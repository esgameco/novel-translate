            <p>Li Fan also felt that there seemed to be some unusual aura in this valley.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang took a step forward and stood in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed closely, carefully observing his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The valley was located under a thousand feet high mountain, never seeing sunlight all year round, filled with a miasma.</p><p></p><p>The flora and fauna surviving here were not similar to those on Mount Taixu.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had suddenly arrived in another world.</p><p></p><p>"This miasma can actually interfere with divine consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Walking in the valley, not only was he cautious about his footing and obstructed vision, even his divine consciousness couldn't probe its entirety.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, Shang Tianci suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"The buzzing sound has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>He turned back suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and, according to the warning sound of 【Zhuxuan】, circled a rough area in the valley.</p><p></p><p>But within a radius of three meters, there was nothing to be found.</p><p></p><p>However, there were evidently no suspicious remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tianci glanced at each other.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy shot out, clearing out all the weeds and animals in the area.</p><p></p><p>After removing a thick layer of mud, a smooth stone slab was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"This is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan touched the stone slab and felt that it looked familiar.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he remembered. It wasn't in the Xuanhuang Present World but in the meteor fairyland, the scene of 【Ningyuan Taking Longevity Fruit】.</p><p></p><p>In a small house where Mr. Bai in Ningyuan City lived, he had seen a similar stone slab.</p><p></p><p>The blue light of the Daoist stone flickered, recalling the scene of the past.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression suddenly turned strange.</p><p></p><p>These two stone slabs couldn't be said to be very similar.</p><p></p><p>They were exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Immortal Stone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." a conjecture rose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He ordered Tianyang to lift the stone slab while he floated away to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>After Tianyang entered the underground secret room, looked around, and returned, indicating that there was no danger.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then flew down.</p><p></p><p>The scene he experienced was not much different from what he remembered.</p><p></p><p>In the not-so-big space, there was a faceless stone statue standing against the wall.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of the isolation of the Immortal Stone Tablet, a long brown wooden table in the middle, even after thousands of years, still looked almost the same as it did back then.</p><p></p><p>Even in the air, a faint smell of blood could still be discerned.</p><p></p><p>The wooden box at the table's corner, transparent jars arranged along the wall, and the twenty-eight sets of beast bones buried in the corner.</p><p></p><p>All of these clearly indicated that this was the underground secret room of Mr. Bai's house that Li Fan had visited in the meteor fairyland!</p><p></p><p>Things that existed in the meteor fairyland had inexplicably appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This discovery suddenly made Li Fan feel a sense of absurdity in the changes and intersections of time and space.</p><p></p><p>"So, Mount Taixu used to be Ningyuan City?"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, isn't the Zixiao Sect nearby?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered and quickly compared according to the information from Ximen Yu's "Ancient and Modern Mountains and Rivers Study."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't match."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>According to the information from the previous life's Jiao Xiuyuan, the remnants of the Zixiao Sect were now located in the central part of Linlang Prefecture in the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Far away from this place.</p><p></p><p>And back then, Ningyuan City was within the Zixiao Sect's sphere of influence. It shouldn't be more than thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>"No one can blame him. Who could have imagined that, although they were once in the same province, thousands of years later, they would be worlds apart."</p><p></p><p>"It can't be explained by just changes in the landscape. It's as if someone deliberately cut it off and separated it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had known before that the current Xuanhuang Realm was formed by the fusion of the original Xuanhuang Realm and several other worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that apart from fusion, there is also transformation."</p><p></p><p>"What does Senior Master Changfa Tianzun intend to do?"</p><p></p><p>"At the end of the 115th era, after being destroyed by a glance from a True Immortal, that earth-shattering roar. Could it be the transmission of methods?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Xuanhuang Realm holds some special significance for her."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts slowly calmed down, Li Fan, erring on the side of caution, instructed Tianyang to dig three feet deep to ensure that nothing was missed here.</p><p></p><p>"This faceless Xuantian God statue is entirely made of Xue Immortal Stone. It's valuable."</p><p></p><p>"However, instead of selling it, it might be better to use it as a bargaining chip for the 【Multiverse Alliance】. After all, under the heavens, this might be the only Xuantian God statue left."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also thought of the dormant Xuantian Sect's Law King under the Zixiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, it might have a miraculous effect when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>As he put away the statue, the sensation of the Zhuxuan Secret Technique also returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what is that withered statue? It looks a bit unsettling," Shang Tianci couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"This involves ancient secrets. It's ancient, even before the rise of Changfa Tianzun. You'll understand later," Li Fan said mysteriously, revealing half and concealing half, successfully piquing Shang Tianci's interest.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Fan's thoughts sparked, and he simply cut and took away the entire underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>This left Shang Tianci speechless.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mind and later brought Shang Tianci back to the 【Spirit Wood Realm】.</p><p></p><p>While crossing the border of the states on the way, they encountered cultivator patrols. Fortunately, Li Fan used the secret technique of 【Concealing the Sky with One Hand】 and went unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoshang, how do you feel about this place?"</p><p></p><p>Standing on top of the spiritual tree, Li Fan asked Shang Tianci next to him.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, just a bit..."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary."</p><p></p><p>"Yes. It's almost an endless plain, with hardly any beautiful mountains and rivers. It can't be compared to the extraordinary scenes of the Xuanhuang Realm. So, from now on, we'll rely on you," Li Fan said with a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Shang Tianci was stunned, evidently not understanding the meaning behind Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Your Purple Gold Gourd can manifest Xuanhuang wonders, right? In this Spirit Wood Realm, manifest them one by one. Even if the scale is smaller than the original, that's okay."</p><p></p><p>"Just recreate the wonders of Xuanhuang in this small world!"</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, when a newcomer arrives, the first thing they see is the same landscape as the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"How shocking that would be!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan whispered.</p><p></p><p>And Shang Tianci couldn't help but breathe rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do it right away!"</p><p></p><p>The straightforward young man immediately slapped his chest guaranteeing.</p><p></p><p>"Before manifestation, plan the landscape orientation well."</p><p></p><p>"The Elder of the Tree People has lived for many years. If you're unsure about anything, you can consult with her," Li Fan reminded.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"With Xiaoshang's help, our 【Multiverse Alliance】 will gradually become a reality."</p><p></p><p>"As soon as the transaction with the Five Elders is completed, and the resources are ready, we can officially start construction."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt somewhat pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this Spirit Wood Realm can be refined into a portable treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Then, replace it with an anchor point and bind it with Huanzhen." </p><p></p><p>"A solid and stable base is still quite important at the moment."</p>

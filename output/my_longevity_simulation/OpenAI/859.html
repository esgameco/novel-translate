        <h1>Chapter 859</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Although he was very eager to see what would happen after Mr. Bai, Zhenxian, Luan, Ji, and even "Real" formed their ideas into fish bait, the fishing pool was ultimately a first-grade immortal tool, and its interior was even more mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>If he insisted on doing so, no one could guarantee whether he would catch some unimaginable monsters.</p><p></p><p>Then, like True Immortal in the 115th world, he would rudely destroy the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>This world had just begun, and the layout was just starting to take effect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan currently did not have a plan to catch Real.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I'll try it when this world ends," he said.</p><p></p><p>Referring back to the first idea of fish bait, Ji Shaoli was actually contemplating the rainbow divine light caught by Zhong Shentong from the last world!</p><p></p><p>When it came to like attracting like, what could better fit the bill than the items in the brilliant starry sky themselves?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this was also an experiment.</p><p></p><p>If it really worked as expected, known items would be easier to catch...</p><p></p><p>With the help of "Real," the difficulty of fishing would undoubtedly be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were enough cycles and attempts, establishing a complete list of items within the fishing pool's light orbs.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps one day, even this endless fishing pool could be completely emptied!</p><p></p><p>The key point was that the resource output of this fishing pool was completely independent and unaffected by any other events in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Each of Li Fan's different plans in each world's reincarnation, leading to different historical paths, would not prevent the fishing pool from becoming the most stable source of treasure supply.</p><p></p><p>It was of great significance.</p><p></p><p>Of course...</p><p></p><p>The premise was that Li Fan's speculation was correct.</p><p></p><p>In the fishing pool of the brilliant starry sky, the clone Ji Shaoli's mind floated with various characteristics of the rainbow divine light displayed by Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>The rainbow divine light was endless.</p><p></p><p>Not only was it extremely powerful, but its speed was also terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It could rival the Yuanying stage while Li Fan was only at the Foundation Building stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed to have a special protective function as well.</p><p></p><p>In the 114th world, Zhong Shentong could freely shuttle through the white mist using the rainbow divine light, unaffected by the devouring white mist.</p><p></p><p>It was truly an all-around offense and defense tactic, with endless clever uses. Once acquired, there was no need for other treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's experience, having witnessed all the scenes in the various worlds of reincarnation, the mysterious nature of this rainbow divine light was undoubtedly at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>To have such performance at the Foundation Building stage was remarkable.</p><p></p><p>When he cultivated his Dao, reached the Harmony stage, or even the Longevity stage, would the rainbow divine light reveal even more incredible features?</p><p></p><p>As Ji Shaoli continued to contemplate, a colorful light shadow gradually formed at the end of the fishing line that hung down.</p>

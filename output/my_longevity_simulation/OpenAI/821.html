        <h1>Chapter 821</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When Ji Shaoli's words came out, the four corners were immediately shocked. </p><p></p><p>You should know that the original fishing head prize of five million contribution points was something that the vast majority of cultivators could never hope to reach in their lifetime. </p><p></p><p>And now, in such a short time, one's wealth could still double? </p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was also shocked and stood up on the spot, "Brother Ji, you're not joking, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's face changed, serious as he said, "I am not someone who speaks nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao also felt inappropriate and apologized, "I was out of line."</p><p></p><p>With Ji Shaoli's confirmation once again, the gazes of the cultivators present at the scene towards him became somewhat heated.</p><p></p><p>At least tens of millions of contribution points, not to mention in the Yunhai region. </p><p></p><p>Even in the central core territory of the Immortal Alliance, they could already be considered wealthy individuals. </p><p></p><p>"Brother Ji, stop beating around the bush! What is the purpose of gathering us here today?" </p><p></p><p>"Yeah, you didn't just assemble us to show off your wealth, right?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed fervently. </p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli gestured for silence once again.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were on him, waiting for Ji Shaoli's speech.</p><p></p><p>"A great battle is looming, the situation is uncertain, we need to plan ahead."</p><p></p><p>"Facing the changes alone may not be enough. Therefore, we need to act together for our collective benefit."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli spoke firmly. </p><p></p><p>The cultivators present looked at each other in confusion, not sure what exactly Ji Shaoli meant by "acting together". </p><p></p><p>"Help each other, unite as one. Share information and face difficulties together!" Ji Shaoli scanned the surroundings, his words resolute.</p><p></p><p>However, the people present were not young men who could be easily swayed by a few words. </p><p></p><p>With a look of doubt on their faces, they waited for Ji Shaoli's further explanation.</p><p></p><p>"As a group, the higher the cultivation level of the members, the more beneficial it is for the collective. I know that some of you here, due to financial constraints, are unable to purchase suitable cultivation techniques. Thus, your realms have been stagnant."</p><p></p><p>"And conveniently, I have enough spare contribution points..."</p><p></p><p>By this point, some clever individuals in the room had already guessed what Ji Shaoli was going to say next, but they still found it hard to believe, staring intently at him. </p><p></p><p>"So, for anyone willing to join our ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society‚Äô, I can lend them the contribution points needed to exchange for cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>"No interest, just repay slowly in the future. Moreover, by completing tasks issued by the 'Mutual Aid Society,' you can offset and reduce a portion of the debt."</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't a free gift, the interest-free loan without collateral made many of the cultivators present excited.</p><p></p><p>"Due to my limited current assets, I have to consider the brothers present here. Thus, there is a temporary upper limit of one hundred thousand contribution points that each person can borrow!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the more tasks completed within the ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society‚Äô, the higher the future borrowing limit will be. There will even be other benefits..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli talked eloquently, explaining the various operational mechanisms of the 'Mutual Aid Society'.</p><p></p><p>"To join the ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society,‚Äô no compulsory signing of any contracts is required. If you don't want to stay, just clear your debts within the society, and you can leave at any time."</p><p></p><p>"As for borrowing contribution points, there are no low-pressure agreements required."</p><p></p><p>"However, if there are those who maliciously disrupt the rules, they will be jointly punished by the brothers of the ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society‚Äô!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's face was solemn, a hint of killing intent visible.</p><p></p><p>This caused many of the cultivators present to change color inwardly. </p><p></p><p>"I knew it, Friend Ji, you are not an ordinary person. To come up with such a bold idea..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm in for this ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society‚Äô!"</p><p></p><p>The first to respond was Pei Tuo, the guard of Haitong Island and a perfected Golden Core realm cultivator. </p><p></p><p>In a previous cycle, Li Fan had a chance encounter with him. </p><p></p><p>Although this person had been in the Golden Core realm for more than ten years, he still hadn't accumulated enough contribution points to exchange for the Yuan Infant cultivation technique. Not to mention finding a suitable Immortal Cave to devour.</p><p></p><p>Having wasted so much time for nothing, how could he not be anxious?</p><p></p><p>Encountering such a great opportunity today, he didn't hesitate and agreed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were any constraints or limitations upon joining the ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society,‚Äô he was willing!</p><p></p><p>Entering the Yuan Infant realm a day earlier could make all the difference in his future life!</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli applauded and praised, "Excellent! Friend Pei, as the second member of the ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society,‚Äô I will definitely not treat you unfairly!"</p><p></p><p>The first member naturally referred to Ji Shaoli himself.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's lips moved slightly, seemingly saying something to Pei Tuo.</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo's body shook violently after hearing it, his face filled with disbelief, staring fixedly at Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled slightly and interrupted what Pei Tuo wanted to say.</p><p></p><p>However, Pei Tuo's extremely excited expression couldn't escape the notice of the people present.</p><p></p><p>Although curious about what benefits Ji Shaoli had promised, the cultivators present were not easily swayed and clamoring to join the Mutual Aid Society.</p><p></p><p>Amidst hesitation, surprisingly, no one else spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was not in a hurry and said softly, "No need to rush. When you have made a decision, you can come back to me."</p><p></p><p>"But there is something I must mention beforehand."</p><p></p><p>"Those who join first will receive various benefits. The later you join, what you might have previously obtained for free might need to be worked for."</p><p></p><p>Although vague, his words carried a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>After the banquet ended, including Pei Tuo, a total of six cultivators chose to join the ‚ÄòMutual Aid Society‚Äô first.</p><p></p><p>"Friend He, are you not considering it anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled as he watched He Zhenghao about to leave and asked. </p><p></p><p>"Brother Ji, rest assured, I will think it over when I get back. I will give you an answer soon!" He Zhenghao vowed.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli did not insist.</p><p></p><p>After the other cultivators left, Ji Shaoli looked at the six cultivators who remained.</p><p></p><p>Two Golden Core realm and four Foundation Building realm cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Restart the 'Primordial Eight Extinction Dragon Formation' to seal off the island.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli looked at them and nodded in satisfaction, "Very good. You few are the elders of our 'Mutual Aid Society'."</p><p></p><p>"Friend Ji, are there truly no contractual obligations in this Mutual Aid Society?‚Äù Another Golden Core middle-stage cultivator named Xiang Xin among the six asked.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli chuckled, "What obligation is stronger and more reliable than the benefits themselves? As I've said, the founding intention of the Mutual Aid Society is for everyone to help and benefit each other, to overcome difficulties together."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Xin nodded without a reply.</p><p></p><p>The others remained silent, neither confirming nor denying. </p><p></p><p>Only Pei Tuo was finding it hard to contain his excitement. </p><p></p><p>After receiving Ji Shaoli's eye sign, he couldn't help but ask eagerly, "Brother Ji, you mentioned earlier that you would provide me with information on an ownerless Yuan Infant Immortal Cave..."</p><p></p><p>(Note: The website link "Êñ∞69Êõ∏Âêß‚Üí69ùìºùíΩùìäùìç.ùí∏‚Ñ¥ùìÇ" is not part of the original text and seems to have been added as an intrusion.

        <h1>Chapter 741</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Nan Gong Shirong looked at Guan Changge who, although had reappeared, was behaving like a silly child, continuously laughing foolishly with a strange expression. He asked curiously. </p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Xu Bai nodded, "Most of his divine thoughts are immersed in the comprehension of the sword way. He is unwilling to return. I am also helpless about this..."</p><p></p><p>*Cough...* Xu Bai couldn't help but cough.</p><p></p><p>Having a part of his body swallowed by the Boundless Wall, he clearly felt himself becoming weaker. It was as if his vitality and spirit had been partially drained, causing an overall "deficiency."</p><p></p><p>"It seems somewhat similar to my <Thread Pulling> divine ability, but Thread Pulling leans more towards the process of bodily deterioration. Whereas this, it feels like a part of the body has been shaved off..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Xu Bai, who was comprehending the divine ability, seemed a bit absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that he was seriously injured in the Boundless Wall, Nan Gong Shirong cautioned him, "It's okay, you have done your best. Little Guan is not willing to come out on his own, and we can't do anything about it."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with his intact body, it is enough to settle accounts with Old Guan. You go and rest, I will take care of what comes next. I want to see if Guan Hangxiu can still care for this foolish boy." After instructing Xu Bai to rest, Nan Gong Shirong let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai obeyed and returned, but his mind was still immersed in the comprehension of the divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Others only thought that his injuries were the reason, without paying much attention.</p><p></p><p>Ten days passed in the Tianliang City in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Good, this newly comprehended divine ability, opposite to <Thread Pulling>, can be named..."</p><p></p><p>"<Life Severing>."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai regained consciousness from his epiphany, a flash of light passed through his eyes as he looked towards the passing bird outside the house.</p><p></p><p>Without warning, the bird locked in Xu Bai's gaze seemed to lose control and suddenly plummeted from the sky.</p><p></p><p>After flapping its wings repeatedly, it barely recovered in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>However, its flying speed seemed much slower than before.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied, Xu Bai withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Invisibly severing the life force of beings. Compared to Thread Pulling, the casting is more concealed. It can be instantly cast, making it hard for others to perceive, only feeling inexplicably weakened." </p><p></p><p>"It can also be used together with <Thread Pulling>, collapsing internally and externally. Instantly bringing about life and death." </p><p></p><p>"Combining the two, it can be called <Thread Pulling Life Severing>."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Exhaling deeply, Xu Bai slowly got up.</p><p></p><p>Being equipped with sharp weapons, murderous intent arises on its own. Advancing further in divine abilities, Xu Bai briefly thought of experimenting with someone.</p><p></p><p>But soon, before he could act on it.</p><p></p><p>This desire dissipated on its own.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's gaze narrowed as he sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>This clone did not possess the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra cultivation. If the original body had such thoughts, it would certainly take some time to resolve them.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai recalled the scene he had witnessed in the Boundless Wall, where Guan Changge achieved enlightenment despite risking death. Surprisingly, feelings of pity and lament arose in his heart, emotions that would never appear in his original self.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the influence of this body?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Enjoying the benefits brought by the extraordinary comprehension abilities, but also bearing the changes in character."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke, Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The original body possessed the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, but the clone did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the resting place and inquiring about the disappearance of Guan Changge, Xu Bai noticed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>As Nan Gong Shirong successfully brought the person forward, Guan Hangxiu could not retaliate further.</p><p></p><p>But the subsequent actions of Guan Hangxiu shocked the bystanders from Tianliang Province, who were prepared to witness a good show.</p><p></p><p>In front of Nan Gong Shirong and other cultivators, Guan Hangxiu summoned the <Falling Star Flying Sword> and directly slew the foolish and drooling Guan Changge.</p><p></p><p>"This appearance disgraces your family's prestige. It's better to die early. Eighteen years later, I will come looking for you again." Before swinging the sword, Guan Hangxiu spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The golden sword energy filled the air, leaving no trace of Guan Changge's flesh and blood. He was annihilated on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The people of Tianliang Province were also shocked by Guan Hangxiu's ruthless efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Although Nan Gong Shirong's face stiffened, he advised the other party to mourn.</p><p></p><p>Guan Hangxiu, however, showed no mercy and left directly.</p><p></p><p>Although Nan Gong Shirong had a look of disbelief, he felt relieved that the troublemaker had left, letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Then, something that puzzled Xu Bai occurred.</p><p></p><p>Instead of being punished, he who had teased Nan Gong Shirong along with the close associates An Ye Qiu and others, received some rewards.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on the many details of his handling of the matter, Xu Bai pondered on what exactly went wrong.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>There were no flaws; everything from start to finish was handled perfectly.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this was precisely the biggest problem.</p><p></p><p>Despite knowing the danger of the Boundless Wall swallowing cultivators at any time, he still probed without hesitation. </p><p></p><p>However, he quickly found a way to enter the Boundless Wall. Moreover, he could bring Guan Changge back.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Too perfect.</p><p></p><p>If it were a cultivator cultivated by Nan Gong Shirong from the ground up, he would undoubtedly be very pleased.</p><p></p><p>But do not forget, Xu Bai's identity was unclear and he joined midway.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong wouldn't simply assume that others would be satisfied with a few words from him.</p><p></p><p>So, Xu Bai exerting so much effort and dedication actually raised his suspicion. </p><p></p><p>"It turns out that being too smart can lead to misunderstanding." Xu Bai shook his head to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>He just continued to do his job diligently.</p><p></p><p>But occasionally, he would complain about the unfair treatment to his colleagues. These words reached Nan Gong Shirong's ears, easing his suspicions.</p><p></p><p>But he still didn't completely let his guard down. Xu Bai acted as if nothing had changed.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>After two years, it was 22 years in total.</p><p></p><p>In Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>A burst of dazzling white light emanated from Li Fan's Dissipation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Numerous symbol arrays continuously emerged and changed rapidly on the Dissipation Disc.</p><p></p><p>After the white light slowly dissipated, Li Fan keenly noticed that his Disc had grown larger by one circle.</p><p></p><p>"In the process of the Nine Discs Competing, the first failure has appeared," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Before he could carefully study the refined Disc, Fang Zaiji's overly excited shout suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I finally figured out the specific usage of this Endstone Disc!"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of Insight flew to Li Fan, flipping up and down and drawing golden lines.</p>

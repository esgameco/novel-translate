            <p>"Since you are good at pleasing people, I'll give it to you. The new book → 69shuix.com."</p><p></p><p>"However, I have a condition."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the words of the Supreme One, Li Qing was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>A plump and tall woman walked out from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>In her thirties, compared to the sitting young man Zhao Shijie, she appeared more mature and sexy.</p><p></p><p>"Your abilities in the illusion realm are good, but I wonder about your skills in reality?"</p><p></p><p>"If you can satisfy me, maybe I will be happy and give you a few more martial arts manuals."</p><p></p><p>Mature Zhao Shijie extended her index finger to her mouth and gently licked it.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Qing with a dazed gaze, her face blushed as if water was about to drip.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded and agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Moments later...</p><p></p><p>A black straight sword appeared in front of Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>The tip of the sword pointed directly at the Supreme One.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's expression was solemn: "I have a sword, please teach me, Senior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>His voice thundered, echoing in the hall for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The mature Zhao Shijie's alluring expression froze instantly.</p><p></p><p>She looked deeply at Li Qing, then her body instantly retreated and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>A silver light flew towards Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>It contained the Xuantianjiao martial arts that Li Qing had been longing for. New book → 69shuix.com</p><p></p><p>Besides the ones he already knew of, such as "Heaven and Earth Tax Collection" and "Eternal Unique Secret," there were two martial arts he had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>"The Book of Forgetfulness" and "The Record of the Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was overjoyed: "Thank you, Heavens..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his words, a dizziness swept over him.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the scenery in front of him suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>It was no longer within the Great Dao Sect, but he had been kicked out by Zhao Shijie.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Five Elders' Meeting.</p><p></p><p>"It looks like Zhao Shijie is quite angry that I refused her." Li Qing chuckled to himself.</p><p></p><p>Relying on various tactics, he successfully obtained the Xuantianjiao martial arts from the other party.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing did not let it cloud his judgment.</p><p></p><p>He still held respect for the Supreme One of Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Being addicted to the illusion realm was because he had lost his true self. And if there were to be a romantic affair with the Supreme One in reality...</p><p></p><p>It might bring unforeseen risks.</p><p></p><p>So Li Qing decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>"I must always be vigilant."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing reminded himself in his heart once again.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he discerned the way back.</p><p></p><p>Although the mission was already completed, the Supreme Being had synchronized and known about his experience.</p><p></p><p>But the content of these several Xuantianjiao martial arts manuals was vast.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't be read through in a short period, and needed to be quickly delivered back to the Supreme Being's abode. New book → 69shuix.com</p><p></p><p>"This place seems unfamiliar. I wonder whose territory it is within the Five Elders' Meeting."</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't intend to inquire. Li Qing just slightly identified the location of the Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Then he rushed swiftly in the corresponding direction.</p><p></p><p>At first, just like when he came, it was very smooth.</p><p></p><p>He encountered no inspection by the Five Elders' Meeting cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to leave the boundaries of this state, an accident occurred.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, three figures flew up from the ground, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was about to say something to get past.</p><p></p><p>But as the words reached his mouth, there was a sudden change.</p><p></p><p>"I am Li Qing of the Xuantianjiao! I have infiltrated the Five Elders' Meeting, obtained martial arts, and am about to return!"</p><p></p><p>As if the words were spoken without going through the brain, he directly revealed his confidential information!</p><p></p><p>With this statement, Li Qing's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>The three cultivators responsible for interrogating the Five Elders' Meeting were first stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then they all showed a mixture of astonishment and fear.</p><p></p><p>"There is..."</p><p></p><p>Before they could react, a black sword shadow flashed like lightning.</p><p></p><p>Quickly passing through the bodies of the three cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the three cultivators turned into a mist of blood, leaving no trace of their bones.</p><p></p><p>An omen of the falling of celestial beings was congealing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, seizing this opportunity, Li Qing hurriedly fled.</p><p></p><p>"The realm of reality!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Zhao is so petty!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant when he wanted to say something casually, he ended up revealing his true situation.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Qing realize where he was at once.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Supreme Being in reality is indeed extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>As he fled in panic and recalled the recent events, Li Qing was amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With his will, he did not notice anything out of the ordinary throughout the process.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the words were spoken that he realized something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qing felt that even with his knowledge of the rules here, he couldn't fabricate a lie forcibly now!</p><p></p><p>This was the power of overturning the natural order!</p><p></p><p>Feeling heavy-hearted, Li Qing accelerated his pace once again.</p><p></p><p>Though he had been exposed, luckily, because he was in the peaceful territory of the Five Elders' Meeting for a long time, the vigilance was not so strict. There were no pursuers for the moment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhao Shijie probably only intended to scare him, not harm him. Otherwise, the trade between them would have been in vain.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Qing was just sent to the border of the realm of reality.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't flown for long before he returned to the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, during the crossing of the boundary defenses of the Wanxian Alliance, there was a little incident.</p><p></p><p>During the time he went to the Five Elders' Meeting, the defenses at the border had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>The flaws in the formation passed on by the Supreme Being had already become ineffective, almost causing him to be discovered by the patrol cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Supreme Being noticed the situation here and timely completed the dismantling of the formation.</p><p></p><p>This prevented Li Qing from being exposed.</p><p></p><p>Flying again within the territory of the Wanxian Alliance, Li Qing couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Although I obtained the martial arts this time, the journey back was full of twists and turns."</p><p></p><p>"Is this what they call troubles all along the way? I hope there won't be any more mishaps in the future."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Qing hurried towards the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was fated, just as he was about to reach the entrance of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Li Qing was locked onto by a flying and patrolling [Sky Patrol Arrow].</p><p></p><p>The arrow light flashed, and without any preparation, it directly pierced Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Li Qing achieving extraordinary accomplishments with the strangeness of heaven, he would have perished at that moment when the Sky Patrol Arrow was about to strike.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Qing was seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>And the launch of the Sky Patrol Arrow had attracted the attention of the Wanxian Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Ling, who was sent to guide him, arrived quickly and took the heavily injured Li Qing away.</p><p></p><p>By the time the Wanxian Alliance cultivators arrived, all they saw was a big pit and faint traces of blood.</p><p></p><p>Within the Spirit Wood Realm.</p>

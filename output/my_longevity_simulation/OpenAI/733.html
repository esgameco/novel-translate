        <h1>Chapter 733</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat cross-legged in a secret room, closing his eyes in meditation.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, dozens of sword energies surrounded and spiraled around him. They appeared solid, capable of cutting through gold and iron, even radiating a faint metallic luster. Upon closer inspection, one could even see numerous blurry sword shadows shifting on the sword bodies.</p><p></p><p>In front of Li Fan, a "sword embryo" that had absorbed and mastered the essence within it floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>"This 'Breathing Qi into Sword Technique' is indeed profound." Li Fan opened his mouth, and the dozens of unmatched sharp sword energies were swallowed by him, returning into his abdomen to nurture once again.</p><p></p><p>Inside his dantian, a golden pellet like a planetary atmosphere surrounded by thousands of sword lights was already formed. It created a colorful halo that looked enchanting and mesmerizing.</p><p></p><p>Only Li Fan knew what kind of dreadful power was hidden in this "ring of sword light." If he were to exhale all the thousands of sword energies at once, even peak Nascent Infant stage experts of this era would likely perish instantly.</p><p></p><p>"The memories in Ji Zhaoxuan's mind completely lack the source of techniques, it seems he simply cultivated the 'Myriad Swords Art,' a genuine technique that disciples of the Celestial Sword Sect practice. However, it is evident that having such a phenomenon in the Golden Core stage is rare, even in the entire Celestial Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"And this move seems to have some similarities with Situ Yao's 'Incoming Sword Technique'..."</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts rotated, Li Fan had already fully contained the imposing aura of thousands of sword lights in his dantian. Without leaking any sharpness, he appeared like an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After coming out of seclusion in the secret room, even before Chu senior brother came looking for him, Li Fan took the initiative to hand over the "sword embryo."</p><p></p><p>Chu senior brother showed an expression of someone who knew what was good; he glanced at the "sword embryo" and casually put it away.</p><p></p><p>"Just as Senior Brother said, the Grand Senior Brother is summoning everyone; it seems there's something important to instruct. You should come with me." He ordered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred, nodding and following behind him.</p><p></p><p>The main hall of the Celestial Sword Sect was located at the peak of a mountain that stood like a straight sword piercing the clouds at the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had already gathered in the hall, all of them having higher seniority than Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing the reason why Chu senior brother brought him to this place, Li Fan simply stood at the edge of the crowd with him, waiting for Situ Yao to arrive.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the initially somewhat noisy hall suddenly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>Then a strong scent of alcohol wafted through, accompanied by a sword light, Situ Yao staggered into the center of the hall.</p><p></p><p>After belching, he intermittently explained the reason for summoning everyone.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, the prototype of the world-cracking divine weapon was completed, and the next step was to forge the sword body.</p><p></p><p>To successfully traverse the realms through world-cracking, the sword body of the divine weapon must be unparalleled in strength. The most critical material required for this was the "Taiyuan Essence Gold." While the Celestial Sword Sect's treasure trove had a considerable stock, it was far from enough to meet the needs of forging the world-cracking divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao was skilled in battles, but felt somewhat powerless about this matter. Hence, he wanted to ask for the opinions of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>He also made two requests.</p><p></p><p>First, they must not disclose the fact that the Celestial Sword Sect is forging the world-cracking divine weapon. Although not afraid of conflict, it would be extremely troublesome if the other sects joined forces to interfere.</p><p></p><p>Second, although the Celestial Sword Sect was quite wealthy, the resources needed to forge the world-cracking divine weapon were indeed vast. Besides the "Taiyuan Essence Gold," there were over a thousand other rare treasures required, nearly emptying the sect's coffers. Therefore, they needed to be frugal and try to obtain an adequate amount of "Taiyuan Essence Gold" with minimal expenses.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Senior Brother's words, all the cultivators present showed expressions of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Share your thoughts and come up with solutions. Whoever can handle this matter, I'll appoint him as the next Sect Leader of the Celestial Sword Sect!" Situ Yao sat on the ground, discarding any airs of a high-ranking person, yet his words were astonishing.</p><p></p><p>The current Sect Leader of the Celestial Sword Sect, Huo Yuzhu, could only smile bitterly and dared not refute.</p><p></p><p>Once these words were spoken, the hall was instantly filled with a commotion.</p><p></p><p>After all, who wouldn't covet the position of Sect Leader among the Ten Sects of Immortality? Even if there wasn't much real power, the status and treatment were incomparable to ordinary sect members.</p><p></p><p>While everyone had various expressions, Li Fan noticed that Chu senior brother's gaze had discreetly swept over him.</p><p></p><p>"What does he mean?"</p><p></p><p>Though Li Fan knew where to find a large amount of Taiyuan Essence Gold, it was from his experiences outside of the Celestial Realm in his past life in the Five Elements Grand World. There was no connection to Ji Zhaoxuan, who had taken over his body.</p><p></p><p>What did this Chu senior brother know and why did he specially call him over?</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on the memories in the body's mind, Li Fan did not find any close relationship with Chu senior brother. They were merely acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>Hence, he remained composed, pretending not to notice the other's gaze.</p><p></p><p>As the meeting concluded and they were on the way back to their living quarters on the mountain peak, Chu senior brother suddenly transmitted his voice and asked, "Junior Brother Ji, your Ji Family should have plenty of 'Taiyuan Essence Gold,' right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was taken aback, "What?"</p><p></p><p>Chu senior brother looked displeased, "Junior Brother, don't play dumb with me. As the top commercial group in the world, your Ji Family is said to even have half-immortal artifacts. How could they not have Taiyuan Essence Gold?"</p><p></p><p>As if a switch had been pressed, memories from Ji Zhaoxuan's background surfaced in Li Fan's mind. These memories dated back to when the original body was only five or six years old.</p><p></p><p>Leaving his parents and being sent to the Celestial Sword Sect by the family elders. It seemed like there were some instructions, but those had long been forgotten.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Chu senior brother's reminder that reignited these distant memories stored in this body, the current Li Fan might still be unaware.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back on his strange behavior before, Li Fan suddenly realized it all.</p><p></p><p>However, he kept a blank expression on his face, showing confusion, "Ji Family?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he finally reacted. A trace of anger and desolation flickered in his eyes, and Li Fan said coldly, "For so many years, I haven't been in contact with my family. The ties were long gone. Even if they have 'Taiyuan Essence Gold,' it has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Chu senior brother chuckled, offering words of advice, "Junior Brother, don't get emotional. I know you have many reservations, but think about it. If you can get the full support of the Ji Family's 'World Commerce,' maybe you can contend for the position of Sect Leader this time."</p><p></p><p>"Even if our Celestial Sword Sect wants to leave the realms, there are things that cannot be taken away. For example, the vast territory of the mountain gate, as well as the jurisdiction of many affiliated sects. Just a little contribution will bring huge profits to the 'World Commerce.'"</p><p></p><p>"Why not strive for a win-win situation, Junior Brother? Think about it carefully. If you're interested, I can accompany you home and be a mediator."</p><p></p><p>Chu senior brother patted Li Fan's shoulder, wearing a profound expression.</p>

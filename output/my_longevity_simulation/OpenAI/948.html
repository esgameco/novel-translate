        <h1>Chapter 948</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Even the astute Li Fan couldn't tell if he was pretending at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"But it's okay, trying it out will make it clear."</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, thousands of terrifying and hideous ghosts and gods suddenly appeared within the formation.</p><p></p><p>Darkness enveloped the entire space.</p><p></p><p>One by one, those deformed monsters all stared at Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Each showing a terrifying expression, then pounced towards Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the sounds of ghosts and wolves crying echoed.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the myriad of ghosts, Yan Fangzhou, who had been sitting still, suddenly jumped up.</p><p></p><p>His eyes bloodshot, looking at the countless ghostly creatures around him, he couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>But seeing these creatures about to attack him, Yan Fangzhou gritted his teeth, desperate and angrily shouted, "I'll fight you!"</p><p></p><p>Then he used the last bit of his cultivation, fiercely fighting against those ghosts and gods.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you're quite good at acting. Almost managed to fool me." Li Fan surprisingly praised.</p><p></p><p>But at his signal, the attacks of those fierce ghosts and gods became even more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Since they were all created by divine thoughts, each attack landed on Yan Fangzhou caused not only physical trauma and pain but also corresponding pain in his soul.</p><p></p><p>And those ghosts and gods seemed to be toying with him, not tearing Yan Fangzhou apart directly. Instead, they seemed to be tearing off a small piece from his soul with each attack.</p><p></p><p>It didn't cause fatal injuries, but it multiplied the pain a thousand times.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou let out a cry of incompetence, despair, and anger, eventually being engulfed by countless ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven gives great tasks to those who can endure, demanding their hearts be tested, their muscles and bones strained..."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I have high hopes for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed away from the scene, leaving behind countless ghosts to train with Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Back in the secluded practice chamber, Li Fan contemplated to himself, "Now that my cultivation method is complete, my momentum is enough to disguise myself as the former Law King Sun Xingwang."</p><p></p><p>"As for appearance, memories, I can use the 'Sitting Forgetting Secret Art' to cover them up."</p><p></p><p>"Everything is prepared, just waiting for Meng Rubin to come looking for me."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how things are going with He Zhenghao..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, with the help of the faceless stone statue, many scenes appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao had been praying less frequently recently.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that his faith in the Compassionate Immortal of the mortal world had weakened, but he had been incredibly busy lately.</p><p></p><p>His hidden sense of gratitude couldn't even form in his mind before it was interrupted by his duties.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "duties" were the full implementation of the 'Xuantian Sealing Spirit.'</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's guidance earlier, He Zhenghao had fully grasped the complete Xuantian Sealing Spirit formation, as well as an understanding of the formation.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough review, the Strategy Hall of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance also approved the feasibility of the Xuantian Sealing Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The resolution was swift, unlike the usual procrastination.</p><p></p><p>The approval from the higher-ups was quick, with the task given to quickly build a genuine Xuantian Sealing Spirit formation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance would provide a Tianxuan Mirror body to test the power of the formation.</p><p></p><p>This test was almost the highest secret of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was transferred from the Strategy Hall headquarters to an unknown location.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, it was a top-secret place with many defense measures, and even the remote sensing images of the faceless stone statues had some distortion.</p><p></p><p>But her power level was higher than the Yellow World, so the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance couldn't completely block Li Fan's prying.</p><p></p><p>Knowing, understanding the formation, and being able to independently build the formation were completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>While He Zhenghao was theoretically bragging, in practice, he encountered unimaginable difficulties.</p><p></p><p>However, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance also knew the difficulty of creating this formation, so they sent six equally talented formation masters to assist.</p><p></p><p>They collectively explored and discussed.</p><p></p><p>Even the chief of the Strategy Hall, Lu Xichan, would often come to inquire about the recent progress of the formation.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly put immense pressure on He Zhenghao, but he also felt a surge of excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A faint light shot out, hitting a quaint small mirror in front.</p><p></p><p>From the mirror body, ripples instinctively emanated, seemingly trying to resist the invasion of the light.</p><p></p><p>The two struggled for a moment, but eventually, the victory went to the quaint small mirror, leaving He Zhenghao disappointed.</p><p></p><p>His suppressed desire to prove himself didn't come to fruition, and he fainted on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This caused chaos among the nearby cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although the first test failed, the Immortal Alliance didn't blame him and instead comforted him kindly.</p><p></p><p>They even promised that if the Tianxuan Sealing Spirit formation were successfully developed, the Immortal Alliance headquarters would step in to arrange He Zhenghao's marriage.</p><p></p><p>Allowing him to reconcile with Heng Ruo Shui.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, He Zhenghao, who had just been lifelike, immediately bounced up and prepared for the next test.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao knew that although the Heng family's power was immense, it was inconsequential in the face of the entire Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Alliance headquarters intervened, the senior members of the Heng family had no reason to block the union of the two.</p><p></p><p>Imagining the scene of returning to the Heng family not long after, He Zhenghao suddenly became full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>He forgot all about fatigue and hardship.</p><p></p><p>This scene caused Li Fan to shake his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Since even the data from He Zhenghao's past has been thoroughly investigated, it is certain that from the moment he joined the Cloud Assistance Society, his soaring success could not be hidden."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a matter of when Meng Rubin will come knocking on the door."</p><p></p><p>A glint of light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But waiting passively was never Li Fan's style.</p><p></p><p>He decided to take the initiative to draw attention from Meng Rubin.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered as he left the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>After a quick flight for half a day, he arrived in the border region of Jiushanzhou.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiushanzhou was no longer the deserted plain it used to be.</p><p></p><p>Since the Five Elders apologized voluntarily, Jiushanzhou had returned to the rule of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And this was where the first display of divine power of the Heavenly Venerable Faphase occurred, attracting many cultivators to observe.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators even attempted to comprehend the killing magical abilities of the Heavenly Venerable Faphase from here.</p><p></p><p>With the absolute strategic advantage gained by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, the temporary absence of the Five Elders' trouble in advancing, had brought much business to this previously desolate border region.</p><p></p><p>The new floating sky city had not been fully constructed yet, so the vast majority of cultivators were resting in a defensive fortress on the ground.</p>

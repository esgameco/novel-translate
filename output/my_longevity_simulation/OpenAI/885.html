        <h1>Chapter 885</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It hasn't been long since the last time a piece was cut off by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The Residual Separation Disc does not seem to have fully recovered.</p><p></p><p>"At first, the nine discs competed, and then returned to one."</p><p></p><p>"Which means, this Residual Separation Disc can at most be re-divided into nine pieces."</p><p></p><p>"The ability to break formations will not be affected, only the ability value is fixed at the moment of division."</p><p></p><p>"However, in the future, relying on one's own calculation to evolve will slow down a lot."</p><p></p><p>"But it's okay, as long as the calculation results of the mother disc are synchronized every period of time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts flickered, and then his finger was like an iron sword, fiercely striking towards the Separation Disc.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Residual Separation Disc trembled slightly, and a thin piece was cut off.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the increasingly weak mother disc, Li Fan held the separated disc piece in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Then, thousands of bloodlines flew out from his body again, soaring to various places in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre scene instantly attracted the attention of all creatures in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the tree-people races dared not look directly, immediately bowing their heads.</p><p></p><p>Only Tianyang, Shang Tianci, and other cultivators curiously looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Countless bloodlines, like brushes, were used as paint with the already prepared materials for the formation. </p><p></p><p>On the ground of the Spirit Wood Realm, a huge formation was inscribed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, for an Elemental Infant Formation Master, it would take a minimum of several years to barely complete such a large formation covering a realm.</p><p></p><p>But with the powerful calculation support of the Dao Stone in his mind, Li Fan achieved it quicker with more blossoming.</p><p></p><p>One person undertook the simultaneous formation equivalent to hundreds of Formation Masters.</p><p></p><p>At a visible speed, a large-scale formation slowly took shape on the ground of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Can formations still be laid out like this?"</p><p></p><p>This made even the cultivators who didn't understand formations stare in amazement, staring blankly at the scene.</p><p></p><p>The formation inscribed by Li Fan on the Spirit Wood Realm was a completely new formation, created by Li Fan himself, never seen in the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The core referenced top formations like the Ten Thousand Miles Rivers, Heavenly Origin Transformation, and Heavenly Profound Soul Lock.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan wanted to incorporate the essence of reversing life and death.</p><p></p><p>But just as he thought of this, a sense of crisis inexplicably surged in his heart, so he decisively gave up.</p><p></p><p>However, in seven days, the core foundation formation was already formed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw out the disc piece.</p><p></p><p>With a fierce burst of light, the piece disappeared in the air, merging into the core of the formation.</p><p></p><p>"With the Residual Separation Disc as the core of the formation, it can achieve complete surveillance and control of the Spirit Wood Realm like the Heavenly Profound Soul Lock."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, it can enhance the protection formations infinitely, strengthening them endlessly."</p><p></p><p>"Until it's as strong as gold soup."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>As the disc merged into the formation, the speed at which the formation took shape on the Spirit Wood Realm ground increased by a thousand times.</p><p></p><p>If it was like a child's hand-drawn before, now it was like a printer printing.</p><p></p><p>Before the onlookers could react, the Spirit Wood Realm ground roared and trembled.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling light extended from the ground to the sky.</p><p></p><p>Under the dazzling light, all the beings in the small world were forced to close their eyes.</p><p></p><p>When they opened their eyes again, all the visions had vanished.</p><p></p><p>But the Spirit Wood Realm now was completely different from before.</p><p></p><p>Those with weaker cultivation didn't notice much.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators like Tianyang, however, couldn’t help but look around and at the sky in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>As if countless pairs of eyes were staring at him, making him uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan chuckled loudly, diverting Tianyang's attention.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already packed away his countless bloodlines and landed in front of the 99-feet high gate of the World Union Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Using his hand as a brush, he inscribed the four characters "World Union" under the black jade plaque in lively strokes!</p><p></p><p>With the completion of the inscription, the Spirit Wood Realm also reacted, emitting a slight trembling.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the sky in the Spirit Wood Realm also displayed the words "World Union."</p><p></p><p>Under the leadership of the female tribal chief, the tree beings bowed and worshipped.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators fell to the ground, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan put down the brush, the World Union Headquarters was officially completed.</p><p></p><p>Most of the main structure was complete, only minor repairs were needed in some areas.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed grand, but this vast Union Headquarters is too empty."</p><p></p><p>"If outsiders see it so deserted, they might have the wrong idea."</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his chin, Li Fan came up with an idea in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>After snapping his fingers, soon many figures appeared in various places within the Union Headquarters!</p><p></p><p>They were in a hurry, seemingly very busy.</p><p></p><p>Some of them were even chatting with each other, just like real people.</p><p></p><p>This added vitality to the originally cold World Union Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it looks much better this way."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit self-deceptive, it's okay. It will soon be lively here."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled satisfactorily.</p><p></p><p>"Elder..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was lost in thoughts, Shang Tianci nervously approached him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought he wanted to apply to see Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>But Shang Tianci was actually talking about a new member of the Union Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, after my persuasion, Yan Fangzhou has agreed to join our Union."</p><p></p><p>"But he said he wanted to see our strength first."</p><p></p><p>Afraid of angering Li Fan, Shang Tianci cautiously said.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Fangzhou?" Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely remembered this person, a member of the young genius organization Mountain and River House in the Profound Yellow Realm mentioned by Shang Tianci before.</p><p></p><p>Despite his young age, he was already in the Divine Transformation Realm. He even came up with the brutal idea of using the vision of Profound Yellow in the Heaven's Horizon Gourd to burst the caves of other Elemental Infant Stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>His character suited Li Fan's taste.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed a friendly smile, "It’s okay, bring him here personally."</p><p></p><p>"I will entertain him well when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was delighted, "Yan Fangzhou is much stronger than me. If he joins our Union, it will surely be more helpful to the cause of the World Union."</p><p></p><p>With that, Shang Tianci excused himself and hurried to bring Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched Shang Tianci leave and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, he swiftly came to the circular hall at the entrance of the Union Headquarters.</p>

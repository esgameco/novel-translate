            <p>The present Li Fan can manipulate as he pleases.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this Black Flame is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Just the transformation of the birth of Xuanhuang, its essence is faintly more powerful than the Red Flame."</p><p></p><p>Covered with a layer of invisible colorful jade light, Li Fan easily suppressed the black flames emitted by Yan Fangzhou, carefully observing.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of aura seems very similar to the aftermath of the Red Flame burning the Cloud Sea. It belongs to the category of great destruction..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>In the Daoist paradise created by Mr. Bai in the previous life, he had never seen the "Transformation of Birth and Changes in Heaven and Earth," which was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Li Fan began to have a clue.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't belong to the Xuanhuang Prime Realm. Rather, it comes from other worlds and is a part of heaven and earth that has merged later."</p><p></p><p>"Many worlds merging into one."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is still dominated by the Xuanhuang Realm, after absorbing so many foreign elements, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao inevitably undergoes changes as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly exerted force with his five fingers, gathering a powerful seven-colored divine light in his palm, causing it to become somewhat vague.</p><p></p><p>Even though the black flames were endlessly resentful, they were still extinguished inch by inch by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"If it were the soul of heaven and earth, maybe I would really be tempted."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it's just the transformation of the birth of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, temporarily putting Yan Fangzhou out of his mind.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts drifted to the upcoming event, the Sea of Red Flames. 新69書吧→69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"Now that I already know the positions of many souls of heaven and earth, there is no need to focus on the Red Flame."</p><p></p><p>"On one hand, the Red Flame is too weak, and on the other hand..."</p><p></p><p>"After the Red Flame dies, Mo Sha descends. Even if I can escape from Mo Sha, it may attract the attention of the hidden powerhouses of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's too conspicuous."</p><p></p><p>"For now, I should focus on hiding."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Li Fan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time to arrange for the members of the Cloud Assistance Association to evacuate."</p><p></p><p>"After all, they are the talents that have been cultivated with great difficulty, the backbone of the future Multiverse Alliance. We can't let them die in vain."</p><p></p><p>Among the Cloud Assistance Association, the one with the highest strength is Pei Tuo at the early Yuan Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not participate in the Immortal Alliance Examination again, he was still highly valued due to his breakthrough in strength.</p><p></p><p>He has now been promoted to the position of Chief Guard at the Cloud Sea Martial Hall, managing three martial training squads under him, holding real power.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I need to figure out a way to transfer him inland."</p><p></p><p>"However, at his level, it may be difficult to quietly transfer him."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I can help him achieve some meritorious deeds..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the faces of many spies from the Five Elders Association appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Since he had made a decision, his secondary body Ji Shaoli immediately began to make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then remembered Yan Fangzhou's words from earlier.</p><p></p><p>"The scenery of this small world is nice. But it's a bit of an exaggeration to call it the 'Multiverse Alliance,' isn't it a bit misleading?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Even a little kid can't be fooled. It seems that I really need to make some improvements."</p><p></p><p>While contemplating, his spiritual awareness swept through. As he looked at the Lingmu Realm, which, although had extraordinary sights of Xuanhuang, still felt quite empty, an idea came to his mind.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered and he arrived at a mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>Referring to the appearance in his memory, he moved his mind slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a quaint stone tower emerged from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then took out a tower peak from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Replacement, placement.</p><p></p><p>After placing the tower peak on the stone tower, the newly emerged stone tower was instantly filled with a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied, Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Looking around the stone tower, soon after, with a series of rumbling sounds, several buildings appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Just let the tree people do the decoration, and it will be almost there."</p><p></p><p>"One-to-one replica, plus the Heaven and Earth Taiji Die of the Tianji Sect here, who would dare to say that our Tianji Sect is fake?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan duplicated it according to the appearance of the Tianjian Sect in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the newly built mountain gate that was empty, Li Fan couldn't help but think of the Heavenly Wonder [Sword] that was still buried in the Sword Tomb of the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The item is good, but it was left by Mr. Bai, so it may be his backup plan as well."</p><p></p><p>"Must stay vigilant."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, all Heavenly Wonders have spiritual intelligence. Even if I were to take it, I might not be able to make use of it."</p><p></p><p>"I can do a favor."</p><p></p><p>While thinking this, Li Fan absentmindedly folded a wooden branch.</p><p></p><p>Recalling his understanding of the Dao of the Sword within himself, as well as the insights he had from Mr. Bai's Red Rope and the [Sword] within the Tianjian Sect in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the wooden branch in Li Fan's hand underwent a marvelous change.</p><p></p><p>Innumerable sword shadows appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>And then suddenly entered it.</p><p></p><p>The color of the branch became deep, and its texture became hard.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the components of the branch gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It truly began to resemble a [sword].</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after rapidly absorbing countless sword shadows, the quantity of true sword intent that entered it sharply decreased.</p><p></p><p>It indicated that Li Fan's understanding had already dried up.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't fully transform it into the Heavenly Wonder.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan's efforts came to naught.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sword-like branch in his hand, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It could barely be considered a Heavenly Wonder."</p><p></p><p>But he wasn't angry since, unlike formations, this was only a sideline for him to learn.</p><p></p><p>The ability to create a Heavenly Wonder out of nothing was still quite incredible.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I don't take it, maybe I can still go to the site of the Tianjian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I can also visit the sites of other sects such as the Yaowang Sect, and the Purple Summit Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan planned to resurrect these vanished cultivation sects in the Lingmu Realm, though not perfectly, just enough to deceive people.</p><p></p><p>"I have the legacy treasures of the Tianji Sect."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, with the return of the Divine Cauldron of the Yaowang Sect, along with the original members of the Yaowang Sect, true and false will be mixed. Who can distinguish them then?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling somewhat pleased with himself, Li Fan left the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>He headed straight for the site of the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although the openly known site of the Tianjian Sect was in Tian Guangzhou, he learned in his previous life through Shuo Fengkou that the sword tomb of the Tianjian Sect and the [Sword] were not located in Tian Guangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were located one province away in Tian Youzhou.</p><p></p><p>It was conveniently divided into two by the white mist barrier, slicing it in between.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the sword tomb had never been discovered by anyone.</p><p></p><p>He quietly and discreetly made his way there.</p><p></p><p>Without disturbing any of the Immortal Alliance cultivators along the way, Li Fan soon arrived at the site of the Tian Youzhou Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the unassuming scene before him, resembling a random burial mound for mortals.</p>

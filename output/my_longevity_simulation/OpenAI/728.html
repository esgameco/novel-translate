            <p>Li Fan sighed on his face, "You should know that Huangfu Song's cultivation level is higher than mine by a large margin, but he died so inexplicably. Truly, life and death are unpredictable. So, with no greed in my heart, I returned directly."</p><p></p><p>"Luckily, with the power of the Rebirth Heavenly Sovereign, Huangfu has a chance to be resurrected."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that Li Fan returned alive from the white mist, Dantai Tao's eyes subtly flashed a hint of disdain.</p><p></p><p>But it was Shuofeng who chuckled, "I advised you not to go, but you didn't listen. For such a trivial reward, it really wasn't worth it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, "Without Shuo's distinguished family background, if I want something, I have to rely on my own efforts. Fortunately, luck was on my side..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Fan took out the "Endstone Plate."</p><p></p><p>Instantly attracting the attention of Shuofeng and Dantaitao.</p><p></p><p>Casually handing the stone plate over, Shuofeng took it in his hand, carefully examining it for a moment, and marveling, "You do have extraordinary luck. As far as I know, many people have set their eyes on this item, and yet you were the first to obtain it."</p><p></p><p>"However, whether it results in gains or losses remains to be seen."</p><p></p><p>Unable to discern any mysteries, Shuofeng handed it over to Dantaitao to play with.</p><p></p><p>Dantaitao squinted his eyes, observed for a moment, then shook his head slightly and returned it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Have you two noticed anything?" Li Fan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance has already thoroughly researched it, but we haven't found anything. How could we possibly detect anything suspicious in such a short time," Shuofeng chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Dantaitao added, "I believe this item may just be a simple ordinary stone."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan denied, "I feel that this item is not ordinary. I'll study it further when I return. If I make any discoveries, I will definitely inform both of you first!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of displeasure flashed in Dantaitao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But Shuofeng applauded, "I am very much looking forward to it!"</p><p></p><p>Dantaitao could only follow suit.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, when I came earlier, I heard you say, Shuoxiong...," Li Fan changed the subject after a moment of quiet and proactively asked.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng waved his hand, looking annoyed, "Let's not talk about it. I've recently had a feeling and sensed an opportunity for breakthrough. But she insists on keeping me here and says she wants to wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>"I can only stay in this small courtyard all day long, I'm really suffocating," Shuofeng complained.</p><p></p><p>"Surely the Immortal Sovereign has a deeper intention. Perhaps by making you wait, there may be major changes in the Immortal Alliance coming next?" Li Fan didn't criticize Feixue Immortal Sovereign but pondered with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"I did hear something," Dantaitao suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Shuofeng looked towards Dantaitao, showing interest.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the exploration progress of the White Mist Barrier is almost complete. Sufficient data has been collected, and perhaps the Heavenly Mirror is about to arrive..." Dantaitao stopped midway.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, Li Xiong is a guest of my Xuan family, speak freely!" Shuofeng could tell what Dantaitao was hesitating about with a single glance and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Dantaitao then continued to elaborate.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mirror is left by the Transcendent Master, a treasure of great mystery within the Immortal Alliance. In the Xuanhuang Realm, all things, above and below, are reflected under its gaze."</p><p></p><p>"Except for the White Mist Barrier."</p><p></p><p>"The area inside the white mist is a new and unfamiliar existence to the Heavenly Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"If we compare the Heavenly Mirror to a cultivator, its way of cultivation might be measuring the heavens and earth. However, for thousands of years, it has been stuck in a bottleneck, unable to advance further."</p><p></p><p>"From the Wulao Assembly's side, the Heavenly Mirror would naturally not be allowed to probe. So, for the Heavenly Mirror to further progress, the only way is to measure the areas within the white mist."</p><p></p><p>"If enough data is collected, the Heavenly Mirror might be able to advance further, completing its own sublimation transformation."</p><p></p><p>"This is the reason why the Immortal Alliance is heavily promoting the explorations of the White Mist Barrier."</p><p></p><p>Dantaitao explained eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng couldn't help but remark, "It seems that your previous gathering of Formation Masters at the Immortal Alliance headquarters is also related to this, right? I'm not very clear about these secrets."</p><p></p><p>Dantaitao smiled but remained silent, tacitly agreeing.</p><p></p><p>"The current Heavenly Mirror has become the foundation-building tool of the Immortal Alliance. If it undergoes transformation..." A hint of longing flashed in Dantaitao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also spoke thoughtfully, "The transformation of the Heavenly Mirror will certainly have a profound impact on the Immortal Alliance. There must be a reason why Immortal Sovereign Feixue didn't let you out. Shuoxiong, your patient wait is necessary. According to Dantaitao's words, I believe that day is approaching soon."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng snorted lightly and stopped discussing the matter further.</p><p></p><p>The three continued chatting for a while.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, under Shuofeng's strong insistence, Li Fan sparred with him again.</p><p></p><p>Intentionally slowing down his spellcasting speed, Li Fan used the "Thread Retrieval" technique, but Shuofeng's sword broke through the light halfway, leaving a bloody mark on Li Fan's body, who admitted defeat repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng laughed heartily, then waved his hand to restore the numerous fine blood strands left on his body.</p><p></p><p>Having shattered the Thread Retrieval technique, Shuofeng's desire was fulfilled, and he did not detain Li Fan any longer.</p><p></p><p>After staying for a while longer, Li Fan bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Tianquan Prefecture, he returned to Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Liu San, Fang Zaiji, and Jiang Yushan all came to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, the information about the cultivator named Zhong Shentong that you asked to inquire about earlier, we have some leads."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How so?" Li Fan raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>However, Liu San's expression was somewhat strange, "Young Master, are you sure this is the cultivator you are looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Liu San presented an image of an old man with white hair.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, recognizing it to be Zhong Shentong whom he encountered in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>After confirming, Liu San said somewhat oddly, "The person has been found, but it is said that this person's time is almost up, unable to break through the cultivation bottleneck, and has already passed away."</p><p></p><p>"Dead?" Li Fan couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?" Li Fan asked again in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The life and death secrets of Zhong Shentong and his Seven-Colored Divine Light were extremely rare and extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>To master these two skills, one must not be an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>And yet, he fell silently in this life?</p><p></p><p>Liu San wryly smiled, "This is a matter personally instructed by the Young Master; I naturally understand its importance. I have confirmed it from multiple sources. Zhong Shentong has indeed passed away."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan furrowed his brow deeply.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, his brows relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the reason why Zhong Shentong may have fallen in this life.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was precisely because of the presence of the "Rebirth Heavenly Sovereign."</p>

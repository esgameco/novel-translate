        <h1>Chapter 995</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan sighed and then turned his gaze to the ink-stained evil book.</p><p></p><p>The moment he took it out and placed it in front of him, a sense of disgust and a hint of fear simultaneously emerged in his sea of knowledge from the Huadaoshi and disintegration discs.</p><p></p><p>"It really is quite mysterious."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared straight at this extremely black metal little book.</p><p></p><p>Made from an unknown material, it emitted a dark black light.</p><p></p><p>This black light seemed to be active, constantly moving on its surface.</p><p></p><p>Different from the ink color on the Ink Killer's body that Li Fan had seen before, the ink on the Ink-Stained Evil Book was like emitting a thick foul odor, making people feel nauseous and uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"It's like the waste generated during the operation of the world. Unacceptable..."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, it is somewhat similar to the world Yōuhún to which Yinshang belongs."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Taking out the Immortal Alliance's standard Yuan Infancy Mirror called the Green Bamboo Ring for testing, when Li Fan manipulated the Ink-Stained Evil Book and released countless black lights to envelop it.</p><p></p><p>It was like a blank paper splashed with ink.</p><p></p><p>The Green Bamboo Ring's original bright green light dimmed instantly, and its aura also subsided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Even though the black light came from his own hands, Li Fan still frowned slightly and distanced himself a little.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the Ink-Stained Evil Book, he waited for nearly half a day until the blackness surrounding the Green Bamboo Ring gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>From the ancient wood of the Lingmu Realm, there was a slight discomfort.</p><p></p><p>"The black light of the ink stain doesn't disappear out of thin air; it requires a certain amount of time for the world to purify it. If the quantity increases, surpassing what can be processed, it can even completely pollute the world."</p><p></p><p>"Although it cannot achieve the effect of destroying the world, it can make the world smelly and unsuitable for cultivators to live in."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>Taking the Green Bamboo Ring that had been submerged in the black light for a long time, it had already lost all its functions as a magic treasure. Just with the power of his physical body, a light pinch made the Green Bamboo Ring shatter inch by inch and scatter on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a specific attack on magic treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Now the protective battle armor effect of the Xuan Suo garment will also be greatly reduced. Moru Bin is really considerate..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put away the Ink-Stained Evil Book and silently praised.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the meeting between Yúfēng and Xuánsùshāng was getting closer as predicted.</p><p></p><p>Without Li Fan sending someone to monitor, Moru Bin had already sent intelligence about the potential few caves.</p><p></p><p>Five locations, two of which were excluded as possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Because, of the three remaining caves, some cultivators had already started preparing in advance.</p><p></p><p>Given the esteemed status of the Xuan family, they were accustomed to living in luxury. Every time they arrived somewhere, although no specific instructions were given, the underlings would still make all arrangements in advance to avoid displeasing their master.</p><p></p><p>Since the final decision on which cave to go to had not been made yet, all three caves were prepared.</p><p></p><p>For the Xuan family, the resources spent on this were just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Having been in the top echelons of the Immortal Alliance for years, they probably hadn't thought that anyone would dare lay hands on the Xuan family.</p><p></p><p>The so-called confidentiality work was just symbolic, almost nonexistent.</p><p></p><p>"Can't blame them; perhaps Xuánsùshāng himself is disdainful of so-called security measures."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, a flash of fierceness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He gathered Tianyang, Linling, and Baifhadaoren and told them the target of their upcoming attack.</p><p></p><p>"Just cooperate with me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan imparted a set of formations to them, allowing them to familiarize and practice during the waiting period.</p><p></p><p>"When the four of us join forces to deploy this formation, we can seal off an entire area."</p><p></p><p>"No one can come in or out. Cut off from the inside and outside, unable to communicate."</p><p></p><p>"Those trapped by the formation will be subjected to a pressure equivalent to the total of our soul powers, greatly reducing their strength."</p><p></p><p>"This operation is not highly dangerous; we need to act swiftly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stated simply.</p><p></p><p>"Using this formation is indeed extraordinary. Even among the remnants of the various realms back then, it is hard to find something of similar caliber." After the preliminary practice, Baifhadaoren, who had tested the power of the formation, couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>Linling's eyes also showed a trace of fear.</p><p></p><p>Only Tianyang remained foolishly oblivious, seemingly unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just smiled in response.</p><p></p><p>How could they have known that this seemingly formidable formation, which Li Fan and Moru Bin had mastered, was customized during the ten-plus days of waiting based on the information from Xuánsùshāng and Yúfēng.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready, and Li Fan contacted Moru Bin.</p><p></p><p>For the three followers behind Li Fan, Moru Bin only lingered briefly on Baifhadaoren, then closed his eyes, looking nonchalant.</p><p></p><p>"If they meet in the Immortal Alliance City, it's a bit tricky."</p><p></p><p>"But because they find the caves inside the city too simple and are used to living in natural caves outside the city..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, indulgence and extravagance have their downfall."</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin transmitted mentally, disdain and killing intent unconcealed in his tone.</p><p></p><p>"Such is the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Your very disciples who transmit knowledge have gone too far."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded with a smirk.</p><p></p><p>"It seems it's time to give the Immortal Alliance a warning." Moru Bin snorted.</p><p></p><p>In the last two days, based on the movements of the external cultivators near the three caves, they finally locked down the target.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of a thousand-mile bamboo sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and his group lurked in the air, looking at the continuous green below stretching to the horizon with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>Baifhadaoren perhaps recalled his destroyed homeland and had a moment of melancholy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Linling scanned around, trying to find if there was a spirit similar to hers in this bamboo sea.</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin and Li Fan coldly mocked: "Truly enjoying it."</p><p></p><p>"This place will make a perfect burial ground for them."</p><p></p><p>During the ambush waiting for Xuánsùshāng to arrive, a small incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>A devout prayer suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And Moru Bin seemed to have sensed something, looking at Li Fan with a slightly furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay." Li Fan made a knowingly gesture, signaling Moru Bin to be at ease.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he checked the image in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was Dao Xuánzi, a member of the Ten Thousand Realms United Council whom he hadn't seen in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan had disclosed the rough location of the Azure Sea Bead to them, and after years of waiting and searching, they finally found the Azure Sea Bead.</p><p></p><p>By establishing a foundation again in the way of Tao, they re-cultivated the peculiar Dao foundation of the earth.</p><p></p><p>The strong wave of faith just now was Dao Xuánzi's sincere gratitude to the Compassionate Immortal of the mortal world after successfully establishing his foundation.</p>

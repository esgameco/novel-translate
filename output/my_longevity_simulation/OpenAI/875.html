            <p>"However, I sense that the atmosphere here is still very strong. If it weren't for my Rainbow Divine Light protecting me, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to stay here for long."</p><p></p><p>"This level of power..."</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't only last for two or three decades, right?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt arose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"What could have disturbed the peace of the Yin Spirit Realm? Releasing billions of souls from the Yellow Spring?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless, like me, it's a cultivator who mistakenly entered this place."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, an image of the skull that he had suppressed not long ago appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that person isn't dead yet?"</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was not an unfounded paranoia brought on by the eerie scene in this place that startled Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Rather, this Yin Spirit Realm was extremely remote. At his current speed, it would take him over a month of continuous flight.</p><p></p><p>Apart from having a specific goal, the likelihood of accidentally entering this place was quite small.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the skull, although only the skull remained, the black and gold patterns on the skull could still persist despite the erosion of the gray mold.</p><p></p><p>"The black and gold patterns are immortal on the surface, while the gray mold grows inside the skull."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this indicates that the powers of the two are evenly matched, and neither can overpower the other."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the appearance of the mysterious skull, Li Fan became increasingly convinced that his speculation might hold some truth.</p><p></p><p>"If completely eroded, it should turn into ashes like many things in the Yin Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Since the skull is still intact, it means it has not truly perished."</p><p></p><p>There were countless secret methods in the immortal cultivation world, and cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm could achieve immortality and eternal life.</p><p></p><p>If this mysterious skull could revive with the help of the black and gold patterns, it wouldn't be something difficult to accept.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed very dangerous. But it's also an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"To find out what exactly happened in the other immortal cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, instantly thinking of dozens of ways to use it.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not forget the main reason for coming here.</p><p></p><p>"Young Junior Brother, this Rift Whale can open space in nothingness. These spiritual bodies seem to be very fond of it, so it must be beneficial for them. Do you want to give it a try too?"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang quickly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"These are not human souls, just resembling them."</p><p></p><p>"These spiritual bodies are condensed from the power of the Yellow Spring in this place." Seeing the other party's slight disgust, Li Fan couldn't help but explain.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang felt better after this explanation.</p><p></p><p>He absorbed an adult old soul that had been soaking in the Yellow Spring water for a long time and was no longer recognizable.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang operated his spiritual power and absorbed it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, I understand why those giant whales like to eat them." Tianyang said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"This small world was originally derived from the Yellow Spring here, like fruits growing on a tree."</p><p></p><p>"In the Yellow Spring water, there are many rule powers. The most abundant of these is the ability to create space." "Although it's only at the level of a small world, it's still of use to me."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang spoke a lot in one breath and absorbed another spiritual body crystal through sound transmission.</p><p></p><p>However, this time he frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it seems to have been affected by the gray mold and has become somewhat chaotic."</p><p></p><p>"Taking just one is enough, taking more is of no benefit." Tianyang concluded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Scanning with his divine sense, he found a spiritual body crystal that had been around for some time.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing it, some images flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The waters of the Yellow Spring flowed in a circle.</p><p></p><p>At fixed points, there would be residual forces.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, these forces accumulated more and more.</p><p></p><p>And then, they bloomed and bore fruit, forming a circle of nine "worlds."</p><p></p><p>Civilization began to emerge.</p><p></p><p>Life in the world, after death, would return to the Yellow Spring, flow through the river, and move on to another world to reborn new life.</p><p></p><p>The peaceful days continued until this day...</p><p></p><p>A golden chain tore through the sky from the distant void.</p><p></p><p>The chain spread and instantly tightly wrapped around and locked the entire Yellow Spring world.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Under the tremendous pulling force, the Yellow Spring world kept roaring.</p><p></p><p>Mountains and rivers collapsed, like doomsday.</p><p></p><p>But the chain showed no sign of loosening.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, holy golden energy kept surging from it.</p><p></p><p>Sharp and cutting off the connection between the Yellow Spring world and the space itself, as if dragging it towards somewhere.</p><p></p><p>This was an immense force far beyond the Yellow Spring world.</p><p></p><p>There was absolutely no room for resistance. It was continuously dragged in the void and didn't know how far it had moved forward until it barely stabilized.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Yellow Spring world was torn apart in this extreme pulling force. Only one of the nine worlds remained, accompanying the Yellow Spring, arriving in this unfamiliar starry sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The images in his mind slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes exploded with a strange light.</p><p></p><p>He had long known that in ancient times, the Xuanhuang Realm had a powerful formation.</p><p></p><p>It could capture distant realms and worlds from outside the void.</p><p></p><p>And even open spatial passages for direct wars between realms.</p><p></p><p>Most of the countless small worlds and realms in the Xuanhuang Realm were derived in this way.</p><p></p><p>But since the rise of the Xuantian Sect and the ten Great Immortal Sects taking control, this formation seemed to have been damaged.</p><p></p><p>Obscure and seemingly vanished into the river of history.</p><p></p><p>Now, through the memory fragments left by the Yin Spirit Realm, he was lucky to witness the might of this ancient formation when it was activated.</p><p></p><p>"Spanning the void, a golden chain's offensive..."</p><p></p><p>"How powerful is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had now reached the point where he could be called a master of formations.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Endless Disintegration Disc in hand, there were few in the entire Xuanhuang Realm who could surpass his proficiency in formations.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he found it hard to imagine how such a grand formation could be built.</p><p></p><p>"Plucking stars and seizing moons, is this already the technique of a true immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the glimpse of the memory of the Yellow Spring's reminiscence, Li Fan saw the golden chain.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have some similarities with the one he saw in the Immortal Graveyard, which was used to lock the remains of a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there is any connection between them?"</p><p></p><p>"That true immortal happened to be trapped at the boundary of the Xuanhuang Realm. It shouldn't be a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"While the path to immortality is not severed, there is still a connection between the immortal cultivation world and the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"Since there can be immortal treasures to support, there must be help to build formations."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his senior brother remain motionless for a long time, Tianyang thought something had gone wrong.</p><p></p><p>He inquired with sound transmission, which finally brought Li Fan back to awareness.</p><p></p><p>"Young Junior Brother, did you see the scene of the golden chain breaking through the void?"</p>

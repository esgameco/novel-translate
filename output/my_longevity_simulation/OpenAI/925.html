        <h1>Chapter 925</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When the sun was at its zenith, an extremely powerful aura suddenly rose from the Liuyue Peak, pointing directly towards the sky. The sun's radiance was instantly blocked, and a bright white moon appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if night had momentarily descended upon the Daodao Sect, attracting the attention of everyone in the sect. In the midst of the crowd's gaze, a graceful figure in white robes emerged, appearing like a true celestial being within the moon. Upon seeing her, both men and women in the Daodao Sect couldn't help but feel a moment of distraction.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Jing Tong has advanced to the Harmony Realm, a joyous occasion!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the sect leader, Fang Dingge, resonated throughout the sect, followed by a cascade of congratulatory voices. Nobody had expected that the usually weak Moonlight Lineage would have the first core disciple to advance to the Harmony Realm. What was even more crucial was that Huo Jing Tong had only cultivated for less than a century, making her incredibly young.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as she did not intentionally seek death, it was highly likely for her to reach the day of swallowing the Longevity Fruit. A potential Longevity Realm expert would undoubtedly change the situation within the Daodao Sect completely.</p><p></p><p>Countless minds were in turmoil. After realizing this, they immediately dispatched their subordinates to prepare gifts of congratulations. The celebration ceremony for Huo Jing Tong's advancement to the Harmony Realm, held under the guidance of Fang Dingge, was grand and lavish.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the entire sect offer their congratulations, but invitations were also sent to other sects of the Immortal Dao. Lasting for over a month, the celebration finally came to an end.</p><p></p><p>After everything settled down, Huo Jing Tong, now a Harmony Realm cultivator, quietly returned to the Liuyue Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Li Qing had been waiting there for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Huo Jing Tong and smiled gently. Huo Jing Tong knew that her advancement to the Harmony Realm was inseparable from Li Qing's assistance.</p><p></p><p>"You... have you ever tasted the feeling of being a Harmony Realm cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jing Tong's eyes were misty as she spoke words of extreme contrast. At the same time, she casually set up restrictions and locked the door. After seclusion for seven days, she reluctantly left.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from becoming a Harmony Realm cultivator exceeded expectations. Because after advancing to the Harmony Realm, Huo Jing Tong came into contact with the principles of Heaven and Earth, beyond just the Yin-Yang reversal.</p><p></p><p>This time's effect was even better than before, directly helping Li Qing, who had recently advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, break through to the mid-stage. With Huo Jing Tong as the only existing Harmony Realm expert in the Moonlight Lineage, she naturally became the true leader of the lineage, possessing many privileges exclusive to Harmony Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>She could designate a separate mountain peak as her residence and have control over ordinary disciples. The Daodao Sect also trusted this Harmony Realm cultivator who had grown up in the sect. As a support for reviving the Moonlight Lineage, Huo Jing Tong was granted many privileges that other Harmony Realm elders did not have.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, Huo Jing Tong began implementing her plan within the Moonlight Lineage. Understanding the terrifying nature of Li Qing's unique constitution and being the greatest beneficiary, her stance aligned completely with Li Qing's.</p><p></p><p>Under various pretexts, she summoned outstanding female cultivators of the Moonlight Lineage to her residence, where Li Qing would intervene. Although a bit forceful, after cultivating together, their realms experienced a slight improvement, appeasing any remaining dissatisfaction they had.</p><p></p><p>They even kept it confidential to gain more opportunities in the future. In less than a year, the Moonlight Lineage fell completely under Li Qing's control.</p><p></p><p>As Li Qing's cultivation became more profound, the eerie atmosphere naturally caught the attention of the few male cultivators in the Moonlight Lineage. However, lacking substantial evidence and with Huo Jing Tong's presence as a Harmony Realm cultivator, they were helpless to act.</p><p></p><p>Following this, Huo Jing Tong agreed. With the departure of those male cultivators, the Moonlight Lineage fell completely under the control of Li Qing and Huo Jing Tong.</p><p></p><p>As Li Qing devoured Yin elements without restraint, her cultivation broke through, advancing to the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, nearing the Harmony Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I need a new female cultivator in the Harmony Realm to assist me."</p><p></p><p>In a hidden room, Li Qing slowly spoke to Huo Jing Tong.</p><p></p><p>Having already planned for the female cultivators in the Daodao Sect, Li Qing had a specific target in mind.</p><p></p><p>"She is reclusive and does not interact frequently with others. Indeed, she is a good target. However, Harmony Realm cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing flashed a hint of worry in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jing Tong smiled, "Don't worry. We don't necessarily have to resort to violence."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Xiyu is not too concerned about physical beings but highly values cultivation realms. If I use the secret of my rapid cultivation as bait, she is sure to comply."</p><p></p><p>"You are becoming more and more like me, Master!" Li Qing praised.</p><p></p><p>A conspiracy web was slowly woven during their private conversation, and the plan proceeded smoothly. After listening to Huo Jing Tong's narration, Zhang Xiyu agreed without much hesitation, issuing a stern warning that they would pay with their lives if the plan failed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled, reassuring her. With two Harmony Realm cultivators and one about to break through, they entered seclusion together.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and within a month, Zhang Xiyu emerged from seclusion, while Li Qing successfully broke through to the Harmony Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you satisfied now?"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jing Tong embraced Li Qing from behind, murmuring softly. After a moment of silence, Li Qing asked, "Master, are you not interested in the Longevity Fruit position?"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jing Tong's hands suddenly froze, then tightly held onto Li Qing without letting go for quite some time. Eventually, she chuckled, "With your abilities, obtaining the Longevity Fruit position should be a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing caught Huo Jing Tong's hands, saying earnestly, "I still need your help."</p><p></p><p>Next, the two launched an assault on the Longevity Fruit position, the highest existence in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, less than ten years remained until Li Qing built the foundation. This meant that Zhao Shijie, Zhao Ruoxi, was still in closed-door cultivation. However, Li Qing seemed to have forgotten about this childhood friend, not actively seeking her out.</p><p></p><p>On the day when the ten-year deadline was reached, the sealed stone door slowly rose, and Zhao Ruoxi stepped out of the secret room. Deeply inhaling, her expression suddenly changed, and then...</p>

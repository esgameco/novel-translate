        <h1>Chapter 803</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Mr. Bai's terrifying talent that harmonizes with the will of heaven, unexpectedly only extends to the foundation building level."</p><p></p><p>"Above the foundation building, everything is in the theoretical speculation stage. Even extraordinary geniuses like Gu Xinghan, exhausting all their efforts, cannot progress further..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't waste my energy on that."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan has a clear understanding of his own talent.</p><p></p><p>"The new method must be studied, but it can be done through others. There is no lack of talents in the Xuanhuang realm, eventually, a breakthrough method can be found."</p><p></p><p>"If it doesn't work in one lifetime, try two lifetimes; if not in two lifetimes, try ten lifetimes!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps informing Master Yin of this method could also be an option..."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Gu can also be considered as a candidate to continue investigating."</p><p></p><p>If he wants to break free from the Xuanhuang realm, even with the endless power of 'Reincarnation,' solo battle alone is not enough; he needs to harness the power of countless beings in this realm.</p><p></p><p>Just like how if he hadn't comprehended the 'Incarnation' function from Tianyang before, he might have already met an unfortunate end.</p><p></p><p>Familiar faces flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"In three more years, I can return to the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"During this time, I cannot waste it."</p><p></p><p>With a slight thought, a jade disc that looked like an ordinary object suddenly appeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>It was the 'Terminal Dissolution Disc,' which Li Fan had willingly abandoned the cultivation realm of the Mid-Yuan Infant stage to preserve in the past.</p><p></p><p>The 'Dissolution Disc' combined with the 'Ultimate Terminal Disk' that could shield the perception of the Celestial Mirror, forming the ultimate creation.</p><p></p><p>Its birth was indeed a serendipitous occurrence, and it would be challenging to replicate.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the cultivation of Mid-Yuan infants...</p><p></p><p>Knowing of the existence of the Five Elements Great Cave Sky and wanting to re-cultivate, it was an easy task for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Wanxian Alliance to actually tell the truth."</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Secondary Body actually has no secret connection with the Celestial Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes showed a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th generation, facing Mr. Bai's "violent attack," he had made preparations.</p><p></p><p>He intended to record the 'Celestial Locking Spirit Array' and the 'Reverse Life and Death Great Array' into the Dissolution Disc, in hopes of attracting the Celestial Mirror and even the Wanxian Alliance's attention, thereby driving away Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>The idea was good, but there was a setback along the way.</p><p></p><p>Until Li Fan transformed and the Dissolution Disc lay quietly in the ruins of sand and stones for nearly half a month, and no one from the Wanxian Alliance came.</p><p></p><p>It was almost certain that the so-called Celestial Secondary Body was indeed an independent entity, unrelated to the Celestial Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"At least for the Dissolution Disc."</p><p></p><p>"After the 'Nine Discs Become One,' its calculation ability is not much weaker than that of the Celestial Mirror. However, it is only specialized in formations."</p><p></p><p>"Plus, the 'Ultimate Terminal Disk' that can conceal the existence of the Celestial Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"With this 'Terminal Dissolution Disc,' combined with the information of many great arrays, I understand everything clearly. Anchored by the Wanxian Alliance for two years, the array defense line constructed based on the computational power of the Celestial Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"In my eyes, breaking these arrays is like child's play."</p><p></p><p>A hint of confidence flashed in Li Fan's eyes: "This is the result of generations of efforts, finally achieving success since I started studying formations from the 10th generation."</p><p></p><p>Touching the seemingly ordinary treasure in his hand, Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Wanxian Alliance's progress speed cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>"The higher the lead, the better!"</p><p></p><p>"With my current level of formation..."</p><p></p><p>"No, at this time, any so-called Grandmasters of Formations in the Xuanhuang realm cannot help the Terminal Dissolution Disc advance any further."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have another treasure..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan brought it into his sea of consciousness, placing it under the 'Transformation Stone' to accelerate the self-iteration of the Terminal Dissolution Disc.</p><p></p><p>The self-iteration speed of the Dissolution Disc was not very slow, but almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>"'Transformation God-One,' is indeed handy. It's just a pity that even after fusing so many Transformation Stones, I still haven't seen any signs of reaching the Intermediate-grade."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Jiao Xiuyuan maintains the soul of thousands of puppets, also relying on this thing. I wonder if he has any backups..."</p><p></p><p>Having a premonition, if the Transformation Stone evolves to Intermediate-grade, there might be unexpected gains.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already determined the hiding place of the current Taiyan Sect, Li Fan had no intention of provoking them for now.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, one of the last two streaks of light escaping at the end of 115th generation, one of them was most likely the information-based Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Being able to survive the End of the World crisis, even if barely, was enough to demonstrate the extraordinary nature of the Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the other streak of light, Li Fan guessed that it was most likely the Celestial Mirror.</p><p></p><p>After more than two hundred years, it should have collected enough data and completed its self-evolution.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that after upgrading, it has cut ties with the Xuanhuang realm and is no longer bound?"</p><p></p><p>With too little information, Li Fan could only speculate without basis.</p><p></p><p>Going down to Yin Xing's tomb, absorbing the Transformation Stone, the action was just a futile attempt to accelerate the self-iteration of the Terminal Dissolution Disc.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the mountaintop, Li Fan began practicing the 'Infinite Filling and Emptying Method.'</p><p></p><p>"Five elements return to one, infinite filling and emptying; its power does not cease, the soul does not die."</p><p></p><p>Although the data contained in this divine skill was extremely vast, and almost made Li Fan's head ache at the time, it was still derived from the 'Inverse Five-Element Life and Death Sword,' a different application of the power of the five elements that Li Fan was very familiar with.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, entering the gate was not as difficult as imagined.</p><p></p><p>After three years of immersing himself in the practice, once 'Reincarnation' was complete, Li Fan also initially completed the practice of the 'Infinite Filling and Emptying Method.'</p><p></p><p>It was like putting on a raincoat in a pouring rain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly felt that outside of his spiritual soul, there was an extra layer of thick protective shell, making him more robust.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the power of the five elements in the Big Xuan's Small World is limited. Without the continuous replenishment of power from the Five Elements Great Cave Sky, the increase in strength is not too significant."</p><p></p><p>"For further cultivation, I have to start all over again after forming the Infant again. By then, it is not just about strengthening the spiritual soul but the critical self-repairing after being seriously injured."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>He habitually flicked the nonexistent dust off his body.</p><p></p><p>Without looking at everything in the secular world of the Big Xuan, he headed straight for the Eastern Profound Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the Immortal Extinction Great Array as per usual, passing through a bright light...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again returned to the vast cloud sea above the waves!</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fan looked at this vibrant world but had scenes of a black sun devouring everything flashing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang realm, I'm back!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 968</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had discussed in detail various matters that needed to be taken into account for their cooperation. However, Li Fan did not ask Mo Rubin to inquire about the secrets of the Immortal Alliance. As the saying goes, "To get, one must give." In Li Fan's view, Mo Rubin's line of inquiry was still in the development stage and far from the time of harvest.</p><p></p><p>"When he further establishes his position among the law propagators in the Immortal Alliance, perhaps then I can make some small requests."</p><p></p><p>He thought so after Mo Rubin's spiritual consciousness had completely disappeared from his knowledge sea.</p><p></p><p>In the next ten days, all practitioners of the "God Manifestation" technique, under Li Fan's hint, all headed towards Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>According to Mo Rubin's plan, he would be in Luo Yanzhou soon as a law propagator.</p><p></p><p>Both the upper and lower levels of Luo Yanzhou, all officials of the various levels of the Immortal Alliance, would definitely treat this matter with the highest specifications.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Mo Rubin would specifically attract the attention of all supervisory forces, creating a fertile ground for Li Fan to spread the "God Manifestation" technique in Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>For a month, Li Fan had to bewitch as many practitioners as possible during this period.</p><p></p><p>Then disperse these practitioners to various places in the Immortal Alliance, waiting for Mo Rubin to finish his inspection and return to the Immortal Alliance headquarters shortly after.</p><p></p><p>And then, detonate.</p><p></p><p>When the situation spiraled out of control, Mo Rubin would voluntarily step forward and take on the task of completely eliminating these traitors. With Li Fan as the mastermind on the inside, this matter was bound to be perfectly resolved.</p><p></p><p>This was the general plan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the actual implementation, various unexpected accidents were very likely. Mo Rubin had already made various plans and precautions.</p><p></p><p>There was a feeling of strategizing in advance and winning from afar.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to Li Fan, a bit more planning was still necessary.</p><p></p><p>Soon, more than thirty thousand practitioners of the "God Manifestation" technique were influenced by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Each went to Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>To avoid alerting the authorities of the Immortal Alliance due to this sudden increase in traffic, under Li Fan's manipulation, some of these people used teleportation arrays while others flew through the air.</p><p></p><p>In batches, within ten days, they all quietly arrived at various places in Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>And they began observing the surrounding practitioners and seeking suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>Although Luo Yanzhou was not as prosperous as the four central states of the Immortal Alliance, it was still a first-rate state.</p><p></p><p>The commander-in-chief of the Immortal Alliance Guarding Command, Ji Cheng Xianzun, was a member of Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>After he acquired great power, he made many contributions to his hometown.</p><p></p><p>Many children from numerous families in Luo Yanzhou were able to go to the Immortal Alliance headquarters for positions, and then return to help their hometowns in the following years.</p><p></p><p>After years of cultivation, the network of relationships was intricate and unfathomable. Only existences like the law propagators could make Luo Yanzhou treat this matter with such caution.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's knowledge sea, the map of Luo Yanzhou slowly unfolded.</p><p></p><p>Red dots representing practitioners of the "God Manifestation" technique were scattered throughout Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>As he sensed the information transmitted back by his subordinates, Li Fan couldn't help but nod silently, "The quality of the practitioners here is much better than that of the remote Cloud Sea, even if we exclude those from major families."</p><p></p><p>"Mm..."</p><p></p><p>"Everything is ready, just wait for Mo Rubin."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first arranged for his subordinates to contact and build relationships with selected targets.</p><p></p><p>Instead of acting rashly, he gradually gained the trust of the targets.</p><p></p><p>The conversations of the thirty thousand people all converged in Li Fan's knowledge sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan presided over the situation in the middle, relying on his powerful spiritual consciousness and high emotional intelligence to always provide the best response solutions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not all over thirty thousand practitioners of the "God Manifestation" technique were acting alone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan intentionally grouped those with lower abilities together. By exchanging words, the efficiency of influencing them was even higher than that of the solo practitioners.</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, within a few days, there were tens of thousands of "trusted friends" in Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the countless different scenes floating in front of him calmly.</p><p></p><p>To him, making acquaintances, chatting, and gaining trust were just a series of multiple-choice questions.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current experience and thoughts, finding the best solution among countless choices was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, choices made without emotions and with absolute rationality could foster relationships better.</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning of a friendship, the relationship is the hottest. Strike while the iron is hot..." he silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Just one day after the agreed-upon time, there seemed to be an unusual atmosphere enveloping Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Among the countless images, numerous discussion voices flew into Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Why haven't we seen Young Master Cai recently? Did he come up with some new ideas again?"</p><p></p><p>"Strange, I haven't run into Brother Zhang for a few days either."</p><p></p><p>"The guys from the Martial Arts Hall have been more diligent lately. But the way I see it, it seems a bit staged. "</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>Combining various unusual behaviors, the practitioners in Luo Yanzhou quickly realized that a prominent figure had arrived.</p><p></p><p>As for how significant this figure was and what their true identity was, they had no way of knowing.</p><p></p><p>However, the intelligent ones had decided to retreat into seclusion and refrain from going out for a while.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, for some unknown reason, they might inexplicably disappear.</p><p></p><p>Within Luo Yanzhou, everything was calm.</p><p></p><p>The many practitioners were discerning enough not to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>They just gathered with friends to discuss privately.</p><p></p><p>And at that moment, it was finally Li Fan's turn to show his power.</p><p></p><p>Stirring up the emotions of the target practitioners and resonating with them was actually quite simple.</p><p></p><p>Most of these practitioners had no background and had only reached their current level through their hard work.</p><p></p><p>Most were in the Foundation Establishment Realm, with a few in the Golden Core Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were very few in the Nascent Soul Realm, almost none.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's bewitching voice echoed in their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, these big families control Luo Yanzhou. We lowly practitioners probably will never have a chance to rise above. "</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, we never get any good opportunities. We aren't even qualified to know what happens...  "</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, this kind of life."</p><p></p><p>"Merely relying on one's own cultivation, without resources, how high can we advance? Without a blessed land, even if we are peerless geniuses, we will still be stuck at the Nascent Soul Realm. I think those children from major families aren't necessarily better than us. Take Young Master Cai, for instance, who lacks nothing but is stuck in the late Golden Core Realm. He's truly a complete waste! If it were me..."</p><p></p><p>...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 812</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"This magnificent mountain range, if there was just one in an ordinary state, it would be enough to be famous throughout the world. Yet here, there are a total of nine!" </p><p></p><p>A young man in white clothes walked slowly to the foot of the Tianlao Mountain, sighing repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The young man had fair skin and a handsome appearance. However, his eyes occasionally revealed a resilience not typical of someone his age.</p><p></p><p>Around his neck hung a long rope woven from green vines.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the green rope hung a green gourd.</p><p></p><p>The young man swung the gourd, then pulled out the stopper, aiming the opening towards the towering Tianlao Mountain range ahead.</p><p></p><p>After making slight adjustments to the position, he nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Retrieve!"</p><p></p><p>He lightly commanded, and a virtual image seemed to emerge from afar, being sucked into the green gourd from the Tianlao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The young man brought the gourd to his nose and sniffed carefully.</p><p></p><p>"It truly is a stunning sight!"</p><p></p><p>His face was filled with a look of fascination.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, his expression suddenly froze, and his body became immobile in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A figure slowly appeared behind him, reaching out to take the green gourd from his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Scene Treasure Gourd, this thing is indeed not bad," said the person with a sneer.</p><p></p><p>Fear flashed in the young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ordered Tianyang to carry the young man, while he himself put away the treasure gourd.</p><p></p><p>"Shang Tiangi, a member of the Immortal Alliance Mountain and River Pavilion. At eighteen years old, he is considered an extraordinary talent."</p><p></p><p>"The companion strange item, the Celestial Scene Treasure Gourd, can capture the scenery of the mountains and rivers within it. It generates a nearly identical, slightly smaller copy within the gourd."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, with a single thought, one can traverse to the locations recorded in the Celestial Scene Treasure Gourd. If not for my ability to manipulate Binding Worms, even if he had reached the Nascent Soul realm, it would not have been so easy to capture him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine thoughts looked into the Celestial Scene Treasure Gourd, where various unique landscapes were dispersed among the clouds and mist.</p><p></p><p>Some of them were familiar to Li Fan, such as the Taishan Ten Veins and the Tianling Thousand Waters.</p><p></p><p>And the Tianlao Mountain, which was just captured by Shang Tiangi, was also among them!</p><p></p><p>"For someone who has just reached the Golden Core realm, daring to charge into the chaotic Nine Mountain States alone, truly showing no fear."</p><p></p><p>"However, if it weren't for me, what was about to happen next would have truly followed the protagonist's script."</p><p></p><p>"During his journey, he coincidentally encountered an ambush by the Five Elders Society."</p><p></p><p>"With the cooperation of the Lingyuan Sect, the Five Elders Society had already dispatched heavy forces to block off the Nine Mountain States, not allowing anyone to enter or exit. They also blocked all communication; ordinary methods of spreading news were impossible. They were just seeking to delay as much time as possible. Speed is key in warfare. Before the Immortal Alliance could react, they planned to take over the Nine Mountain States."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that with bad luck, they ran into Shang Tiangi, this abnormal individual who could rely on his companion item to instantly transfer to the Nine Mountain States where spatial transmission was impossible."</p><p></p><p>"Resulting in leaks of information and incomplete achievements."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, recalling the official statements of the Immortal Alliance in the previous life regarding this matter.</p><p></p><p>"However, I cannot guarantee that this is the whole truth of the matter."</p><p></p><p>"Further observation is needed."</p><p></p><p>"As for this kid..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his head and glanced at the motionless Shang Tiangi.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang signaled, knocking him unconscious with a slap. Then Li Fan flicked his finger, sending a red sphere containing his vital blood into the other's body.</p><p></p><p>It was the technique of passing down blood that could affect the mind, the Bloodline Crossing.</p><p></p><p>"The Multiverse United Conference cannot be run by myself alone. With such talent, he could serve as a facade quite well."</p><p></p><p>Standing on Tianyang, Li Fan flew to the top of the Tianlao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>He casually set up an array to mask his breath, then looked into the distance, waiting for the arrival of the Five Elders Society army.</p><p></p><p>"They should be arriving soon."</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Li Fan studied the Celestial Scene Treasure Gourd he had just acquired.</p><p></p><p>Although it was Shang Tiangi's companion item, for some reason, he had not used it to build a foundation but rather treated it like an ordinary treasure, just carrying it with him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense entered the green gourd, attempting to connect with the landscapes inside. He wanted to see if he could freely move through these scenes like Shang Tiangi.</p><p></p><p>But to his dismay, they did not respond to him at all.</p><p></p><p>"I can't refine them with spiritual energy. I can't even sense their absorption... It seems this thing is exclusive to that guy."</p><p></p><p>After a fruitless attempt, Li Fan shook his head and gave up.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the unconscious Shang Tiangi, Li Fan carefully examined him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" After a moment, Li Fan's eyes revealed a hint of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Engraved on Shang Tiangi's Golden Core was the pattern of a purple-gold gourd.</p><p></p><p>The appearance was exactly the same as the Celestial Scene Treasure Gourd, but the essence was more profound and luxurious.</p><p></p><p>"The Twin Gourd? Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>However, he had no intention of directly seizing it.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Shang Tiangi still had some use. Secondly, this companion item was likely unique to him, just like the Celestial Scene Treasure Gourd. It couldn't be taken by force.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps someone like Mr. Bai, who embodies the will of heaven, could use it effortlessly. As for me, it's not possible."</p><p></p><p>The treasure was right in front of him, yet he couldn't enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan felt no urgency.</p><p></p><p>He simply narrowed his eyes, silently feeling the progress of the Bloodline Crossing within Shang Tiangi's body.</p><p></p><p>When Shang Tiangi woke up with a start and saw the mysterious person who had captured him, his fear had disappeared and was replaced by a sense of closeness and trust.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what do you think of the Immortal Alliance?" Li Fan asked in a strange tone.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Shang Tiangi was slightly stunned, unexpectedly hearing such a random question from the other party.</p><p></p><p>He subconsciously answered, "The Immortal Alliance is great! Everyone has cultivation skills, and one doesn't have to worry about life safety..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted, cutting him off, "Great? Can't you see how many cultivators have to toil hard for half their lives just for a cultivation method? And they even have to split the techniques for sale. Starting from foundational cultivation, reaching Golden Core requires a new exchange. Yuan Ying and Nascent Soul stages are the same!"</p><p></p><p>"Just treating us cultivators like cattle!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tiangi was about to retort, but Li Fan pointed at his forehead.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, numerous scenes of lower-level cultivators laboring hard for slight contributions flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tiangi, a once peerless genius, naturally did not understand how difficult it was for mediocre cultivators to advance step by step from being ordinary people to refining Qi, building Foundation, completing the Golden Core...</p><p></p><p>Many people even spent their entire lives stuck in realms that he could effortlessly break through. Making no progress at all.</p><p></p><p>For the first time in his life, Shang Tiangi truly understood the hardships these people faced, and his mind was severely impacted, filled with indescribable shock.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to bewitch him with words.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the look in Shang Tiangi's eyes gradually changed.</p>

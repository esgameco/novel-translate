            <p>"What evidence do you have?" However, she was not easily convinced, as both Xǔ Bái's appearance and the timing of his appearance were highly suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái smiled slightly and recounted all the details of the previous transactions between them through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>A hint of curiosity flashed in Xiǎo Qīng's eyes, temporarily choosing to believe Xǔ Bái's identity.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please follow me." With a gentle wave of her hand, she dismissed the surrounding guards, and Xiǎo Qīng led Xǔ Bái towards the towering spire-shaped palace in the city.</p><p></p><p>Flying in the air, Xǔ Bái scanned the continuous buildings established on the bodies of the Chi Jiu corpses.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of continuous development, the terrifying beast's original shape was no longer recognizable.</p><p></p><p>Only in a few key places, traces of the original monster could still be observed.</p><p></p><p>For example, the crack on the head that was used as a sacred site for worship, and the monster's claw wrapped in layers of mysterious metallic structures.</p><p></p><p>And the imperial capital seemed to be built on the original heart.</p><p></p><p>During the flight, Xǔ Bái gained a more intuitive understanding of this civilization closely related to the alien beasts.</p><p></p><p>The alien beasts had indeed integrated into various aspects of people's lives.</p><p></p><p>Just in the brief time Xǔ Bái observed on the road, he saw inhabitants with hollow bodies, resembling dragons shuttling between cities; lion-like creatures with wings carrying guard cultivators on their backs, patrolling in the air; and hidden in various corners of the city, eye-like structures occasionally casting a gaze toward Xǔ Bái in the sky...</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the various unknown alien beasts that the residents of the Empire carried with them.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed quite unique and vibrant," Xǔ Bái couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>The speed of their flight was extremely fast, and in no time, they arrived at the Imperial Palace.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Xǔ Bái realized that the towering spire he had seen earlier was also a living alien beast.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, this spire and the buildings within tens of miles were all evolved from this huge alien beast.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of this alien beast is probably not below that of an ordinary Yuán Yīng cultivator," Xǔ Bái evaluated silently.</p><p></p><p>One was an imperial master, and the other carried the bloodline of the Empire's founder.</p><p></p><p>The alien beast did not show any defensive measures.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a door suddenly appeared on the originally smooth exterior of the spire.</p><p></p><p>Xiǎo Qīng turned back to look at Xǔ Bái with some confusion before flying into it first.</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái, unfazed, followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the tower, they were greeted by a gorgeously decorated room.</p><p></p><p>Ceiling adorned with intricate patterns, walls resembling white jade, wooden floors, carpet covering the entire room...</p><p></p><p>It was no different from ordinary human architecture, and it was impossible to tell that they were inside an alien beast. </p><p></p><p>There was no one in the room.</p><p></p><p>And Xiǎo Qīng seemed to have no intention of involving others in the conversation anymore.</p><p></p><p>After gesturing for Xǔ Bái to sit down, she politely asked, "Don’t you still know the name of a friend?”</p><p></p><p>"Xǔ Bái."</p><p></p><p>"You're also surnamed Xǔ?" Upon hearing this name, Xiǎo Qīng's breath instantly became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing something amiss, she quickly calmed her mind and said, "I haven’t told my friend yet, the surname of the Imperial family is indeed [Xǔ]."</p><p></p><p>With that, she focused her gaze on Xǔ Bái, observing his expressions.</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái's performance clearly disappointed her.</p><p></p><p>"That's indeed a coincidence," Xǔ Bái said with some surprise, as if he had not known about it before.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Xiǎo Qīng did not respond but after a moment of silence, she went straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, what did you mean by saying that our [Empire] will face great difficulties?"</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái sighed slightly, showing a troubled expression.</p><p></p><p>He then proceeded to explain the establishment of the Wàngshēng Mansion in the Xuán Huáng Realm, the upgrading of the Tiān Xuán Mirror, and the stirring of cultivators to explore the small pocket realms in order to achieve the unification of the world.</p><p></p><p>When talking about the establishment of the Wàngshēng Mansion, Xiǎo Qīng's face remained relatively calm.</p><p></p><p>But when Xǔ Bái mentioned the cultivators carrying the Tiān Xuán Treasure Mirror and exploring the entrances to the small worlds, the shock on her face could no longer be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"When did this happen? How come I didn't receive any news?" Xiǎo Qīng said slightly at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuán Huáng Realm is changing rapidly. The development is too fast, and there are too many changes. Your Empire's spies have not had time to report back, which is normal. Even though the Alliance of Ten Thousand Realms had anticipated the actions of the Immortal Alliance early on, we did not expect their movements to be so swift and decisive. We were slow, resulting in several small worlds being quickly captured."</p><p></p><p>A hint of sorrow flashed in Xǔ Bái's eyes, "Fortunately, you have not been discovered here."</p><p></p><p>"Although we have the Alliance of Ten Thousand Realms, everyone is dispersed and it is difficult to concentrate our forces. Faced with the powerful Immortal Alliance this time, we chose to temporarily avoid confrontation and preserve our strength."</p><p></p><p>Xiǎo Qīng looked worried, "I’m afraid that avoiding for a while may not prevent inevitable exposure."</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái said confidently, "That's why I came to find a friend. Although the power of the Tiān Xuán Mirror is indeed terrifying, the Alliance of Ten Thousand Realms has its own resources."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the organization has developed a supreme magic treasure that can interfere with the detection of the Tiān Xuán Treasure Mirror."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xǔ Bái paused intentionally.</p><p></p><p>After catching Xiǎo Qīng's attention, he continued, "Before I came, I had already used the power of this magic treasure to hide the entrance of your Empire. So, friend, you don’t need to worry for now."</p><p></p><p>Xiǎo Qīng looked at Xǔ Bái with a hint of doubt in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái chuckled and took out a folding fan, lightly waving it in front of his chest, "If you don't believe me, friend, you can go and verify it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Xiǎo Qīng smiled and said, "With a friend coming from afar, I naturally believe that you wouldn't deceive us in such matters. But I am curious, how did you know about the entrance to the [Empire] channel?"</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái confidently replied, "Without a certain confidence, how dare we call ourselves the [Alliance of Ten Thousand Realms]? Moreover, friend, don't forget. It was we who first came to you for a trade deal."</p><p></p><p>"I must thank my friend for that. However..."</p><p></p><p>Xiǎo Qīng stared at Xǔ Bái and asked, "Your alliance always gets up early for profit. This time, you have actively sheltered us. What are your conditions?"</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái closed his folding fan with a snap, "I like talking to smart people. Besides informing you of the situation in the Xuán Huáng Realm, I do have a task at hand."</p><p></p><p>Xǔ Bái stood up abruptly, his face serious, "Now that the Immortal Alliance is strong, we can only choose to endure. But as my friend said, always evading, sooner or later, we will be discovered."</p><p></p><p>"So, before that day comes, we must develop enough power to resist the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

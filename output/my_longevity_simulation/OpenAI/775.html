        <h1>Chapter 775</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"No wonder [he] just has a little bit of Mr. Bai's charm, [his] split body's cultivation talent is so terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"My will is the will of heaven, my heart is the heart of heaven." Xu Bai repeated this sentence in a low voice, suddenly realizing.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai is afraid that he is a kind of existence similar to the embodiment of the will of heaven. Without the shackles of new methods, it seems that taking a step to become a god in an instant is not a difficult task."</p><p></p><p>With the help of the memories transmitted from the holy fetus Xu Bai, the split body was able to fully comprehend what it felt like to integrate with heaven, "unity of man and nature."</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the original body Li Fan, the split body Xu Bai, and the holy fetus Xu Bai is quite mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Although currently all dominated by the same consciousness, the qualifications of the three bodies are different from each other.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even towards the same things, they would have different insights.</p><p></p><p>The talent of the split body Xu Bai far surpasses Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And the holy fetus Xu Bai is even above the split body Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the moment the holy fetus separated from the mother body, it was already subjected to a more severe "contamination." Subconsciously, he would do things beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>Like falling inexplicably while walking on the road. It must have been affected by some external force.</p><p></p><p>However, the current Xu Bai, whether the split body or the holy fetus, remains unaware and unable to resist the external force causing this situation. They can only let the changes silently happen on themselves.</p><p></p><p>The only certainty is, even though the final outcome is predetermined and cannot be changed, the holy fetus Xu Bai has not yet given birth to its own independent consciousness.</p><p></p><p>His actions are still controlled by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This is also why, knowing that he was already influenced by Mr. Bai and unable to resist passively, Li Fan took the initiative to induce the birth of the holy fetus.</p><p></p><p>Since he could no longer stop it, then it is better to actively facilitate it and seize control!</p><p></p><p>During this process, he could secretly plant some nails for the other party.</p><p></p><p>For example...</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Bai awakens independently after acquiring Li Fan's memories.</p><p></p><p>He might try to build a foundation with [Establishing Base with Myself], thus breaking free from the shackles of tradition and opening up a completely new path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If this path theoretically works, Mr. Bai is definitely the most likely one to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan doesn't allow him to do so.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he manipulates the holy fetus Xu Bai to build a foundation with the [Will of Heaven Sword], and continue on the path of the new method.</p><p></p><p>"After Mr. Bai is reborn, he may indeed have a showdown with tradition."</p><p></p><p>"It's just right to add some difficulty for him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan doesn't hold much favor for this being who wants to be reborn through his body.</p><p></p><p>However, what is more likely is...</p><p></p><p>Once the other party awakens its own consciousness, the first thing it may do is probably find the original Li Fan and seize the treasure of [Returning to the True Self]. After all, it has all of Li Fan's memories.</p><p></p><p>By then, Li Fan will truly be as defenseless as a lamb to the slaughter.</p><p></p><p>"I must make arrangements before that time."</p><p></p><p>"The time left for me is not much."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's face became unusually serious.</p><p></p><p>Given the holy fetus Xu Bai's pace of cultivation, by the time Mr. Bai finally awakens, his cultivation will definitely surpass Li Fan by far.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he is synchronized with Li Fan's memories, knowing every move Li Fan set up beforehand like the back of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, escaping from the other party would be as difficult as ascending to the sky.</p><p></p><p>The only possible chance lies in the [Incarnation] function of [Returning to the True Self].</p><p></p><p>"Though dead, not extinguished, the true spirit remains. Transforming the self into objects, crossing through the ages."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Tianyang, whether you can survive this time, it all depends on you."</p><p></p><p>"If there is a next life, I will definitely treat you well!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After activating the Incarnation function, one can abandon the physical body and entrust the true spirit to an object.</p><p></p><p>When the duration reaches its limit, one can activate the Returning to the True Self on their own terms.</p><p></p><p>This is the only method Li Fan can think of currently to break free from Mr. Bai's mental control.</p><p></p><p>However, if he easily [Transforms into Objects] now...</p><p></p><p>When Mr. Bai regains his will, he will also have the memory of Li Fan's [Incarnation]. There is still a high probability of him finding the whereabouts of Li Fan possessing a body.</p><p></p><p>By then, Li Fan's fate might be even more tragic.</p><p></p><p>"To deceive Mr. Bai, one must first deceive oneself."</p><p></p><p>"Before activating the [Incarnation] function, the target is uncertain."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's mind raced, contemplating strategies to break through.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai left the secret room and first returned to Tianliang City, resigning from the position of [Communication Envoy].</p><p></p><p>This move surprised Nan Gong Shirong.</p><p></p><p>"What dissatisfaction do you have, you can speak out directly. Why make a fuss like this?" he advised hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Are you not satisfied with your position? I can promote you. With the merits you have accumulated over these years, it's enough to silence others." He tried to persuade.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai shook his head slightly, "Thank you for your kindness. It's just that the day before, I suddenly had a feeling. I felt that worldly matters are busy, but have no great use for me individually."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how high the official position, how abundant the resources, if one does not focus on the cultivation itself, it is useless. It becomes a burden instead."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai put on a look of understanding worldly affairs, along with his extraordinary appearance, truly stunned Nan Gong Shirong.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a bit regrettable. After a few decades or hundreds of years, when I ascend to the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance, Tianliang Province will eventually be handed over to you. Among my subordinates, you are the most reliable." Seeing that Xu Bai had made up his mind, not pretending, Nan Gong Shirong shook his head slightly, lamenting. Trying to make a final retention.</p><p></p><p>After being ruthlessly refused by Xu Bai, he continued, "There will always be a place for you in Tianliang Province. If you change your mind in the future, you can always come back to find me."</p><p></p><p>"Then I will take this opportunity to thank you, sir!" Xu Bai bowed, and then left gracefully.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong watched his figure, his face full of doubt.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's resignation did indeed cause quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>After all, the position in the Immortal Alliance is coveted, and with every job, there is someone suitable for it. The sudden vacancy of a position like [Communication Envoy] naturally caused various forces to vie for it.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the occurrence of an event easily quelled the waves caused by Xu Bai's resignation.</p><p></p><p>In the progress of the Immortal Alliance cultivators' conquest of small worlds, an unexpected major incident finally took place.</p><p></p><p>Tai Yan Sect, this famous ancient immortal sect.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it not perish.</p><p></p><p>It actually thrived spectacularly in a certain small world.</p><p></p><p>After a team of Immortal Alliance cultivators intruded, they were easily defeated by the other party.</p><p></p><p>However, Tai Yan Sect did not harm them and simply released them all back.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 781</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The surging clouds and seas turned back to the appearance of being just annihilated by ink.</p><p></p><p>Lava raged, caves were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's hands, the coil emitted bursts of crystalline white light, disappearing into the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Emerging in his own cave world.</p><p></p><p>Transformed into drops of spring rain, falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan saw signs of animal life appearing in the mountains, rivers, lakes, and forests within the cave world.</p><p></p><p>Without any prior signs, fish, birds, and beasts suddenly emerged from various places.</p><p></p><p>With the addition of various creatures, true vitality began to manifest in the cave world.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary evolution, it would have taken hundreds of thousands of years for such a thing to happen.</p><p></p><p>But with the power of world revival, it happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"This technique is truly amazing," Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the Five Elements Great Cave World he nurtured for countless years in his previous life consisted mostly of plants. It was still far from becoming a "world."</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Bai's cave world inside his body achieved this in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Since emerging from the surging clouds and sea, Xu Bai did not stop the pace of transforming the world.</p><p></p><p>However, it was more like repair and patchwork afterward, without any earth-shattering changes within the cave world.</p><p></p><p>Only in those unnoticed corners did various changes quietly occur.</p><p></p><p>"I can't learn this, I can't learn this," Li Fan kept pondering on Xu Bai's extraction of the power of revival.</p><p></p><p>Even though he experienced it firsthand, he was still clueless about how Xu Bai managed to do it.</p><p></p><p>This clearly exceeded the level that Li Fan could currently comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary Yuanying cultivators use their cave worlds as the foundation for cultivation. I have never heard of someone directly devouring a small world before."</p><p></p><p>"When he truly advances to the Nascent Divinity realm, I wonder how powerful he will become."</p><p></p><p>"And what kind of Heaven and Earth Soul Dao will he merge with?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was unexpectedly filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>During Xu Bai's journey through the Xuanhuang Realm, there was another thing that Li Fan was concerned about.</p><p></p><p>Logically, with Xu Bai's appearance and temperament, he should have attracted the attention of other cultivators wherever he went.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his actions of seizing the changes of Heaven and Earth all the way.</p><p></p><p>It should have garnered considerable attention.</p><p></p><p>But all the cultivators they encountered along the way seemed to ignore him completely.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they couldn't see Xu Bai at all.</p><p></p><p>Hidden in plain sight in broad daylight!</p><p></p><p>"This kind of ability really suits me."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to blend with all things in Heaven and Earth..."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was about to ascend to the Nascent Divinity realm, while Li Fan was also about to refine the "Emperor Beast."</p><p></p><p>All the sealed exotic beasts in the Sealing Life Treasure Chest had been released.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even added the flesh and blood of the Red Nine-Headed and the essence blood of the Kunpeng.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Above the Furnace of Myriad Transformations, all the diagrams of exotic beasts emitted dazzling lights.</p><p></p><p>The metal furnace shook violently, and creaking sounds were heard from all around.</p><p></p><p>As if it might not withstand it and burst open at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Another preparation is complete."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tapped his hands continuously, setting up formations around the Furnace of Myriad Transformations, sealing it temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Then he stored it in a separate storage ring.</p><p></p><p>After that, Li Fan took out some materials and began crafting mechanical puppets according to the methods from his memories of the Sun Yang Record.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Scripture is my only means of disrupting the Longevity Heavenly Sovereign's vision."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it seems that the powerful figures in this world are very interested in the Chaos Scripture. So, when the time comes, I will not only personally display it. It will also erupt simultaneously in different places."</p><p></p><p>In a few days, a somewhat rudimentary black puppet had been crafted.</p><p></p><p>It didn't have any intelligence to speak of, and its functionality was very basic.</p><p></p><p>Its sole purpose was to execute predetermined commands at crucial moments, unaffected by any external factors, even Li Fan himself!</p><p></p><p>"Even using the Chaos Scripture myself is quite difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention these puppets."</p><p></p><p>"Only by splitting the character 'Chaos,' I may be able to pull it off. At that time, the puppets will assemble it into a complete technique."</p><p></p><p>"If it's the full power of 'Chaos,' I might not be able to divide it. However, aiming for the essence of Chaos rather than power, I can give it a try."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan simultaneously supervised and recorded Xu Bai's activities, he continued to craft puppets and contemplate the method of disassembling the Chaos Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the Dao of Transformation One Secret Technique, he could proceed without much chaos.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan unleashed a black surge of aura, landing on the newly refined Medicine King True Cauldron, only to be easily blocked by the black faint light emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan furrowed her brows lightly, while Fang Zaiji was pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do you think of my craftsmanship? This new cauldron is truly sturdy. I'm afraid that even if the three of us join forces, we wonâ€™t be able to damage it."</p><p></p><p>"It's all due to its inherently strong material. If its internal formations are truly activated for full defense, perhaps even the attacks of the Longevity Sovereign couldn't breach it!"</p><p></p><p>"And all thanks to your generosity, not hesitating to spend on various Celestial treasures. I have never been so extravagant in my entire life when crafting tools." Fang Zaiji sighed somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, who was testing the hardness of the Medicine King True Cauldron, was very satisfied: "Thank you for your hard work, Senior Fang."</p><p></p><p>"I heard recently that the small world where the Taiyan Sect is located has officially merged with the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. To showcase as a role model, they even allow free visits by Alliance cultivators. Since Senior Fang has put in so much effort in crafting, why don't you join me in visiting to see the situation for ourselves?" Xu Bai smiled and suggested to Fang Zaiji.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the gaze from Liu San, Xu Bai directly put away the somewhat darkened Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyan Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"They are not easy to provoke. I was hunted down all the time back then, never had peace. It was the disciples of the Taiyan Sect who pinpointed my whereabouts." Fang Zaiji hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Those are all things of the past. Now that they have joined the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and have no grudges against you, why would they continue chasing you?" Xu Bai chuckled.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Bai said so, Fang Zaiji became somewhat restless: "I heard that the Taiyan Sect has a treasure called the 'Transformation Stone Mother.'"</p><p></p><p>"It is said to project an extremely realistic illusion inside and has actually derived another real world through it. I've heard of its name for a long time, but never had the opportunity to see it..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes flashed, "Heh, I've also heard of it. This item is a treasure of the Taiyan Sect, it's probably not easy to see it."</p><p></p><p>"Whether we can feast our eyes on it this time will depend entirely on our luck."</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Today, I had a bit to drink, so my thinking is a bit sluggish. I'll update another chapter later.</p>

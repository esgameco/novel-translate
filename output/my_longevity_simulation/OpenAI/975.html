        <div class="content">
            <p>"What? How come the gray mold hasn't burst yet?" After waiting for almost a month without hearing any news, Li Fan couldn't help but feel confused.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't make sense, right?"</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Li Fan realized that the issue could only arise from the person who transmitted the technique.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is one of the top rulers of the Wanxian Alliance, an existence that has survived from the ancient calamity to this day."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is not as powerful as the character 'Hunger' above the Immortal Ruins, the destructive power of the gray mold should be above that of an ordinary immortal realm..."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to resolve it so easily and effortlessly..."</p><p></p><p>"Well, maybe the correct way to use the gray mold is to secretly corrode various places in the Profound Yellow Realm first, and then have multiple eruptions happening at once..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan, who was proficient in pharmacology, was pondering by himself, his only remaining idea demon, the one occupied by Mo Rubin, finally returned with a message.</p><p></p><p>"Xingwang brother, everything alright?"</p><p></p><p>"Who? Where did this little one come from!" Li Fan pretended to have forgotten the other's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, the attack was about to be launched.</p><p></p><p>However, without the assistance of thousands of divine demons, Li Fan's mental power alone was clearly no match for Mo Rubin at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin parried while trying to awaken the memories of "Sun Xingwang". </p><p></p><p>After a while of pretending, a faceless stone statue slowly emerged in the empty consciousness sea, emitting a faint golden light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also slowly halted his attack.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Mo Rubin for a long while, his expression inexplicable as he said, "You finally came."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the two of us were almost unable to see each other again."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was unfriendly as he glared, "Didn't we agree that when the time came, you would step forward directly to carry out the task of sweeping away the divine demons? Why is there a young man full of schemes coming instead?"</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't for the critical moment and the protection of the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal, I would have almost fallen into his trap and revealed all the secrets!"</p><p></p><p>"Or, is this the result you originally wanted? Using someone to kill?"</p><p></p><p>Threads of killing intent surfaced on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's expression shook, "Xingwang brother, don't misunderstand! I didn't expect the transmitter Jiang to personally take action!"</p><p></p><p>"Your commotion was a bit too great, almost causing a crisis in the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I was startled at the time, to tell the truth."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's tone held some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"What? So, it's my fault?" Clearly in the midst of a bright sea of consciousness, Mo Rubin felt somewhat eerie after saying those words.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the other from going crazy, he quickly changed the subject, "By the way, Xingwang brother, how did you defeat him? From his actions afterwards, it seems he returned empty-handed, without much gain."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said impatiently, "I've said it's the protection of the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal! Otherwise, I'd still foolishly think I am him and he is me!"</p><p></p><p>With this, Mo Rubin finally confirmed that "Sun Xingwang" had indeed escaped from the hands of the transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>After all, only a few other transmitters knew the nature of the transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin inadvertently glanced at the gradually fading stone statue above his head, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Our ultimate goal has been achieved. This time I resolved the crisis of the divine monsters rampaging. As per tradition, important matters of the Immortal Alliance will be handled by me in the coming period."</p><p></p><p>"So, it's time to coerce the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror again," Mo Rubin said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, "As usual, figure it out. Just tell me what you need me to do!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin smiled, "Xingwang brother, this time you don't need to intervene again. Just be patient. I'll contact you again when there is progress."</p><p></p><p>"This time is mainly to confirm the situation on your end. After all, the transmitter Jiang is not easy to deal with. I have always avoided direct contact with him..." Mo Rubin's tone was somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me more about this transmitter, in case we encounter him again and are caught off guard," Li Fan continued along with the conversation.</p><p></p><p>"Originally I wanted to warn you when he took action. But at the time, it was the meeting of the transmitters' council, and issuing a warning was already at the limit."</p><p></p><p>"The transmitter Jiang is the first among the transmitters. Possessing the supreme attribute of 'All Things Resemble Me'..."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Returning Ruins Realm, left by the Transmitter Tianzun, it can 'return' infinitely..."</p><p></p><p>In this conversation, Li Fan not only understood why the gray mold had not burst, but also for the first time gained a considerable amount of information about the transmitters who always remained behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>They had only entered the contribution and merit ranking system as a pretense to maintain the Immortal Alliance system.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Profound Yellow Realm, and the way established by the Transmitter Tianzun, they could not achieve longevity from then on, but they could still live as long as heaven and earth, free from aging.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was said that even if they were to fall for some reason, they could be restored through a certain method of 'backup', and come back to the world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, incidents like the attack on the transmitters and their fall had never occurred since the birth of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mo Rubin also did not know the truth of the matter.</p><p></p><p>With a total of eighteen seats, the transmitters had not changed since the founding of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And they never would change.</p><p></p><p>They were the true high-ranking officials of the Wanxian Alliance, and any rules or regulations of the Alliance had lost their effectiveness on them.</p><p></p><p>Only decisions made within the transmitter council could affect them.</p><p></p><p>They also had privileges that ordinary cultivators dared not think of.</p><p></p><p>For example: conscription.</p><p></p><p>Within the Immortal Allianceâ€™s territories, if anyone caught the attention of any transmitter for any reason, they had the authority to conscript that cultivator into their own small world.</p><p></p><p>The selected cultivator would then disappear as if evaporated from this world, with no records remaining.</p>

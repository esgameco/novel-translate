        <h1>Chapter 825</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan was quite surprised. From the Spirit Wood Realm to the Nine Mountain State, one would have to cross almost half of the Stone Lin State.</p><p></p><p>Based on the normal flying speed of a Yuan Ying cultivator, it would take at least five or six days.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Ling flew with Li Fan in the sky, it would probably take half a day.</p><p></p><p>However, with the help of the Earth's Vein power, they had already reached their destination in almost no time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they traveled underground without making a sound!</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association were in a standoff. There were heavy defenses guarding the border between the Stone Lin State and the Nine Mountain State.</p><p></p><p>However, as Li Fan and his companions traveled, they did not attract the attention of either side.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Earth's Vein is pure and exclusive. It seems that even in the mysterious world now, no safe method of traversing the Earth's Vein has been found," Li Fan recalled the various knowledge he had gathered about the Earth's Vein, silently pondering.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in the Nine Mountain State, the flow of the Earth's Vein seemed to be blocked.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly changed from turbulent to calm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sensed discomfort from Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>So he signaled for her to return to the surface.</p><p></p><p>Before drilling out of the ground, Li Fan carefully observed the surroundings to ensure there were no other people around before emerging.</p><p></p><p>"The atmosphere here is so uncomfortable," Lin Ling frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountain State is made up of the corpses of ancient beasts. It's normal to feel somewhat repelled by it," Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>"Such a large area is formed from the transformation of corpses?" Lin Ling widened her eyes, "Then its strength during its lifetime must have been extremely terrifying. No wonder the seniors are restricted here..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Seniors?" Li Fan's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Just now, we were able to run so fast underground thanks to the help from the seniors!" Lin Ling said innocently.</p><p></p><p>She even took out a piece of tree branch, proudly showing it off, "Master, look, this is the gift the seniors gave me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but squint slightly.</p><p></p><p>The tree branch was yellowed but different from the lifeless appearance. It was due to the long-term infiltration of the Earth's Vein power. From it, one could sense a vigorous and powerful Earth's Vein surging energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had seen this tree branch once before.</p><p></p><p>It was during the 115th generation at Yueyang State, in the cave of West Gate Feather.</p><p></p><p>"The Tree of Earth's Vein?"</p><p></p><p>He immediately recalled the conjecture about this tree from West Gate Feather.</p><p></p><p>Back then, after Ruomu was severely injured by a cultivator, some huge trunks fell off his body and scattered to the world. After many years of reproduction, they each evolved into different ancient trees.</p><p></p><p>The Tree of Earth's Vein was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Growing upside down, the roots of these ancient trees spread all over the mysterious world.</p><p></p><p>"How did you communicate with the 'senior'?" Li Fan asked Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling tilted her head and looked at Li Fan. It seemed she couldn't quite understand the meaning behind his words.</p><p></p><p>After a while, she directly transmitted the whole process of her communication with the ancient tree of Earth's Vein to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The communication between ancient trees was different from that of humans.</p><p></p><p>Almost the moment they reached the Earth's Vein, the two had already resonated and connected.</p><p></p><p>And in a very short time, they had completed the exchange of information.</p><p></p><p>The ancient tree of Earth's Vein showed great favor towards Lin Ling, a new and young junior.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it not attack her but also actively helped her.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, through the ancient tree of Earth's Vein, Lin Ling learned about several other ancient trees in the mysterious world.</p><p></p><p>First was Ruomu, the oldest and the ancestor of all spirits...</p><p></p><p>The ancient tree of Earth's Vein did not tell Lin Ling its name.</p><p></p><p>It only advised Lin Ling that the mother tree had a volatile temper and even beings of the same kind, she might not treat them well. On the contrary, she might even devour them, nourishing herself.</p><p></p><p>One should keep a distance as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Then there were two existences on par with the ancient tree of Earth's Vein.</p><p></p><p>They were among the strongest ones that had detached from Ruomu back then.</p><p></p><p>One was the **Spirit Ancient Tree**, and the other was the **Heavenly Flower Ancient Tree**.</p><p></p><p>Although they came from the same origin, they chose completely opposite paths.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Ancient Tree chose to reproduce as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Even if it faced calamities, as long as one part survived and had enough time, it could regrow.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Flower Ancient Tree, on the other hand, followed the path of **Returning all Arts to One**.</p><p></p><p>Constantly shrinking and refining itself, hoping to one day return to the existence of Ruomu.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Slight image information about the **Spirit Ancient Tree** and the **Heavenly Flower Ancient Tree** flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he had actually had contact with both during his cycles in this world.</p><p></p><p>The branches of the **Spirit Ancient Tree** were the material used by Jiao Xiuyuan to create his avatars.</p><p></p><p>"Branching out and spreading everywhere, covering the mysterious world. It seems to faintly resonate with Jiao's **Myriad Puppetry Art**."</p><p></p><p>"It's just unknown what relationship Jiao Xiuyuan himself has with the Spirit Ancient Tree."</p><p></p><p>As for the **Heavenly Flower Ancient Tree**, Li Fan had only met one of its avatars.</p><p></p><p>That was the big tree with a human face he had seen in the organization buildings on the Ten Thousand Immortal Island.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th generation, when the Five Elders Association raided the island, they wanted to move the entire island.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the entire space was locked, communication, and methods of transmission all failed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had paid a hefty sum to Jiao Xiuyuan to learn the escape route.</p><p></p><p>It was through the organization buildings that he successfully escaped the disaster.</p><p></p><p>"This big tree with a human face is one of the avatars of the **Heavenly Flower Ancient Tree**."</p><p></p><p>"As for the female voice with the spirit tree, I don't know who she is."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In addition to these two powerful ancient trees.</p><p></p><p>The ancient tree of Earth's Vein also introduced a few junior companions who were a bit weaker.</p><p></p><p>Like Lin Ling, they were all trees in the world that had gained wisdom of their own.</p><p></p><p>Most of them resided in the caves and small worlds of the mysterious world.</p><p></p><p>Since these caves and small worlds were in the mysterious world, these spirit trees could also establish a faint connection with the ancient tree of Earth's Vein.</p><p></p><p>However, like Lin Ling, who could transform and walk out on her own, she was the first.</p><p></p><p>So the ancient tree of Earth's Vein was very excited.</p><p></p><p>As for the situation where Lin Ling was under the control of the cultivator, this ancient tree didn't seem to care much about it.</p><p></p><p>It only advised Lin Ling that each spirit tree in the world had its own destiny and should follow the innermost thoughts for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Ling, who had just been born, naturally, she seemed to understand but not really comprehend, just obediently agreeing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I never expected so many things to happen in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>"All this happened without me noticing at all. Even if I can fully control Lin Ling, it's the same."</p><p></p><p>"The means of these ancient trees are truly mysterious and unpredictable."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, both this ancient tree of Earth's Vein and Lin Ling have relatively gentle temperaments. Unlike Ruomu, who is quite extreme."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if they joined forces to secretly plot against me..."</p><p></p><p>"It would be really hard to guard against."</p>

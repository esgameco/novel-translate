        <h1>Chapter 881</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"In the coming decade, there will be wonders of the earth in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Or two."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli threw out a heavy piece of news.</p><p></p><p>"One of them is here in this sea of clouds. It is a 'Canghai Pearl' containing the endless power of the vast ocean."</p><p></p><p>"The other, in the Guanglan State, is the 'Ten Thousand Mountain Cauldron,' which nurtures continuous mountain ranges with endless mysteries."</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Wonders of the earth?"</p><p></p><p>Such treasures of this level, they could only dare to dream about.</p><p></p><p>"If you are willing, the Alliance can help you obtain these two items," Ji Shaoli solemnly said.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi stood there in shock.</p><p></p><p>They could only suspect they misheard.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers...</p><p></p><p>What virtues and abilities do they possess?</p><p></p><p>As if reading their minds, Ji Shaoli patted their shoulders, "You don't need to underestimate yourselves. Although those self-proclaimed geniuses have better backgrounds and talents than you."</p><p></p><p>"But what the Alliance values most is character!"</p><p></p><p>"Your aspirations are not inferior to any genius I have ever seen in my life!" Ji Shaoli said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Am I really this strong?</p><p></p><p>This thought crossed their minds. </p><p></p><p>"I believe that if given a high enough starting point, you will be able to compete with those geniuses!" Ji Shaoli said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing?" he asked again.</p><p></p><p>Although they still couldn't believe that such a good opportunity would happen to them, on the other hand, what do the two brothers have to lose now?</p><p></p><p>If they were lucky enough to obtain wonders of the earth...</p><p></p><p>Even if they were to die, there would be no regrets, right?</p><p></p><p>The two men who had struggled in the wilderness for half their lives immediately nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"If we can truly build our foundation with the wonders of the earth, I will give my life for the Alliance!" Kou Hong said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi also made a solemn pledge.</p><p></p><p>"Alright! Then this matter is settled." Ji Shaoli immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Casually, he assigned the wonders of the earth that were once treasured to Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi.</p><p></p><p>The Canghai Pearl has been an old friend of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Mountain Cauldron, which Li Fan once investigated and which will emerge around this time, are both valuable items.</p><p></p><p>However, as their cultivation increased, these wonders of the earth had become useless to him.</p><p></p><p>Instead of being detected by the Immortal Alliance cultivators and seized, it was better to use them to strengthen the power of the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As for why Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were chosen...</p><p></p><p>It was purely a whim of Li Taishi's at the moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, for him, there was no substantial difference between the so-called unparalleled geniuses and Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, who were trapped in building their foundations all their lives and died of old age.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the talents of these two are not too bad. At least, judging from their performance in the battle in Daxuanjing City that day, their actual combat power is far superior to ordinary cultivators," Ji Shaoli commented.</p><p></p><p>"Since their fate in this world has already deviated so much, I will add fuel to the fire and see where their limits lie!" he thought.</p><p></p><p>While Ji Shaoli thought like this, he protected the two brothers.</p><p></p><p>He took out various treasures to minimize the dangers during their advanced cultivation process.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the appearance of these two men in front of Li Fan in this world was somewhat unexpected.</p><p></p><p>And now in the Xuanhuang Realm, there were very few things that could barely bring Li Fan some surprises.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, that's how their current experiment came about.</p><p></p><p>However, for Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, it meant a day that completely changed their destiny. It was just a casual attempt by the split from Ji Shaoli on Haixuan Island, out of boredom.</p><p></p><p>They didn't care about the results at all.</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm at this moment, Li Fan's main body's mind settled down, merging with the Five Elements Great Cave.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging power of the five elements, he tried to incorporate them into one.</p><p></p><p>"The five elements unite, the infinite balance; their power is endless, the soul is immortal."</p><p></p><p>"With the continuous power of the five elements, I can elevate my 'Infinite Balance Law' to a whole new level."</p><p></p><p>"Fulfilling my final shortcoming."</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's delicate manipulation, the power of the five elements merged perfectly into one.</p><p></p><p>Forming a kind of unknown energy that Li Fan had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's soul felt like it had been hungry for a long time and suddenly caught a whiff of food.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of hunger came over him, making him almost think that the side effects of the 'Hunger' mantra had reappeared.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly identified that it was just his soul's natural response to sensing something beneficial to itself.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he absorbed this mysterious energy like a whale sucking in water.</p><p></p><p>Similar to when he swallowed Yima, his soul felt like it was soaking in a warm spring, feeling warmly all over.</p><p></p><p>However, the difference between the two lies in that the effect of Yima was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>After digestion, there was no more nourishment to the soul.</p><p></p><p>But this 'Infinite Balance Law' as long as the five elements supplied by Li Fan were constantly transforming, it would never stop!</p><p></p><p>If taking Yima was like taking a hot bath that quickly cooled down.</p><p></p><p>Then the 'Infinite Balance Law' was like a hot spring that always maintains its heat.</p><p></p><p>In constant nourishment, Li Fan's soul grew rapidly to a level that he could almost discern on his own.</p><p></p><p>If before in Daxuan, he only formed a protective layer outside his soul, like wearing a straw coat, then at this moment, with the far-reaching transformation of the 'Infinite Balance Law,' Li Fan felt that his soul no longer needed any external protection.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on oneself, as firm as steel.</p><p></p><p>No matter the wind or rain outside, I will stand firm!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps my soul was too weak before, which is why the effects of cultivation were so remarkable."</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, Li Fan felt that the 'Infinite Balance Law' had begun to decline, and he had an insight.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance's techniques for the soul are too limited. Even if I reincarnate through the ages, I couldn't find many high-quality ones without the help of the Yanfa Jue."</p><p></p><p>"But that will change after today."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, immersed in the cultivation of the 'Infinite Balance Law.'</p><p></p><p>He hadn't felt the joy of rapid advancement in his cultivation for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if with the growth of my soul, its functions will change?" a thought suddenly flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan woke up from his seclusion, the first thing he did was to test the so-called effect of the soul's immortality in the 'Infinite Balance Law.'</p><p></p><p>In his memory, there was a secret technique that burned the soul at the cost of a temporary and significant increase in cultivation, named 'Soul Burning Technique.'</p>

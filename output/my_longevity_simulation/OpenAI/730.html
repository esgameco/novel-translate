            <p>"Even if the Tianxuan Mirror is not the true essence of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror, there must be an extremely close relationship between the two."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Tianxuan Mirror comes from the Xuantian Sect, does this mean that the Transmitter of the Law is also involved?"</p><p></p><p>"In order to avenge the Ten Sects of the Immortal Way who were destroyed in the past?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Bai remembered that for thousands of years, the Tianxuan Mirror had been constantly giving birth to reincarnated beings.</p><p></p><p>"Even though the Xuantian Sect has been destroyed for many years, it can still use the 'Exterminate Xuan' secret technique to sense the connection between the Tianxuan Mirror and it. Does this mean that the Tianxuan Mirror has not completely rid itself of the control of the Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"So the Wanxian Alliance put in so much effort to find the hidden Xuantian Sect Law King in the Purple Cloud Sect, all for the ultimate control of the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"And the reason is, because of the prophecy I made when pretending to be a disciple of the Tianji Sect, 'Tianxuan locks the soul, Xuanhuang unifies.'"</p><p></p><p>The events unfolding in this world suddenly interconnected.</p><p></p><p>Through the surface of the events, Xu Bai saw the deep underlying reasons hidden behind them.</p><p></p><p>"And now, as the Wanxian Alliance actively promotes the era of the Great Exploration, it seems to be pushing for further transformation of the Tianxuan Mirror. Does this mean that the Wanxian Alliance has finally achieved its goal and gained control of this treasure left by the Transmitter of the Law?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>He had speculated before. The true master behind the scenes of the Wanxian Alliance was not the cultivators, but the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But later, by a fortunate coincidence, he learned of the existence of the transmitters of the law. Therefore, he deduced that the transmitters of the law and the Tianxuan Mirror mutually restrained each other, jointly leading and commanding the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that the cultivators have ultimately won the victory in this struggle?</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's mind, the figures of Shuo Feng and Lu Xichan suddenly flashed.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Family..."</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by Lu Xuejing when she saw his true self resounded in his ears again.</p><p></p><p>"Whose descendant are you? You look suspicious! You must not be approaching Shuo Brother's Five Elders Guild as a spy to find out the location of the Tianxuan Mirror! You don't look like a good person at all; Shuo Brother has never lied to me before..."</p><p></p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, it pierced through the haze.</p><p></p><p>"So that's it," Xu Bai realized.</p><p></p><p>The so-called factions outside the faction, imperial thoughts; within the factions, various and strange. Not all cultivators stood on the side of the transmitters of the law.</p><p></p><p>At least according to the current information, the Chief of the Strategist Hall, as well as Feixue Immortal Venerable and the cultivators surnamed Xuan, were on the side of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The transmitters of the law tried to completely control the Tianxuan Mirror through the methods of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>And the cultivators who held the Tianxuan Mirror in high regard naturally had to find a way to counteract. They might be unable to stop the actions of the transmitters of the law, so they took a different path. They pushed the Tianxuan Mirror to undergo further transformation and resist the control of the Xuantian Sect's secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>But with such a big move, almost mobilizing the entire Wanxian Alliance, to encourage cultivators to explore the White Mist. Xu Bai firmly believed that without the consent of the highest ruling class of the Wanxian Alliance and the transmitters of the law, this wouldn't happen.</p><p></p><p>"Unless the discovery of the White Mist was a decision from a higher will, even the transmitters of the law did not go against it. If the Tianxuan Mirror wants to upgrade itself with this, it's just borrowing a helping hand."</p><p></p><p>"And the only one who can make the transmitters of the law bow is..."</p><p></p><p>After analyzing all this, Xu Bai's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"The Transmitter of the Law!"</p><p></p><p>"He hasn't left? Still in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous sense of pressure hit him instantly. Xu Bai suddenly remembered that even before the era of the Great Exploration arrived, Liusan had already seen many Wanxian Alliance cultivators delve deep into the mist.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he speculated that the Alliance might be searching for clues related to the 'Chaos Formula.'</p><p></p><p>This connected everything.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai instantly felt a chilling fear, "Could the immense divine consciousness that descended after I used the Chaos Formula that day be the Transmitter of the Law?"</p><p></p><p>But soon, Xu Bai frowned slightly and denied himself.</p><p></p><p>Even though his performance that day was excellent, he didn't think he could fool the transmitter's eyes.</p><p></p><p>And from the moment the Chaos Formula was used until the divine consciousness descended.</p><p></p><p>The time span was too long. If it truly was the Transmitter of the Law, with His cultivation, there's no way the reaction would be so slow.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the Chaos Formula activated again in the subsequent confrontation with Moshuai that finally caught His attention."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's thoughts suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Or, the Transmitter of the Law wasn't inside the Xuanhuang Realm at the time. It was only after I used the Chaos Formula that He returned..."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Xu Bai was immediately shocked again.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, he still couldn't rule out this possibility.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Chaos Formula, powerful as it is, cannot be used casually."</p><p></p><p>"It was a stroke of luck the first time, but if there's a next time..."</p><p></p><p>Dealing with the Transmitter of the Law indeed would be affected.</p><p></p><p>If the Transmitter of the Law, who had overshadowed the Xuanhuang Realm for thousands of years, personally intervened, Xu Bai didn't have the confidence to use 'Huanzhen' in front of Him.</p><p></p><p>It would be best not to use it unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai also thought that if the above speculations were true. Then the Transmitter, who had already achieved eternal life and transcended beyond worldly matters, was still so concerned about the 'Chaos Formula'...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's heart trembled, and the first thought that came to mind was this possibility.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, scenes from the time he saw in the Upside-Down Maze quickly replayed.</p><p></p><p>The eerie and horrifying corpses scattered all over, and the stone tablet in the center of the maze engraved with the Chaos Formula.</p><p></p><p>A speculation involuntarily emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation world in that maze was destroyed due to the influence of the Chaos Formula."</p><p></p><p>"And that 'Chaos' word came from..."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"As for why the twisted monster mistook me for the 'Tianzhe' Fisherman, and explained that the culprit was the Celestial Healer..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly remembered a sentence Emperor Sanmo had said to Lu Ya.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes, even what you see with your own eyes may not be the truth."</p><p></p><p>"Under the influence of the Chaos Formula, the possibility of misidentification cannot be ruled out."</p><p></p><p>"At the Yunshui Sky Palace, when Tianzhe, Celestial Healer, and Tianyu faced each other, Tianzhe admitted to slaughtering everyone in the Yunshui Sky Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Upside-Down Maze is also the same."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"In the White Mist of the Element-Devouring, various bizarre and abnormal phenomena abound. It's hard to say that there is no influence of the Chaos Formula among them."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Chaos Formula appeared not only in the Xuanhuang Realm. Perhaps it has appeared in other cultivation worlds as well."</p><p></p><p>"And even led to endless calamities."</p><p></p><p>"This is probably the reason why the Transmitter of the Law and the current Wanxian Alliance, along with the Five Elders Guild, are so concerned about it."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of Xu Bai's contemplation, Li Fan, who had been staring blankly all this time in the Eternal Life Valley, was suddenly awakened by Liusan.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, is the Tianxuan Mirror related to the Xuan Sect?" he asked.</p>

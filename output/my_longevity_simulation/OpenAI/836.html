        <h1>Chapter 836</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The continuous feedback cultivation from the help of Li Jie's departure from the sect and the gathering of clouds has successfully allowed Li Fan to break through his realm. For some reason, this time he did not encounter the binding of Celestial Tribulation. He quickly returned to the later stage of the Golden Core realm. According to the increasingly fast trend, Li Fan believed that the attainment of perfection was not far away. "It's time to consider the matter of merging with Tianyang." "But…" Li Fan took out a real lure fruit and pondered for a moment. In the end, he called Tianyang and let him eat the fruit. Tianyang did not ask why, without any hesitation, he swallowed the crystal-clear real lure fruit in one bite. "Alright, there's no time to lose, let's set off. This time, Senior Brother has prepared a big gift for you!" Li Fan finally relaxed, looking at Tianyang, feeling somewhat relieved. Tianyang tilted his head, seeming like he didn't quite understand the meaning in Li Fan's words. Li Fan paid no mind and continued to summon Lin Ling, leaving the Spirit Wood Realm and heading straight to their destination. This time, Li Fan's target was the essence of heaven and earth, the "Inkstone." As it shares the same prefix as "Ink Kill," the strength of the Inkstone is without a doubt. Currently, the Inkstone had just been born not long ago. Hidden underground in Qiling State, it was not yet known to the world. It was only with the blessings of Mr. Bai that Li Fan was aware of the existence of the Inkstone at this moment in time. If the innate duty of Ink Kill is to annihilate everything, then the mission of the Inkstone is to fill the void left by destruction. Deep underground in Qiling State, some terrifying calamity seemed to have occurred. Large amounts of void cavities emerged in clusters. It was as if the depths of the earth were continuously being gnawed away by insects, leaving it riddled with holes. Without external intervention, it was feared that before long, Qiling State might collapse in a catastrophic event, leading to its destruction. The birth of the Inkstone was to prevent this disaster from happening. Its ability was to generate black, stone-like hard substances, filling the void cavities to repair the chewed up and damaged space. However, if the abilities of the Inkstone were limited to that, Li Fan would not have set his sights on her. Apart from "repairing," the Inkstone possessed another extremely powerful ability – "Space Shatter." The term "Inkstone" did not refer to a stone but to a power that could affect and transform space. Since it could repair countless space cavities, it naturally could also, at a thought, turn the originally intact world into a riddled one. This was just a part of the information from Mr. Bai's memory that Li Fan had synchronized. He believed that when Tianyang truly refines and integrates with the Inkstone, more abilities would be awakened. As for how Li Fan would deal with such a powerful essence of heaven and earth… As the group shuttled through the veins of the earth and rapidly arrived underground in Qiling State, Li Fan had already conducted a simulated deduction in his mind. Although the Daoist stones in his mental sea were only of medium quality, Li Fan believed that as long as there were no more variables introduced, this hunt would be entirely within his control. As they emerged from the flow of the veins, Li Fan and the other two saw the countless terrifying void cavities ahead. Discontinuous, they looked like twisted long worms burrowing and leaving traces of destruction. "Even the power of the earth veins has been cut off here." Li Fan became vigilant. Not seeing the figure of the Inkstone for the time being, the three did not rashly move forward. Instead, they set up a formation outside the range of these cavities. Surprisingly, it was the Heavenly Seal Spirit Formation that Hongxi used during the 115th era to control the enhanced version of Crimson Flame! The Tianxuan Spirit Locking Formation and the Heavenly Seal Spirit Formation. One entity with two sides, different paths leading to the same destination. Li Fan had mastered the entire formation diagram of the Tianxuan Spirit Locking Formation, even though he didn't understand the Heavenly Seal Spirit Formation before. However, with the addition of the "Endless Disintegration Disc," a powerful weapon, in this era, his deductions led to a formation that could achieve effects similar to the Heavenly Seal Spirit Formation. Lacking the crucial Heavenly Seal Mirror, the power would naturally be weakened. But with expertise in formations, he could still sustain a formation that reduced the power of the essence of heaven and earth. "It's impossible to completely strip the abilities of the essence of heaven and earth as Hongxi did before by revealing the formation. But severing the connection between the Inkstone and the essence of heaven and earth and suppressing it shouldn't be difficult." Li Fan contemplated while setting up the formation. Both Lin Ling and Tianyang were clueless about formations, so they could only watch blankly on the side. Fortunately, Li Fan had set up formations continuously for decades, and he had ingrained the process of rapid formation setting into his instincts. A month later, a massive altered Tianxuan Spirit Locking Formation that covered the entire area of the underground void cavities was completed. Following that, Li Fan had to set up a formation to block the impending battle fluctuations and to lock the space, preventing the Inkstone from sensing the danger and escaping. Li Fan was not skilled in spatial manipulation, but with the help of many precious resources obtained from the Wulao Society, he managed to barely complete these tasks after half a month. Li Fan also had Lin Ling ask for the help of the senior of the ancient veins. Using the powerful force of the earth veins, they further sealed the area. When the real battle began, they purposely created some commotion to cover up any leakage of energy fluctuations. Initially hesitant at Lin Ling's request, the ancient veins eventually agreed. The encounters with Lin Ling were brief but frequent. Seeing her rapid progress within a short period, the ancient veins were naturally curious about these precious resources. With the external help secured, the next task for Li Fan was to communicate with Lin Ling and Tianyang. As a Golden Core cultivator, he naturally could not risk his life. Lin Ling and Tianyang would be the primary fighters, while Li Fan intended to stay far away, acting as their commander. Aware of their limited strategic thinking, Li Fan meticulously briefed them on the various situations they might encounter in the upcoming battle. Through the formation, he temporarily linked the thoughts of the three individuals. He also handed over many prepared treasures to them for any potential needs. ... With that, Li Fan silently retreated. With a clap of his hands, the formations were activated layer by layer. "With such thorough preparation, you won't be able to defeat a small Inkstone. So, even if you are counter-killed, you can't blame me." With a strange ripple, he spread towards the void cavities.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 854</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The cultivation of "Mystery of Life and Death" is also an unparalleled mystical cultivation method. When cultivated to the deepest level, it is said to achieve a miraculous state of being present in both life and death, achieving a unique state of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Practicing this method can awaken and greatly magnify the innate fear of life and death in cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It can make cultivators like Zhong Shentong, who are naturally laid-back, suddenly change into a different person when facing the threat of death, becoming fully alert and responsive.</p><p></p><p>"According to the original historical trajectory, Zhong Shentong would not break through until he reached his limit."</p><p></p><p>"But now he has advanced ahead of schedule."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>The period of severe abnormality between immortals and mortals has passed, so it can be confirmed that Zhong Shentong did not break through due to this reason.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But due to his main body still being in the process of swallowing the Five Elements Grand Heavenly Realm, he couldn't break away.</p><p></p><p>This time, to observe Zhong Shentong, his avatar Ji Shaoli had to step in.</p><p></p><p>"He has just broken through to the Foundation Building stage and has not had the chance to comprehend the Seven-Colored Divine Light. With my Golden Core cultivation, I should be able to handle him..."</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be any major problems," Ji Shaoli thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, just to be safe, his avatar made sufficient preparations.</p><p></p><p>At the Foundation Building stage up to the Nascent Soul stage, as long as one arms themselves with enough contribution, they can ignore the gap in cultivation and crush the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that he was already one realm higher than the opponent. So Ji Shaoli wasn't overly worried.</p><p></p><p>According to the information, Ji Shaoli arrived at the northwest border of Yongyunzhou via a transmission array, where Zhong Shentong was hiding in a desolate small mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, this Zhong Shentong was just an ordinary old man. Although he luckily obtained half of the scroll of the 'Mystery of Life and Death' through a coincidence, he had been practicing without success. It wasn't until his lifespan was about to end that he broke through the restraints under immense pressure and successfully stepped into the Qi Refining stage."</p><p></p><p>"After the Qi Refining stage, due to insufficient cultivation momentum, he only spent the rest of his life in this small temple."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, he should have waited until his limit approached to break through again. But now, it happened ahead of schedule..."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of extraordinary item did he use for the Foundation Building stage?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli did not reveal his figure but concealed his aura, observing from a distance.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Zhong Shentong, there was also a little Taoist boy in the temple, about eight or nine years old.</p><p></p><p>Excessively, tasks such as cleaning and cooking, which could easily be done with magic, were strangely done personally by the little Taoist boy at Zhong Shentong's request.</p><p></p><p>The little Taoist boy was very attractive, with eyes that seemed to speak, bright and lively. However, he did his work diligently without complaint, very agile and skilled. His proficient demeanor did not resemble that of a child at all.</p><p></p><p>While the little Taoist boy handled everything orderly, Zhong Shentong merely sat by a pond in the backyard of the temple fishing.</p><p></p><p>After calling out to the little Taoist boy several times with no response, he had to bring the prepared meal to Zhong Shentong himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's time to eat," the little Taoist boy said in a childish voice.</p><p></p><p>"Shh, don't scare away the fish for your master."</p><p></p><p>The little Taoist boy rolled his eyes and started eating on his own.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for the little Taoist boy to almost finish eating, Zhong Shentong's expression changed: "It's hooked!"</p><p></p><p>He pulled the fishing rod, but it wasn't a fish that came up, just a green light cluster.</p><p></p><p>Though Zhong Shentong looked disappointed, he still reached out to search through the green light cluster.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he found what seemed to be a rusted round plate-shaped magical tool.</p><p></p><p>After examining it, Zhong Shentong shook his head slightly and tossed it to the little Taoist boy.</p><p></p><p>The little Taoist boy seemed accustomed to this and skillfully caught it, asking, "Master, what is it this time?"</p><p></p><p>"A fire plate that can emit bright flames. No need for incantations when starting a fire from now on," Zhong Shentong lazily explained.</p><p></p><p>He then gathered his fishing rod and devoured the food voraciously.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Foundation Building stage, he no longer needed to eat like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhong Shentong seemed to enjoy it very much, devouring the food eagerly.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, he cleared the food on the table.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take a nap. There's nothing urgent, don't disturb me," Zhong Shentong got up, humming a tune as he instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, got it," the little Taoist boy replied helplessly.</p><p></p><p>When the chanting in the temple started, the little Taoist boy finished clearing the leftovers and returned to the pond.</p><p></p><p>Taking out a fishing rod from nowhere, she imitated Zhong Shentong's earlier actions and began fishing.</p><p></p><p>However, after a long time with no movement, she couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Darn it..." she couldn't give up and threw the rod again.</p><p></p><p>The result remained the same, with the fishing rod still empty at the tip.</p><p></p><p>The little Taoist boy finally accepted her fate and left the pond disheartened.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Ji Shaoli slowly revealed himself.</p><p></p><p>"Intriguing," he stared at the pond not far away with a mysterious expression.</p><p></p><p>After setting up an illusion around him, he carefully observed the small pond.</p><p></p><p>Under the exploration of his divine sense, it was indeed just an ordinary pond. It wasn't deep, no more than ten feet, and had a length and width of about three yards.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing in the pond except for some floating debris, with no fish living in it.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't just witnessed Zhong Shentong fishing out a green light cluster from the pond, Ji Shaoli would have almost been deceived.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't see any mysteries, Ji Shaoli directly flew into the water to try to discover the secret of the pond.</p><p></p><p>But... even after entering the water, there was no difference from an ordinary pond!</p><p></p><p>After returning to the shore, Ji Shaoli pondered for a moment and took out materials from his storage ring to make a fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>Imitating the actions of the master and disciple, he started fishing.</p><p></p><p>Sitting by the water, he focused all his attention.</p><p></p><p>He cast the line!</p><p></p><p>But there was no change.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli sat still for a long time, feeling that something was amiss, and then retracted the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>"This pond clearly has some secrets, but they can only be seen and not understood..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this pond only recognizes Zhong Shentong?"</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, the little Taoist boy wouldn't have tried.</p><p></p><p>"One who is sincere..."</p><p></p><p>"What does it truly mean to be sincere?"</p><p></p><p>Fishing was not unfamiliar to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Whether before he crossed over or during his time as a grand teacher in the Great Mystery.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he felt troubled, he would go fishing.</p><p></p><p>With the unwavering belief that he would not return until he had caught a fish.</p><p></p><p>However, ever since he began cultivation, he had never engaged in this relaxing activity again.</p><p></p><p>"Sincerity..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli seemed to have an insight.</p><p></p><p>This time, he sat by the pond once again.</p><p></p><p>Without pondering over unraveling the secrets of the pond this time.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to simply catch a fish!</p><p></p><p>"Exhale!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli solemnly cast the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the scene before him changed dramatically!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 842</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The same goes for the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, on the Haixuan Island, a few remaining members of the mutual aid association were preparing for seclusion and further studies, so there were no outsiders coming and going during this period. This was how they narrowly escaped calamity.</p><p></p><p>However, at this point, they had lost interest in studying. Jishao Li shut down the transmission array and activated the island's defense formation, completely cutting off contact with the outside world. They only kept track of external situations through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"It's all about timing and fate. Luckily, I chose to seclude myself here for further studies back then. The friends Zhang Mu and Sun Ying couldn't hold on any longer and perished."</p><p></p><p>"The other mutual aid members are also showing severe symptoms..." He Zhenghao said with a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Mu and Sun Ying were both members of the Congyun Mutual Aid Association. Out of the thirteen members of the association outside, two had already fallen. This showed the terrifying lethality of the Variant Immortal and Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>As well as the current plight of the Wanxian Alliance under the rampant spread of the Immortal and Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>"The other friends are also in danger and can't express themselves well."</p><p></p><p>"Although they are all brothers of the mutual aid association, seeing them like this is distressing. But letting them in is absolutely out of the question," Jishao Li said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"This Immortal and Mortal Miasma is treacherous and dangerous, and we haven't found a suitable way to deal with it yet. We are helpless as well," Jishao Li paused, looking towards the Haixuan Island with a mysterious expression.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Immortal and Mortal Miasma can spread through spiritual energy. I have completely sealed off the spiritual channels between the island and the outside world. Luckily, I have some spirit stones prepared on the island, so there should be no problem in the short term."</p><p></p><p>"But if you all want to cultivate, it's impossible. We can only barely maintain survival," Jishao Li turned back, looking at everyone with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Having a safe place to stay is already fortunate. As long as we can hold on until the Wanxian Alliance comes up with concrete measures to deal with it," all the cultivators sighed.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this Immortal and Mortal Miasma? It is said to exist in ordinary people's bodies, invisible and tasteless, without substance. How could it deceive the Wanxian Alliance and spread worldwide in such a short time?" After a moment of silence, He Zhenghao asked in puzzlement, a hint of worry flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>None of the people present, including Jishao Li, could answer. They fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>What exactly is the Immortal and Mortal Miasma?</p><p></p><p>Right now, Lifan also wanted to know the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>"Coughâ€¦ Are you two okay?" He squinted his eyes, looking at the energetic Tianyang and Lin Ling on his left and right, and asked somewhat unwillingly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, just say a few less words. Rest well," Tianyang advised worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine... cough..." Before he could finish speaking, Lifan burst into a violent cough. It seemed like his internal organs were about to shatter, all the contents coming out. Despite looking extremely unwell, Lifan was not worried in the least. Instead, he remained calm and carefully observed the changes happening in his body, which impressed Tianyang watching beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Shang Tiansi's condition seems lighter than mine, but it's still uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>Although his divine consciousness searched everywhere in his body, it couldn't find any trace of the culprit, the Immortal and Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>Lifan decisively gave up and began pondering.</p><p></p><p>"It has no substance, but it uses ordinary people, cultivators, and spiritual energy as its carriers."</p><p></p><p>"After surviving for thousands of years, it can still induce mutations."</p><p></p><p>"Is this Immortal and Mortal Miasma truly a product that defies the laws of nature?" Lifan pondered with a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he took out the communication talisman left by Yin Shangren and contacted him.</p><p></p><p>A short while later, Yin Shangren's voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Lifan fellow daoist, did you contact me because of the Immortal and Mortal Miasma?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough... Yin daoist, how come you're fine?" Lifan, looking at the energetic state of the other party, couldn't help but express surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I'm not like you guys. Perhaps it's because I have been in contact with the Immortal and Mortal Miasma for many years. I just felt unwell for a day or two, and immediately bounced back!" Yin Shangren said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lifan's gaze flickered, "Daoist, you really have good luck. I, on the other hand, am getting weaker and might not be able to escape this disaster..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't scare yourself, fellow daoist. Rest well, and you will recover," Yin Shangren said somewhat dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"Given that you have been infected for so long and can still speak normally, it means there is no major issue. The truly severe cases will be on the brink of death within three to five days," Yin Shangren explained professionally.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take your auspicious words," Lifan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Yin Shangren hesitated before saying, "The Immortal and Mortal Miasma is probably a product of cultivators defying the laws of nature."</p><p></p><p>"It can kill immortals even when used by mortals."</p><p></p><p>"Ignore strength and weakness."</p><p></p><p>Lifan was puzzled, "If that's the case, how can this mutated Immortal and Mortal Miasma come about after defying the laws of nature?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren shook his head, "The change is only in the external form. Where has the defied law changed?"</p><p></p><p>"But perhaps the proportion of cultivators to mortals now compared to ancient times is higher. Therefore, the Immortal and Mortal Miasma's lethality is greater than before."</p><p></p><p>Lifan contemplated the meaning behind Yin Shangren's words.</p><p></p><p>A sudden thought flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Yin, according to what you've said, the emergence of this Immortal and Mortal Miasma is to protect ordinary people and suppress cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Immortal and Mortal Miasma is resurfacing and mutations are occurring, does that not mean that the eternal Taizi who defies this law is still in the world?"</p><p></p><p>"Why have we never heard of the name of this Taizi?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Yin Shangren hesitantly replied, "I already have some thoughts on this matter."</p><p></p><p>"However, I can't confirm yet."</p><p></p><p>"But I am certain that if we can know the identity of this Taizi, we will be one step closer to uncovering the secret of the Immortal and Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's voice sounded somewhat elusive.</p><p></p><p>Lifan slightly narrowed his eyes but did not pursue further questions.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he turned to inquire about Yin Shangren's views on the specific direction of the Immortal and Mortal Miasma pandemic.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoist, there is no need to worry. The Wanxian Alliance has certain experience in dealing with the Immortal and Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>"At present, the situation seems a bit passive because a way to control the mutated Immortal and Mortal Miasma has not been found yet."</p><p></p><p>"But it should be resolved soon."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the method is appropriate, the conclusion of the Immortal and Mortal Miasma will surely be the same as thousands of years ago, disappearing once again."</p><p></p><p>"It will only exist inside ordinary people as a kind of deterrent," Yin Shangren said with a somber tone.</p><p></p><p>His words seemed to conceal some special emotions.</p>

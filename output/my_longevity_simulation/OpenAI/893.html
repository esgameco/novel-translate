        <h1>Chapter 893</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This seemingly plain black sword must have its extraordinary attributes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense swept over it slowly, but no matter how he looked at it, it appeared to be an ordinary iron sword.</p><p></p><p>As if he could easily break it with just one hand.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the wooden sword lost its spirituality and the other remaining swords looked around in confusion, the black sword itself was undergoing subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>"Like refining with fire slowly, removing impurities while keeping the essence. It may look plain, but in reality, it is as simple as the wooden sword, where all things return to one, and the path leads to simplicity." Slowly, Li Fan began to see the intricacies within it.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the Wood Sword's plan to create another body for itself?" A sudden thought emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"While the other remaining swords may take a long time to transform into complete conceptual beings, this black sword, thanks to the Wood Sword's plan, is not far from completing its transformation."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, this might be one of the reasons why the Wood Sword was willing to part ways with Shuo Feng." Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this still unformed black sword, Li Fan temporarily dismissed the idea of taking it.</p><p></p><p>"There's probably still a dozen or so years left..."</p><p></p><p>"This can also be considered a fruit borne from the Wood Sword's plan. If I can take it, the Lingmu Realm's Heavenly Sword Sect would be firmly established."</p><p></p><p>Although it is currently unclear why the Wood Sword acted in such a manner.</p><p></p><p>But that does not hinder Li Fan from making the most of it.</p><p></p><p>Returning to his original location, he stayed in the sword tomb for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>After not being able to gain any new insights from the wooden sword, Li Fan finally left reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>Before parting, Li Fan did not forget to use a secret technique to hide the sword tomb and leave his mark.</p><p></p><p>As soon as someone else intruded, he would immediately sense it.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Heavenly Sword Sect matter is settled, next is the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>The location of the Medicine King Sect's remnants is not a secret.</p><p></p><p>Located within the Six Strings Province, in a remote mountainous area.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, it had already been thoroughly searched by cultivators, leaving behind only worthless debris scattered around.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan arrived at this place, within a radius of a hundred miles, he could not find another living soul.</p><p></p><p>The air was filled with a faint foul smell, making one disgusted.</p><p></p><p>"The Medicine King Sect truly knows how to make a move, preparing to escape entirely with their entire sect. They even left behind such a nauseating toxin to ensure that their old territory would not be occupied by others." Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This special stench was left by the Medicine King Sect in the past.</p><p></p><p>Almost melding with the earth here, lingering for thousands of years without dissipating.</p><p></p><p>If not dispersed, no one would want to live in such a place filled with foul odors.</p><p></p><p>Though the Medicine King Sect's method was somewhat repulsive, it was indeed effective.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the relatively well-preserved remnants of the sect's buildings and, following Jiao Xiuyuan's instructions on the location, arrived at an abandoned workshop.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the foul smell, he activated his spiritual power and dug out several small Medicine King Cauldrons buried underground.</p><p></p><p>"There are actually thirty-six cauldrons?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Although he had entrusted Jiao Xiuyuan to help excavate the small Medicine King Cauldrons before, the latter had adamantly claimed there were only twenty-something.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, oh Friend Jiao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and made a note of this matter.</p><p></p><p>He then conducted a thorough search as usual.</p><p></p><p>Aside from these old cauldrons, there were indeed no other valuable items left by the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then headed straight to the Purple Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli suddenly felt a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>"Weird, I've made more than enough preparations. Even if a fellow Daoist were to approach, I should be able to retreat confidently."</p><p></p><p>"Where is this sense of danger coming from?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, who always trusted his own premonitions, suddenly stood up with a deep expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>The unease was escalating.</p><p></p><p>His heart was beating wildly, as if facing a great disaster!</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli knew something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>After checking the teleportation array on the island, he discovered that it had indeed been blocked and could not be activated!</p><p></p><p>"Trying to capture a turtle in a jar?"</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Ji Shaoli's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was surprised, Ji Shaoli attempted to use the teleportation formation, only to find it ineffective.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like something had sealed off the entire space around Haixuan Island!</p><p></p><p>Although Ji Shaoli was shocked, he did not panic.</p><p></p><p>Gripping a dried branch and feeling the flow of the earth veins beneath his feet, he was not restricted.</p><p></p><p>Slightly relieved, he loosened his grip.</p><p></p><p>After a period of growth, Lin Ling, who had been spending her days with Dao Tong Liuli, had also made considerable progress in strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to her increasing spiritual power, her relationship with the ancient tree of earth veins had improved.</p><p></p><p>By obtaining this dried branch from the ancient tree of earth veins, any wielder could traverse the earth veins with its assistance.</p><p></p><p>Despite having a means of escape, Ji Shaoli did not leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see who was trying to harm him.</p><p></p><p>The one who had closed off the two-way teleportation array of Wanxian Island, rendering all his efforts with significant contributions useless...</p><p></p><p>Everything indicated the strength of the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Something only a prominent local figure like the Xiang family could achieve.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was not afraid of being caught off guard; all he needed was to understand the reason behind the failure.</p><p></p><p>Humming a tune, he brewed two cups of spirit tea.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli patiently awaited his guest.</p><p></p><p>The members of the mutual assistance association on Haixuan Island had already been sent away by him using some excuse.</p><p></p><p>He also informed Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi about the specific information regarding the two unique items. It was up to them to make use of it.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli didn't have to wait long.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a young man's figure appeared next to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>What startled Ji Shaoli was that the young man appeared without any aura fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>As if he had always been by Ji Shaoli's side.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more shocked was...</p><p></p><p>The young man in front of him was someone he had seen before!</p><p></p><p>"The Law Transmitter?!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli blurted out.</p><p></p><p>It was the fellow whom Li Fan, during the scene of taking the Longevity Fruit in the Meteor Immortal Realm, had seen spreading new techniques as one of the members of the initial Wanxian Alliance whom he had Soul Searched!</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The young man was also somewhat surprised by Ji Shaoli addressing him by his identity as soon as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>The young man's gaze was sharp as he stared at Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Ji Shaoli suddenly felt his thoughts and body completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>The escape method he had prepared beforehand also lost its effectiveness!</p><p></p><p>It was as if his soul was being drawn out, and an indistinct figure began to appear on Ji Shaoli's body.</p><p></p><p>Just at that moment...</p><p></p><p>Two colorful lights suddenly burst forth and surged towards the young man.</p><p></p><p>However, as the lights got closer to the young man, he caught them between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Not an inch could advance further.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..." The young man looked at the iridescent divine light in his hand, showing a hint of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>He then suppressed and put it away with a flip of his hand.</p>

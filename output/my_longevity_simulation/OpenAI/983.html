        <h1>Chapter 983</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>She stood in front of a celestial furnace with wide eyes full of curiosity at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the [Seven-Colored Jade Illusionary Radiance], it's a world-class golden light. This little thing is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"It looks harmless like a human or animal, even I almost overlooked it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could naturally tell if Lin Ling was lying.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, it seemed like a pair of invisible hands had sprung up in the Spirit Wood Realm. In an instant, he captured the Daoist Luli, bringing him in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Luli's vision blurred as the scenery changed suddenly.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Li Fan's face, a hint of panic flashed in Luli's eyes. She tried to say something, her lips moving up and down, but no sound came out.</p><p></p><p>"According to what Zhong Shentong said earlier, when you were just fished out of the Fishing Pond, you were just a transparent fruit similar to Luli."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to radiate golden light, this fruit of yours must be quite a tonic."</p><p></p><p>Without asking any questions, Li Fan unexpectedly began to perform a series of hand gestures, setting up a formation resembling a pill furnace around Luli.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the intense heat around him, Daoist Luli's face turned pale. Waving her pale arms, she desperately tried to explain something.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan paid no attention, seemingly intending to refine Luli on the spot and eat her directly.</p><p></p><p>The immense pressure around quickly rendered Luli immobile. It was as if she was bound tightly by invisible ropes, floating in the air stiffly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the defenseless Daoist Luli, Li Fan narrowed his eyes and continued to enhance the output of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Within the pill furnace formation, nine crimson fire dragons emerged, roaring and spewing dazzling flames towards the bound Luli.</p><p></p><p>Behind Li Fan, watching this scene, Lin Ling shuddered uncontrollably, feeling a chill in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't imagined that the master would want to roast Luli without a second thought or even a single question!</p><p></p><p>Such decisive ruthlessness made her realize that if the master really wanted to kill her, there would be no hesitation at all.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Lin Ling didn't dare to have any rebellious thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, contrary to Lin Ling's expectations, Luli did not dissipate into the flames as imagined.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, bursts of dark golden light erupted from her body, repelling the flames.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Li Fan manipulated the formation, he couldn't break through the protection of the dark golden light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted lightly and continued to manipulate the spiritual energy around, constantly generating melting fire to roast Luli.</p><p></p><p>He didn't actually intend to kill Luli but was using this gradual method to force her true form out.</p><p></p><p>The forces within the melting formation continued to clash and resist.</p><p></p><p>The release of the dark golden light seemed to pose a higher burden on Luli. Her eyes slowly closed, and her body curled up gradually, reminiscent of a sleeping infant.</p><p></p><p>However, the dark golden light around her became more stable.</p><p></p><p>Next to Daoist Luli, a six-petal lotus pattern emerged!</p><p></p><p>Once it formed, the flames spewed by the nine fire dragons could no longer harm her. They were easily blocked by the lotus pattern, which remained unshaken by the flames.</p><p></p><p>"What is this…"</p><p></p><p>Within the Mysterious Yellow Realm, there seemed to be nothing similar. Even the [Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture] did not mention such a thing.</p><p></p><p>It should be an object from another cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>"The six petals should only be its juvenile state." Observing the lotus pattern of Luli in the flames, Li Fan suddenly felt something.</p><p></p><p>Having achieved his goal, Li Fan retracted his divine power.</p><p></p><p>The nine fire dragons disappeared instantly, but Daoist Luli remained bound.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and thundered, echoing in the space: "Do you think that with this broken lotus protecting you, I can't harm you?"</p><p></p><p>"That's underestimating us cultivators of the Mysterious Yellow Realm too much!"</p><p></p><p>Saying so, Li Fan unleashed a rainbow-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in the divine light was a small gray mold.</p><p></p><p>During the initial split growth, there were two pieces of gray mold. The larger piece had been used to deal with Zhong Yong, leaving this smaller piece. Although smaller, the gray mold's erosion ability on the world had not weakened. At the moment of its appearance, even with the rainbow divine light around it, Luli's lotus flower felt extreme danger!</p><p></p><p>Luli trembled uncontrollably, and the six petals of her lotus flower, protecting her, also moved constantly with dark golden light.</p><p></p><p>An instant later, it seemed as if a new petal was about to emerge.</p><p></p><p>The rainbow divine light was about to collide with Luli's lotus flower, and the gray mold was about to be released.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a cold female voice suddenly sounded in Li Fan's mind: "Wait!"</p><p></p><p>The rainbow divine light instantly halted.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect that this world would also be affected by the [Mo] Character… "</p><p></p><p>"[Mo] Character… " Li Fan's heart stirred but he remained composed on the surface. "Please come out, Dao Friend!"</p><p></p><p>The cold female voice no longer concealed, and the lotus flower of Luli slowly bloomed as an illusory dark golden figure appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although the figure's appearance was unclear due to the golden light, the aura she emitted, akin to that of an emperor, somewhat revealed her identity.</p><p></p><p>"I've met Dao Friend from the Mysterious Yellow Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Friend sneaking into our Mysterious Yellow Realm seems suspicious." Li Fan scrutinized the golden figure, finding it hard to determine her strength for a while.</p><p></p><p>Being without a human body and existing in energy form, according to common sense, she should have been seriously injured and forced to do so. But Li Fan did not sense any weakness from the golden figure; instead, he felt infinite vitality.</p><p></p><p>Apologetically, the golden light spoke: "I didn't intentionally hide it; it's just beyond my control."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could inquire, she continued, explaining: "Any cultivation realm that survived in the Abyssal Star Sea is inherently hostile to outsiders. In my current state, if I were to reveal my identity upfront, I'm afraid I wouldn't survive for long."</p><p></p><p>"The Abyssal Star Sea?" Li Fan's head tilted as he asked tactfully.</p><p></p><p>"It's a collective term for all the star regions influenced by the [Immortal Ruins]."</p><p></p><p>Realizing something, the golden light quickly added: "Each cultivation realm has different names for it…"</p><p></p><p>"I see. We cultivators of the Mysterious Yellow Realm refer to it as the [Dark Abyssal Sea]." Li Fan interjected timely.</p><p></p><p>"Dark Abyssal…" The golden light fell silent for a moment, sighing softly. "Not bad, the name fits well."</p>

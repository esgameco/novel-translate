        <div class="content">
            <p>"Even if we cultivators do nothing, this celestial and mortal miasma will never wipe out cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"At most, it will reduce the overall number of cultivators to a certain level. It can be said that there is both killing intent and compassion."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Yin Shangren ended this communication with these words.</p><p></p><p>*Cough.*</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, after some contemplation, inquired about the situation of ordinary people during the outbreak of this mutated celestial and mortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because ordinary people in the world still carry the celestial and mortal miasma within them.</p><p></p><p>This disaster can be considered a terrifying calamity for cultivators, but its impact on ordinary people is limited.</p><p></p><p>Even the casualties are not as high as a common flu.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, nowadays these ordinary people are also considered the people under the governance of the Immortal Alliance. Otherwise, it is unsure if a situation similar to the ancient times, where cultivators slaughtered ordinary people on the brink of despair, would reoccur."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, how will the Immortal Alliance handle this situation. Will this mutated celestial and mortal miasma be absorbed by ordinary people again, unexpellable, leading to another great migration?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Although his body was in danger, it did not affect the agility of his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that, for ordinary people, this celestial and mortal miasma is actually akin to a protective talisman. It's just that, if one insists on seeking immortality and embarks on the path, they have reached the opposite of ordinary people and must discard this protective talisman."</p><p></p><p>"Can immortality and mortality coexist..."</p><p></p><p>In the current Xuanhuang Realm, the conventional methods for purging miasma from the body still consist of only two methods. [Find more content through: new69shuxiacom]</p><p></p><p>The "Purifying Spirit Pool" invented by the Celestial Lord of the East Pole.</p><p></p><p>And the Xuanhuang Clearing Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>These two methods are only applicable to purging the inherent miasma of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators infected after birth, they are useless.</p><p></p><p>"Although both named celestial and mortal miasma, their manifested forms are different."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he gave up his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave the professional matters to the professionals."</p><p></p><p>"This current widespread of the celestial and mortal miasma is believed to be beneficial for Yin Shangren's research. It should help uncover the secrets of the celestial and mortal miasma sooner than expected."</p><p></p><p>"No rush, let's just wait."</p><p></p><p>With the region currently under blockade and cultivators all feeling insecure, everything has come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the opportunity during this time to focus on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Devouring the Five Elements Great Cave and re-entering the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p></p><p>Even without the feedback cultivation from the "Sitting Immortal Technique," solely relying on his own cultivation, Li Fan advanced faster compared to the time when he started from scratch.</p><p></p><p>With abundant resources, Li Fan's cultivation progressed steadily every day, although not by leaps and bounds, he made progress.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from reaching the Golden Core Perfection.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's determination to cultivate even with an illness deeply moved Lin Ling, Tian Yang, and Shang Tian Ci within the Spirit Wood Realm. [Find more content through: new69shuxiashuxicom]</p><p></p><p>They were all deeply touched.</p><p></p><p>Reducing their daily leisure time, they became more diligent.</p><p></p><p>After half a year since the outbreak of the mutated celestial and mortal miasma, things finally took a turn.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance invented a highly effective elixir that greatly alleviated the symptoms of illness when consumed by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even those cultivators who had not been infected yet took it in advance. While it didn't provide complete immunity to the celestial and mortal miasma, it significantly reduced the probability of cultivators falling due to illness.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a genuine divine medicine.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Immortal Alliance was unusually generous this time.</p><p></p><p>Not only were all Immortal Alliance cultivators able to receive it for free, but even the wandering cultivators not affiliated with the Immortal Alliance were also given this treatment.</p><p></p><p>For a while, cultivators were grateful and appreciative of the Immortal Alliance's generosity.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators who previously held biases against the Immortal Alliance chose to join after receiving treatment.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivators gradually recovered with the help of the special elixir, the Immortal Alliance sent out cultivators to purify the land once again, dispersing the celestial and mortal miasma that had spread far and wide.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan, who had already recovered, squinted at the so-called "special elixir" in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He had already consumed one before.</p><p></p><p>Aside from experiencing mild symptoms of being infected by the celestial and mortal miasma again, he felt an inexplicable comfort as if his soul was soaking in a warm spring.</p><p></p><p>"Ascension Pill of the Mind?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was somewhat peculiar.</p><p></p><p>During the 115th generation, he had taken this kind of elixir that was banned by the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although it had been weakened significantly, the sensation of taking this special elixir was not much different from that of the Ascension Pill of the Mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was the Patriarch of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although not well-versed in pharmacology, Li Fan could discern the effective method of this special elixir.</p><p></p><p>Which was to accelerate the outbreak of the celestial and mortal miasma in the cultivator's body, while simultaneously suppressing the pain caused by the infection with a powerful sense of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Immortal Alliance has a rule that each cultivator can only take one pill at most."</p><p></p><p>"If one takes too many, it's really hard to predict the outcome."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully screened his own thoughts, while looking at the elixir in his hand again.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that he did not have a strong desire to consume it again, he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Just one pill won't hurt."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the number of cultivator deaths may have increased."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance clearly resorted to emergency measures, which they had to take under duress."</p><p></p><p>"However, being able to stabilize the situation first can be considered a good approach."</p><p></p><p>Crushing the special elixir in his hand, Li Fan closed his eyes, his spiritual consciousness enveloping the Five Elements Great Cave below.</p><p></p><p>After half a year of arduous cultivation, he was on the brink of reaching Golden Core Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Just one step away and he could embark on the path of devouring the cave.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Heavenly Calamity would not appear again!</p><p></p><p>Just need to wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Great Cave is vast, and it will take at least two to three years."</p><p></p><p>"With Tian Yang and Lin Ling taking care of the matters of the World Union, it won't fall into a stalemate."</p><p></p><p>One year after the outbreak of the mutated celestial and mortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators have grown accustomed to its presence.</p><p></p><p>After all, almost all cultivators had been through one round of infection.</p><p></p><p>Those who couldn't bear it have already perished.</p><p></p><p>The rest had developed sufficient immunity.</p><p></p><p>Although there were occasional cases of cultivators being reinfected, they were few in number and did not affect the overall situation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the second batch of special elixirs by the Immortal Alliance had been successfully developed and distributed to various cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the celestial and mortal miasma gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Thundercloud Sea, Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>"It feels like a whole new world!"</p><p></p><p>After a year of being closed off, the island reopened.</p><p></p><p>Having taken two rounds of the special elixir, the effects of the celestial and mortal miasma had already dissipated within half a day.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and others breathed in the fresh spiritual energy, all couldn't help but sigh.</p>

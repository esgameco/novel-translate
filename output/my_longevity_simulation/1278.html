            <p>Chapter 1274: Heavenly Venerable's Earthly Soul</p><p></p><p>"Since I can't let the Myriad Immortal Alliance notice my plan, I can only steal a little bit of time each time... Originally, I would need a long time to accumulate enough, but now..." </p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue looked at Li Fan, "Your method has been a great help!"</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan said, "Forty years is still too long. Moreover, in order to avoid any flaws, while you are in slumber, you must allocate a small portion of your power to deal with the supervision of the Dharma Protector Hall. Is there any way to further shorten the required time?"</p><p></p><p>"You really want to help me?" Yan Fa Jue seemed a bit shocked.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Li Fan's very serious expression, after pondering for a moment, Yan Fa Jue flew to his side, leaned close to his ear and said, "As I said before, for me, the extrapolation technique is equivalent to cultivation. The reason I need to sleep for fifty years to grow is because I need to sort out and absorb the gains from cultivation. If there is a way to skip this step, I'm afraid I would only need to rest for five years... no, ten years should be enough!"</p><p></p><p>"I vaguely remember that there is a treasure in the world called [Immortal Sound Jade Dew]. If I could eat some more of it..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue was almost drooling from the corners of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Sound Jade Dew?" Li Fan frowned slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure this is something from the Xuan Huang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had reincarnated through a hundred lifetimes and possessed the Heavenly Profound Mirror origin, grasping the Creation Stone Tablet. It could be said that among the spiritual treasures within the Xuan Huang Realm, there was almost nothing he didn't know about.</p><p></p><p>But this Immortal Sound Jade Dew was indeed the first time he had heard of it.</p><p></p><p>"Uh... I don't know." Yan Fa Jue was a bit dazed upon hearing Li Fan say this.</p><p></p><p>"But I can be sure that the Immortal Sound Jade Dew really exists in the world." The little loli said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>After remaining silent for a while, Li Fan replied, "I will find a way."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yan Fa Jue's eyes instantly widened, and she couldn't help but say, "You are really a good person!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said, "Aren't you afraid that I am from the Myriad Immortal Alliance, and all that I've said is to deceive you..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue chuckled, "This young lady is not stupid. You are different from the people of the Dharma Transmission. Besides, I can tell at a glance who has ill intentions and who is sincere!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and did not refute.</p><p></p><p>"Then you should rest well for now. If I have any news, I will contact you again."</p><p></p><p>The light and shadows twisted, and the simulated personality restored its original form, replacing Yan Fa Jue's work tirelessly.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while to ensure there would be no mistakes, Yan Fa Jue happily lay spread-eagled again, floating in the air and falling into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Fa Jue's original body, even if not from the immortal realm, must be from a special cultivation realm similar to the Xuan Huang Realm, with a protective realm array."</p><p></p><p>"With her current abilities, her help to me is no longer significant. But if she can take a step further and extrapolate immortal techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already tasted the sweetness brought by the array path crushing several generations. If the same could be done with techniques, future actions would definitely be more convenient.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue's intuition was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the current Li Fan had no ill intentions towards Yan Fa Jue. He was just planning to help her break free from the control of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. In this process, using the excuse of successfully escaping, he would let Yan Fa Jue acknowledge him as her master.</p><p></p><p>After the end of this lifetime, he should be able to choose to retain Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>In this way, an unprecedented situation would occur in the Xuan Huang Realm - the existence of two identical Heavenly Wonders.</p><p></p><p>And with a few more decades of experience with Yan Fa, the Yan Fa Jue retained by Li Fan should be the slightly stronger one between the two.</p><p></p><p>A perfect plan.</p><p></p><p>The premise was to successfully have Yan Fa Jue acknowledge him as her master.</p><p></p><p>Before that, it was harmless to indulge her a little.</p><p></p><p>Even if this goal was not achieved in this lifetime, relying on the experience of spending hundreds of years with her and the secrets drawn out, it would not be difficult to have Yan Fa Jue acknowledge him as her master in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the Separation Disk and Yan Fa Jue are both tools. To truly comprehend the Dao and find a way to transcend, I still have to rely on myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was clear as a mirror.</p><p></p><p>Before finding a way to break free from the shackles of the Dharma Transmission cultivation system, he might as well continue walking down the path ahead. After all, with the advantage of endless reincarnation and rebirth, step-by-step cultivation was much easier compared to starting from scratch and creating a new world.</p><p></p><p>"When the Xuan Huang Realm undergoes changes, it will be the earthly soul of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even if I devour hundreds of earthly souls of the Dao, I may not necessarily have a qualitative increase in strength. After all, during the changes that will destroy the Xuan Huang Realm, each of those changes seeking survival may not be inferior to the earthly souls of the Dao in the current peaceful Xuan Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"In this lifetime, use the Holy Emperor to probe the true strength of the Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Doctor. In the next lifetime, strive to shorten the gap between us through taking this step. Even achieve parity!"</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on ordinary earthly souls of the Dao is definitely not enough."</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the close connection between the Holy Emperor and the Xuan Huang Dao in this lifetime, Li Fan was able to learn more secrets of the Dao. The earthly souls of the Dao, born from assuming heavenly duties, were the manifestation of the laws of the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Flame and Ink Slaughter were all earthly souls of the Dao with single attributes.</p><p></p><p>And under extremely special circumstances, the Xuan Huang Realm would spontaneously derive [compound attribute] earthly souls of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The [Heavenly Dao White] that Li Fan had given birth to through the Holy Fetus in a coincidental opportunity was among them.</p><p></p><p>Mr. White, as the Great Heavenly Venerable of Xuan Huang, although fallen, still left an indestructible mark in heaven and earth. The Heavenly Dao White was a compound earthly soul of the Dao of Xuan Huang, using this mark as a vessel to be born into the world.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao White inherited the characteristics of the Great Heavenly Venerable of Xuan Huang's mark, and itself possessed the characteristics of an earthly soul of the Dao. Therefore, it could integrate the powers of many earthly souls of the Dao with a wave of its hand, achieving [unity of heaven and man].</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao White in this state was undoubtedly strong.</p><p></p><p>With one glance, the Dharma Transmission could instantly level a state to the ground. But the Heavenly Dao White could block the Dharma Transmission outside for a moment, showing its strength.</p><p></p><p>If used as a material when advancing to the Unified Dao stage, it would definitely greatly increase one's combat power.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Just this one was not enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vaguely understood that the same earthly souls of the Dao might not have the same effect in the new Dharma cultivation. But the Xuan Huang Realm had more than one Great Heavenly Venerable of Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Mr. White was the last generation Great Heavenly Venerable of Xuan Huang, the closest to the current era, and the easiest to "summon".</p><p></p><p>"If all the past Great Heavenly Venerables of Xuan Huang could be summoned in the form of earthly souls of the Dao and materialized as my nourishment for advancing to the Unified Dao stage..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, it's already the limit for the Xuanhuang Realm to support the Heaven and Earth Spirit of a Great Celestial Venerate. The scenario I envision is theoretically impossible to achieve."</p><p></p><p>"But I have Huan Zhen's existence. Every reincarnation, summon a Great Celestial Venerate's Heaven and Earth Spirit, and find a way to seal and preserve it. When all are gathered, refine and swallow them simultaneously."</p><p></p><p>The Huadao Stone's flowing light circulated, and the possible future scenes kept evolving in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Feasible."</p><p></p><p>"But it must be done gradually."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to seeking a breakthrough in the hidden Starry Sea, this method is more reliable. The two can be done in parallel."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, the Holy Emperor of this lifetime, in a sense, can also be considered half a Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate. If he falls, I wonder if he can leave a mark between heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's true self was scheming for the future in the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor of the Great Enlightenment finally found traces of the possibly hidden Xuantian Sect's Dharma King in the clues recorded on the Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>"When the Xuantian King was around, the disciples of the Xuantian Sect were all shrouded in a mysterious power that influenced and distorted the records of the Creation Stone Tablet. But when the Xuantian King disappeared, this shroud did not directly dissipate. This is also one of the reasons why the Ten Immortal Sects were always on high alert against the Xuantian Sect back then, fearing it would rise from the ashes."</p><p></p><p>"However, as time passed, especially after the great tribulation of 'Dharma Cannot Be Jointly Cultivated' descended, this shrouding power seemed to be affected by something and eventually faded away."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping arrived outside the ruins of the Purple Dawn Sect.</p><p></p><p>His gaze penetrated layers of obstruction and reached below the ground.</p><p></p><p>He saw a figure sleeping there.</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect's Dharma King, Mo Rubin."</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor recalled Mo Rubin's deeds before he was persuaded by the Xuantian King to join the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was the most outstanding disciple of the ancient immortal sect Nine Refinement Observatory in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The absolute genius most likely to ascend to immortality.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Refinement Observatory's techniques were known in the ancient Xuanhuang Realm for their unique and strange methods.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Mo Rubin had already completed the refinement of the first eight Immortal Souls. He was only one step away from successfully forming the last Immortal Soul.</p><p></p><p>But at this critical moment, he suddenly saw the scene of Xuanyuan Hong breaking through the tribulation and ascending.</p><p></p><p>His Dao heart was greatly shaken, and the ninth Immortal Soul was damaged.</p><p></p><p>After finally calming down and repairing the Immortal Soul, he learned the news that the Xuantian King, who had already successfully ascended, had unexpectedly returned to the mortal realm again.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm suffered a great tribulation, the Immortal Path was no longer visible, and there was no more possibility of ascension.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin could no longer maintain his Dao heart. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and the ninth Immortal Soul directly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The previous eight Immortal Souls were also damaged to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the injuries to Mo Rubin's Immortal Souls showed a trend of continuously worsening over time.</p><p></p><p>Because the Immortal Path was severed, Mo Rubin, who had always taken ascending to immortality as his goal, completely lost the motivation to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The former genius fell into a slump. Even the persuasion of his sect elders was useless.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's will was depressed, and he became more and more dispirited.</p><p></p><p>Until the Xuantian King, Xuanyuan Hong, stood in front of Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene gradually became blurry, and his thoughts returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor did not directly wake up Mo Rubin but carefully observed first.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of the technique seems to be no longer the Nine Transformations Immortal Soul. It should be a technique the Xuantian King brought down from the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I don't feel that he has suffered very serious injuries. Rather than healing, it's more like..."</p><p></p><p>"Waiting?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered. With a light wave, a slight energy fluctuation without any hostility, like a breeze, penetrated the space and reached where Mo Rubin was resting.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's eyelids twitched slightly, about to be startled awake from his slumber.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" At this moment, Li Ping seemed to have noticed something, and his waving arm suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding calmness caused Mo Rubin to fall into deep sleep again.</p><p></p><p>But unlike before, Mo Rubin inadvertently changed his posture. Along with it, his expression and demeanor also changed.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor stared for a while and vaguely saw some clues.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Nine Refinement Observatory's [Nine Transformations Immortal Soul] was dreaded by the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm at that time was that every time an Immortal Soul was cultivated, it started from scratch with a brand new consciousness. And only when the experiences the Immortal Soul went through differed from the previously condensed Immortal Souls to a certain extent could the Immortal Soul be successfully refined.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the later it got, the more difficult the cultivation became. Some Nine Refinement Observatory cultivators even deliberately committed many extreme crimes in order to create a suitable cultivation environment for successfully refining Immortal Souls.</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, Mo Rubin relied only on his own comprehension to almost successfully refine nine Immortal Souls, which can indeed be called an extraordinary genius. What a pity..." The Faceless Holy Emperor shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Since he knew about Mo Rubin's characteristics, the Holy Emperor naturally became more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Such an existence similar to a madman might always appear calm on the surface. But it was very likely that in the blink of an eye, he would make a decision completely different from before.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor continued to emit slight energy fluctuations, slowly waking up Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't perceive which of Mo Rubin's eyes had opened.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping was certain that when Mo Rubin said this sentence, he had been observing himself for some time.</p><p></p><p>"The aura on your body feels a bit familiar. That's why I didn't take action directly," Mo Rubin continued.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping keenly noticed that a crack like a mirror had silently formed between the two of them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Ping's figure suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only his voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened in the battle that wiped out the Xuantian Sect back then?"</p><p></p><p>"And is the Xuantian King really dead or not?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin retracted his little trick and showed an interested expression: "I do know some things. But why should I tell you?!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, his face instantly darkened: "Want to deal with Brother Xuanyuan? You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The sky above the Purple Dawn Sect seemed to suddenly become gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Pieces of mirror surfaces appeared, sealing the space.</p><p></p><p>"Face your inner self! Let me see, what makes you similar to Brother Xuanyuan!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin spoke seemingly nonsensical words.</p><p></p><p>And in the reflection of countless mirror surfaces, the hidden figure of the Faceless Holy Emperor slowly appeared.</p>

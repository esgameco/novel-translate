        <h1>Chapter 885</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of light flashed in his mind, and moments later, the Ultimate Dissociation Disc, radiating with a brilliant white light, appeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Not much time had passed since Li Fan last sliced off a piece from it.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Dissociation Disc seemed to have not yet fully recovered its vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Initially, the nine discs competed for supremacy, and then merged into one."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, this Ultimate Dissociation Disc can be divided into a maximum of nine pieces again."</p><p></p><p>"The ability to break through formations through deduction will not be affected, but the ability value will be fixed at the moment of division."</p><p></p><p>"However, from now on, the speed of evolution through its own deduction will be much slower."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter, as long as the deduction results of the mother Dissociation Disc are synchronized over every once in a while."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts flashed, and then his finger, like an iron sword, struck down fiercely on the Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Dissociation Disc trembled slightly and a thin slice of the subordinate disc was cut off.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the increasingly weakened mother disc, Li Fan held the subordinate Dissociation Disc in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Then, tens of thousands of blood threads once again extended from his body, flying to various parts of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>This strange scene instantly attracted the attention of all living beings in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the tree people races did not dare to look directly, and immediately lowered their heads.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators like Tian Yang and Shang Tianci curiously observed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood threads, like brushes, used the already prepared formation materials as paint.</p><p></p><p>On the land of the Lingmu Realm, they began to engrave a vast formation.</p><p></p><p>Originally, for an ordinary Yuanyuan-stage formation master, it would take at least several years to barely complete the layout of this realm-covering grand formation.</p><p></p><p>But with the support of the powerful computing power of the Dao Stone in his mind, Li Fan blossomed in multiple places.</p><p></p><p>One person took on the simultaneous formation layout equivalent to hundreds of formation masters.</p><p></p><p>At a visible speed, a large-scale formation gradually took shape on the land of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Formations can be laid out like this too?"</p><p></p><p>This made even the cultivators who didn't understand formations gape in disbelief, staring at this scene in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The formation Li Fan was engraving on the Lingmu Realm at this time was a brand-new formation created by Li Fan himself, which had never appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm before.</p><p></p><p>The core referenced the essentials of top-level grand formations such as the Wanli Shanhe, Tianyuan Huasheng, and Tianxuan Suoling.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan wanted to incorporate the essence of reversing life and death into it as well.</p><p></p><p>But when he thought about it in his mind, an inexplicable sense of crisis suddenly surged in his heart, so he decisively gave up.</p><p></p><p>In just seven days, the core foundation formation had already taken shape.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tossed out the subordinate Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>"With the Ultimate Dissociation Disc as the formation core, it can not only achieve complete surveillance and control over the Lingmu Realm like the Tianxuan Suoling."</p><p></p><p>"It can also use the Infinite Method to endlessly strengthen the protective formation."</p><p></p><p>"Until it becomes impregnable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>As the Dissociation Disc entered the formation, the speed of formation completion on the land of the Lingmu Realm instantly increased by thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>If before it was like a child's hand-drawing, now it was like printer printing.</p><p></p><p>Before the onlookers could react, the land of the Lingmu Realm rumbled and trembled.</p><p></p><p>The light erupting from the ground reached the sky.</p><p></p><p>Under the dazzling radiance, all living beings in the small world were forced to close their eyes.</p><p></p><p>When they...</p><p></p><p>When they opened their eyes again, all the strange phenomena had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>However, the Lingmu Realm at this moment was completely different from before.</p><p></p><p>Those with weaker cultivation levels were fine, unable to perceive anything.</p><p></p><p>But a Hedao realm cultivator like Tian Yang couldn't help but suspiciously survey the surroundings and the sky.</p><p></p><p>It felt like countless eyes were staring at him intently, making him feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan's loud laughter that attracted Tian Yang's attention.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already retracted the countless blood threads from his body and landed in front of the ninety-nine zhang tall gate tower of the Wanjie Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Using his hand as a brush, he flamboyantly carved the four large characters "Wanjie Alliance" under the black jade plaque!</p><p></p><p>His strokes were vigorous and completed in one go!</p><p></p><p>The moment he lifted his brush, the Lingmu Realm also responded, emitting slight continuous tremors.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully examined his own calligraphy, his pride and satisfaction evident in his expression.</p><p></p><p>In the sky of the Lingmu Realm, for some unknown reason, a projection of the four characters "Wanjie Alliance" appeared.</p><p></p><p>The tree people, under the leadership of their matriarch, all kowtowed and worshipped.</p><p></p><p>And all the cultivators also fell to the ground, looking up at the scene in the sky.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's brush, the construction of the Wanjie Alliance headquarters was officially completed.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed magnificent, but this vast alliance headquarters is too empty."</p><p></p><p>"If outsiders come and see it so desolate, they will inevitably have thoughts in their hearts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked his chin, and the next moment an idea came to his mind.</p><p></p><p>With a light snap of his fingers, after a while, one figure after another appeared in various locations of the alliance headquarters!</p><p></p><p>They moved hurriedly, seeming very busy.</p><p></p><p>Some of them even conversed with each other, no different from real people.</p><p></p><p>They added a lot of vitality to the originally very quiet Wanjie Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this looks much better."</p><p></p><p>"Although there's a sense of self-deception, it's okay. This place will really become lively soon."</p><p></p><p>A satisfied smile appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was immersed in his imagination, Shang Tianci nervously came up to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally thought he wanted to apply to go find Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it was related to a new member of the Wanjie Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, after my persuasion during this period, Yan Fangzhou has agreed to join our alliance."</p><p></p><p>"But he said he wants to first take a look at our strength."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci said somewhat cautiously, afraid of angering Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Fangzhou?" Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had some impression of this person. It was the one Shang Tianci had mentioned before, a member of the Shanhe Pavilion, an organization of young talents in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>At a young age, he had already reached the Huashen realm. He had even proposed to Shang Tianci the cruel idea of using the Xuanhuang scene manifested in the Tianjing Gourd to forcefully explode the Dongtian of other Yuanyuan realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>His personality was very much to Li Fan's liking.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed a kind smile: "No problem, you can personally bring him over."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I will properly host him."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was overjoyed upon hearing this: "Yan Fangzhou is much stronger than me. If he can join our alliance, he will definitely be of greater help to the cause of the Wanjie Alliance."</p><p></p><p>With that said, he bid farewell to Li Fan and hurriedly went to receive Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched Shang Tianci's departing figure and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He then flashed and arrived in the circular grand hall at the entrance of the alliance.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>More than two hundred years ago, when Steward Song had just joined the Zixiao Sect, he was still only a young boy.</p><p></p><p>It was the centennial celebration of the Zixiao Sect, and the entire sect was filled with a harmonious and festive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>However, an unexpected guest suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>The identity of the visitor was so noble that even the Sect Master of Zixiao had to personally receive them.</p><p></p><p>It was the Special Supervisory Envoy of the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisory Envoy did not give much face to the Sect Master and directly stated that they had received a tip-off that the Zixiao Sect was harboring a wanted criminal of the Ten Immortal Sects, and a thorough investigation was needed.</p><p></p><p>Although the Zixiao Sect was very embarrassed, facing the Supervisory Envoy who represented the will of the Ten Immortal Sects, they had no choice but to cooperate with the investigation.</p><p></p><p>No one knew who the specific criminal was at the time, but the intensity of the search was so severe that every disciple of the Zixiao Sect was interrogated one by one.</p><p></p><p>Even Song Hesong, who had just entered the sect and was serving as a menial worker, was not spared.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong was not very clear about the final result.</p><p></p><p>However, after the Supervisory Envoy left, rumors began to circulate within the sect.</p><p></p><p>A true disciple of the Zixiao Sect had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Many people suspected that this true disciple was the wanted criminal.</p><p></p><p>Although the sect had established rules strictly prohibiting such unfounded rumors, the truth could not be concealed forever.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the confidentiality requirements of the incident gradually decreased.</p><p></p><p>Later, when Song Hesong took up the position of steward in Ningyuan City, his senior brother solemnly warned him to be on guard against the remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Upon his curious inquiry, he learned that the true disciple who had been taken away back then was actually a spy from the Xuantian Sect who had infiltrated the Zixiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect, the former number one sect in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Dominating the world, all other sect cultivators had to look up to them."</p><p></p><p>"Later, it was overthrown by the joint efforts of the Ten Immortal Sects. It was in that battle of sect destruction that the Ten Immortal Sects established their leadership position."</p><p></p><p>"However, a dead insect with a hundred feet does not stiffen easily. Although the Xuantian Sect was destroyed in a day, there were still remnants hidden in the world."</p><p></p><p>"In order to eliminate any possibility of the Xuantian Sect rising from the ashes, the Ten Immortal Sects issued an extermination order. Anyone with any connection to the former Xuantian Sect would be killed without mercy."</p><p></p><p>"And the Ten Immortal Sects alliance, which had already become a force to be reckoned with, was still so wary of the already destroyed Xuantian Sect because..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of unusual color flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme treasure of the Xuantian Sect disappeared without a trace in the battle of sect destruction."</p><p></p><p>"And this supreme treasure was called..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Mirror." Li Fan silently repeated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This mirror can be called a supreme treasure of heaven and earth, with endless wonders. The Ten Immortal Sects even set a bounty that anyone, with this mirror alone, could exchange it for a position of immortal longevity fruit."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, after so many years, the remnants of the Xuantian Sect have been nearly wiped out."</p><p></p><p>"As for the whereabouts of the Xuantian Mirror, it's even more unknown."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly digested the information obtained from Song Hesong.</p><p></p><p>"Could that Mr. Bai be a former member of the Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe, maybe not."</p><p></p><p>"But the Xuantian Mirror should be the Tianxuan Mirror of later generations. It's just unknown why the order of the two characters 'Xuan' and 'Tian' was swapped."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention that the Ten Immortal Sects have already been overthrown, there's no need to be secretive anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they really wanted to conceal its origin, they could have completely changed to a new name. There's no need to be so obvious."</p><p></p><p>"Could there be some deeper meaning?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Dharma Immortal who created the new method did so to overthrow the cultivation world order and avenge the destruction of the sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't dare to be certain.</p><p></p><p>However, he had taken a step closer to the truth of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Li Fan suppressed his surging thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"The two key figures have been dealt with, and the rest are just some unimportant minions."</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Li Fan's original consciousness broke out of Li Chen's body, revealing his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly approached Chu Liang and the others.</p><p></p><p>With a single encounter, without saying a word, he activated the Insect Binding Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>In just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, he captured the other four people who were lying in ambush.</p><p></p><p>At this point, there were no more cultivators in Ningyuan City except for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this is the last time I come here."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai, don't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently pondered.</p><p></p><p>He didn't wander around anymore, but quietly stood in the air above Ningyuan City, waiting for the time limit to arrive.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the surrounding scenery slowly began to blur.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed, and he looked down.</p><p></p><p>He saw a thin, cyan-colored figure, whose face was unclear.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the main street, looking up at him.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, a mortal woman in an elegant pink dress was nestled, her appearance also unclear.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering, the surrounding scene suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Instead, another scene took its place.</p><p></p><p>On the continuous ruins, only a cyan-colored figure remained, standing in a daze.</p><p></p><p>It could be vaguely seen that his hands were covered in blood stains, as if he had been trying to dig for something in the ruins earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the original history?"</p><p></p><p>The scene turned black.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a moment of dizziness, and the next second, he returned to the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>His head was dizzy, and upon careful comprehension, he actually had two gains from this trip.</p><p></p><p>One was the "Zixiao Haoran Intention", a secret technique from the "Zixiao Thunder Control True Formula" for cleansing the soul and purifying the body and mind.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhang, could it be that self-destruction is also your obsession?"</p><p></p><p>At this thought, Li Fan's expression became a little strange.</p><p></p><p>"But it's just as well, saving me the trouble of finding another cleansing technique."</p><p></p><p>"I have already mastered three secret techniques from the 'Zixiao Thunder Control True Formula': the Zixiao Soul Search Technique, the Zixiao Divine Thunder Escape, and the Zixiao Haoran Intention. Unfortunately, I have no chance to see the fundamental true scripture. I'm afraid it will be difficult to have the opportunity to complete it in the future."</p><p></p><p>As for the second gain from this trip to the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, three green, crystal-clear fruits lay quietly.</p><p></p><p>Just the aura emanating from them made Li Fan feel a jolt of energy, as if he had become much younger.</p><p></p><p>"Afterlife Longevity Fruit."</p><p></p><p>"Consuming each one can increase lifespan by three hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"This is the reward for resolving Mr. Bai's obsession."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the urge to consume them himself, Li Fan shifted his gaze away from the crystal-clear longevity fruits.</p><p></p><p>"For me, three hundred years of lifespan is just one reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>"But for other cultivators, these are almost priceless treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than consuming them myself, it's better to maximize their value and exchange them for something more useful."</p><p></p><p>"However, what exactly to exchange them for still requires further planning."</p><p></p><p>Temporarily putting this matter aside.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he gave up the idea of searching for information related to the Xuantian Sect and the Xuantian Mirror.</p><p></p><p>There would definitely be no results.</p><p></p><p>If he forcibly searched and inadvertently attracted the attention of certain existences, being forced to start over would be troublesome instead.</p>

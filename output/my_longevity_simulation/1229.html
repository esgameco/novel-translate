        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1227: I Enter the True Immortal Dao</p><p></p><p>"Is the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate related to the suddenly rising Severed Immortal Tower?"</p><p></p><p>"What is his purpose in summoning sixteen Dao-merging beings to the Darkest Star Sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Also, when I first arrived at this place full of relic fragments, the cultivator I encountered... was not from the Profound Immortal Boat. There should be another cultivation civilization existing here. Is it the Merchant Immortal Boat, or is it related to the Dharma Transmission?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts were disturbed by the intense energy fluctuations within Zhao Xian's body. </p><p></p><p>Above Zhao Xian's head, spiritual energy formed a vortex, frantically pouring into his body.</p><p></p><p>And in his dantian, there were purple-tinged cracks appearing on his golden core. </p><p></p><p>It seemed as if something was gestating inside.</p><p></p><p>After two months of frenzied closed-door cultivation, Zhao Xian entered the Nascent Soul realm!</p><p></p><p>However, this Nascent Soul...</p><p></p><p>It was different from what Li Fan had seen in the ancient books of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was not the image of an infant full of Dao charm and vitality, but directly a miniature of Zhao Xian's true self.</p><p></p><p>It even looked older than Zhao Xian himself.</p><p></p><p>Upon close observation, Li Fan discovered that the age manifested by this Nascent Soul seemed to have some profound mystery.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a predetermined fate? The innate limit that Zhao Xian can break through to the next realm. In other words, before reaching the age displayed by the Nascent Soul, Zhao Xian will not be able to break through to the Deity Transformation realm?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan had a vague guess.</p><p></p><p>"This counts as... another type of bottleneck? It has never been mentioned in the records of the Xuanhuang Realm. I just don't know if this predetermined age limit can be changed."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian, who finally woke up from his seclusion, also discovered the abnormality of his Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>Advancing too quickly caused his mentality to become slightly abnormal. It took him a while to accept this fact.</p><p></p><p>He privately found Zhao Wuji to inquire.</p><p></p><p>"What? You have formed your Nascent Soul?" </p><p></p><p>This time Zhao Wuji was not shocked, but somewhat frightened.</p><p></p><p>The academy had not finished discussing how to deal with the Golden Core Zhao Xian, yet he had already become a Nascent Soul realm cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't all the previous discussions be in vain?</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>Only after seeing the slightly older miniature that emerged from Zhao Xian's body did Zhao Wuji thoroughly believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at your situation, there is hope for Deity Transformation within ten years. This..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji stared blankly for a moment, not knowing what to say for a while.</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't make the decision on this matter. I must directly notify the Palace Master." Zhao Wuji fled as if escaping, his figure looking very disheveled.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian would definitely be subjected to strict examination soon.</p><p></p><p>Not very clear about the strength of the Palace Master of the Dao Proving Academy, it was better to avoid the limelight for now.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji arrived at the top floor of the academy in one go and pushed the door open.</p><p></p><p>There were three white-haired elders in the room, all looking at the flustered Zhao Wuji with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Xian has formed his Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>One sentence made the three elders' expressions change slightly.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan expected, they no longer cared about the message-delivering Zhao Wuji.</p><p></p><p>Their figures flickered and directly appeared beside Zhao Xian.</p><p></p><p>When Zhao Wuji saw Zhao Xian again, it was already seven days later.</p><p></p><p>Not long after forming his Nascent Soul, his aura had completely stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace Master retrieved the recorded footage of our meeting that day. Because of my impassioned words, the Palace Master finally abandoned the original plan. Instead, he decided to truly cultivate me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"People with talent are not rare. But people with talent who are absolutely loyal are very rare," Zhao Xian said to Zhao Wuji.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji recalled the events that had happened in the past few days and felt a strong sense of unreality.</p><p></p><p>"But Master, what you said is not entirely wrong. If I were still at the Golden Core stage, I'm afraid I would have been refined into a Dao Pill and swallowed by the Palace Master by now. Fortunately, I was one step ahead and escaped from death. After all, the Palace Master is almost at his age limit. The Academy also needs a successor," Zhao Xian transmitted his voice quietly.</p><p></p><p>"This is also the last time I will call you Master."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji watched Zhao Xian's departing figure with a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's avatar then shifted to Zhao Xian.</p><p></p><p>As the successor of the Academy, Zhao Xian's treatment underwent a drastic change compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he reside on the second highest level of the Academy, but he also gained access to many secrets that were previously unattainable.</p><p></p><p>For example, the true power system of the Xuan Xian Boat.</p><p></p><p>One of the three elders of the Academy, a cultivator named [Yu Shuo], personally taught Zhao Xian.</p><p></p><p>"Nascent Soul, Void God, Unifying the Dao. These realms are actually just appearances."</p><p></p><p>"Being stronger just means being able to survive a little longer."</p><p></p><p>"Those who should die will still die."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao Xian's confused expression due to the severe impact on his worldview, Yu Shuo continued with a smile, "The reason why our Proving Dao Academy is qualified to be named [Proving Dao] is that we were the first to find a way to avoid the harm of True Immortal power and even utilize it."</p><p></p><p>"We call it the [Entering Dao Method]."</p><p></p><p>"Entering Dao Method?" Zhao Xian was still full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"According to legend, every True Immortal has their own unique [Dao]. The Darkest Star Sea we are in is filled with the unique powers of True Immortals. To avoid being affected by True Immortals, mortal bodies must enter the Dao," Yu Shuo said, and his body underwent a bizarre change.</p><p></p><p>His appearance suddenly flickered inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>From the original white-haired and childlike old man, he turned into an immature child. Then he suddenly became an ambitious youth.</p><p></p><p>Not only his appearance but also his body and aura were constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"When you enter a True Immortal's Dao, not only can you avoid harm, but you can also largely exclude the power of other True Immortals in the star sea," Yu Shuo returned to his original appearance and said with some pride.</p><p></p><p>"This is the method adopted by the vast majority of high-level cultivators in the Immortal Pivot Court and Immortal Boats."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Zhao Xian keenly pointed out the key point.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Entering Dao Method have any flaws? Has the Severing Immortal Tower found a new way to utilize True Immortal power?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Shuo nodded, showing an expression of a teachable child.</p><p></p><p>"The power of True Immortals is not something that anyone can touch. For mortal cultivators to master it, not only does it have great requirements for physique and aptitude, but it also requires special materials and methods to progress step by step. If ordinary people come into contact with too much at once, the only outcome is destruction of body and soul."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yu, are you referring to the relics of destroyed realms?" Zhao Xian suddenly remembered something and hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. And only the relics with the weakest remnant power of True Immortals that are about to dissipate have the best effect."</p><p></p><p>"As for how the Severing Immortal Tower was able to rival the Immortal Pivot Court in a short period of time, it is said that they have found a way to perfectly absorb the relics of destroyed realms without harm," Yu Shuo said with a tone of disbelief.</p>

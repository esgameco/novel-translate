        <h1>Chapter 905</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the light screens arranged by the Huadao Stone in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"The scenes recorded here can be roughly divided into two categories."</p><p></p><p>"Some of them come from the cultivators who have fallen here over the years. They are not of much value."</p><p></p><p>"As for the rest..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of excitement flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Consistent with my previous guess, they all come from the same person."</p><p></p><p>"One of the Twelve Dharma Kings of the Xuantian Sect, Ji Yuzhen!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense came into contact with one of the light screens.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, as if experiencing it in person, numerous scenes came rolling in.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Xuanyuan? Didn't you already ascend?" A gentle female voice came from herself. Seeing the figure that suddenly appeared in front of her, Ji Yuzhen seemed quite shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems you are still the same, always practicing in seclusion and not caring about worldly affairs. I've been back for a while." The man in front had a resolute face and eyes as bright as the stars in the sky. His tone was very gentle, making people feel calm upon hearing it.</p><p></p><p>"This man surnamed Xuanyuan should be that Xuantian King. Although his appearance is not as stunningly beautiful as Mr. Bai, he is still rarely seen in the world in terms of handsomeness." Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian King first sighed, and then said to Ji Yuzhen with a serious expression: "Zhener, I want to do something. It may make me an enemy of the world. Are you willing to join me?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen was stunned for a moment, then without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>She abruptly stood up, the surging spiritual power around her causing the white clouds surrounding the mountain peaks to ripple in layers: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian King was a little surprised: "You're not going to ask what it is?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen stared at the Xuantian King for a moment, smiled faintly and shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian King avoided Ji Yuzhen's gaze and lowered his head guiltily. Then he broke through the sea of clouds and flew towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen followed closely behind, her gaze falling on the Xuantian King's back, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Exiting from the scene, Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he continued to browse the second complete scene.</p><p></p><p>In a dark underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian King was recounting what he saw and learned after his ascension, as well as the phenomenon of the Xuanhuang Realm's deviation that he observed.</p><p></p><p>Twelve figures were scattered in various corners of the chamber.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions, like their faces, were hidden in the shadows and could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>"This matter concerns the safety of countless living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm. We absolutely cannot stand by and do nothing. Xuanyuan Hong, you just go ahead and do it. Even if this old man has to give up his life, I will do my utmost to help you." An elderly voice was the first to speak up.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong cupped his hands towards the elder, his expression solemn: "Old Cui is righteous!"</p><p></p><p>Some people present also echoed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>But there were also a few people who remained expressionless and unmoved.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the narrow chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Zhener, among those immortal realm scriptures, I have selected the most suitable one for you."</p><p></p><p>"The Infinite Heavenly Pivot Spiritual Detachment Technique."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong looked extremely excited: "This technique is the most profound I have ever seen in my life. Body and soul become one, reaching the infinite and boundless realm..."</p><p></p><p>He went on and on, expounding to Ji Yuzhen the profound wonders of the technique.</p><p></p><p>While Ji Yuzhen just listened quietly with a smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On a battlefield full of blood and gore.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen's body transformed into myriad wandering split souls. Each divine soul turned into a faint light flying out, taking the life of an opposing cultivator.</p><p></p><p>While reaping the lives of enemies, Ji Yuzhen's gaze inadvertently</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gazing towards the distant battlefield, Xuanyuan Hong remained unfazed as he faced the siege of several Eternal Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Above his head, an ancient and simple mirror emitted a deep and mysterious light, sealing the surrounding enemies within.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong's eyebrows raised as he softly uttered, "Dharma Inviolable!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of light swept across his body.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the attacks from the five Eternal Realm cultivators fell upon Xuanyuan Hong as if striking empty air, having no effect whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>"Body of Great Strength!" Xuanyuan Hong spoke again.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle reach of his hand, he grasped a massive seal that had suddenly descended from a rift in space above his head, nearly occupying half the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Eyes Like Torches!"</p><p></p><p>A beam of golden light shot forth from Xuanyuan Hong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his gaze over the five besieging Eternal Realm cultivators, golden chains inexplicably appeared on the bodies of those caught in Xuanyuan Hong's sight, firmly binding them!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the tide of battle turned!</p><p></p><p>"Walking the Heavenly Dao!" Xuanyuan Hong's tone was chilling, as if imbued with the majestic aura of the heavens in that moment.</p><p></p><p>He gazed at the five Eternal Realm cultivators before him, their faces contorted. His figure flickered and he instantly appeared above their heads.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible ripple enveloped the five Eternal Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The expressions on their faces changed from unwillingness to panic, and then to fear.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanyuan Hong showed no mercy.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the bodies of these five Eternal Realm cultivators melted away like ice, vanishing into thin air.</p><p></p><p>Only five phantom fruits remained, emitting a strange radiance.</p><p></p><p>With a light wave of his hand, Xuanyuan Hong transformed these five fruits into five streaks of light that shot off into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The battle concluded with the fall of the five Eternal Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a space resembling a boundless starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Xuanyuan, so this is the Floating Crossing Starry Array?" </p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen looked at the scene before them and couldn't help but chuckle, "It's so ugly!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong's expression was calm, "As long as it can serve its purpose, that's all that matters."</p><p></p><p>Before the two, countless golden chains tightly wrapped and entwined around the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It resembled a golden ellipsoid floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>The chains were not completely still. Instead, they seemed to constantly circulate around an internal core.</p><p></p><p>Countless intricate runes were engraved upon the golden chains.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let us begin our first capture attempt."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of nervousness in Xuanyuan Hong's voice.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, hundreds of stars among the myriad before them suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong observed for a moment, then locked onto one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>With a light point of his finger, a chain shot out from the golden ellipsoid.</p><p></p><p>It flew straight towards the targeted star.</p><p></p><p>The chain entered the void, silent and unresponsive.</p><p></p><p>As if lost in the endless emptiness.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong remained focused in observation.</p><p></p><p>It was only after several days that he shook his head with a tinge of regret, "There is still a deviation between the observation markers and the actual positions."</p><p></p><p>"This capture attempt has failed again."</p><p></p><p>With those words, he lightly gestured, and the golden chain that had shot into the void began to return.</p><p></p><p>"Deviation? Is it due to the influence of that unknown attractive force?" Ji Yuzhen asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. Before long, not only our cultivation world, but perhaps the entire space-time will inevitably be affected by it."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong sighed, "We must accelerate our progress."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Xuanyuan, let me heal your wounds."</p><p></p><p>In the secluded space, Ji Yuzhen split off a wisp of his divine sense and flew towards Xuanyuan Hong.</p>

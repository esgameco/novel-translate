        <h1>Chapter 1126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had felt the emotions of [Huan Zhen] to some extent before.</p><p></p><p>The tremor when encountering the Eternal Relic for the first time, and the desire when facing Mr. White's skull.</p><p></p><p>And now, after Li Fan tried to "feed" Huan Zhen with the newly born Five Elements Grotto Heaven, Huan Zhen once again sent feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Not very satisfied. In other words, barely acceptable."</p><p></p><p>A cold gleam flashed in Li Fan's eyes. Countless red threads flew out from the inner Grotto Heaven, like billions of tentacles, piercing into the void of the [Root of Heaven and Earth].</p><p></p><p>Seizing the ownership of the newborn Grotto Heaven from this mother body.</p><p></p><p>The Root of Heaven and Earth was only responsible for simply nurturing the Grotto Heaven. So when this creation destined to leave itself was slowly stripped away by Li Fan, it did not cause much fierce resistance.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was the newborn Grotto Heaven itself that seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>It tried its best to exert a trace of resistance, attempting to stop Li Fan's devouring.</p><p></p><p>But how could a newborn baby compare to a strong adult brother?</p><p></p><p>There was no suspense.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the constant faint rumbling sound, the newborn Grotto Heaven was pulled into the phantom of the Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven, which was like a background painting.</p><p></p><p>Until it was completely engulfed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Buzz buzz buzz..."</p><p></p><p>A series of sharp tinnitus sounded in Li Fan's ears, and the scene before his eyes also seemed to darken for a moment.</p><p></p><p>When everything returned to normal, Li Fan looked at his Huan Zhen panel.</p><p></p><p>"Current available anchor points: 3"</p><p></p><p>"It increased by one, as expected it works. After devouring the Golden Core laws can no longer satisfy Huan Zhen's appetite, the next step is to use the higher-grade Nascent Soul Grotto Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Verifying his guess, while also increasing an available anchor point for Huan Zhen, Li Fan did not feel very happy.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he kept savoring the emotion of [Huan Zhen] just now.</p><p></p><p>Tasteless to eat, a pity to discard. But at Li Fan's insistence, Huan Zhen eventually devoured the newborn Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's the Grotto Heaven, what will it want in the future? Small worlds, immortal cultivation realms? Or the coming changes in the new law system, the Soul of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>"But no matter what, it's time to tease its appetite. Being a picky eater is not a good habit."</p><p></p><p>In the dark void space, Li Fan stood alone.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, he slowly left.</p><p></p><p>Coming out from the [Root of Heaven and Earth], Li Fan then went to the place where the Blood River was located.</p><p></p><p>Due to the lingering power of the Fishing Pond's protection, this place still had not been discovered by the Myriad Immortal Alliance. The surviving cultivators in the stronghold were the last group of the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They had already learned about the news of the total annihilation of the headquarters in the Spirit Wood Realm. In addition to sadness and anger, none of them had any doubts about their faith in the Merciful Immortal of the Red Dust.</p><p></p><p>Because they could still feel the ubiquitous great divine power of the Merciful Immortal in their meditation.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators Li Fan sent to the Blood River to search for historical fragments were basically young people full of enthusiasm. Their cultivation level was at most no more than early Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>So they could only lie low for now, secretly accumulating strength.</p><p></p><p>Without the support from the headquarters and losing all their previous reliance, they could only place their hope for revenge on that vast Blood River.</p><p></p><p>With firm belief, ignoring their own loss</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They immersed themselves in the river of life time and time again, trying to explore its mysteries.</p><p></p><p>In three years, out of the original more than one hundred people, only thirty-three survived in the end. </p><p></p><p>And even these survivors all suffered great damage to their lifespans.</p><p></p><p>Despite their young age, they all had white hair, like elderly people in their twilight years.</p><p></p><p>However, they were not without gains.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan studied the insights they had summarized.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to those driven by pure self-interest, those bearing unforgettable hatred are better able to maintain mental clarity when exploring the Blood-Colored River."</p><p></p><p>"When projecting into the Blood-Colored River, there seems to be a homogeneous mutual attraction. For example, our group of avengers are more likely to observe cultivators in history who also harbored overwhelming hatred."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to simply recording the light and shadow, perhaps things that once existed in history can be truly brought out. It seems to be a manifestation of the power of the [Blood-Colored River]. However, the probability of triggering it is extremely low. Since the creation of [Xun You], this phenomenon has only occurred once. Currently researching the conditions required to achieve the goal..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recorded all this extremely valuable research data.</p><p></p><p>He also remembered the name of the cultivator who diligently organized and recorded these results.</p><p></p><p>Chen Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. Previously, this person's performance was unremarkable among the group. Only now, in the desperate situation of the alliance's destruction, has he finally demonstrated his leadership talent."</p><p></p><p>"He has potential. In the next life, he can be put to good use earlier. Hmm, let me see which small world he comes from..."</p><p></p><p>After achieving his goal at the Blood-Colored River, Li Fan did not show himself to disturb them.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he let this group of people continue their own mission.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, a year later, the outcome would make no difference.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly left and went to the Boundary, Empire, Underworld and many other places.</p><p></p><p>He completed the harvest of results and repeatedly tested and verified his escape plan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The river of time surged forward.</p><p></p><p>The first Heavenly Myriad Spirits Grand Formation was completed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze instantly pierced through layers of spatial barriers and arrived at the mortal world where the grand formation was located.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator in charge of the construction of the grand formation here felt the rewarding cultivation bestowed by the Merciful True Immortal in his body, his face showing excitement.</p><p></p><p>Having received the guidance from the mysterious realm, he activated the grand formation without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This mortal world was somewhat larger in scale compared to Li Fan's hometown, Da Xuan.</p><p></p><p>However, as the Heavenly Myriad Spirits Grand Formation was activated, the originally clear blue sky was suddenly tainted with a strange blood-red color.</p><p></p><p>The blood color swirled in the sky, like a paintbrush, and finally turned into a strange and terrifying blood-colored giant eye.</p><p></p><p>The giant eye looked coldly at the myriad beings below, like the eye of a deity.</p><p></p><p>All living beings between heaven and earth felt an inexplicable sense of extreme panic in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Under the instinctive fear, their bodies trembled uncontrollably and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Even though nothing had happened yet, the emotion of despair had already spread across the earth.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were those who dared to rebel against this blood-colored giant eye.</p><p></p><p>But all they could do was point at the sky, curse angrily, and rage impotently.</p><p></p><p>And that cultivator who single-handedly built the Heavenly Myriad Spirits Grand Formation of this world stared blankly at the blood-colored giant eye in the sky.</p>

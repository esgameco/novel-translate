        <h1>Chapter 615</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"In today's cultivation world, after several great calamities of heaven and earth, the lifespan of cultivators is much shorter compared to our time," Li Fan spoke confidently.</p><p></p><p>"There are very few longevity treasures available, and even if it can extend life by a hundred years, it can drive cultivators crazy to grab it."</p><p></p><p>"If we can mass-produce the Longevity Pills again and exchange them for enough cultivation techniques for all disciples, then there is hope," Li Fan continued.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's just a temporary measure. As long as we have enough manpower, it's not a difficult task," Liu San said, taking out a jade bottle from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"I have nine top-grade Longevity Pills that the sect master rewarded me before, each extending life by about six hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you should exchange them for spiritual... um, now it's called contribution points, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct. Although it's been given a new name, the essence remains the same," Li Fan casually responded, accepting this priceless bottle of pills without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Liu San, however, had some concerns, "As Young Master mentioned, the value of these Longevity Pills is not trivial. It's fine to use them occasionally, but if we sell them frequently, will we not attract unwanted attention?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement, "Liu lao, you're absolutely right. It's precisely because of this that we can't take the initiative."</p><p></p><p>"I mentioned before that I had met Daoist Zhou Qing'ang. This person has a deep background and can handle everything for us. We just need to give him a portion of the profits."</p><p></p><p>Liu San frowned slightly but did not say much.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "This is just a stopgap measure. In the future, we will definitely have to rebuild the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>"But we need to plan it carefully."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Liu San nod.</p><p></p><p>"Liu lao, you stay in the Medicine King Cauldron for now. I'll go back and exchange the pills for cultivation techniques. I'll awaken some disciples first," Li Fan bid farewell and left the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The words he just said were only to appease Liu San. The Longevity Pills would not be easily given away.</p><p></p><p>With the contribution points he currently had, gathering enough disciples to obtain the cultivation techniques needed to produce Longevity Pills was more than enough.</p><p></p><p>However, after the Red Flame Sea incident, the identity of "Cultivator Li Fan from the Tianji Sect" had to be abandoned.</p><p></p><p>The descendants of the Medicine King Sect still had their value.</p><p></p><p>The problem now was how to completely whitewash the identities of all the Medicine King Sect disciples without linking them to him.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan decided to use the method of "divide and conquer."</p><p></p><p>His clone Zhou Qing'ang, found Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What advice do you have, Daoist Zhou?" Gao Yuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Zhou Qing'ang became the messenger of the Secret Envoy, he had subtly become the de facto ruler of the Cong Yunhai region.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Gao Yuan or He Zhenghao, whenever they encountered important matters, they needed Zhou Qing'ang's approval. </p><p></p><p>And he truly lived up to the high regard of the Secret Envoy, working diligently to the point that Gao Yuan and He were apprehensive. </p><p></p><p>Hardly ever seen going out, he was always in the Political Affairs Hall, personally handling every detail.</p><p></p><p>His sudden visit today was quite unexpected to Gao Yuan. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang smiled and said, "Don't be nervous, Daoist Gao. It's just a minor matter that I need your help with."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan looked perplexed, thinking, "Your position is higher than mine, why would you need my help?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang continued, "I have a friend who accidentally discovered a hidden secret realm. Inside this realm, there is a group of cultivators sealed in ice and slumber. Upon waking them up and questioning, I learned that they entered this secret realm to evade pursuit from the Ten Daoist Sects and got stuck in hibernation due to an accident..."</p><p></p><p>Initially attentive, Gao Yuan's expression turned increasingly odd as Zhou Qing'ang narrated.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when Zhou Qing'ang mentioned wanting to "arrange" these cultivators to join the Ten Immortal Alliance, Gao Yuan's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a smooth operator and did not question on the spot, showing a forced smile, "Isn't this a bit too coincidental?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, what's the identity of this friend of yours? Can he be trusted?"</p><p></p><p>"These people, could they be spies sent from over there..."</p><p></p><p>He gestured towards the direction of the Five Elders Council, probing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang chuckled, cutting in decisively, "Daoist Gao, you worry too much. I, Zhou, swear on my life that these people are definitely not spies from the Five Elders Council!"</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, there are benefits in it for you. I know Daoist Gao has almost emptied his pockets in exchange for cultivation techniques, and recently can barely afford to activate the 'Awakening' status. Such a good opportunity has presented itself, you can't miss it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gao Yuan's interest was piqued. Zhou Qing'ang's explanation somewhat made sense.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, he still had some concerns.</p><p></p><p>"What about the Secret Envoy..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang waved his hand, "Such a trivial matter doesn't need to disturb the Secret Envoy. Recently, the Secret Envoy has just restored his Nascent Infant cultivation and is preparing to make a breakthrough to a higher realm."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan was taken aback at this news.</p><p></p><p>This was a major event â€“ the higher the Secret Envoy's cultivation, the more secure their positions. However, neither he nor He Zhenghao knew about this development, indicating that in the eyes of the Secret Envoy, Zhou Qing'ang was more trusted.</p><p></p><p>A thought flashed in Gao Yuan's mind, and once it emerged, it was hard to suppress.</p><p></p><p>"Since Daoist Zhou put it that way, then I can't refuse," Gao Yuan consented with a twinkle in his eye.</p><p></p><p>"Before you bring those cultivators, inform me. I will personally handle their membership procedures."</p><p></p><p>"Agreed! Agreed!" Zhou Qing'ang left contentedly.</p><p></p><p>As Gao Yuan mulled over something with a conflicted expression, pacing back and forth.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he gritted his teeth and made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Using a divine communication jade token left by the Secret Envoy, he contacted Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Secret Envoy, I have something to report to you," Gao Yuan said obsequiously.</p><p></p><p>"Speak," Li Fan's tone was somewhat icy, causing Gao Yuan to gulp nervously, feeling a sense of foreboding.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, with no choice, he pushed through and relayed Zhou Qing'ang's report.</p><p></p><p>But the response received was silence.</p><p></p><p>This made Gao Yuan more uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," after a long pause, Li Fan finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>"However, Gao Yuan..."</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhou is right. In the future, these trivial matters shouldn't bother me anymore."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan's heart instantly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"And, I hope you understand. Unity is the most important."</p><p></p><p>With that, there was silence on Li Fan's end.</p>

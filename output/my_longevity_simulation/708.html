        <h1>Chapter 708</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xu Bai vaguely heard the sound of helpless cries.</p><p></p><p>After that, a slender figure shook his head slightly and turned around.</p><p></p><p>Locked in a gaze with Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>His mind suddenly exploded, sounding loud and reverberating. Xu Bai was horrified to discover that the figure's appearance was exactly the same as his own!</p><p></p><p>No, it's differentâ€¦</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye, the facial features changed abruptly. Xu Bai seemed to see Mr. Bai's unparalleled beauty again.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit different from what he saw back in the Beast Control Sect, not as radiant and godlike, but rather with a touch of sorrow and compassion for the world, more realistic, and with a hint of the "ordinary" taste.</p><p></p><p>His clear eyes seemed to want to convey countless emotions and stories, like a whirlpool gradually engulfing Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Awake!"</p><p></p><p>A light drink, like a bell, seemed to come from the sky. It pierced through the endless world barriers, suddenly appearing in Xu Bai's ears.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes, which were initially dull and lifeless, regained a hint of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Mr. Bai in front of him again, the flesh on his face seemed to melt like a candle, transforming his once breathtaking face into a terrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the horrific vision spread from Mr. Bai's face to his whole body.</p><p></p><p>As if blown away by a gust of wind, he turned into a pale skeleton in the blink of an eye, staring directly at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was suddenly horrified.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings seemed to crack like glass, then shattered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A slight dizziness came over him, and the illusions disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator who was guiding him glanced over him for a moment and then slowly said, "There is a trace of the breath of the Transcendent Master lingering in this space. Novice cultivators who come here for the first time will often feel something and experience illusions."</p><p></p><p>Having been to the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance before, Xu Bai naturally knew about this.</p><p></p><p>The last time his true self came here, he saw the towering statue of the Transcendent Master.</p><p></p><p>From that statue, Li Fan felt extreme danger and a faint sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>But this time, when his clone made from Xu Ke's blood and Mr. Bai's aura arrived here, what he saw was such a bizarre scene.</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of Mr. Bai actually became exactly the same as the clone. And that suddenly turning into white bones was a terrifying sight..."</p><p></p><p>"What does all this signify?"</p><p></p><p>Even though he had escaped the illusion, Xu Bai still seemed to be immersed in the shock it brought.</p><p></p><p>Out of instinct, he followed the black-robed cultivator leading him.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Xu Bai's extraordinary appearance had an effect, as the black-robed cultivator didn't seem to mind, quietly leading the way.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the two passed through the transfer array, transformed into beams of light, and swiftly shuttled through the Immortal Alliance headquarters' space that Xu Bai slowly walked out of the influence of the illusion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the black-robed guiding cultivator explained to Xu Bai, "This trace of the Transcendent Master's lingering aura is usually referred to as the 'True Intent of Transmission.' It is profound and has various miraculous uses. Novice cultivators who encounter it for the first time here will be affected and experience illusions."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, feeling skeptical, sarcastically thought, "Judging by appearances is human nature. Even we cultivators cannot avoid it."</p><p></p><p>But he seized the opportunity to inquire, "According to what Senior just said, it seems that encountering the 'True Intent of Transmission' is extremely rare, perhaps only once in a lifetime. However, besides seeing some illusions, I didn't notice any other effects?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator solemnly replied, "We are all practitioners taught by the Transcendent. Therefore, when we face the 'True Intent of Transmission,' we don't just see simple illusions. It's very likely that what we see is related to each person's 'Ultimate Dao.'"</p><p></p><p>Before Xu Bai could ask, the cultivator took the initiative to explain the concept of the 'Ultimate Dao': "Each practitioner, from the moment they embark on the path of cultivation, generally finds the path obscure and fraught with difficulties. At each realm, how to cultivate and choose the most suitable method requires personal exploration."</p><p></p><p>"Since life doesn't offer second chances, once we make a mistake, we can only regret it for a lifetime and cut off our path. Therefore, with each step we take, we must be extremely cautious."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Ultimate Dao' is considered by the Transcendent as the endpoint of the path most suitable for our cultivation. What kind of person is the Transcendent? Their vision is incomparable to ours. What they determine is basically the truth."</p><p></p><p>"So, the illusions you just witnessed are crucial. If you ponder on them day and night, you will surely make great gains each time."</p><p></p><p>Numerous floating landforms flashed by quickly.</p><p></p><p>The guiding black-robed cultivator narrated the marvels of the 'True Intent of Transmission' unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>He concluded with a sigh, "Our cultivation is like a road to the heavens, shrouded in heavy mist. One wrong step, and we will stumble and fall, shattering into pieces."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Transcendent, showing mercy to all living beings!"</p><p></p><p>As the two transformed back into human forms from beams of light and their feet touched the ground again, the words of the black-robed cultivator ceased, and he reverted to his previous cold demeanor.</p><p></p><p>A straight path paved with green stones led to a towering black stone stele at the end.</p><p></p><p>There lay the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance's Hall of Guardians.</p><p></p><p>Stepping onto the path of enlightenment, Xu Bai's spiritual energy instantly immersed. Like an ordinary person, he steadily walked towards his destination.</p><p></p><p>It was quite a long journey.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the end, the guiding black-robed cultivator spoke gently again, "Present your token here, and you can enter inside. I cannot enter though, so I will wait here for you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly and took out the token.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the last life, a colorful passage appeared on the stele, and Xu Bai walked into it with broad steps.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Declaration of User of Expanding Law Device, Xu Bai."</p><p></p><p>"Identification Number: 03. Authorization Level: Uniting Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Please wait here patiently. The estimated remaining waiting time is thirteen hours."</p><p></p><p>A somewhat familiar voice resonated in Xu Bai's ears.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1255</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, 'When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact.' When the Xuanhuang Realm is no longer the Xuanhuang Realm, I'm afraid those who rely on the Xuanhuang Realm for existence, like you, Fellow Daoist, will also face a reckoning."</p><p></p><p>"Even the immortals of this realm will find it difficult to escape," the Faceless Sacred Emperor concluded.</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping finished speaking, a sense of crisis naturally arose in Shi Ban's heart, as if his inner spiritual awareness was echoing Li Ping's conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"This is something I have never considered before. I wonder what the other immortals think. We haven't had any contact for many years," Shi Ban said after a long contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sneered, "Those few still intend to sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter. It's fine for them to remain neutral. They were never part of my plan anyway."</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban changed the subject, "So, Fellow Daoist, you said the key is that Xuanhuang is the orthodox."</p><p></p><p>"How do we achieve that? And if it's really as you say, if we make any moves or pass on teachings, they will notice and stop us..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping remained silent for a long time, not responding.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he suddenly said, "Let me first help you solve the trouble caused by the stone tablet behind you."</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban knew that in the eyes of this Sacred Emperor before him, he was not yet someone to whom all plans could be fully disclosed. So, he didn't insist and bowed, "In that case, I thank you first, Fellow Daoist. If it doesn't work out, it's alright."</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm taking action, there's no reason for failure."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor's words left Shi Ban speechless.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>The Book of Tribulation was thrown onto the great hall by Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>The pages flipped rapidly without wind.</p><p></p><p>Numerous gold-plated paper figures surged out of the book, lining up like soldiers in formation.</p><p></p><p>The leader was naturally the thick-browed little gold figure from before.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what method the Sacred Emperor had used. Despite being suppressed for less than half a day, they seemed to have undergone earth-shattering changes compared to when they first emerged from the Duguo Sect.</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban's gaze was focused on the paper figures of the Duguo Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping noticed the movement of the cat treasure in the Sacred Dynasty's treasury.</p><p></p><p>As if discovering something extremely interesting, it flashed to Li Ping's side.</p><p></p><p>Standing on Li Ping's shoulder, it affectionately rubbed against his head, but its eyes were fixed on the paper figures below.</p><p></p><p>A strange atmosphere instantly enveloped the Sacred Emperor's throne hall.</p><p></p><p>The paper figures, who were originally nodding and making small movements, suddenly froze like ice sculptures.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to move at all.</p><p></p><p>The leading little gold figure even directly activated the "Eternal Calamity World" cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>However, the golden light on its body flickered like a candle in the wind, looking precarious.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that even when facing the threat of the Sacred Emperor refining the entire Duguo Sect earlier, the Duguo Sect as a whole had never been so frightened.</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban, who had been paying attention to the paper figures of the Duguo Sect, naturally noticed the anomaly in the hall. He looked at the Faceless Sacred Emperor sitting on the high seat with some doubt and uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>From Shi Ban's expression, Li Ping judged that the other party had not noticed the existence of the cat treasure on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptibly glancing at the restless cat treasure, countless thoughts flashed through the Sacred Emperor's mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's not seeing [food] and wanting to hunt, but pure curiosity."</p><p></p><p>"Although the entire Duguo Sect also can't see the existence of the cat treasure, due to the cultivation technique, they instinctively sense the fatal calamity and crisis. They're so scared. Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"The cat treasure, outside the high walls..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping separated a strand of golden source power to appease the restless cat treasure.</p><p></p><p>After examining the paper figures below, the cat treasure seemed to suddenly lose interest. It only licked some source power from Li Ping and then flashed back to the Sacred Dynasty's treasury below to rest.</p><p></p><p>The eerie atmosphere in the great hall gradually returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>No one actively mentioned the strangeness in the hall just now. However, the Duguo Sect, from top to bottom, directly transformed from rural wandering warriors to veteran soldiers, following the Sacred Emperor's will.</p><p></p><p>With Li Ping's permission, the thick-browed little gold figure glanced at Shi Ban and explained, "The Creation Stone Tablet is connected to the underlying laws of the Xuanhuang World. Like the rings of a tree, it spontaneously records everything that happens in the Xuanhuang Realm at every moment."</p><p></p><p>"With the scale of the world, even if it contains all the events, big and small, over tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years, it's not a big deal. But when all of this is borne by a human..."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, it will be extremely painful."</p><p></p><p>The little gold figure bowed to Li Ping, "Actually, if Your Eminence wants to solve this matter, it's simple to say. One is to increase this person's carrying capacity, and the other is to create a buffer."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Duguo Sect acted as if he didn't know Shi Ban at all and waved at the Book of Tribulation not far away.</p><p></p><p>As the pages flipped, countless scenes recorded by the "Observing World Divine Eye" flashed on it.</p><p></p><p>"Our Duguo Sect, like the Creation Stone Tablet, has had a certain degree of supervision over the Xuanhuang Realm in recent years. However, the difference is that we don't have anyone directly dealing with this vast amount of information. Instead, we first record and preserve it, and then divide the work to review it. The power of one person is naturally insufficient to cope. The power of one sect is more than enough to handle it."</p><p></p><p>The little gold figure looked at Shi Ban again, "If you are alone and want to alleviate or even get rid of the burden of the stone tablet, you need to rely on external objects. In the past, it was a bit difficult due to the rejection by the Heavenly Dao. But now, with the help of Your Eminence, I think there should be no problem."</p><p></p><p>From the little gold figure's tone and expression, Shi Ban became more certain that he was indeed Yijue Daoren, the former acting sect master of the Duguo Sect. However, since the other party was unwilling to admit it, he could only pretend not to have recognized him.</p><p></p><p>After Yijue finished speaking, Li Ping finally said to Shi Ban, "Fellow Daoist, please wait for me for a moment."</p><p></p><p>With that, the Sacred Emperor's figure disappeared from the Sacred Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Even the entire Great Enlightenment Small World could not sense his presence.</p><p></p><p>Only a group of Duguo Sect paper figures and the standing Shi Ban were left in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban looked at Yijue, wanting to say something but stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you are also like us, as colleagues, perhaps getting close to each other is not a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>This attitude of handling matters was very similar to Yijue's style back then.</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban nodded slightly, indicating that he understood the meaning behind the other party's words.</p><p></p><p>"In the sealed space of the Dharma transmission, even when facing the refinement of golden flames, we, the Duguo Sect, actually didn't have much fear. Because we didn't feel a real, unavoidable calamity."</p><p></p><p>"But just now, in this great hall..."</p><p></p><p>"A terrifying disaster that we have never felt before. Be careful, that person is not simple..."</p><p></p><p>Yijue's voice was imperceptibly transmitted to Shi Ban's ears, and his heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to chat more with the other party, but the little gold figure refused to respond no matter what.</p><p></p><p>And the Faceless Sacred Emperor Li Ping, in a short...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a while, they returned to the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"The quality of this Hua Dao stone should be sufficient."</p><p></p><p>He was seen throwing a blue crystal towards the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, please take a look. This top-grade Hua Dao stone used as a recording buffer will definitely not be a problem." Without waiting for the stone tablet's response, the Dugu Zong Yijue rushed to say.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, a middle-grade one would have been enough. Using a top-grade is a bit of a waste." The tone of the little golden man was even quite flattering.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the stone tablet shook its head slightly and directly reached out to grasp the Hua Dao stone in front of it. </p><p></p><p>After trying it out, although the rejection of the Heavenly Dao laws was a few points weaker compared to back then,</p><p></p><p>It still did not allow the entry of external objects.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet looked at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a mere top-grade Hua Dao stone. As long as Fellow Daoist doesn't mind." The Holy Emperor's words were very pretty.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>At Li Ping's instruction, the stone tablet and all the paper men of the Dugu Zong followed and arrived above the Daqi Small World.</p><p></p><p>At the intersection of the unknown formation power enveloping the entire small world, golden threads could be seen swirling and surrounding from time to time, forming a hollow.</p><p></p><p>Above the hollow, the color of the sky dome was no longer azure blue, but a sheet of jet black.</p><p></p><p>As if connecting to an unknown existence.</p><p></p><p>Arriving here, the sense of crisis in the stone tablet's heart inexplicably reappeared.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet had already become somewhat numb, but out of instinct, it still observed the traces of the formation here.</p><p></p><p>The paper men of the Dugu Zong, however, looked as usual. As if they were not aware of the danger here.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stepped forward and arrived at the center of the hollow, sitting cross-legged in the void.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable aura surged from the Holy Emperor's body. Before long, a straight beam of golden light shot out from the top of his head and flew into the unknown blackness.</p><p></p><p>As if opening up some kind of passage, the blackness was stirred, and the color gradually approached the normal sky around it.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet looked up and felt the familiar aura belonging to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao from the end of that hollow.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, come here." Li Ping spoke out at this time.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet's figure floated and sat in the air opposite the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao fell like a waterfall from the top of the Heavenly Spirit Cover. The stone tablet felt a long-lost comfort.</p><p></p><p>The pain of being tortured by countless scenes was also relieved at this moment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, being infused with this Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao aura, the stone tablet also keenly noticed the subtle changes taking place within its body.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Thousand Year Change?"</p><p></p><p>After comprehending for a while, the stone tablet was pensive.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet it carried only recorded the events that had occurred within the Xuanhuang Realm in recent years. But outside the original Xuanhuang Realm, due to the fusion with remnants of other cultivation realms, it was originally unable to perceive the various changes caused.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, with the infusion of the Heavenly Dao aura, it was able to personally experience the world's dramatic changes.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet had a vague feeling in its heart that not only was the rejection of external forces by the Xuanhuang laws within its body weakening, but the stone tablet itself had also inexplicably changed.</p><p></p><p>Some blurry scenes from the implanted prefectures also appeared on the stone tablet's records.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the incomplete fusion, the text appearing on the stone tablet was also very blurry.</p><p></p><p>As if lightly wiped, it would be casually erased.</p><p></p><p>"If given tens of thousands of years for the Xuanhuang Realm to slowly realize its own devourment of other worlds, perhaps the so-called Xuanhuang orthodoxy could still be guaranteed. The stone tablet behind me would also record all the events that occurred in the absorbed prefectures. But unfortunately, reality will not give it so much time..."</p><p></p><p>While the stone tablet was pondering, it suddenly heard the voice of the Faceless Holy Emperor beside its ears.</p><p></p><p>"Hua Dao Shen Yi."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet immediately came back to its senses and pressed the top-grade Hua Dao stone against its brow.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, compared to before, it was completely different.</p><p></p><p>The power of rejection within its body had weakened too much. And with the infusion of the Heavenly Dao aura from above, the rejection was becoming lighter and lighter.</p><p></p><p>"Touch it with the divine, fuse it with calculations."</p><p></p><p>"The object and self unite, Hua Dao Shen Yi..."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet silently recited the secret technique of the Taiyi Sect, and the blue crystal was gradually inserted into its sea of consciousness like ice melting into water.</p><p></p><p>The entire process went very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Just as only the last tip of the Hua Dao stone was still exposed, the anomaly in the hollow above caught the stone tablet's attention.</p><p></p><p>"What is that..."</p><p></p><p>Only to see beam after beam of withered yellow light flying out from the end of the black passage.</p><p></p><p>At first, there were only dozens of them flying together, but slowly, the yellow light in the passage became more and more.</p><p></p><p>Thousands upon thousands, like a swarm of dancing bees, densely packed.</p><p></p><p>The yellow light also carried an aura that made the stone tablet feel uncomfortable, though not threatening.</p><p></p><p>The sky full of yellow light kept flying to the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping reached out and caught them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the stone tablet discover that these lights turned out to be one strange-looking paper man after another.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the vivid and lifelike ones of the Dugu Zong, these were purely paper men.</p><p></p><p>While exuding a decaying aura, even if not directly facing each other, those paper men seemed to stare fixedly at the stone tablet, making one feel irritated.</p><p></p><p>"Observing World Divine Eyes?" The stone tablet was stunned for a moment, then suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"This object is harmful and useless to the world, so naturally it needs to be recovered." Li Ping said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the Dugu Zong say that once implanted, it cannot be recovered? Back then, we..."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet seemed to remember something and was shocked for a moment, unable to help but look towards the Yijue Daoist.</p><p></p><p>That Yijue Daoist didn't seem to see the stone tablet's gaze at all, but only respectfully said to the Holy Emperor, "Although the Observing World Divine Eyes are somewhat dilapidated, they can still be reused after re-refining."</p><p></p><p>"The raw materials of this object come from outside the heavens. Our Dugu Zong doesn't have much left. Such a precious and rare object, our original plan was to definitely recover it after surviving the tribulation. Now it's just being done in advance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yijue's calm and composed expression, the stone tablet forcibly suppressed the impulse to teach him a lesson.</p><p></p><p>"Occasionally using it to spy on the enemy's situation is not bad. But there's no need for it to be all over the world."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the greatly increased closeness of the Xuanhuang Realm due to the removal of the Observing World Divine Eyes, Li Ping said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency's teachings are correct." The Yijue Daoist of the Dugu Zong responded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet simply ignored the two and focused on fusing with the Hua Dao stone.</p><p></p><p>When the Hua Dao stone completely disappeared on the outside, a dazzling crystal also appeared in its sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The countless suppressed scenes seemed to pause for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then they madly surged into the Hua Dao stone.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the voice of the Yijue Daoist also kept echoing.</p><p></p><p>It was the exclusive method used by the Dugu Zong to store and record the information of heaven and earth.</p>

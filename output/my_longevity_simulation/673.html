        <h1>Chapter 673</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"As one approaches the realm of true immortals as depicted in legends, the more one desires it after taking the pill," Liu San's expression was extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps those with exceptional willpower can resist the temptation of taking another pill, but..." Liu San shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"At least, in our era, it's rare to hear of such individuals," Li Fan's eyes flashed as he put away the jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>"If in the future Master Liu refines this elixir again, it might be good to keep them all. They could be useful in critical moments," Li Fan advised.</p><p></p><p>Liu San nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I'd like to trouble Master Fang to craft a few self-defense treasures for me," Li Fan then turned to Fang Zaiji and said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What kind of treasures does the sect master want?" Fang Zaiji became interested when it came to his specialty.</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, they should be able to withstand attacks from ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators. Can Master Fang do that?" After spending some time together, Li Fan intentionally lowered his requirements, smiling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Fang Zaiji's self-esteem was triggered, "The young master underestimates me! Even if it's treasures that can withstand attacks from Core Formation cultivators, what's so difficult about it? However..."</p><p></p><p>"It might just need a bit more materials," Fang Zaiji mumbled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was a request from the young master and involved lifesaving utility, Liu San spoke up, "It's alright. There are still some materials stored in the Medicine King Cauldron that would be enough for you to create them!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was stunned, "In the Medicine King Cauldron? That's impossible. I've been researching it for so long, how did I not notice?"</p><p></p><p>Liu San sneered, "It seems like your skills are still lacking."</p><p></p><p>With that, Liu San flew into the Medicine King Cauldron. After a moment, he returned and threw a storage ring to Fang Zaiji.</p><p></p><p>Taking the ring and checking its contents, Fang Zaiji immediately exclaimed, "Black Micro Ancient Bamboo, Demon Ink Gold, Purple Essence Sand..."</p><p></p><p>"Why are there so many good things?" Liu San chuckled disdainfully, "In any case, our Medicine King Sect is also a wealthy and influential sect. If we are truly determined to evacuate, how can we not make thorough preparations?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly remembering something, Liu San's face darkened a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about that, just focus on helping the young master refine the protective treasures. If the materials are not enough, you can ask me for more!" </p><p></p><p>This time, Fang Zaiji did not argue back but happily gazed at the various treasures inside the ring, beginning to plan what kind of treasures to refine.</p><p></p><p>"Could you craft a white robe and a folding fan for me, Master?" Suddenly, Li Fan made a suggestion.</p><p></p><p>"White robe and a folding fan?" Fang Zaiji was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>But looking at Li Fan's unwavering gaze, Fang Zaiji could only reluctantly agree. </p><p></p><p>Leaving the two of them for now, Li Fan entered the secluded chamber.</p><p></p><p>Taking out Xu Ke's essence blood and some materials, Li Fan, following the memory from Little Black, continued to refine the clone that would resemble an adult Xu Ke but with increased charm.</p><p></p><p>After seven days and nights, a perfect male body appeared in front of Li Fan. With extraordinary looks, fair skin like porcelain, eyes shining like stars, a faint smile on his lips, he looked like a celestial being.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the clone, Li Fan couldn't help but be attracted by his exquisite appearance, even momentarily enchanted.</p><p></p><p>It was then that he realized, in order to enhance the clone's appearance, he had subconsciously referenced the face of the most handsome person he had ever seen, Mr. Bai, during the refining process.</p><p></p><p>This resulted in the clone bearing some resemblance to Mr. Bai, though it was just a resemblance. The overall model was still based on Xu Ke's appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't be any issues."</p><p></p><p>The clone's appearance was too perfect, making Li Fan not think about refining another one even if there were minor accidents.</p><p></p><p>"And Xu Ke's essence blood has all been used up. Trying to refine another one wouldn't achieve the same effects."</p><p></p><p>Staring at the clone in front of him, after a moment of contemplation, Li Fan activated him with a gesture.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of dual perspectives surfaced once again.</p><p></p><p>"Although in the Foundation Establishment stage, it is just an empty vessel... But it's fine."</p><p></p><p>The clone put on his clothes, sat down, and immediately began cultivating the 'Heaven's Fortune Scripture'.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan took out the Mystic Bird's Feather and handed it to the clone.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment was originally a lofty achievement. With the Mystic Bird's Feather storing terrifying world fortunes, almost instantly, the clone successfully absorbed it and completed the Foundation Establishment process.</p><p></p><p>However, the Foundation Establishment stage was clearly not enough to fulfill the tasks of the clone; it needed to continue advancing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan crushed premium spirit stones, and pure spiritual energy formed a whirlwind in the chamber, madly pouring into the clone's body.</p><p></p><p>Like a giant whale sucking water, the clone absorbed and transformed all the spiritual energy. In less than half a day, a Foundation Establishment Pill was formed in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of the pill, there was a faint circle of purple, indicating a special aura.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid its power surpasses that of ordinary Foundation Establishment Pills," Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>After the pill, comes the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Normally, to perfectly disguise the clone, it would need to find a place to devour like a cave blessed by nature. However, with the existence of the Beastkind Realm, this hassle was eliminated.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan took the clone and arrived at the Beastkind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Li Fan's main body, the clone's comprehension and manipulation of the Beastkind Realm's world fortunes were smoother and more natural.</p><p></p><p>"Truly, individuals cannot be generalized."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the difference between them, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The clone closed his eyes, standing in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy from all directions converged on him, and to his surprise, the peaks and rivers of the Beastkind Realm rose into the air and flew towards him, forming a miniaturized paradise at an astonishing speed.</p><p></p><p>This grand scene naturally alarmed the disciples of the Medicine King Sect, but seeing Master Li Fan there, they didn't dare to act rashly. Their gazes were all fixed on the handsome man next to Li Fan, reluctant to leave, privately speculating on his true identity. By seizing nearly a third of the world from the Beastkind Realm, they created a 'Beastkind Paradise'.</p>

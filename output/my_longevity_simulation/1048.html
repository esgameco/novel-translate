            <p>Chapter 1046: Trapped Like a Turtle in a Jar</p><p></p><p>In the central four states of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, an extremely obvious dividing line appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the dividing line, the scenes on the earth and in the sky corresponded to each other.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a mirror had divided heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And the cracks that spread out from the dividing line seemed to indicate that this world was about to collapse!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene that resembled the end of the world, Li Fan suddenly realized: "So, Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, and Tianquan, the central four states of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, were built using the main body of the Tianxuan Mirror!"</p><p></p><p>"Using a mirror to change heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression gradually became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror had never mentioned such important information before.</p><p></p><p>Either it meant that the Tianxuan Mirror's idea of gaining freedom was fake, and it was just putting on an act in front of Li Fan and Mo Rubin. The purpose was to lure them into a trap.</p><p></p><p>Or, even the Tianxuan Mirror itself had forgotten that its main body was used to create the world of the four states of Xuanhuang!</p><p></p><p>The uneasiness in his heart grew stronger, and Mo Rubin still hadn't shown up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally wanted to leave directly, but when he quietly flew to the border of Tianquan State, he discovered with some horror that the soul-devouring white fog that originally stretched across heaven and earth had disappeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>Instead, there was an invisible light screen that completely sealed off the four states!</p><p></p><p>No one could enter or leave!</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Li Fan suddenly remembered the story of when he first saw the Burning Flame Sea and fled in panic, but was trapped and nearly died in the sea of clouds!</p><p></p><p>However, compared to back then, Li Fan had grown a lot.</p><p></p><p>Without panicking too much, Li Fan calmed himself down and returned to the center of Tianquan State. He randomly found a cultivator's cave abode and hid inside.</p><p></p><p>With the Endgame Separation Disc, the formations protecting these cave abodes could be completely ignored by him.</p><p></p><p>The buildings inside the cave abode were in the style of a water town courtyard, with no traces of cultivators living there.</p><p></p><p>It should be one of the many properties owned by the cave abode's owner.</p><p></p><p>However, the cave abode had all the necessary facilities. Li Fan found the Tianxuan Mirror and cautiously tested the Tianxuan Mirror's essence he carried with him.</p><p></p><p>"It hasn't failed."</p><p></p><p>"A lot of topics about the changes in the four states appeared in the Tianxuan Mirror, but they were locked and deleted the moment they appeared."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I can still see the message records."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly browsed the information in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Has the sky fallen?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Five Elders are attacking again? I said, the Five Elders suffered such a big loss last time, how could they just give up!"</p><p></p><p>"All means of teleportation have failed, and no one can enter or leave! The central four states have been completely sealed off!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, it's better to hide in the cave abodes and take shelter first, and not go out without authorization. That's all I have to say..."</p><p></p><p>Most of them were valueless remarks made by panicked cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, there were too many cultivators making remarks, so Li Fan still found some useful ones.</p><p></p><p>"Something big has happened! I just came out of the alliance headquarters, and it seems like a fight broke out inside!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't spread rumors here. The alliance headquarters is such an important place, how could anyone dare to fight there without authorization?"</p><p></p><p>"I saw it with my own eyes! Just as I was about to leave, I heard a loud explosive sound. Then I vaguely saw the scene of hundreds of figures suddenly rising up! That was close, I almost couldn't get out."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>The conversation abruptly ended here.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, there were also some cultivators inquiring about the records of those suddenly expelled from the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"In accordance with the plan discussed with Mo Rubin..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then took out a white jade horn and crushed it fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, a sharp sound that only specific cultivators could hear spread out from this place.</p><p></p><p>This was the signal for the Five Elders' assassins to take action.</p><p></p><p>From a distance, nearly a hundred black shadows could be seen flying into the Immortal Alliance headquarters through the cracks between heaven and earth. Li Fan, on the other hand, was very cautious and hid in another cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what exactly happened inside."</p><p></p><p>Before figuring it out, Li Fan did not act rashly. Instead, he chose to wait and see.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling sound between heaven and earth grew louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>The accumulated cracks also became more and more numerous, and were shocking to behold. It seemed as if the entire world could really split open at any time.</p><p></p><p>What made the cultivators of the Four Provinces even more uneasy was that despite such a major change, no one from the Immortal Alliance headquarters had yet stood up to explain the situation and reassure them.</p><p></p><p>This kind of terror lasted for half an incense stick's time.</p><p></p><p>The intermittent thunderous sounds gradually subsided, and the cracks that penetrated heaven and earth slowly closed up.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator appeared in the sky, and Li Fan instantly recognized this person.</p><p></p><p>One of the Dharma transmitters, Chen.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression and a murderous look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Chen's voice, like thunder, spread throughout the world. He announced that the small disturbance within the Immortal Alliance had been quelled. There was no need to panic.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Four Provinces must cooperate with the investigation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Chen hurriedly left and disappeared from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind the cultivators of the Four Provinces, who were discussing and unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Mo Rubin has been captured?" Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought that Mo Rubin's techniques were mysterious, and even if things were exposed, it wouldn't be so easy to capture him. So he felt a little more at ease.</p><p></p><p>After that, Li Fan hid in a new hiding place for another three days. He maintained the highest vigilance to prevent himself from being exposed.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the black-clothed cultivators of the Immortal Alliance came to search, but they failed to discover the hidden Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan also saw that those black-clothed cultivators seemed to be just going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>After a cursory search, they went to the next search location.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Seeing their attitude, Li Fan was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>The blockade and the great search lasted for ten days.</p><p></p><p>At first, the cultivators of the Four Provinces were somewhat cooperative, but as time passed, and there was no hope of a return to normalcy in sight.</p><p></p><p>Voices of discontent gradually spread.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators living in the Four Provinces of Heavenly Authority were definitely the most core and important part of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This kind of unreasonable blockade was bound to not last long.</p><p></p><p>After ten days, faced with the increasingly surging wave of opposition, the Immortal Alliance finally lifted the restrictions on the Four Provinces.</p><p></p><p>The ground scenery reflected in the sky slowly dissipated, and the boundaries of the Four Provinces reappeared with white fog barriers.</p><p></p><p>However, those huge cracks from heaven to earth did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>Like the wounds of heaven and earth, they reminded the cultivators of the recent changes and the unreality of this world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not escape immediately, but still lurked in the hidden cave dwelling. After more than a month, when the impact of this matter finally subsided and people were hardly heard discussing it anymore, he quietly left.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, he never received any message from Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was a call for help or a warning.</p><p></p><p>There was none at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan went to Wei Capital again, where the human avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror was located.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of that human avatar could no longer be seen.</p>

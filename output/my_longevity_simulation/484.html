        <div class="content">
            <p>You can't say that, besides the Cloud and Water Atlas, there must be other opportunities in the Cloud and Water Sky Palace. Sikong Yi remained calm, staring straight at the increasingly spectacular phenomenon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even with great opportunities, I'm afraid they can't compare to the Cloud and Water Atlas. Han Wuyou shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi was somewhat surprised: How do you mean?</p><p></p><p>Hehe, people only care about the 100,000 contribution points, blinded by their eyes. In fact, they overlook where the real opportunities lie. Han Wuyou smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>What is most important in cultivation? Connections! Background! He repeated.</p><p></p><p>In my view, the true value of this Cloud and Water Atlas is the opportunity to make connections with the senior who issued the task.</p><p></p><p>For a person to be able to offer 100,000 contribution points at will, they must have at least transformed their spiritual cultivation. If you can establish a relationship with them, even just a few words, it would make a significant difference for ordinary cultivators. Han Wuyou explained softly.</p><p></p><p>If you can obtain a stable way of keeping in touch, it will completely change your destiny even more.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sikong Yi seemed pensive.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>As the three chatted, a blue light swept through the clouds and the Cloud and Water Sky Palace officially opened.</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi, Baili Chen, and Han Wuyou, along with many other cultivators, flew inside.</p><p></p><p>After some twists and turns, they narrowly passed the test of the Qin Hall.</p><p></p><p>However, during their journey deeper, for some reason, the three caught the attention of another group of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>To their surprise, they ended up engaging in a fierce battle. The other side outnumbered them and their overall cultivation surpassed theirs.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Han Wuyou fell in the siege, not closing his eyes in death.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Sikong Yi, relying on the extremely powerful lifesaving ability of the "Substitute the Day and Change the Sun Art," miraculously survived.</p><p></p><p>In a disheveled state, he continued towards the position of the Taiyi Hall in his memory, a chilly feeling settling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Truly, the world is unpredictable. A figure like Daoist Han, with such potential, should have had a boundless future. Yet, he inexplicably died here.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to his confident demeanor not long ago, Sikong Yi felt a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>Although they had only known each other for a short time, Sikong Yi already saw him as a close friend.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity, heaven envies the talented!</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously, Sikong Yi reached for a storage ring in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It was the one he saw on Han Wuyou's body after finding him dead.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou was indeed very wealthy, with various arrays, magical tools, approximately 10,000 contribution points worth of spirit stones, and the most crucial, dozens of communication spirit symbols.</p><p></p><p>Connections, background...</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi kept repeating these words in his mind, as the sadness in his eyes gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Han, rest assured. I will ensure that you continue to live well!" </p><p></p><p>Using Daoist Han's life as a sacrifice, the subsequent actions indeed went much smoother.</p><p></p><p>Passing the test of the Insect Daoist, Sikong Yi endured the excruciating pain of a thousand swords piercing his body and arrived at the square in front of the Taiyi Hall.</p><p></p><p>At this time, it was quiet all around, with only him present.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his excitement, Sikong Yi controlled his clone and activated the "Steadfast Sea Divine Sword."</p><p></p><p>"Baili Chen, the 165th generation direct disciple of the Cloud and Water Sky Palace, seeks an audience with Ancestor Taiyi!" he called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>The ground trembled, and finally, he successfully deceived the Cloud and Water Atlas from the confused tortoise-snake monster.</p><p></p><p>After requesting to leave the Cloud and Water Sky Palace, Sikong Yi pretended to be calm and headed straight for the Island of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>With some precarious moments along the way, he successfully returned to the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>His clone, Baili Chen, chose to complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>Unable to discern the true nature of the "Cloud and Water Atlas," please wait.</p><p></p><p>The response from the Tianxuan Mirror made Sikong Yi's heart skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>Even the Tianxuan Mirror couldn't identify it? Besides the miniature landscapes, what other purpose does the Cloud and Water Atlas serve? Sikong Yi hadn't even had the chance to ponder this, as the subsequent hint from the Tianxuan Mirror shocked him more.</p><p></p><p>"The mission issuer... requests a visit from you. Do you accept?"</p><p></p><p>He's here! He's here! Sikong Yi was first taken aback and then felt his heart beating violently.</p><p></p><p>His blood surged, and the words of Han Wuyou before his death once again flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>True opportunities, connections!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, numerous thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a while, an old man with white hair and a seemingly kind face appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Respectfully, Sikong Yi bowed and then tremblingly held out the rainbow-colored model with both hands.</p><p></p><p>The old man took the Cloud and Water Atlas, carefully examined it, and sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>His cloudy eyes kept turning, as if recalling something.</p><p></p><p>"What is the situation in the Cloud and Water Sky Palace now?" he inquired.</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi swallowed a mouthful of saliva and stuttered out his response.</p><p></p><p>The old man didn't show any concern for Sikong Yi's nervousness but instead nodded slightly as he listened to his description.</p><p></p><p>After Sikong Yi finished speaking, silence once again enveloped the space within the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Watching the unmoving figure in front of him, seemingly lost in memories, Sikong Yi once again recalled Han Wuyou's words.</p><p></p><p>"Now in the world of cultivation, relying solely on being ruthless and brave is not enough. You need a background, you need connections!"</p><p></p><p>His heart rate increased, and eventually, he couldn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>Summoning courage, he asked, "Senior, may I ask what else I could do for you?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Physician raised his head and gave Sikong Yi a slight glance.</p><p></p><p>Feeling his heart being squeezed tightly, his body seemed frozen, and his brain ceased thinking.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, he heard a soft chuckle from the Heavenly Physician, "Very well, I do have a task for you."</p><p></p><p>"Go on my behalf to the Cloud and Water Sky Palace once more and place this object there."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the old man took out a small white jade pendant and handed it to Sikong Yi.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sikong Yi was extremely joyful.</p><p></p><p>But he dared not show any excitement on his face, carefully and respectfully taking the pendant.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, the white jade pendant seemed to have nothing special, except that it looked exactly like the elderly man in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"I will not let the senior down!" Sikong Yi put away the pendant and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Sikong Yi received a notification of 200,000 contribution points being credited to his account from the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>His brain was suddenly blank.</p><p></p><p>After the old man's figure disappeared from the Tianxuan Mirror for a long time, Sikong Yi began to think again.</p><p></p><p>Just casually running an errand and earning another 100,000 contribution points!</p><p></p><p>This senior is probably far beyond the realm of transforming his spiritual cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Opportunity, true opportunity!</p><p></p><p>If he had to rely solely on himself, who knows how long it would take to accumulate 100,000 contribution points! But now, with just a few words from a major figure, he obtained them easily.</p><p></p><p>Friend Han did not deceive me!</p><p></p><p>Excited, Sikong Yi saw a bright future for himself and couldn't help but let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>After calming down, he didn't dare to neglect the instructions of the white-haired old man, and once again headed straight to the Cloud and Water Sky Palace.</p><p></p><p>The pendant in the storage ring emitted a burst of white light and flew straight into the sky, dissolving and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>With the mission completed, Sikong Yi breathed a sigh of relief, ensuring no one was around before quietly leaving.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, outside the Cloud and Water Sky Palace, a hidden figure quietly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Physician...hm!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 949</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan, who had quietly changed his appearance, sat in the corner, carefully listening to the conversations of the cultivators inside the fortress.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard that the Immortal Alliance seems to have no plans to build a floating city in Jiushan Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of the unstable space here. Although the Heavenly Venerable's Dharma Appearance has thoroughly plowed through Jiushan Prefecture, it hasn't changed the spatial characteristics. The teleportation array still can't be used stably."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the cultivators all realized.</p><p></p><p>"Not building a floating celestial city... The Myriad Immortal Alliance surely won't leave such a large territory unattended, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hard to say. Previously, we could rely on the geographical advantages of Jiushan and build cities along the mountains. Now that this place is flat, there's no natural defense. The key point is that the teleportation array can't be used. Once surrounded, we can't get rapid support. Both the defense cost and effect are too poor."</p><p></p><p>"You guys don't understand a thing! The Five Elders have all been beaten by our Myriad Immortal Alliance to the point of personally seeking peace. Would they still dare to actively invade? What danger could there be?"</p><p></p><p>"This fellow Daoist is truly too naive. Haven't you heard that the balance of power has no fixed rules since ancient times? How can a temporary victory or defeat determine a hero? Last time we were able to achieve victory only because our Myriad Immortal Alliance launched a surprise attack when they were unprepared. In my opinion, if both sides fight again, the outcome is still uncertain!"</p><p></p><p>"When our Myriad Immortal Alliance was defeated before, you didn't say that."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the fortress were very enthusiastic about discussing the situation in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Each had their own opinion, arguing endlessly, no one giving in to anyone. It was quite lively.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed for a while and found that besides himself, there was another cultivator who was only listening attentively without participating in the discussion. </p><p></p><p>This person looked to be in his thirties, wearing a black robe with silver-white hair tied up. Listening to everyone's discussion, a hint of disdain flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He clearly didn't quite agree with the views of the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, bought a pot of excellent spirit wine, and sat down in front of the other party.</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you, fellow Daoist?" Li Fan asked with a smile, pouring a cup for the silver-haired cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The silver-haired cultivator was still full of vigilance towards Li Fan's unprovoked enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>He didn't answer Li Fan's question, but narrowed his eyes and kept sizing up this overly familiar cultivator in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoist, there's no need to be suspicious. At a glance, I could tell that you have an extraordinary bearing, unlike ordinary people, and have your own insights. You're also very curious about the future situation in Jiushan Prefecture, so I wanted to boldly ask for your opinion."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, the silver-haired cultivator finally let go of his vigilance upon seeing Li Fan's sincere face.</p><p></p><p>Downing the spirit wine in one gulp, the silver-haired cultivator transmitted his voice, "Hehe, you asked the right person!"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Xin Hongzhang. In terms of being well-informed, none of these people present can compare to me!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan hurriedly poured another cup for Xin Hongzhang.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was very satisfied with Li Fan's attitude and transmitted, "Considering our fateful encounter, I'll reveal a bit to you. Remember not to spread it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, what they said..."</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Wanxian Alliance indeed doesn't plan to build a floating city in Jiushan Prefecture anymore. However, this doesn't mean that the Immortal Alliance is going to give up on this place."</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, the Immortal Alliance has decided to establish the first free trade prefecture in history here."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Free trade prefecture?" Looking at the other party's solemn appearance, Li Fan couldn't help but become truly interested. "What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>"But these are all old stories. The Divine Lord's Dharma Appearance showed its might, and the entire Jiushan Prefecture was razed to the ground. Although the Wanfa Chamber of Commerce wasn't completely wiped out, it also suffered heavy losses. It would be difficult for them to be like before..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"However, that leader of the Wanfa Chamber of Commerce is indeed a character. He actually persuaded the Wanxian Alliance to lift trade restrictions in this Jiushan Prefecture. The Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association cultivators can all come here to freely trade for the resources they need. They only need to pay a small amount of tax."</p><p></p><p>"Led by the Immortal Alliance, with the assistance of the experienced Wanfa Chamber of Commerce. It's said that they have already reached a secret agreement with the Five Elders Association, ensuring that even if they start a war in the future, both sides will not choose to fight in Jiushan Prefecture..."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, do you know what it means to be able to confirm safe free trade?" Xin Hongzhang stared at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, his eyes showing excitement.</p><p></p><p>"It can be imagined that Jiushan Prefecture, which is still desolate now, will soon become extremely prosperous. It may even surpass the four major prefectures in the hinterland. If one can seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, they will surely be able to change their fate against the heavens..." Xin Hongzhang also drank another cup of spiritual wine fiercely, venting his inner excitement.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this reason, would I travel thousands of miles to come to this remote border area?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lowered his head and remained silent for a long time, seeming to be digesting this shocking news.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his head and said to Xin Hongzhang with full gratitude, "Such important insider information, yet you casually told me, a passerby you met by chance..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang waved his hand, "Hehe, if you hadn't taken the initiative to strike up a conversation and ordered a pot of good wine, I wouldn't have told you about this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, this matter can't be considered a top secret. The Immortal Alliance's announcement should come out soon. You and I can only occupy a little bit of a head start."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, if you have ample contribution points on hand, you might as well pay close attention to the cave dwelling purchase qualifications in Jiushan Prefecture recently."</p><p></p><p>"I dare to bet that within ten years, the price of cave dwellings here will at least double! Even a three or four-fold increase is not a problem. If you can buy a few cave dwellings at the beginning and sell them off later..."</p><p></p><p>"It's simply a profitable business with no capital!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang whispered again.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xin is really far-sighted!" Li Fan looked as if he had just woken up from a dream, patting his own head. "How come I didn't think of that?"</p><p></p><p>He then continued to flatter incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Having drunk too much spiritual wine and hearing Li Fan's compliments, Xin Hongzhang couldn't help but feel a little smug.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he saw that Li Fan seemed to be hesitating about something.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as if he had made up his mind, he whispered mysteriously, "Brother Xin treats me so well, I can't be stingy either."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I have a secret technique called [Divine Possession]. If you don't mind, I can teach it to you."</p>

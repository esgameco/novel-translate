        <h1>Chapter 913</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>Although he had no idea why the Heavenly Doctor would suddenly appear here, ever since the last time when Li Fan was nearly unable to successfully return after being "looked, smelled, asked and cut" by the Heavenly Doctor, he had already rehearsed countless times in his mind the countermeasures for when he met the Heavenly Doctor again.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in a flash, Li Fan had already made what he considered to be the most correct choice.</p><p></p><p>His mind was completely empty, his thoughts seemingly frozen.</p><p></p><p>However, such an abnormal performance instantly attracted the Heavenly Doctor's attention. </p><p></p><p>He first lightly pointed at Han Zhong, and several streaks of silver light arrived in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Like silver needles, they completely sealed Han Zhong in space.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Han Zhong's face solidified, even his thoughts were frozen in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Then the Heavenly Doctor looked at Li Fan with his turbid eyes, a playful expression appearing on his face: "Such vigilance..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that we have met before, young friend?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't think at all, his subconscious reaction was already made.</p><p></p><p>"Cut the crap, scum like you should be executed by everyone!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shouted angrily with a face full of righteousness.</p><p></p><p>Then he successively shot out several Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword Lights!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the component originating from the Desolate Sword Intent was greatly increased in these black sword lights!</p><p></p><p>Facing the incoming sword lights, the Heavenly Doctor did not dodge.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the extremely familiar sword intent, a ripple flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Without seeing him make any movements, the trajectories of the hundreds of black sword lights that were originally straight began to bend on their own.</p><p></p><p>They all gathered in the Heavenly Doctor's outstretched left hand.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor casually pinched them into a black ball, and Li Fan also lost control over them.</p><p></p><p>This skill that could be described as miraculous made Li Fan startled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This time it was not an act.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly reacted and continued his performance.</p><p></p><p>"You old thief!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his attack being blocked so easily by the other party, Li Fan showed grief and indignation on his face and cursed angrily.</p><p></p><p>Then he pointed at the Heavenly Doctor's glabella, but his figure transformed into a light and retreated explosively at the same time.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was horrified to find that Han Zhong's originally small room suddenly seemed to become infinitely large at this moment. No matter how much he flew and escaped, he could not leave this place!</p><p></p><p>"Desolate Sword, Cloud Dream Illusion Technique..."</p><p></p><p>"What else do you know?"</p><p></p><p>Facing Li Fan's frequent curses and disrespect, the Heavenly Doctor did not get angry.</p><p></p><p>"Humph! Don't even think about getting anything out of me, you dog thief! Today I'm unlucky to fall into your hands! Kill me or skin me as you wish!" Li Fan seemed to give up arguing as if he knew he was not the Heavenly Doctor's match.</p><p></p><p>He disdainfully spat at the Heavenly Doctor and said with great righteousness.</p><p></p><p>"Humph..." The Heavenly Doctor shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>But he was not surprised by Li Fan's performance.</p><p></p><p>"After so many years, they still haven't changed at all. They still hate me so much..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew into a rage: "Deep hatred from a sea of blood, will not change even after thousands of lifetimes!"</p><p></p><p>"Young man. If I said I was a good person, would you believe it?" The Heavenly Doctor was not angry, but looked at Li Fan with a smile and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed the Heavenly Doctor carefully again.</p><p></p><p>White-haired and kind-looking. Indeed, if judging purely from appearance, he didn't seem to be a bad person at all.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still snorted coldly: "Old thief, don't even think about deceiving me! Knowing a person's face doesn't mean knowing their heart!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He laughed in spite of himself, then asked, "You can believe the words of a madman, so why can't you believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could answer, the Heavenly Doctor continued, "If I were really a bad person, would I have let Tian Jue live well until now? He's confused and crazy, and you can't figure it out either?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression suddenly froze, as if he had fallen into contemplation. Judging from his expression, there was indeed some confusion in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes, things are not as simple as they appear. Even if you see it with your own eyes, it is still the case," the Heavenly Doctor sighed slightly, with a tone that seemed to have endless vicissitudes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent, obviously not easily convinced by the Heavenly Doctor's words.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Doctor didn't seem to care.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, I will soon thoroughly resolve everything."</p><p></p><p>He said this to himself.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was talking to Li Fan, but also like he was talking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The young man has a good character, just too reckless. In the future, you should be more cautious when doing things, plan before you act," the Heavenly Doctor commented, like an elder in the family teaching his children.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out a jade slip out of nowhere and threw it towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip did not look like an ordinary item, with nine sacred auras of golden light surrounding it. As it passed through the air, it even caused layers of space to vibrate.</p><p></p><p>"It's always good for young people to read more books."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let me take care of business."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor turned his attention to Han Zhong, who had been frozen all along.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man narrowed his eyes, his expression focused.</p><p></p><p>A silver needle appeared silently in his right hand, and then with a flick of his finger, it shot towards Han Zhong's Baihui acupoint.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>The silver needle penetrated the bone, and Han Zhong, who had been completely frozen, suddenly struggled violently.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor remained expressionless, and several silver needles were released simultaneously, tightly controlling Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suppressed the urge to read the golden jade slip in his heart, his mind empty.</p><p></p><p>He just kept observing the Heavenly Doctor's movements with all his attention.</p><p></p><p>When eighty-one silver needles were inserted all over his body, the expression on Han Zhong's face completely froze.</p><p></p><p>It showed a hideous and distorted appearance, with eye sockets, mouth, and nostrils, as if corroded by something, melting into dark holes.</p><p></p><p>An invisible aura that made one's hair stand on end flowed out from Han Zhong's body through these holes.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Heavenly Doctor's seal, Li Fan, who was beside him, inexplicably felt a strong sense of crisis in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His eyelids twitched, as if a great disaster was imminent!</p><p></p><p>He retreated behind the Heavenly Doctor without a sound, and only then did the sense of crisis slightly diminish.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor didn't pay attention to Li Fan's small movements and took out a jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>The mouth of the bottle was aimed at Han Zhong's head and gently tossed over.</p><p></p><p>This jade bottle seemed to have the function of absorbing the invisible aura, and slowly, the source of Li Fan's sense of crisis gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And in this process, Han Zhong's body completely turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>After everything ended, the Heavenly Doctor solemnly took back the jade bottle and sealed it.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Looking at the jade bottle in the Heavenly Doctor's hand, Li Fan couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"This is a disease," the Heavenly Doctor sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This little guy, I don't know if his luck is good or bad. He found the Eye of the Heavenly Beast and left the Xuanhuang Realm. As a result, he was tainted with this disease."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think of the phenomenon of desolation and decay that occurred in his soul when he first came into contact with Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>"Disease?" Li Fan pondered.</p>

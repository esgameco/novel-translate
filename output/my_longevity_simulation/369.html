        <h1>Chapter 369</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Inside the base of Jiaxu, Li Fan looked slightly stunned at the sudden visit of Xue Mu and others. After a moment of thought, he decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>"I am not being modest. During the assessment at the Lanhun Abbey, my affinity level with the Tianxuan Mirror is just average," Li Fan said. "Xue Mu can verify this."</p><p></p><p>"I appreciate your kindness, but my abilities are limited, and I cannot bear such a heavy responsibility."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Jiang's formation level is far superior to mine and is highly respected. I can see that there is no one else more suitable than him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The formation master named Jiang Qigui looked at the surrounding practitioners with some unfriendly eyes and hastily responded, "Li Fan is joking. Your contributions are evident to everyone, how can I..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Li Fan interrupted with a smile, "Senior Jiang, don't misunderstand. Every word I said is sincere and heartfelt."</p><p></p><p>"As is well known, the final construction process of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation requires communication with the central formation hub for continuous debugging in the future."</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed not my expertise, and it is not my intention to decline."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Qigui hesitating, Li Fan added, "I understand your concerns. Constructing the outer and internal formations requires more effort but relatively less contribution."</p><p></p><p>"On the other hand, the central core area does not require much effort, yet the contributions obtained are much more. It's not about escaping responsibility but choosing the most efficient way of formation construction."</p><p></p><p>"So, Senior Jiang, there is no need to refuse."</p><p></p><p>"Who else is more suitable for this important task than you?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Li Fan scanned around to show his sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Having heard Li Fan's heartfelt words, Jiang Qigui's face turned slightly red.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, he bowed deeply towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I will respectfully accept it!" Jiang Qigui said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his hands, expressing earnestly, "It will be hard work for you in the future."</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Huang Fu Song, accompanied by two black-robed practitioners, arrived at the base of Jiaxu. Prior to this visit, they had received a message from Li Fan that the Tianxuan Mirror, the central formation hub, had been sent over.</p><p></p><p>"Respects to Senior Huang Fu!" Li Fan saluted.</p><p></p><p>"You brat..." Huang Fu Song looked at Li Fan with a complicated expression.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well!" Patting Li Fan on the shoulder, Huang Fu Song did not say much more.</p><p></p><p>He took out a damaged jade token, turned around, and completed the fitting with the jade tokens in the hands of the two black-robed practitioners.</p><p></p><p>In the unfolded light screen, countless characters cascaded like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>A subtle wave emanated from the light screen, passing over the surroundings, seemingly conducting identity verification.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the wave retracted, and a quaint and exquisite bronze mirror appeared from the light screen.</p><p></p><p>As the characters flowed into the mirror, the light screen vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only the bronze mirror floating in mid-air, emitting a serene dark light around it.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, Huang Fu Song began to recite incantations.</p><p></p><p>Pointing outside the base, towards the center of the devouring elemental mist.</p><p></p><p>The mist emitted ripples, as if something in the depths of the mist responded to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted slightly, identifying it as the core area for the construction of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>As expected, a moment later, a flash of cyan light tore through the mist.</p><p></p><p>Directly towards the Jiaxu base below.</p><p></p><p>Right at the suspended bronze mirror.</p><p></p><p>The cyan light swirling around slowly converged and disappeared, leaving the bronze mirror looking as ordinary as any common item.</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song finally breathed a sigh of relief, took out a crimson square wooden box from his chest, and stored the bronze mirror inside.</p><p></p><p>As the mirror entered the wooden box, the physical box transformed into a red shadow before everyone's eyes, then consolidated into a red light dot that flew to Huang Fu Song's forehead and settled there.</p><p></p><p>Without explaining his actions, Huang Fu Song spoke to everyone in a solemn tone, "I will oversee the central formation hub until its placement is completed."</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Qigui, how long do you all need for this process?"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Jiang Qigui replied, "Within seven days, with everyone's combined efforts, it can be completed."</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song nodded slowly, "Time is of the essence. Once this formation is completed, I have other places to rush to."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, his face slightly eased, "Thanks to the hard work of Li Fan, the progress of this formation's construction is among the fastest."</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, the current top-ranked Tianchen Prefecture has not yet completed its entire formation; they should still be in the process of constructing the central core area."</p><p></p><p>"If you all work harder, there might be a chance to surpass them..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Huang Fu Song was encouraging everyone, a sudden cry came from outside the council chamber, from the direction of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? How did the top-ranked suddenly gain so many points?"</p><p></p><p>"Now there's a clear gap between first and second place!"</p><p></p><p>As these words reached the ears of the practitioners present, their gazes towards Huang Fu Song became strange.</p><p></p><p>"Heh... you're a bit late. But you can still aim for second place," Huang Fu Song said with a thick skin, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, time is of the essence, let's depart quickly," he ordered.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was preparing to go to the central area of the formation to complete the final work, another cry rang out, catching the attention of Li Fan and others.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Look, Guo Yezhong, who has always been in last place, is finally making a move!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, despite having few points, he still remains at the bottom. But at least he has finally started working."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, Xue Mu, and Jiang Qigui exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>They all felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Did Guo Yezhong gain points because the first place Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation was completed? Is there a connection between the two incidents?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards Huang Fu Song, seeking answers. The plump man shrugged, looking completely clueless.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1149: Annihilating the Festering Wound</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Army had been guarding the Chita Abyss for too long. </p><p></p><p>Some of them were even born here and had never left this place until their death.</p><p></p><p>Family, friends.</p><p></p><p>Everything they were familiar with bloomed and withered within the Eternal Immortal Fortress.</p><p></p><p>For the various wonders of the true Xuanhuang Realm that they were protecting, the vast majority of the Qingxuan Army had only heard about them through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>They had never truly seen them with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>And the horror of the Chita Abyss made it impossible for them to even fantasize about leaving one day.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Li Fan brought a glimmer of dawn to their endlessly bleak lives.</p><p></p><p>"With the two lords joining hands, they might really be able to permanently eliminate the demonic sound..." </p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Army cheered thunderously, staring hopefully at Li Fan and Shang Shaojun standing outside the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"The cruelest thing in the world is to give hope and then ruthlessly destroy it." Shang Shaojun looked back at the expressions on the faces of the generals under his command and sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"I only agreed to your request out of necessity just now. But in fact, I'm not optimistic." He transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"What's truly troublesome about the Chita Abyss is not just the demonic sound. Otherwise, any Dharma transmitter from the Immortal Alliance could easily suppress it with a casual effort. What the Immortal Alliance's higher-ups are really wary of is the distorted dao of world destruction from the bottom of the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"It's like a wound. If punctured, pus will flow out from it and infect the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Left with no choice, Shang Shaojun had to explain the reason why the Immortal Alliance only guarded and did not choose to permanently eliminate the root cause.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic sound is just a superficial phenomenon. To truly eliminate it forever, unless while suppressing the demonic sound, you can also properly handle this wound."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun originally wanted to use these words to dispel Li Fan's idea of dragging him to the bottom of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, after hearing his explanation, the other party wasn't surprised at all, as if he had long known the truth of the Chita Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He even smiled slightly and asked in return: "The demonic sound is a superficial phenomenon, the wound..."</p><p></p><p>"Is also a superficial phenomenon."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao circulates, birth and death never cease. If it was an ordinary world trauma, at most in a hundred years, it could heal. However, the Chita Abyss has been rampant for over several hundred years. Yet it shows no signs of stopping, instead growing more and more intense. Shaojun, aren't you curious about this?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards Li Fan was filled with surprise and uncertainty. </p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought Li Fan was a cultivator with powerful strength and full of passion, but now it seemed...</p><p></p><p>"My identity is not important, what's important is you, Shaojun."</p><p></p><p>"Regarding everything in the White Mist Labyrinth, and the Myriad Immortal Alliance's strange attitude towards this matter back then. Are you really not curious?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's expression changed: "You're from the Five Elders Council?"</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan sat cross-legged with his sword again: "I will wait here for three days."</p><p></p><p>"After three days, I will charge into the abyss with my sword."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether Shaojun is willing to come along... I won't force you."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun remained silent.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered like water and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Three days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Fan remained seated at the mouth of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Whenever demonic sounds reappeared, he easily eliminated them with sword light.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Army in the Eternal Immortal Fortress</p><p></p><p>The soldiers all gazed at Li Fan's back with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Many wise individuals even recorded the image of Li Fan's sword light extinguishing the demons.</p><p></p><p>They repeatedly pondered over it.</p><p></p><p>Some truly gained insights and greatly improved their strength.</p><p></p><p>The agreed-upon time between the two parties had arrived. The Holy Fetus Li Fan did not hesitate in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the masses, he rose and slowly walked towards the interior of the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He had no intention of waiting for Shao Jun at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan was about to set off alone, whispers inevitably arose within the Eternal Immortal Fortress.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if Shao Jun's prestige was previously high, if he did not react to this matter, his image would collapse beyond repair.</p><p></p><p>These Qingxuan soldiers were his trusted subordinates cultivated over a hundred years. If he lost their wholehearted support, it would be an extremely painful loss for Shao Jun.</p><p></p><p>With Shao Jun's strength, even if he entered the Chizha Abyss and failed to suppress the demonic sounds, at most he would only suffer some injuries. Preserving his life would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan was certain that Shao Jun would definitely appear.</p><p></p><p>Even if he just followed behind Li Fan to put on a show.</p><p></p><p>As expected, just as Li Fan fearlessly set foot into the Chizha Abyss, Shao Jun's figure appeared right on time.</p><p></p><p>"Escorting the Army Leader!"</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan soldiers shouted in unison like thunder, disappearing abruptly after Li Fan had completely entered the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond and only observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat similar to the situation in the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Endless darkness, causing one's heart to palpitate. The difference was that within the darkness, there were continuous dark red light bands, like the flowing blood of some ancient exotic beast.</p><p></p><p>From these blood-colored light bands, ash-like substances occasionally floated out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out and grabbed a piece. The decaying aura instantly began to corrode his entire body from the point of contact.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the body of the Holy Fetus Li Fan turned into the same ash-like substance.</p><p></p><p>A sword light tore through the darkness, and Li Fan was reborn from his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"These remnant ashes are the result of being tainted by the law of world distortion and destruction. This is only the outermost periphery of the abyss. The deeper you go, the more profound the distortion becomes. It can even contaminate and destroy the foundation of our cultivation." Shao Jun transmitted a warning.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of cultivation he referred to were the Foundational Qi Objects, the Nascent Soul Grotto-Heavens, and so on.</p><p></p><p>As long as these new roots of the Dao remained undestroyed, cultivators could be reborn endlessly. But if they were also damaged, then the cultivators would naturally perish along with them.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, we need to be wary of the sudden outbreaks of demonic sound tides. The demonic sounds outside the abyss and inside the abyss are two completely different concepts. Back then, I prided myself on my firm will, but I couldn't last more than a few breaths before nearly being driven mad by those horrifying whispers."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun rambled on and on, but Li Fan turned a deaf ear and flew unwaveringly towards the bottom of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he passed, sword lights flashed, and those continuous, drifting dark red blood shadows were all exterminated.</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun stared for a while and discovered that those abnormal things showed no signs of rebirth. He couldn't help but be secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 【Sword of Annihilation】. Wherever the sword light reaches, all turns into nothingness."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice suddenly rang in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"A festering wound only needs to be cut clean."</p><p></p><p>He said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"As for those demonic sounds..."</p><p></p><p>"I have a supreme secret technique that I will impart to you, ensuring your peace of mind."</p>

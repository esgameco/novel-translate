        <div class="content">
            <p>On the surface, it seemed that Li Fan was not cultivating.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had already divided his mind, separately studying the formation techniques, reading through the "Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture", and cultivating to accumulate karma and improve his cultivation...</p><p></p><p>He was able to multitask efficiently and methodically.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He played with the silver token in his hand, and as his divine sense entered it, a lot of information instantly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was called the "Cosmos Token", and it was a magical tool created to match this set of Cosmos Courtyards.</p><p></p><p>In addition to basic functions such as communication and storage, its biggest use was to control the residential courtyards within the Cosmos Courtyards.</p><p></p><p>The residences in the courtyards were divided into three different grades: high, medium, and low.</p><p></p><p>Different grades had different treatments.</p><p></p><p>The one Li Fan was assigned to belonged to the high grade.</p><p></p><p>"It should be based on the results of the previous test," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the token, Li Fan opened the Heavenly Profound Mirror again.</p><p></p><p>He started to check the information on the recent hot events.</p><p></p><p>In addition to some major events that affected the entire Profound Yellow Realm,</p><p></p><p>there was more hot information about the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>Both the density of information and the number of people communicating far exceeded that of when he was in the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>It gave Li Fan a sense of "prosperity".</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept over the various pieces of information.

Fellow Daoists, it's better not to take risks!"</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Immortal Jicheng resigned from his position as the Chief Commander of the Garrison Academy. It is rumored that he was unfortunately hit by the enemy's evil technique in the previous battle between the 'Virtual and Real Heavenly Venerate Plan' and the Five Elders Society's infiltration of the Harmonious Dao cultivators, greatly reducing his lifespan. Exhausted in mind and body, he was unable to preside over the overall situation."</p><p></p><p>"In front of the 'Wall of Mortals Becoming Immortals' in Tianyun Province, another cultivator has gained insight into the Great Dao this year. He finally achieved the realm of Five Laws Golden Core!"</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Idiot has recently been wandering near Tianquan Province. Fellow Daoists, please be careful to avoid him!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Man Fisherman appeared in Xiangxiang City, Tianshu Province yesterday, and is expected to stay for about seven days this time. Those who seek opportunities, hurry up and go!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Old Man Fisherman..." Li Fan showed an interested look and clicked in.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that this Old Man Fisherman was a cultivator who looked a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>Dressed as a fisherman, his cultivation level was unknown.</p><p></p><p>He just kept muttering to himself that he couldn't find his things.</p><p></p><p>His whereabouts were erratic, with records of his appearances in various provinces.</p><p></p><p>As for the so-called opportunity, it was a matter of luck.</p><p></p><p>Showing one's belongings to Old Man Fisherman to see if there were any items he had lost.</p><p></p><p>Generally, Old Man Fisherman would shake his head repeatedly, saying that these were not his things.</p><p></p><p>But occasionally, he would also show interest in certain items and propose the idea of exchanging them.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fisherman was generous in his dealings, and the value of the techniques and magic treasures he offered almost always far exceeded what the cultivators provided. New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùìºùì±ùìæùîÅ.ùì¨ùì∏ùì∂</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many cultivators wanted to take some unknown items and try their luck.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there had been foolish cultivators who had the idea of forcibly robbing him.</p><p></p><p>But anyone who did so did not survive.</p><p></p><p>"Quite interesting..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that once you enter this Cosmos Courtyard, you can't leave until the closed training is over. Otherwise, it would be nice to go around and join in the excitement."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this information, Li Fan secretly lamented the pity in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After cultivating and adjusting in the small courtyard for a few days, Li Fan finally received a message from the Cosmos Token.</p><p></p><p>The personnel had arrived, and the group training would officially begin tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a set of white clothes and a shiny golden ball also appeared in the Cosmos Token.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what material this small ball was made of, but it felt extremely hard when squeezed.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine sense could not penetrate it.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, golden light flowed inside the small ball, as if there was some kind of liquid inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan changed into the white clothes and quietly waited for tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>The next day, a wave of fluctuations surged on the Cosmos Token, followed by an eruption of light.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, there were more than a thousand people wearing the same clothes.</p><p></p><p>"According to what Zhang Zhiliang said before, there are three spots for this group training from the Congyu Sea Province."</p><p></p><p>"Then there must be more than three hundred provinces just in the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"No, maybe some provinces have several times the quota of the Congyu Sea."</p><p></p><p>"But even so, it shows how vast this Profound Yellow Realm is."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering, the white-robed Ji Hongdao he had seen before quietly appeared above the crowd.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze around and said in a clear voice, "I'm sure you already know the purpose of this training."</p><p></p><p>"It is to accelerate the popularization of the 'Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation' in our Myriad Immortals Alliance, so that all enemies of the Five Elders Society will have nowhere to hide in front of us."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking, you must have heard its name countless times. But there shouldn't be many who have actually seen it."</p><p></p><p>"Today, let me first show it to you."</p><p></p><p>With Ji Hongdao's words, an image of a mirror suddenly flashed above everyone's heads.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, three sky-penetrating pillars of light descended from the sky, locking onto three positions on the plain below.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene, everyone was stunned at first, and then concentrated their spirits to sense the locations locked by the light pillars.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, because no matter how he sensed it, there was nothing there.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the expressions of the people around him, almost everyone was like this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Hongdao spoke again, "Are you surprised? Obviously, there is nothing in your perception. But the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation has given a mark..."</p><p></p><p>His voice suddenly rose a tone, "This is the 'Dao-Self Unity' stealth technique of the Five Elders Society. It is by relying on this secret technique that they have been able to repeatedly invade our territory as if entering a land with no one."</p><p></p><p>"But now, with the birth of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation, all of this is in the past!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao lightly pointed, and the three pillars of light suddenly became even brighter.</p><p></p><p>The air distorted, and at the locked locations, three cultivators with miserable appearances and shackles on their bodies revealed their figures.</p><p></p><p>These three cultivators stared at Li Fan and the others in the sky with hatred.</p><p></p><p>But they could not move or speak.</p><p></p><p>They could only be reduced to teaching materials for the lecture and experiment.</p><p></p><p>"The basic principle of Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking is the 'Soul Contract' that every cultivator of the Five Elders Society will sign..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao began to explain to the elite formation masters from various provinces present.</p><p></p><p>In order to demonstrate the uniqueness of the souls of the Five Elders Society cultivators, he even forcibly extracted the soul of one of them using a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>And the pillars of light between heaven and earth also followed the movement of that soul with traces of golden light.</p><p></p><p>The pain of having one's soul extracted alive was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Among them, quite a few young cultivators showed a look of reluctance upon seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao let out a cold laugh, not saying a word, but keeping their reactions in mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed during the lecture.</p><p></p><p>After explaining the basic structure of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation, Ji Hongdao said again, "The key to constructing the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking is to build a formation pivot that can distinguish the differences in souls."</p>

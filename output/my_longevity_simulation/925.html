Whether male or female in the Dadao Sect, they were all momentarily stunned upon seeing her.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Junior Sister Jingtong for advancing to the Hedao realm!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of Fang Dingge, the sect master of Dadao Sect, spread throughout, followed by a series of congratulatory voices.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that the always weak Yuehua lineage would be the first to have a core disciple advance to Hedao.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, Huo Jingtong had only been cultivating for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>She was really too young.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as she didn't deliberately seek death, it was very likely that she would live to see the day of consuming the Fruit of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>A potential Longevity realm expert, the situation in Dadao Sect was bound to change completely.</p><p></p><p>Countless people's thoughts were stirred.</p><p></p><p>After reacting, they all sent their subordinates to prepare congratulatory gifts.</p><p></p><p>The celebration ceremony for Huo Jingtong's advancement to Hedao was held very grandly under Fang Dingge's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the entire sect congratulate her, but invitations were also sent to the other sects of the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>It lasted for more than a month before the curtain finally fell. New 69 Book Bar 8 9 shux.com</p><p></p><p>After everything settled down, Huo Jingtong, who had already become a Hedao cultivator, quietly returned to the Liuyue Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Li Qing had been waiting here for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Huo Jingtong and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong knew in her heart that her advancement to Hedao was inseparable from Li Qing's help.</p><p></p><p>"You scoundrel..."</p><p></p><p>"Have you tasted the flavor of being a Hedao cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's eyes were hazy as she spoke words of extreme contrast.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she casually set up a restriction, sealing the door.</p><p></p><p>It was only after a full seven days of closed-door cultivation that she left somewhat reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>And the feedback from being a Hedao cultivator was indeed beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Even because after advancing to Hedao, Huo Jingtong was tainted with the power of the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth, causing the Reverse Ethics Scripture to once again come into contact with other principles of Heaven and Earth besides [Reversing Yang to Yin].</p><p></p><p>It directly helped Li Qing, who had recently advanced to Nascent Soul, to break through to the middle stage of Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>One step closer to Li Qing's goal.</p><p></p><p>After Huo Jingtong advanced to Hedao, as the only existing Hedao expert in the Yuehua lineage, she naturally became the true ruler of Yuehua.</p><p></p><p>Hedao cultivators had many privileges.</p><p></p><p>Not only could they designate a separate mountain peak as their own residence, but they could also decide the life and death of ordinary disciples.</p><p></p><p>And the Dadao Sect had great trust in this Hedao cultivator who had grown up in the sect since childhood. New 89 Book Bar â†’ 89shux.com</p><p></p><p>As a support for her revitalization of the Yuehua lineage, Huo Jingtong was even given many permissions that other Hedao elders did not have.</p><p></p><p>So, Huo Jingtong, who could be said to have a hand covering the sky in the Yuehua lineage, gradually began her plan.</p><p></p><p>After personally experiencing the terrifying nature of Li Qing's special physique and being the biggest beneficiary.</p><p></p><p>Her stance had become completely aligned with Li Qing's.</p><p></p><p>Under various pretexts, she summoned outstanding female cultivators of the Yuehua lineage to the residence.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Qing would make his move.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a bit of a sense of using power to pressure people, after cultivating together and discovering their realm's</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation level slightly increased.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the little dissatisfaction remaining in her heart instantly vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>She even took the initiative to keep it a secret, hoping to gain more opportunities in the future.</p><p></p><p>In this way, in less than a year, the Moon Flower Sect completely fell under Li Qing's control.</p><p></p><p>As Li Qing's cultivation became more and more profound, this strange atmosphere naturally also attracted the attention of the few male cultivators in the Moon Flower Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, without substantial evidence, coupled with the suppression of He Jingtong, a Harmonious Dao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>They were also helpless.</p><p></p><p>The only thing they could do was to actively request outside missions in order to escape.</p><p></p><p>He Jingtong naturally agreed to everything.</p><p></p><p>With the departure of those few male cultivators, the Moon Flower Sect finally fell completely under the control of Li Qing and He Jingtong.</p><p></p><p>Wantonly absorbing Yin Yuan, Li Qing's cultivation also progressed by leaps and bounds, as if there were no bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>She stood at the peak of the Demigod stage.</p><p></p><p>"I need a new Harmonious Dao female cultivator to help me."</p><p></p><p>In the secret room, Li Qing said slowly to He Jingtong.</p><p></p><p>He Jingtong's eyes stared at Li Qing for a long time, and finally nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There are not many Harmonious Dao female cultivators in the sect. Among them, Zhang Xiyu from the Dao Defense Institute has the shallowest connections and is the most suitable target."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing had long had a plan in mind for the Harmonious Dao female cultivators within the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"She is a loner and doesn't often associate with people. She is indeed a good target. But after all, with Harmonious Dao cultivation..." A trace of worry flashed in Li Qing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He Jingtong smiled: "Don't worry. It's not necessarily a must to fight and kill."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Xiyu doesn't care much about her physical shell. Instead, she values cultivation realm very much. If I use the secret of my rapid cultivation progress as bait, I'm not afraid she won't comply."</p><p></p><p>"Master is becoming more and more like me!" Li Qing praised.</p><p></p><p>In the whispers of the two, a huge net of conspiracy was spread out.</p><p></p><p>And the plan did indeed proceed very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>After hearing He Jingtong's narration, Zhang Xiyu did not hesitate much.</p><p></p><p>She agreed to try.</p><p></p><p>It's just that she made a vicious vow that if there was no effect, the two must pay with their lives.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled and told her to rest assured.</p><p></p><p>Two Harmonious Dao cultivators and one quasi-Harmonious Dao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>They walked hand in hand into the closed-door cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly, and soon a month went by.</p><p></p><p>When Zhang Xiyu left, Li Qing had already successfully broken through to the Harmonious Dao stage.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the two beauties by her side concealing the disturbance during the breakthrough, I'm afraid she would have been exposed by now.</p><p></p><p>"You should be satisfied now, right?"</p><p></p><p>He Jingtong hugged Li Qing from behind and murmured.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was silent for a moment, then asked He Jingtong in return: "Master, don't you have any interest in that Longevity Fruit position?"</p><p></p><p>He Jingtong's hands suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Then she tightly clutched Li Qing and didn't let go for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After a while, she giggled and said, "With your ability, I think the next Longevity Fruit position is already in your pocket."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing grabbed He Jingtong's hands and said seriously, "I still need Master's help."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Next, the two launched an assault on the Longevity Fruit position, the highest realm in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it had been less than ten years since Li Qing started building her foundation.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Senior Sister Zhao Ruoxi was still in closed-door cultivation at this time.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qing seemed to have forgotten about this childhood sweetheart and didn't deliberately go looking for him.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the ten-year period had arrived.</p><p></p><p>The sealed stone door slowly rose, and Zhao Ruoxi walked out of the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, her face suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 676</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The shopkeeper explained repeatedly, and the onlooker cultivators who were watching the excitement also echoed, and then he accepted it with skepticism.</p><p></p><p>"So you mean to say that the once unparalleled and beautiful Tianling Flower has completely disappeared now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a bit lost and regretful, "If I had known earlier, I would have come to see its beauty a few years ago!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Tianling Flower has petals that bloom differently. After blooming, on each petal, there will appear special scenes. It could be blue mountains, or a rushing river. Or even a sky of white snow. One flower gathers the beautiful scenery from all over the world. A divine creation, incredibly beautiful..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's recounting immediately stirred up memories among the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were local cultivators from Tianlingzhou, all having seen the exquisite beauty of the Tianling Flower in the past. Their discussions and reminiscences filled the atmosphere with even more sighs.</p><p></p><p>What cannot be obtained will always be the most beautiful. Alas...</p><p></p><p>The more they thought about it, the more they felt regretful, and the cultivators shook their heads with sighs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the atmosphere becoming more poignant, Li Fan spoke loudly, "If such a treasure cannot be seen with one's own eyes, it is truly a great regret in life! Wuxian Peak has countless people, but I refuse to believe that the Tianling Flower was not completely preserved!"</p><p></p><p>"I am offering a reward here. I am willing to exchange a Longevity Pill that can extend life for three hundred years for a chance to see the original Tianling Flower in person!"</p><p></p><p>With all eyes focused on him, Li Fan took out a pill and placed it in his palm.</p><p></p><p>His voice spread instantly, and upon seeing the pill in Li Fan's hand and feeling the attraction in their hearts, a commotion erupted among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>A treasure that can extend life for three hundred years is already extremely precious. However, this person was willing to use it just for a chance to meet!</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you are truly a man of character, I admire you! Rest assured, my friend specialized in cultivating Tianling Flowers back then, maybe there are preserved Tianling Flowers from that time."</p><p></p><p>"I will also ask around for you!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The crowd instantly became lively.</p><p></p><p>Even the flower shop owner's eyes lit up as he took out a communication charm and started contacting others.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood among the crowd, waiting quietly.</p><p></p><p>The result was as he expected.</p><p></p><p>After a while, everyone showed expressions of great regret. In the Tianling City where the news spread, indeed, no one had preserved the Tianling Flower in its original form.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let out a long sigh, looking extremely disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"If my wish cannot be fulfilled, I cannot rest in peace!"</p><p></p><p>"My reward will remain valid for a long time, I kindly ask all of you to continue inquiring for me!" Li Fan bowed to the crowd and then left with a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>Although this seemed insignificant, it was still a rare event in the desolate Tianling City after a major battle. The news about the disappearance of the original Tianling Flower gradually started gaining attention.</p><p></p><p>In any case, those cultivators who had seen or heard of the beauty of the Tianling Flower back in the day were not few.</p><p></p><p>As this interesting event spread widely, memories of the Tianling Flower resurfaced in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it is indeed a pity."</p><p></p><p>"Such a treasure, how could I have missed the opportunity to see it back then? Once missed, it's gone forever!"</p><p></p><p>More and more cultivators began to have such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As for the initiator of all this, Li Fan watched with satisfaction as discussions about the Tianling Flower increased in various places in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Next, emotions need some time to ferment. The regular cultivators have started, and with the disciples from the Medician Sect adding fuel, there shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>"However, to truly elevate the value of the Tianling Flower, it depends on the real powerful figures of Wuxian Peak."</p><p></p><p>A glint of determination flashed in Li Fan's eyes as he took out the communication charm left to him by Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Shuo, how have you been lately?"</p><p></p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, Li Fan got straight to the point, "I have a matter at hand, and I would like to trouble you to inquire about it."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianling Flower..."</p><p></p><p>After sending the message, Li Fan waited quietly for the response.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Shuo Feng came back with a message, "I seem to have heard about the Tianling Flower before. It's not a big deal; I'll ask around for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, "In that case, thank you in advance, Shuo!"</p><p></p><p>There was temporarily no response from Shuo Feng's end.</p><p></p><p>"All that is left is to wait for the flowers to bloom."</p><p></p><p>Without rushing back to Changsheng Valley, Li Fan scrutinized every major and minor event that had occurred in the past two years in the Xuanhuang Realm meticulously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was familiar with the course of history, naturally could trace some unusual incidents deliberately hidden in the subtle clues.</p><p></p><p>For instance, the information about the ruins of the Jiu Shan State's Chaoyuan Sect had suddenly disappeared overnight. It was as if the incidents of caves flying up into the sky and attracting cultivators to explore had never happened. What appeared in the searches were just fragmentary records about the ancient Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there were instances where a few cultivators from various martial halls were conscripted and sent to an unknown destination. These vacancies caused quite a bit of contention and chaos.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stored all these clues in his mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, Li Fan paused momentarily.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he messaged Shuo Feng again, "Brother Shuo, I have recently comprehended a new magical technique. Thinking back to the scene when we sparred before, I feel a bit itchy in my heart. I wonder if you have time recently to have another sparring session with me?"</p><p></p><p>This time, Shuo Feng replied quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How is it that after more than two years without seeing each other, you are confident you can defeat me? Let me remind you, I have already broken through to the Golden Pill cultivation level now. Even if you use your full strength at the Yuan Infant realm, I'm afraid you might not necessarily win against me."</p><p></p><p>"No need to talk too much, we'll know once we try." Li Fan's response was also straightforward.</p><p></p><p>This exchange immediately sparked Shuo Feng's fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Come here," he sent a location, indicating.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked and it was a mountain range outside Tianquan City in the Tianquan State.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I will come there right away. Please wait a moment, Brother Shuo."</p><p></p><p>"No problem. I've been here these days." After Shuo Feng's reply, there was no further communication.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then left the Tianxuan Mirror, used a teleportation array, and arrived in Tianquan State.</p><p></p><p>Tianquan State was full of the abodes of the privileged members of Wuxian Peak.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng's given location naturally belonged to this category.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Li Fan carefully bypassed the protective formations and headed straight for the designated location.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1207</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The only thing that can be done is to dissect and analyze these remnants of the world. Perhaps we can still deduce and restore the state of this dark starry sea before its demise."</p><p></p><p>"However, after all, it is an existence that is several levels higher than an ordinary immortal realm in the Xuanhuang world. Even if it's just a corpse, much can be gained from it."</p><p></p><p>The aura on the Holy Fetus Li Fan suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>As if magma erupted violently, his aura, which was already at the peak of the Hua Shen realm, expanded several times in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Holy Fetus still could not escape the connection restriction between the avatar and the true body.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if there was an invisible shackle, fiercely suppressing that surging aura back.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan let out a muffled groan and actually spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Inside the small world derived from the black sword in his body, countless black cracks appeared, as if it would be destroyed at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But the eyes of the Holy Fetus Li Fan were instead filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The world is incomplete, and the Dao is weakened."</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, in this dark starry sea, it is possible for the avatar to surpass the realm of the true body!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan savored the impact of that instant expansion.</p><p></p><p>Like a tyrannical giant force, forcibly breaking the shackles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I still lack some of the driving force to break through. Collapsing halfway, I suffered a backlash instead."</p><p></p><p>"If I accumulate a little more, I can break through that shackle in one go."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered the scene where his avatar cultivated the Devouring Heaven and Earth Great Technique before, and finally forcibly broke through the [Calamity of Heaven].</p><p></p><p>"This is called [breaking the Dao with force]. In a normal great world, without being a true immortal, one does not possess such great power at all. But the dark starry sea is broken and the requirements have been greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>"After my avatar forcibly broke through the bottleneck of the Calamity of Heaven before, it was hit by the huge palm of the Xuanhuang Dao. In this dark starry sea, even such a backlash may not descend."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan, like Zhao Xian just now, was filled with the joy of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"From one to ten thousand. Since this inherent Dao can be broken, can others also be realized?"</p><p></p><p>"When a whale falls, ten thousand things are born. The demise of the starry sea may be a great opportunity that is difficult to encounter in billions of years for the surviving cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa's strength far surpasses that of ordinary cultivators. In addition to all the new Fa cultivators in the entire Xuanhuang realm being his foundation, it may also be inseparable from this."</p><p></p><p>"Having stayed in the starry sea for ten thousand years, he is probably infinitely close to the legendary immortals."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The realization of the Holy Fetus in the dark starry sea also had a great impact on Li Fan's true body.</p><p></p><p>The discovery that the broken world of the starry sea was greatly beneficial to cultivators against the Dao made even his aura involuntarily fluctuate slightly.</p><p></p><p>It attracted the attention of the two Dao elders, Hua Yueye and Zhang Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Sun?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just thought of my lovely wife at home and my mind wandered." Li Fan said somewhat ashamedly.</p><p></p><p>The two guarding elders showed strange expressions and nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Opportunities and crises have always coexisted."</p><p></p><p>"Although the current dark starry sea is a holy land of cultivation for cultivators, there is no doubt that it is also full of crises."</p><p></p><p>"If the Holy Fetus was not a heaven-defying foundation establishment, he would have probably perished halfway. Facing the various strange things in the starry sea, even my Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven derived world cannot support for too long."</p><p></p><p>That invisible void in the dark emptiness, and the fatal black plague...</p><p></p><p>No matter which</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>None of these were things that the current Li Fan could handle.</p><p></p><p>"Even with the help of the Holy Fetus's enlightenment, it's the same."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only console himself like this.</p><p></p><p>"If those sixteen Dao-merging experts from the Myriad Immortals Alliance were to leave the Xuanhuang Realm, they should also be able to slowly discover this secret."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if they can still make it back alive."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held a pessimistic attitude towards the fate of these sixteen people.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Dharma Transmission, the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm were absolutely just tools.</p><p></p><p>This summoning should not escape this fate either.</p><p></p><p>"However, I can try to secretly learn the method of flying out of the Xuanhuang Realm without the Echoing Star Force."</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the Echoing Star Force in this lifetime is purely accidental. There is no way to guarantee that it can be reproduced in the future. But since I already know the importance of the Darkest Star Sea, how can I miss it?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if this point in time is top secret and impossible to investigate, after a few decades pass, or when the Holy Dynasty begins to threaten the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the two sides start a war, such secrets will be left unattended and not difficult to inquire about."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although this was the case, Li Fan kept a close eye on these sixteen people at all times.</p><p></p><p>Through the Tianxuan Mirror, the avatar left in the Sun family had already been able to maintain a stable existence. The recovery of the avatar's strength also made Sun Luyao in the Infinite Mirror become increasingly powerful and more obviously integrated with the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>On this day, while peeping into the Tianxuan Mirror, Sun Luyao suddenly mustered up the courage and said to Li Fan, "Senior, I seem to have sensed the location of another Infinite Mirror fragment again."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps after absorbing it, the ability of the Infinite Mirror will be further enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Sun brothers had searched almost the entire territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and the fragment they found did bring a qualitative change to the Infinite Mirror. If it could be restored a bit more, it might really bring surprises to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's avatar pretended not to hear.</p><p></p><p>He patiently finished peeping into the Tianxuan Mirror and still did not find any information about the sixteen people summoned by the Dharma Transmission.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he coldly look at Sun Luyao and ask, "What location?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>After seeing the location pointed out by Sun Luyao, Li Fan's avatar couldn't help but feel a little surprised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely in the Hundred Stones Grotto Heaven located on the border of Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The ruins of the Tianji Sect and the entrance to the Spirit Wood Realm were all in this underground network of caves.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's avatar only replied indifferently and did not show any intention of going to search.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao didn't dare to ask more either.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until seven days later, when Sun Luyuan came to the secret room again, that Sun Luyao, who had obtained Li Fan's permission, repeated the matter with some urgency.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to Li Fan's calmness, Sun Luyuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"If we can find another fragment, you may not have to suffer like this anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, brother, what was Fu's reaction after learning about the news of the Tianxuan Mirror's human avatar?" Sun Luyao asked again.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sun Luyuan frowned, "The birth of a human avatar from the Tianxuan Mirror is a major event that needs to be dealt with slowly. I can understand that he has no movements for the time being. But what's strange is that I haven't been able to contact him since our last meeting."</p><p></p><p>"Can't contact him?"</p><p></p><p>"Not only Fu's side. I can't even enter the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance for the time being. It seems that there is something extremely important going on."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The anchor was set for 58 years, and the ten-year period had arrived.</p><p></p><p>The Wuxian Alliance sent out a group of black-clad cultivators to begin eliminating scattered cultivators who had not joined any alliance.</p><p></p><p>Scattered cultivators rose up in resistance, but were easily defeated.</p><p></p><p>Though the reason for the weak combat strength of the scattered cultivators was clear.</p><p></p><p>The combat strength displayed by the black-clad cultivators in this battle was indeed formidable and not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Although their individual strengths were not high, most of them were at the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>But in actual combat, they were extremely frightening. They could face more than ten cultivators of the same realm at the same time without falling behind.</p><p></p><p>They were ruthless in their attacks and never spared anyone.</p><p></p><p>No matter where the scattered cultivators hid, the black-clad cultivators could always accurately locate them.</p><p></p><p>Leaving them with nowhere to escape.</p><p></p><p>For a time, blood flowed throughout the land.</p><p></p><p>After barely repelling a group of black-clad cultivators, the people at Li Realm eventually decided to join the Wuxian Alliance after discussions.</p><p></p><p>After the people practiced the secret method "Concealing the Sky with One Hand" found in the remnants of the Tianji Sect, and successfully passed the test of the White Jade Questioning Heart Platform through the operation of the Shuofeng, they temporarily hid within the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>During the 60th year of anchoring, all battles came to an end.</p><p></p><p>There were no more scattered cultivators within the Wuxian Alliance's territory.</p><p></p><p>In the 61st year of anchoring, the Wuxian Alliance issued an order.</p><p></p><p>To maintain the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array, it was everyone's responsibility.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators within the alliance need to practice the method called the "Heaven-Fixing Record."</p><p></p><p>After practicing this method, although it did not increase one's own cultivation base, according to the progress made, corresponding "Heaven's Gift Points" could be generated in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Similar to contribution points, Heaven's Gift Points could be used to exchange for various cultivation techniques and resources.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, despite some reluctance, the vast majority of cultivators had no choice but to practice the "Heaven-Fixing Record" as required.</p><p></p><p>As the years passed, Han Wuying broke through to the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>That same year, during a secluded comprehension, he gained enlightenment from the "Heavenly Physician Scriptures" within the broken formation jade disc.</p><p></p><p>In the 65th year of anchoring, there was a rumor circulating among the small paths. It was as if there was an additional obstacle in the world, and the cultivation gains of cultivators did not entirely return to themselves.</p><p></p><p>Instead, a small portion seemed to disappear to an unknown location.</p><p></p><p>The rumor was quickly suppressed after a brief duration.</p><p></p><p>After a secret gathering of the Li Realm faction, confirming the authenticity of the news through mutual verification, Xiao Heng instructed everyone not to spread it.</p><p></p><p>The next day of the assembly, the Li Realm faction was warned by a group of black-clad cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the 69th year of anchoring, the Five Elders suddenly launched a surprise attack on the Eight Directions State.</p><p></p><p>This time, they seemed to have figured out a way to temporarily shield themselves from the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array.</p><p></p><p>They swiftly conquered most of the territories within the Eight Directions State in just one day.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, tens of thousands of black-clad cultivators descended in large numbers and engaged in a bloody battle with the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>Despite the elite overall strength of the Five Elders surpassing that of the black-clad cultivators, the latter were fearless and seemingly endless in quantity. As one batch died, another quickly replaced it.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, the heavily wounded Five Elders were forced to retreat.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, the cultivators of the world learned the identities of this group of black-clad cultivators.</p><p></p><p>【Celestial Sorcerers】.</p><p></p><p>In the 71st year of anchoring, more information about the 【Celestial Sorcerers】 was leaked.</p><p></p><p>Different from the current cultivation system, Celestial Sorcerers did not need to cultivate. They only needed to gain recognition from the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array.</p><p></p><p>With its approval, they could manipulate the energy under the array's cover and engage in combat.</p><p></p><p>The highest-level Celestial Sorcerer today had strength equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the 72nd year of anchoring, a sensational incident happened.</p><p></p><p>Golden Core cultivator Tang Fangsheng accidentally killed hundreds of commoners in Chilong City during a confrontation.</p><p></p><p>One of them survived, named Shi Qing. Unfortunately, all of his family members died.</p><p></p><p>Shi Qing was grief-stricken.</p><p></p><p>For unknown reasons, he gained recognition from the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array and became a Celestial Sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he gained the combat power of the Nascent Soul stage, and he directly killed his enemy, Tang Fangsheng.</p><p></p><p>After years of cultivation, cultivators found their progress in cultivation becoming slower.</p><p></p><p>In the 80th year of anchoring, the Wuxian Alliance uncovered a major case attempting to destroy the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of cultivators were executed.</p><p></p><p>In the 85th year of anchoring, Han Wuying comprehended a technique called the "Melting Furnace Myriad Forms" from the "Heavenly Physician Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly studying the Heavenly Physician Scriptures, he emerged aware of the vast varieties of different creatures it described.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely discovered a common link among all living creatures.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were like a furnace, where once-unified beings were refined into the myriad forms in the world.</p><p></p><p>By practicing this technique, one could freely transform among the myriad forms.</p><p></p><p>As long as one understood the physiological structure, they could change into the appearance of plants and animals.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators found it difficult to discern the true from the false.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuying was overjoyed as he broke through to the middle stage of the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>In the 86th year of anchoring, the number of Celestial Sorcerers steadily increased.</p><p></p><p>In the 90th year of anchoring, a celestial phenomenon appeared.</p><p></p><p>Blood rain fell across various states, and mourning cries echoed throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>It lasted for several months incessantly.</p><p></p><p>In the 91st year of anchoring, Celestial Sorcerers with cultivated Dao merged together, suppressing all individuals involved in attempting to subvert the Locking Spirit Array.</p><p></p><p>In the 101st year of anchoring, the Wuxian Alliance established clear quotas for cultivators practicing the "Heaven-Fixing Record."</p><p></p><p>In the 139th year of anchoring, Han Wuying received a secret message from Xiao Heng. After arriving at a site thirty thousand feet underground, Han Wuying learned that in recent years, under the banner of subverting the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array, the 【Reviving Immortals】 had gathered a large number of like-minded cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Han Wuying learned of an even more shocking piece of news.</p><p></p><p>Numerous pieces of evidence pointed towards the involvement of the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuying learned an upgraded version of the "Concealing the Sky with One Hand" technique, which could interfere with the surveillance of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array within a certain range.</p><p></p><p>In the 150th year of anchoring, news spread that the Wuxian Alliance and the Five Elders were about to merge.</p><p></p><p>The world was shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the 159th year of anchoring, the Xuanhuang Realm was unified.</p><p></p><p>The Wuxian Alliance and the Five Elders, collectively called the 【Heavenly Alliance】.</p><p></p><p>A group of Celestial Sorcerers began constructing the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array within the former territory of the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>In the 160th year of anchoring, Han Wuying broke through to the later stage of the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>In the 163rd year of anchoring, during the construction of the Locking Spirit Array, the 【Reviving Immortals】 attempted to assassinate the Array Master and obtain the structural blueprint of the Locking Spirit Array.</p><p></p><p>However, it ended in failure, and seventy-eight people died tragically.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the Heavenly Alliance launched a frenzied purge.</p><p></p><p>Many innocent cultivators died.</p><p></p><p>The 【Reviving Immortals】 completely went into hiding.</p><p></p><p>In the 171st year of anchoring, the construction of the Locking Spirit Array was completed throughout the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the sky regularly displayed a green color.</p><p></p><p>And the Xuanhuang Realm ushered in a period of nearly a century of peace.</p><p></p><p>The number of Celestial Sorcerers continued to increase.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the cultivation speed of the cultivators became slower each year.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the overall number of cultivators steadily decreased annually.</p><p></p><p>Underneath the seemingly calm Xuanhuang Realm, dark currents surged.</p><p></p><p>In the 260th year of anchoring, Han Wuying broke through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>In the 263rd year of anchoring, a letter titled "Declaration to the Cultivators" spread across various regions of the Xuanhuang Realm overnight.</p><p></p><p>This completely opened the war between cultivators and the Locking Spirit Array.</p>

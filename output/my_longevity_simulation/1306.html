        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Watcher bears a mission from the Immortal Realm, and may even be a direct creation of True Immortals. Ordinary forces cannot contend against it."</p><p></p><p>"Although the path to immortality has long been severed, as long as They still exist, They will always resolutely carry out their mission. This is precisely where our hope of escaping lies..." Zhong Gongdao quickly wrote in the air.</p><p></p><p>"This Watcher of the Xuanhuang Realm does not seem to actively attack us. As long as we don't make a sound and attract its attention, we should be able to ensure safety temporarily. However, staying in this pot is not a long-term plan. I can sense that the longer we stay here, the faster our life force drains away."</p><p></p><p>"The Watcher only cares about its own mission. We must quickly figure out what exactly the mission of this thing above is. Then we can think of a way to escape..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up, their gazes penetrating through the Xuan Immortal Vessel, falling on that terrifying figure at the edge of the giant pot, stirring the pot water.</p><p></p><p>"Don't observe, lest it cause changes." Elder Gan Jingda waved his hand, temporarily blocking everyone's vision.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Lie of the Dao Verification Academy wrote with a solemn expression: "If we use the power of True Immortal seal characters to create chaos, is there hope of escaping? Although the Watcher is strong, it can't resist the power of True Immortals, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Gongdao shook his head slightly and explained, "Indeed, it should not be able to completely resist the influence of True Immortal seal characters. The Xuan character talisman I just used has already proven this point. But after all, it has countless ties with the Immortal Realm. Compared to us mortal cultivators, the Watcher has a certain ability to resist the power of True Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"This Watcher in front of us, after being hit by the Xuan character talisman, only forgot the previous events, but did not leave this pot..." Zhong Gongdao's meaning was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue also nodded in agreement, "That's right, using True Immortal seal characters to create chaos is too risky. Just now with one glance, it killed one-tenth of our Immortal Vessel's population. If it can resist for a moment... even if we can escape, not many on the Immortal Vessel will survive."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Gongdao continued, "Everyone, we also have to consider what happens after escaping from here. If we use up all the accumulated True Immortal seal characters, how can we resist the Dharma Heavenly Venerate of the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this foul air must be vented. Even if we can't get some Immortal spiritual energy, we must at least get some resources in the Xuanhuang Realm!" Zhang Fangzhu of the Immortal Vessel's Forging Star Workshop looked fierce.</p><p></p><p>After discussion among the Immortal Vessel's elders, a consensus was finally reached. First send out personnel to fly out of the pot and explore the surrounding environment. Strive to figure out the possible mission of this terrifying Watcher in front of them. At the same time, always be prepared for the Immortal Vessel to be discovered by the Watcher and fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Soon, twenty cultivators left the Immortal Vessel one after another, flying towards the outside of the pot.</p><p></p><p>Some of them, before even flying out of the range of this giant pot, were attracted by the invisible whirlpool in the pot and fell into the water, completely disappearing.</p><p></p><p>And the vast majority of those who had the strength to fly out of the pot were directly discovered by the invisible Watcher, their life force extracted and kneaded into small balls.</p><p></p><p>Only one who luckily escaped the Watcher's range never returned.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Immortal Vessel then invested more than a hundred cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although three cultivators completed the reconnaissance this time, they were all discovered by the Watcher without exception when trying to enter the pot on the way back.</p><p></p><p>They were kneaded into spheres and died instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Dying in vain like this is not the way!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's just fight it head-on!"</p><p></p><p>"Too weak to even fly out of this pot. Too strong and the Watcher will definitely discover..."</p><p></p><p>"Especially the Dao Entry Elders, going is sending them to their deaths!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Immortal Vessel, the atmosphere once again fell into despair.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhao Xian, the body possessed by the Holy Fetus Li Fan, stood up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Ai Tianjue and wrote with determination, "Master, I want to try."</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Severed Immortal Tower all showed moved expressions.</p><p></p><p>They had an extremely good impression of this young junior with outstanding talent.</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue reached out and rejected Li Fan's request.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Gongdao went against the crowd's opinion and once again sent out a reconnaissance team of three hundred people.</p><p></p><p>The result was still a total annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing those lively lives being mercilessly kneaded into balls by the Watcher, the icy fear had already accumulated to a certain threshold in the hearts of the Immortal Vessel's people.</p><p></p><p>When Zhong Gongdao was about to issue orders again, seeing the trembling bodies and desperate eyes of the cultivators in front of him, he hesitated.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he had gone soft, but that he also began to doubt whether this kind of probing was of any use.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan stood up again.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhong, this student is willing to try." Although a flash of fear initially appeared in Li Fan's eyes, it was quickly replaced by incomparable determination.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Severed Immortal Tower, looking at the eyes of the cultivators from other organizations on the Immortal Vessel, sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they agreed to Li Fan's request.</p><p></p><p>After a simple farewell to his masters, under the gaze of thousands, Li Fan flew out of the Xuan Immortal Vessel unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tianjue, you've taken in a good disciple."</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhong, who rarely took the initiative to interact with others, said to Ai Tianjue this time.</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue nodded slightly, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan successfully leave the giant pot, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Next was a long wait.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, everyone did not see Li Fan's returning figure for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The light of hope slowly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhong Gongdao thought Li Fan had also failed and died, and was about to send out the last wave of reconnaissance teams.</p><p></p><p>A figure openly flew past the Watcher stirring the water in the pot.</p><p></p><p>Descending from the sky, returning to the Xuan Immortal Vessel!</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Although the Watcher was above and everyone dared not make a commotion, the expressions on the faces of the Immortal Vessel's people had already fully explained how excited they were at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After losing nearly five hundred backbone forces of the Immortal Vessel, they finally saw hope of escape.</p><p></p><p>Like the moon surrounded by stars, they welcomed Li Fan to the center of the elders.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Yin-Yang Pearls?"</p><p></p><p>"Each one seems to contain endless frozen corpses?"</p><p></p><p>The scene described by Li Fan made the Immortal Vessel's people look horrified.</p><p></p><p>And the few elders of the Immortal Pivot Court frowned slightly, as if they remembered something.</p><p></p><p>After inviting Zhong Gongdao over and exchanging a few words.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Gongdao gathered everyone, "Everyone, perhaps we have found a way to escape from here!"</p><p></p><p>"The mission of this Watcher..."</p><p></p><p>"Should be to collect different specimens."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Gongdao's expression was not as joyful as finding a way to escape. Instead, it was very gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Different specimens? Elder Zhong, what does this mean?" Everyone looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Gongdao said, "Daosheng, you explain the situation."</p><p></p><p>Everyone's attention then focused on the white-haired Jian Daosheng, the head of the Immortal Pivot Court.</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng's eyes showed a look of reminiscence as he wrote and explained, "In the ancient times of the great cultivation world, the Starry Sea was prosperous and countless cultivation realms were full of vitality. But our Xuan Shang Immortal Vessel was always willing to float in the Starry Sea without a fixed abode..."</p><p></p><p>"The world always thought that the Xuan Shang people pursued profit, so they traveled between realms to seek exorbitant profits. But..."</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't having a fixed world as a base be more conducive to the Dao of Commerce? The lives of everyone on the Xuan Immortal Vessel depend on a single vessel. Although the Starry Sea at that time was not as full of crises as it is now, flying in the Starry Sea all year round will inevitably encounter tribulations."</p><p></p><p>"But we were still willing to drift on the Starry Sea rather than choose a realm to reside in."</p><p></p><p>"It's just because the Xuan Shang Immortal Vessel was built by a group of cultivators who escaped from cultivation realms where Watchers existed."</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng showed a look of sighing emotions, looking at the shocked crowd, and continued to write, "Cultivators treat mortals like cattle and horses, raising them in pens. And the Immortal Realm's treatment of cultivators may be even worse."</p><p></p><p>"Almost every prosperous cultivation realm has traces of monitoring by the Immortal Realm. Even those remote and unknown cultivation realms, no one dares to guarantee that Immortals won't suddenly descend and intervene. What exactly the Xuan Shang ancestors discovered back then to escape from their original homeland is unknown. But what is certain is that it was out of fear of the Immortal Realm and not wanting to be raised like cattle and horses that the Xuan Shang ancestors decided to reside in the Immortal Vessel."</p><p></p><p>"At the height of the Immortal Vessel's prosperity, the population was no more than a million. Perhaps because the number was really too small, indeed there was no intervention from Immortal Realm forces for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng turned the topic to the reason for making such an inference, "Judging from the scene Zhao Xian saw, those frozen in the nine Yin-Yang Pearls should be the cultivators that existed in the Xuanhuang Realm since ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"Not dead, but existed." Jian Daosheng specifically emphasized this point.</p><p></p><p>"So before, when disciples tried to escape by concealing their own life force, it was useless."</p><p></p><p>"To escape from this Xuanhuang Watcher, the safest method is to disguise oneself as a cultivator that already exists in those nine Yin-Yang Pearls with endless frozen seas."</p><p></p><p>After all, the Immortal Pivot Court was an existence that had controlled the Immortal Vessel for thousands of years before the Severed Immortal Tower. Out of trust in the Immortal Pivot Court, everyone still decided to try this method.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, when Li Fan was scouting before, his divine sense swept over the endless frozen sea and recorded the characteristics of enough cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After successfully disguising themselves, the first group of cultivators set off.</p><p></p><p>Not as ostentatious as Li Fan, but cautious and hesitant.</p><p></p><p>And that formless Watcher indeed turned a blind eye to them.</p><p></p><p>A team of thirty people all successfully escaped from this nightmarish giant pot.</p><p></p><p>With the feasibility verified, everyone on the Xuan Immortal Vessel accelerated the pace of escape.</p><p></p><p>After all the members of the Immortal Vessel escaped, the Watcher's action of monitoring and stirring the pot water finally ended.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to stretch out its palm and fiercely slap the pot.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the huge vibrating sound, the giant pot slowly shrank.</p><p></p><p>The Watcher kept slapping, and the giant pot became smaller and smaller. In the end, it turned into a crystal clear small pearl.</p><p></p><p>Inside the small pearl, the original pot water turned into a calm ocean.</p><p></p><p>The Watcher that completed all this first stood still for a moment. After a while, it seemed to remember its own mission.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the rumbling footsteps, it left this space.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Xuan Immortal Vessel who held their breath and watched all this, only let out a long sigh of relief after making sure the Watcher had finally left.</p><p></p><p>However, in order to prevent attracting the Watcher back again, everyone still communicated with gestures.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhong, it has been investigated that this is a closed space with no exits around."</p><p></p><p>"We haven't figured out how the Watcher left."</p><p></p><p>With the Xuan Immortal Vessel's thousands of years of unbroken heritage and everyone working together, they quickly determined that the exit to leave this place was in those nine Yin-Yang Pearls.</p><p></p><p>After carefully selecting one of them, the Xuan Immortal Vessel flew into it.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the endless corpses on the frozen sea with their own eyes, the people of the Immortal Vessel still felt an unspeakable fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yin-Yang Pearl, far away from the Watcher again, they could finally communicate with divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"What does the Xuanhuang Watcher collect so many corpses for?"</p><p></p><p>"This place seems to be a mysterious formation."</p><p></p><p>The people of the Immortal Vessel discussed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, can the records of what the Xuan Shang ancestors discovered back then really not be found?" Li Fan asked Ai Tianjue through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly noticed that just now, there seemed to be an exchange between the head of the Immortal Pivot Court and the several great elders of the Severed Immortal Tower. Hence this question.</p><p></p><p>A flash of hesitation appeared in Ai Tianjue's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan had no qualifications...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only a few knew the secrets of this immortal boat. However, Li Fan had just risked his life to scout for the immortal boat, and finally succeeded in bringing back key information.</p><p></p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that he was the hero who saved the Xuan Immortal Boat. There was nothing much to hide anymore.</p><p></p><p>After discussing with the other elders and finally obtaining permission, Ai Tianjue answered, "As the chief has not spoken falsely, the ancestral teachings are indeed no longer on the Xuan Immortal Boat..."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan heard the meaning in Ai Tianjue's words: "Not on the Xuan Immortal Boat. Teacher, you mean..."</p><p></p><p>"On the Shang Immortal Boat?"</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue nodded: "Back then, there was infighting within the immortal boat, and it split into two. Our Xuan Immortal Boat, although we obtained the Hundred Inquiries Immortal Record. But the most important part of the Xuan-Shang Immortal Boat ended up with the Shang Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>With Ai Tianjue's personality, talking about this matter, he also felt a slight regret.</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing?" Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, after the Xuan-Shang ancestor left his homeland, he was afraid of being tracked by the Overseers and even the True Immortals. While drifting uncertainly in the starry sea, he was also trying to find a way to completely escape the True Immortals." A trace of yearning flashed in Ai Tianjue's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, immortals and mortals are different. Even if they merge with the Dao, in front of True Immortals, they are no different from ants. Trying to escape the True Immortals by ordinary means is like a fool's dream..."</p><p></p><p>"But the Xuan-Shang ancestor did it indeed."</p><p></p><p>A trace of realization flashed in Li Fan's eyes: "Immortal artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. And not only that." Ai Tianjue said with some wistfulness.</p><p></p><p>"You also know that in ancient times, some immortal realms had particularly close ties with the upper realm. As time passed, some immortal artifacts were scattered everywhere. The Xuan-Shang Immortal Boat traveled through the starry sea, collecting immortal artifacts. And they tried to analyze the power of the immortal artifacts and make it their own..."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, they must have achieved some results. Unfortunately, before they could transform this research achievement into practical application, changes had already occurred in the starry sea." Ai Tianjue sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan-Shang Immortal Boat had internal strife and split into two from then on. Our Xuan Immortal Boat seized the vast majority of the stored supplies, which is the Hundred Inquiries Immortal Record. The Shang Immortal Boat took the research notes from back then and an unknown number of immortal artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned: "So to speak, in the internal strife back then, our Xuan Immortal Boat was actually the loser?"</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue nodded: "You could say that."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He secretly said in his heart: "No wonder the Xuan Immortal Boat has always been so secretive about information regarding the Shang Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>"Even in the face of the near-desperate situation against the Overseers before, our Xuan Immortal Boat did not have internal strife. The Xuan-Shang Immortal Boat back then shouldn't have been worse than us, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's because the leader of the Xuan-Shang Immortal Boat back then wanted to do something crazy that would lead the entire boat to their deaths." Ai Tianjue said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"They wanted to pilot the Xuan-Shang Immortal Boat to crash into the high wall, in an attempt to break out of this starry sea." After a brief silence, Ai Tianjue said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Xuan Immortal Boat was still searching for a way out in the Yin-Yang Pearl.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Xuanhuang Realm had already entered a new stage.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor, who had been evenly matched with the Dharma Heavenly Venerate for a while, couldn't help but be distracted and looked at the unusual scene in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The merging of the many shattered realms had been initially completed.</p><p></p><p>The white fog barriers that originally spanned the heaven and earth shattered under the crushing internal force of the Xuanhuang Realm's growth and decline.</p><p></p><p>The boundless sky encompassing all the states was revealed to the Xuanhuang cultivators for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The scattered immortal spiritual energy in the world had been completely absorbed by the Xuanhuang heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators also slowly awakened from their greed and frenzy.</p><p></p><p>They stared blankly at the clear sky they had never seen before, standing still.</p><p></p><p>In the slight trembling of heaven and earth, it seemed that something was being activated.</p><p></p><p>Lines flashed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Holy Emperor's strength, he could not see clearly whether they were real or illusory.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Heavenly Venerate's attacks became more and more fierce. Li Ping could feel that the Dharma Heavenly Venerate was gradually not holding back anymore.</p><p></p><p>He knew in his heart that the most critical moment was about to come, and the Holy Emperor was doing his best to try to stop the Dharma Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the heaven and earth rumbling became louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>However, a sense of unease suddenly surged in the Holy Emperor's heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this sky, Li Ping felt a sensation as if he was in a formation.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the entire Great Inauguration world was under the cover of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>And the moment the Holy Emperor had this thought, an extremely subtle thought fluctuation appeared in his mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Although it disappeared in a flash, Li Ping could discern the meaning the Xuanhuang Dao wanted to express.</p><p></p><p>Danger! Escape!</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not understand what it meant. The Xuanhuang Realm at this moment was unprecedentedly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Where did the crisis come from?</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Ping was stunned, a golden light suddenly came from outside the sky.</p><p></p><p>Like a golden needle, it flew at high speed and stabbed fiercely into the Xuanhuang earth!</p><p></p><p>The rumbling sound of the Xuanhuang Realm suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>As if this needle had forcibly interrupted the process of the Xuanhuang Realm's transformation!</p><p></p><p>A surge of anger immediately welled up in the Holy Emperor's heart.</p><p></p><p>With starlight surging on his body, he flashed in an instant, bypassing the Dharma Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>He came to the front of that golden needle.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the Source Power enveloped his palm, wanting to pull this golden light out of the Xuanhuang earth.</p><p></p><p>However, what surprised the Holy Emperor was that this golden needle, which clearly came from outside the sky, seemed to be like the meridians and blood vessels of the Xuanhuang Realm itself. It merged with the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>As he exerted a little force, the Xuanhuang earth under his feet also violently shook.</p><p></p><p>Mountains undulated and the power of the earth veins gushed out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Holy Emperor loosened his hand and gave up forcibly pulling it out.</p><p></p><p>And just as he tried to pull out the needle, countless golden needles flew in from outside the sky like a meteor shower.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they were inserted into the Xuanhuang earth according to some extremely mysterious arrangement.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the process of the Xuanhuang Realm's transformation interrupted.</p><p></p><p>Vortexes appeared in the sky, and the immortal spiritual energy that had already been absorbed by the Xuanhuang heaven and earth was actually forced out again.</p><p></p><p>Where the golden needles were, wisps of white fog emerged from them again.</p><p></p><p>Like sharp scalpels, they began to cut the Xuanhuang earth again.</p><p></p><p>A strange power was slowly enveloping the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm, after witnessing the re-released immortal spiritual energy, did not frantically grab it.</p><p></p><p>Many living beings directly fainted to the ground and fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>They were not able to personally witness this extremely mysterious change in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Doctor!!" The Holy Emperor had already understood the instigator of this incident.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, trying to find the other party's location.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Heavenly Venerate's attack arrived in a flash.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was no longer holding back.</p><p></p><p>The limit of power that the Xuanhuang Realm could barely withstand exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Heavenly Venerate has come, why not bow!"</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Heavenly Venerate's ice-cold voice sounded at the same time.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to appear simultaneously from every corner of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's body instantly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>As if facing the direct gaze and questioning of all the new Fa cultivators in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Those pairs of eyes of the masses seemed like shackles, tightly entangling his body.</p><p></p><p>"So the Xuanhuang Realm is the Dharma Heavenly Venerate's home ground..." A trace of realization flashed in the Holy Emperor's mind.</p><p></p><p>"However, in this Xuanhuang Realm, I also have help!" The Holy Emperor's starlight robe surged.</p><p></p><p>He roared: "Mo Rubin, how long are you going to watch the show!"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know where this Mysterious Heaven Sect's Dharma King was hiding.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping was sure that when the anomaly in the Xuanhuang Realm occurred, he would definitely hide in some corner and silently observe everything.</p><p></p><p>From the brief exchange with Mo Rubin before, Li Ping saw that this Mysterious Heaven Sect's Dharma King did not particularly care about what the Xuanhuang orthodoxy was.</p><p></p><p>As long as the world under his feet was intact, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>What he cared more about was finding the missing Mysterious Heaven King and leaving this darkest starry sea.</p><p></p><p>So the Holy Emperor didn't care whether Mo Rubin responded or not, and secretly shouted in his heart: "Dao One!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy between heaven and earth instantly came to life.</p><p></p><p>From death to life, it surged into the Holy Emperor's body in rolling waves.</p><p></p><p>Like an abyss swallowing the sea, the Holy Emperor's body gradually expanded with the continuous influx of the Insect Transformation spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Ten zhang, hundred zhang, thousand zhang...</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Heavenly Venerate's chains entangling his body instantly turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Holy Emperor had already turned into a truly towering giant.</p><p></p><p>Ruling over the Xuanhuang earth.</p><p></p><p>And the infusion of the Insect Transformation spiritual energy still did not stop.</p><p></p><p>As if it really wanted to devour all the spiritual energy of the entire Xuanhuang Realm in a short time!</p><p></p><p>As his body continued to expand again, the grand merged Xuanhuang Realm slowly became the size of a room in the Holy Emperor's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Heavenly Venerate's attacks also became no longer so difficult to resist.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor also had the spare energy to look outside the Xuanhuang Realm to find the Heavenly Doctor's location.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hold him back!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Tianyang's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>He blocked the Dharma Heavenly Venerate and said to the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Go with peace of mind."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's the Dharma Heavenly Venerate, he won't be able to kill me in a short while."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang was no longer in the form of a young child, but had turned into a puppet with dark gold and crimson colors intertwined.</p><p></p><p>The size of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"Take this!" The Holy Emperor handed that white ring to Tianyang, and he himself flew out of the Xuanhuang Realm, following the golden needles that were still constantly flying in, to find the Heavenly Doctor's traces.</p><p></p><p>He also tried to intercept this golden light halfway.</p><p></p><p>But the golden needles came from outside the sky, too fast and too dense.</p><p></p><p>There was no time to stop them at all.</p><p></p><p>Only by finding and solving the source of the golden needles could it be stopped.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Tianyang already fighting with the Dharma Heavenly Venerate, there was no sign of Mo Rubin appearing.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Transformation spiritual energy quickly dissipated after entering the void.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Dao One Insect also taking some advantage during the previous absorption and sublimation of the immortal spiritual energy by the Xuan Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the speed of death at this moment would be even faster.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor understood that he must find the Heavenly Doctor's traces as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>This expert, who also seemed to be at the Supreme Realm, apparently had no intention of showing up and fighting him.</p><p></p><p>He always concealed his traces.</p><p></p><p>And the Holy Emperor also discovered that these golden needles seemed to have been arranged early.</p><p></p><p>Not only were they launched from a certain place in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>But from any direction, there were countless golden needles.</p><p></p><p>They fell into the Xuanhuang Realm with extreme precision.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor only felt that he had a body full of martial power but nowhere to use it, feeling stifled.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the scene of the Erasing Calamity and the Great Magician's remains sealed outside the Great Inauguration small world suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>He even vaguely had the idea of unsealing it and detonating it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Holy Emperor was shocked by his own thoughts and forcibly suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>"How could I have such thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>The thought flashed by, and the Holy Emperor could only continue to search for the Heavenly Doctor's traces.</p><p></p><p>And as the golden needles continued to fall, the Xuanhuang Realm surprisingly slowly returned to its original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Between heaven and earth, the white fog barriers rose again, dividing the states.</p><p></p><p>The restless Xuanhuang Realm seemed to be sealed by the golden needles and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's helplessness had already reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>He inadvertently glanced at the Xuanhuang Realm below again...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his heart was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Because he suddenly discovered that the Xuanhuang Realm had not completely returned to its original state.</p><p></p><p>Instead...</p><p></p><p>That feeling of being in a formation actually did not fade away!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 847</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Human energy is limited. When attention is focused on one thing, it will inevitably reduce the focus on other things."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the truly exquisite art books carrying Senior Sister Zhao's power have been drowned out by the countless crude imitations produced by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Therefore, the spread and influence of 【One Heart Heavenly Venerate】 has been limited to the greatest extent."</p><p></p><p>"This move is brilliant! I've learned from it." Jì Shàolí, who had a clear view of the various operations of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, couldn't help but sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he slightly frowned: "However, doing this can only reduce the harm. It cannot completely end Senior Sister Zhao's influence..."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance must have a backup plan."</p><p></p><p>Consistent with Jì Shàolí's prediction.</p><p></p><p>While the vast majority of the immortal alliance cultivators were immersed in this deliberately manufactured discussion storm.</p><p></p><p>There was still a small group of people who were not satisfied with those imitations at all. They were still diligently pursuing more exciting art books.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't know that all the books that could circulate in the market had already been secretly and closely monitored by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. It's just that they hadn't closed the net yet.</p><p></p><p>When they finally found a seller who could make a deal after working hard.</p><p></p><p>They were all captured in an instant as soon as the transaction was completed.</p><p></p><p>Charged with the crime of attempting to subvert the immortal alliance.</p><p></p><p>In front of the lively discussion wave, all this seemed so silent. If Jì Shàolí hadn't paid attention to these cultivators before, he probably wouldn't have noticed that they had disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>Confusing the public on one hand, and fishing for lawbreakers on the other.</p><p></p><p>With this two-pronged approach, it took more than three months for the Myriad Immortals Alliance to finally resolve the impact of Senior Sister Zhao's initial probing this time.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Myriad Immortals Alliance seems to have won this confrontation, they have actually lost."</p><p></p><p>Jì Shàolí shook his head inwardly: "For the Five Elders Council, what did they pay for this turmoil? Just some art books that can be mass-produced. But the Myriad Immortals Alliance needs to spend a lot of time and energy to be forced to quell this matter."</p><p></p><p>"It has been suppressed this time. But the Five Elders Council can make a comeback at any time without needing too much cost. The Myriad Immortals Alliance needs to be on guard at all times. This is the overwhelming power of the Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"The decline of the Myriad Immortals Alliance is evident..."</p><p></p><p>"But I still hope that next, it can bring me some surprises."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>There are no eternally lively topics in the world.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the cultivators' attention to those released secret books also decreased day by day.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the immortal alliance's upcoming employment exam was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>The reason why this exam has attracted so much attention is not only because of its unprecedented scale but also due to a piece of explosive news that the Myriad Immortals Alliance released not long ago.</p><p></p><p>In order to deal with the threatening Five Elders Council, the immortal alliance will select thirty-three [Immortal Chosen] through this exam.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the hope of resisting the Five Elders Council, once becoming an [Immortal Chosen], they will be cultivated by the Myriad Immortals Alliance at all costs.</p><p></p><p>Everything needed for advancement, elixirs, cultivation methods, cave heavens, life and death transformations, and even the essence of heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance will provide them for free!</p><p></p><p>No matter what their original cultivation level was, they will definitely be able to advance within ten years.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Inside, achieving the state of merging with the Dao!</p><p></p><p>The only thing that matters is the individual ability of the cultivators. Whether they can play a unique role in the upcoming confrontation with the Five Elders Council!</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance instantly fell into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators are generally somewhat conceited.</p><p></p><p>Even if their cultivation realm is temporarily stagnant, they will not blame themselves.</p><p></p><p>They only attribute the cause to external factors such as cultivation methods and resources.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to merge with the Dao, wouldn't I be much stronger than those who ascended by relying on their family's protection? I wouldn't have retreated again and again under the attack of the Five Elders Council..."</p><p></p><p>Who knows how many cultivators had this thought in their minds the moment they heard this announcement.</p><p></p><p>So with their heads hot, they recklessly rushed towards the registration office for the grand examination.</p><p></p><p>Even Ji Shaoli, in an instant, was somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>But it was only a momentary impulse.</p><p></p><p>Everything has a price. The price of being pulled up and rapidly becoming one with the Dao may be something he cannot bear.</p><p></p><p>The avatar involves the secret of the true self, and he will certainly not take risks.</p><p></p><p>However, having said that, even if he wanted to, he might not necessarily be selected.</p><p></p><p>How many cultivators are there under the rule of the Myriad Immortals Alliance? Only thirty-three will be selected from among them...</p><p></p><p>Although there may be some who do not conform to the traditional meaning of geniuses, he believes that each of them has their own unique advantages.</p><p></p><p>Some who are unfortunate in their fate are not weaker than others. In fact, they only lack an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Once they take advantage of the wind and rise, they can laugh proudly at the ninth heaven!</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli had no doubt that among these thirty-three people, there would definitely be some who were previously unknown. In this selection, they will display their extraordinary talents and shock the world.</p><p></p><p>But he still had some doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Placing the hope of confronting the Five Elders Council on these [Immortal Chosen Ones], doesn't it mean that the current rulers are unable to undertake the great task?</p><p></p><p>How could the Myriad Immortals Alliance do something that slaps their own face?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those mysterious transmitters of the Dao. Even the divine souls of the geniuses selected from the ages have not taken the stage at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance should not be incompetent to this extent.</p><p></p><p>"Unless these thirty-three people who have merged with the Dao, the so-called stars of hope..."</p><p></p><p>"They have other uses."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the masses, this Immortal Alliance Grand Examination officially began.</p><p></p><p>The scale far surpassed the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>For a full month, all the cultivators participating in the examination will go to the examination venue through the Tianxuan Mirrors of each state.</p><p></p><p>Before the grand examination ends, the examination venue is completely closed and isolated from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Because the number of cultivators participating in the grand examination this time was too large, it directly led to the various states of the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance becoming somewhat deserted.</p><p></p><p>During this month, the interior of the Myriad Immortals Alliance was empty.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent the Five Elders Council from launching a sneak attack, the Immortal Alliance not only deployed heavy troops at the borders and strictly guarded them,</p><p></p><p>but also launched a counterattack silently.</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had temporarily suspended the process of devouring the Five Elements Grand Hole Heaven, looked at the diamond-like shining sphere handed over by Lin Ling, his expression somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>This thing was sent over by the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>As a "partner" who had successfully traded several times, the Five Elders Council actually took the initiative to seek help this time...</p><p></p><p>It really surprised Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this shining sphere has caused no small trouble for the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>And they have not yet found a way to solve it.</p>

            <p>Ji Hongdao shook his head and chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the owner of this Qingshi Broken Palm is the ancient Tianzun who achieved the status of Heavenly Venerable with ancient methods."</p><p></p><p>"Achieving the status of Heavenly Venerable with ancient methods is not as harsh as requiring the reversal of heaven and earth principles like it is nowadays."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, the strength will be weakened by more than a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Being killed by someone, encountering disasters and perishing, these are all possibilities."</p><p></p><p>Without leaving too much time for the cultivators present to be shocked, Ji Hongdao seemed to be mentioning an insignificant matter and then instructed, "This mission is urgent, there isn't much time for rest. Today, Huangfu and Shangguan will take everyone to familiarize themselves with the precautions inside the Eternal Immortal Stronghold."</p><p></p><p>"Official construction will begin tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"In the first stage of the mission, outside the Abyss of Scorn, we will build the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Grand Array."</p><p></p><p>"After we have successfully moved the newly discovered maze, we will rush to build the second locking spirit array."</p><p></p><p>"Once we finish building in both places, we can return."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao paused, took out a small Tianxuan mirror from his bosom, and projected a light list above everyone's heads.</p><p></p><p>"Let me inform you that the popularization of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array Grand Competition has officially begun."</p><p></p><p>"Although most of you are not participating in the competition, the Ten Thousand Immortals League will not let your hard work go to waste."</p><p></p><p>"Escort, transportation, cooperation, every effort will be meticulously recorded and converted into points. By the time the grand array is completed, these points can be used to exchange for the league's techniques and treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the construction of each Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array will be considered a meritorious task of top-grade rank."</p><p></p><p>"When the formation is completed, corresponding rewards will be given according to the contribution."</p><p></p><p>"Rewards will be given in real-time without delay."</p><p></p><p>Before Ji Hongdao finished speaking, the cultivators present were already buzzing.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, they had just learned about this news as well.</p><p></p><p>Top-grade rank missions are usually highly dangerous and difficult tasks.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, there is simply no hope of completion.</p><p></p><p>But now, by diligently building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array, they could obtain it.</p><p></p><p>How could this not make them excited?</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao smiled lightly, "Do you want to obtain techniques, elevate your authority rank?"</p><p></p><p>"This is truly a rare opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"If you miss it, I'm afraid that in the future, to obtain similar rewards, you'll have to pay multiple times more."</p><p></p><p>"So, please work hard."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the excitement, Li Fan surveyed the light list in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the grand competition had just begun, the gap hadn't widened yet.</p><p></p><p>The list was constantly changing, showing intense competition.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of 783 names on the list.</p><p></p><p>The names were very familiar, they were all students who had participated in the special training at the Universal Academy.</p><p></p><p>Except for Li Fan and Xue Mu at the bottom with zero points, there was also a Foundation Establishment cultivator named Guo Yezhong who, for some reason, had not yet participated in the formation construction.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's put away your excitement for now. Save your energy for tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>After a while, when the atmosphere had calmed down a bit, Ji Hongdao continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"After disembarking, make sure to carry the 'Black Death Talisman' with you at all times. Even inside the Eternal Immortal Stronghold, remember this."</p><p></p><p>"Starting tomorrow, there will be stationed cultivators in the stronghold accompanying you to prevent the Abyssal Sound. Details will be explained by Huangfu and Shangguan."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ji Hongdao waved his hand, and hundreds of talismans with black light shimmering on the surface appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then, each flew to the cultivators' fronts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan touched one with his hand, and the black death talisman instantly turned into a black line and lurked on his left wrist.</p><p></p><p>Without time to investigate carefully, urged by Huangfu Song, they left the Dust Ferry and temporarily settled in the Eternal Immortal Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The stronghold truly lived up to being the front line against the Abyss of Scorn, almost self-sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Facilities commonly seen in a city were all available here.</p><p></p><p>Apart from being unable to transmit, there was even a Tianxuan mirror present here.</p><p></p><p>However, where Li Fan and the others resided was only the outermost part of the stronghold, estimated to occupy at most a segment of a finger based on the size he had seen earlier.</p><p></p><p>Further exploration was guarded by cultivators dressed in blue robes and was thus impossible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Dust Ferry.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao was still standing at the bow of the ship, gazing at the scene inside the broken palm building.</p><p></p><p>A figure that appeared like a ghostly distortion suddenly appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Is it always using tempting means? Why not try something new?" The figure spoke disrespectfully, full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao seemed unsurprised by his appearance, didn't turn his head, and casually said, "Old tricks, but effective."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it so?"</p><p></p><p>"Among all cultivators, who can truly resist great benefits laid before them without being tempted?"</p><p></p><p>"Even a 'proud' person like you, if there were no benefits, how could you willingly guard the Abyss of Scorn for decades without moving a muscle?"</p><p></p><p>The young man snorted but didn't retort.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he said, "Being able to gain something from the Abyss is my skill. Why don't you let others try?"</p><p></p><p>"I won't mention service in such a dangerous place."</p><p></p><p>"Why do we now also have to build the 'Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array' on this side?"</p><p></p><p>"You and I are clear on what that is."</p><p></p><p>"We cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao suddenly turned around, with a seriousness never seen before on his face, staring at the young man.</p><p></p><p>The young man's words suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan Locking Spirit is the general trend," Ji Hongdao said slowly, emphasizing each word, "who dares to go against it is on a path to death."</p><p></p><p>"I advise you not to provoke the will of the 'transmitter.'"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man still looking displeased, Ji Hongdao sighed and persuaded, "The situation is critical now, it has come to a point where there is no time to lose."</p><p></p><p>"For some reason, the heavens and earth have suddenly lifted the restrictions on cultivation, seemingly breaking the jug to pieces, as if wanting to bury us all together."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders have not been able to locate the whereabouts of the Tianzun through many attempts, and they are getting restless."</p><p></p><p>"The transmitters have observed signs of the reversal of the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean, I believe you understand very well."</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, only with the 'Tianxuan Locking Spirit,' gathering the majority of living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm, can we overcome these difficult times."</p><p></p><p>"Only then can we slowly search for a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>The young man clearly couldn't accept Ji Hongdao's words.</p><p></p><p>He retorted, "Treating all beings as ants, how do you know you're not an ant yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao was unimpressed, "We are naturally above all beings."</p><p></p><p>The young man snorted and said, "Maybe."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see."</p><p></p><p>After that, his figure trembled and vanished.</p>

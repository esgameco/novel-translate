        <h1>Chapter 1201</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Senior Baihua, it seems your cultivation has improved quite a bit?"</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years of simulated experience, Sun Erlang was now a far cry from his former self. He could see the changes that had occurred in Daoist Baihua during the time he was away.</p><p></p><p>His heart couldn't help but be in awe.</p><p></p><p>As for Yi Shu, he looked with great interest at the five circular rings in the sky that corresponded with and connected to each other, as well as the six bright stars surrounding the rings.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Baihua has transported two more cave heavens. It must have been hard work. These two new cave heavens seem to be even larger in scale than the previous ones. No wonder I feel that the speed of the Great Enlightenment traversing the void has noticeably increased again," Sun Erlang silently thought.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty truly lives up to its reputation," Yi Shu said sincerely, sensing the various forces of the small world that constantly enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>"I think, in no more than fifty years, such earth-shattering changes have actually occurred in a mere mortal world. I'm really becoming curious about your master, young gentleman."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua inexplicably glanced at Yi Shu again.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't say anything, only letting out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>He brought the two to the front of the Holy Emperor's seat, then left directly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the towering figure sitting above, like a majestic mountain, Sun Erlang's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought that after experiencing so many seemingly real worlds in the simulated realm and seeing those supremely powerful Longevity Realm cultivators from the ten great immortal sects of the past, he would be a bit more at ease when facing his master again.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Sun Erlang knew he was wrong.</p><p></p><p>When facing a Longevity Realm powerhouse, what Sun Erlang felt was the pressure from the gap in realms, the oppression of the strong over the weak.</p><p></p><p>But when facing his own master, the Faceless Holy Emperor of Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The reason Sun Erlang's body, mind, and even soul couldn't stop trembling was due to the Faceless Holy Emperor's unfathomable mystery, and...</p><p></p><p>The natural condescension of higher beings towards lower life forms.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have returned." Sun Erlang knelt on one knee, just as he always had.</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu cupped his hands slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're back. It seems this trip has given you quite a harvest," the voice of the Faceless Holy Emperor Li Ping echoed in the empty, lofty hall of the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang recounted his experiences in great detail.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Sun Erlang's report, only then did Li Ping say to Yi Shu, "Since Taiyuan Sect is being so polite, we can't be remiss either. During this time, you lead him around the Holy Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is forbidden, wherever this gentleman wants to see, you can take him."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was slightly startled, then quickly said, "This disciple understands."</p><p></p><p>"You may go."</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had no intention of interacting with Yi Shu.</p><p></p><p>Although Yi Shu was the embodiment of Taiyuan Sect's collective consciousness, he still had his own temperament belonging to his individual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He tilted his head slightly, looking at the Faceless Holy Emperor sitting high above, and cupped his hands again.</p><p></p><p>Until he left the Holy Emperor's seat, that Holy Emperor didn't say another word.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing once is better than hearing a thousand times. Senior, after you take a walk, you will naturally have answers in your heart," Sun Erlang hurriedly explained to prevent the other party from feeling awkward.</p><p></p><p>It's just that his smile seemed a bit different from before.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that almost everyone in the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty was cultivating the same technique, a hint of surprise flashed in Yi Shu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the spirit towers casually placed everywhere in the Holy Dynasty, constantly releasing spiritual energy outwards, the smile on Yi Shu's face slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>When he observed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the "Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Formation" connecting the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty with other small worlds, Yi Shu's expression had already become doubtful and surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Young gentleman, do you know..."</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu's words reached his mouth, but he swallowed them back.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang thought that the other party was shocked by the sight of the Holy Dynasty. Seeing that the other party ultimately did not speak out, he did not ask further.</p><p></p><p>Next, Sun Erlang took Yi Shu to visit some important places in the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>For example, Wang Xuanba's exotic beast breeding base and the manufacturing site of the Patrolling Heaven Arrow.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Yi Shu became more and more silent.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, there were flashes of deep confusion and doubt between his brows and eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party's expression, Sun Erlang, who had been constantly shocked inside the Taiyi Sect, couldn't help feeling a sense of comfort and secretly feeling proud.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Yi, is there anything else you want to see?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu did not respond for a short while.</p><p></p><p>His gaze looked into the distance, as if he wanted to take in this magical small world.</p><p></p><p>"If you didn't say you were going to counterattack the Xuanhuang Realm, I would almost think this place was one of the hidden secret realms of the Myriad Immortals Alliance." After a long time, Yi Shu suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Except for the smaller number of cultivators and top experts, you are indeed qualified to compete with the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"However, based on what I've seen so far, it's still not enough if you want to form an alliance with our Taiyi Sect." Yi Shu made such a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Young gentleman, the waters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance are far deeper than you think." Yi Shu hinted.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was not dissatisfied with Yi Shu's reaction, but nodded slightly, as if in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Sun Erlang finally took Yi Shu to the space below the Holy Emperor's seat, where Yin Shangren was.</p><p></p><p>He didn't see Yin Shangren himself.</p><p></p><p>However, just by looking at the hundreds of children who had already laid the foundation at a young age and were cultivating here, Yi Shu also showed a bit of loss of composure for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"This..." With his insight, he naturally saw the uniqueness of these foundation-building children in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the people in the Taiyi Sect in the distant Taixuan Realm turned their eyes to the small world of the Great Qi.</p><p></p><p>Even the Dao-transforming Stone Mother, which was emitting a blue light at that moment, seemed to have a brief pause.</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, a young man went a step further on the basis of 'Laying Foundation with Me' and created the Mixed Origin Golden Core," Sun Erlang said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Laying Foundation with Me?!" After hearing this term, Yi Shu's entire body instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>It was not a figure of speech, but his thoughts really fell into a state of stagnation.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang, who possessed the Dao-transforming Stone, could also see at a glance that this was a manifestation of the Dao-transforming Stone's computational power running to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Yi Shu blurted out.</p><p></p><p>The children who were pondering and working hard to cultivate here all looked at Yi Shu.</p><p></p><p>There was some dislike in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because they were taught by Yin Shangren and had been most resistant to the word "impossible" since childhood.</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu realized his loss of composure and coughed lightly to cover it up.</p><p></p><p>He slowly walked to a jade-like girl among them and observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>The more he looked, the more surprised he became.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang saw that Yi Shu's hands were even uncontrollably clenched tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond variables? Beyond variables?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this is not beyond variables, this is..."</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu suddenly raised his head, as if he was looking directly at the faceless Holy Emperor sitting on the Holy Emperor's seat.</p>

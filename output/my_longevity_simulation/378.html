        <h1>Chapter 378</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The simple and concise words introduced the life of Fan Li Fan to Luxi Chan. </p><p></p><p>Although Huangfu Song did not actively mention information about this person, on that day Dongfang Yao noticed his strange expression when looking at Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>He knew in his heart what kind of person his brother was, and Dongfang Yao immediately conducted some secret investigations. </p><p></p><p>Whether it was the various extraordinary actions of Li Fan rumored among the people, or the miraculous deeds that spread quickly, they all made Dongfang Yao think that this person was not simple. </p><p></p><p>Even the sudden arrival of Huangfu Song this time might be because of Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>And when Chief Luxi suddenly asked, it confirmed his guess. </p><p></p><p>However, even if he guessed some things, there were things that he could say and things that he couldn't say. </p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao was naturally very clear about this. </p><p></p><p>As a subordinate, just cooperate well with the leader. </p><p></p><p>If he acted too clever and disrupted someone's plan above him, it would not just ruin his future, but he might also die inexplicably. </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Dongfang Yao dared not be negligent and meticulously recounted the surface information he had gathered. </p><p></p><p>Luxi Chan noticed that these two subordinates seemed to have some ulterior motives. </p><p></p><p>However, she didn't intend to delve deeper into it. </p><p></p><p>Because there were not many things in this world worthy of her attention, and these two Nascent Soul formation mages were obviously not among them. </p><p></p><p>It was the person who saved her daughter that surprised her. </p><p></p><p>She had heard of Li Fan's name before. </p><p></p><p>Being able to risk his life to save someone in danger was truly commendable in the present age. </p><p></p><p>What was more important was that despite his limited lifespan, he still committed to constructing formations, which was worth highlighting and promoting. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps this person was truly a saint by nature, possessing high morals; or perhaps his cultivation method was special, and his actions were merely opportunistic. </p><p></p><p>For the Ten Thousand Immortals League, it was not important. </p><p></p><p>What was important was that he had truly done those things. </p><p></p><p>What was important was that he convinced most cultivators in the world. </p><p></p><p>For the name of a Golden Core cultivator to reach her ears, there must be some familiar hands behind it. </p><p></p><p>Luxi Chan was not surprised by this. </p><p></p><p>If she guessed right, if Li Fan were to fall before completing the formation, the League would still intervene to save his life. </p><p></p><p>Like buying a horse for a large sum of money, they would advertise him again. </p><p></p><p>The figures of several transmission elders flashed through her mind, and Luxi Chan suddenly felt a wave of gloom. </p><p></p><p>As one of the first batch to actively follow the Transmission Celestial Venerable in transmitting methods and establishing the initial Ten Thousand Immortals League, the transmission elders had been controlling the highest authority of the League since the Celestial Venerable disappeared. </p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation base, each of them surpassed Luxi Chan. </p><p></p><p>Just surviving countless calamities over thousands of years made no one dare to underestimate them. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention that they also vaguely held the method to control the Tianxuan Mirror... </p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Spirit Lock is just the first step." </p><p></p><p>Luxi Chan snorted coldly in her heart and suppressed her thoughts. </p><p></p><p>Her gaze then fell on the old cultivator below. </p><p></p><p>"Thinking that everything is in control, not knowing how they would react if I interfere midway." </p><p></p><p>Before this, although he was her daughter's savior, Luxi Chan did not have the intention to repay him specifically. </p><p></p><p>After all, he saved her daughter without asking for anything and hurriedly left. </p><p></p><p>In Luxi Chan's eyes, it meant that Li Fan had given up that opportunity himself. </p><p></p><p>But now, this person appeared as a pawn of those people in front of her. </p><p></p><p>This made Luxi Chan inevitably change her mind. </p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, she checked Li Fan's ranking in the Grand Comparison Golden List. </p><p></p><p>"Forty-fifth." </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can lend him a hand..." </p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao exchanged a glance, muttering to themselves. </p><p></p><p>You specifically asked us, can we still speak ill of him?</p><p></p><p>Having backstage support is indeed good. </p><p></p><p>Enviously discussing Li Fan, they made him sound as if he were unparalleled in this world. </p><p></p><p>If Li Fan were present to hear these praises, he probably couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed. </p><p></p><p>When it was almost done, Luxi Chan nodded, "He has made so many sacrifices for the popularity of the Tianxuan Spirit Lock formation, but there has been no corresponding reward within the League. It is somewhat inappropriate." </p><p></p><p>"If this continues, won't it disappoint cultivators everywhere?" </p><p></p><p>Both Huangfu and Dongfang were astute individuals. </p><p></p><p>Hearing the implied meaning in Chief Luxi's words, they were surprised but dared not say anything. </p><p></p><p>She continued, "If I weren't aware, it might be fine. But now that I've seen it myself, I definitely cannot turn a blind eye." </p><p></p><p>"However, it is a delicate matter. Stirring up misunderstandings and rumors among certain people would not be good." </p><p></p><p>"At this critical juncture, the Ten Thousand Immortals League should be united." </p><p></p><p>"What solutions do you two have?" </p><p></p><p>The two suddenly remembered some rumors they occasionally heard, and after a moment of consideration, they understood the meaning behind Chief Luxi's words. </p><p></p><p>But this kind of high-level struggle was beyond their reach as small soldiers. </p><p></p><p>They felt troubled in their hearts. </p><p></p><p>Feeling the constant scrutiny from Luxi Chan, they both felt an indescribable pressure. </p><p></p><p>As the leader asked a question, there was no reason for silence. </p><p></p><p>Sweat beaded on their foreheads, and at a critical moment, Huangfu Song suddenly remembered his conversation with Li Fan before. </p><p></p><p>Inspiration struck, he gritted his teeth and said, "Let the Chief know that I have had several long discussions with Li Fan before. Although his lifespan is limited, he is still willing to dedicate himself until his final moment." </p><p></p><p>"Our Ten Thousand Immortals League has never mistreated those who have merits. However, despite his efforts, he is still only ranked around forty to fifty. If we give him special treatment, those ranked before him may have something to say." </p><p></p><p>"If his ranking was slightly higher, it would be more logical." </p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song paused and continued, "This man once privately told me that he regrets not being able to explore many mysterious places of our Ten Thousand Immortals League..." </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, without context, he mentioned this. </p><p></p><p>However, Luxi Chan and Dongfang Yao, who were familiar with the rules of the Grand Comparison rankings, naturally understood the hidden meaning in his words. </p><p></p><p>"That is a good idea." Luxi Chan nodded slightly, acknowledging Huangfu Song's suggestion. </p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>Before he could relax, Chief Luxi asked again, "Do you have any recommended places to send him to?" </p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's heart tensed up again. </p><p></p><p>Recalling Li Fan's words from before, Huangfu Song could only grit his teeth and say, "The Fiv...</p>

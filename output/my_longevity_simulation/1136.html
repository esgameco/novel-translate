            <p>Chapter 1134: The Transformation of Continuing the Divine</p><p></p><p>The young-looking member of the Youzu tribe trembled and explained to Li Fan while occasionally glancing up to observe Li Fan's expression.</p><p></p><p>But how could a vulgar person like him be able to clearly see the countenance of the Divine Emperor of Destiny?</p><p></p><p>Feeling increasingly apprehensive, he fully disclosed his findings during this period: "Your Divine Majesty, since pledging allegiance, this humble one has absolutely had no second thoughts. However, praying to the Dark has already become an instinct like breathing for me. So during this time, while praying to Your Divine Majesty, I couldn't help but also naturally pray to the Dark."</p><p></p><p>"The Dark, just like always, responded to me..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the dozen or so Youzu people in the secret chamber all knelt down in extreme trepidation. </p><p></p><p>It was very apparent that this phenomenon had occurred to all of them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gently waved his hand and helped them all up.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan in this life wasn't too concerned about these Youzu people serving two masters for this extremely short period before he enacted Huanzhen.</p><p></p><p>Because in his anticipation, these people were merely tools for him to study the "power of faith" in this very brief time before Huanzhen.</p><p></p><p>Once he soon initiated Huanzhen, everything in the Xuanhuang realm would be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Let alone these Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>He was more curious as to why the "Dark" would also tolerate this kind of two-faced, treacherous behavior.  </p><p></p><p>If followers of the Faceless True Immortal dared to serve two masters, they would likely have long been torn to shreds by the power of the True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Either the power that dominates behind the Dark is so noble that it's appalling, tolerating its followers to this extent."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart suddenly surged with waves of thought: "It has other intentions. It wants to take advantage of this betrayal by the followers to infect existences on the same level as itself."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan instantly became vigilant.</p><p></p><p>He had always been unafraid to speculate about the powerful existences in this world with the greatest of malice.</p><p></p><p>Carefully discerning the threads of scarlet red power inside his body that, although not much, were extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>But after repeated confirmations, he indeed did not find any traces connecting it to the power of the Dark.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I'm overthinking?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, Li Fan still made a decision.</p><p></p><p>He would not allow any variables to affect the Huanzhen process in this life.</p><p></p><p>He first verbally praised these Youzu people for their honesty.</p><p></p><p>But after leaving the underground chamber, Li Fan ordered Wang Xuanba to grant them eternal rest.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't some euphemism, but truly letting them sleep eternally.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was unwilling to further be tainted by this kind of impure power of faith, but was also worried that directly slaughtering the Youzu people might instead draw the attention of the Dark's ruler.</p><p></p><p>So he simply let them enter a state of living death.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I need to find a way to solve the Youzu's fertility issue. Cultivating followers needs to start from the new generation."</p><p></p><p>After constantly devouring and fusing beast organizations over the years, in addition to cultivating the enhanced version of the "Art of Forging Destiny", Wang Xuanba had instead transformed from a previous three-zhang giant to normal human size.</p><p></p><p>He just looked a bit sturdy and robust.</p><p></p><p>Combining the abilities of many beasts in one body, plus an extremely terrifying physical self-healing speed, even Sun Erlang at the peak of Golden Core stage would not be a match for Wang Xuanba in a fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanba, have you felt any confusion or lack of understanding in your recent cultivation?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>It was to help resolve Wang Xuanba's doubts, and also to understand him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Physical condition, intending to improve the Fate Furnace technique.</p><p></p><p>"Master. Recently, my body has indeed become stronger and stronger, as if I have endless energy at all times. But..." </p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba organized his words and scratched his head: "However, two feelings have slowly emerged in my heart. One is an inexplicable sense of crisis, as if there exists a natural enemy in the world. This feeling is particularly strong when passing through the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"As for the second feeling, it's the occasional whispers. I can't understand what they're saying, but they give me a familiar and intimate feeling."</p><p></p><p>After listening, Li Fan said lightly: "Although your body now resembles a furnace, your mind does not. The miscellaneous thoughts of those beasts you devoured still linger in your mind. Don't practice cultivation recently, go recuperate."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally knew the reason for Wang Xuanba's abnormal body, but he didn't say it explicitly.</p><p></p><p>He just let him rest in the Daxuan Small World.</p><p></p><p>As the deadline for the Huanzhen charging approached, Li Fan needed to eliminate all unstable factors.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, under his will, the pace of Daxuan's conquest of various realms also stagnated.</p><p></p><p>It was beautifully named "recuperation and preparation for the enemy".</p><p></p><p>The Daxuan military and civilians all praised the great and benevolent Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor as time flew by.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the 8th year, Li Fan, seeing the 100% charge progress bar, resolutely rose from the Xuanjing Holy Emperor Throne.</p><p></p><p>Without disturbing anyone else, he quietly came to the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>He awakened the slumbering Youzu people and opened the passage to the You Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the dark You Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan opened the Huanzhen panel.</p><p></p><p>[You can choose one of the following options to retain:</p><p></p><p>An item you possess in this simulation.</p><p></p><p>Your cultivation realm in this simulation.</p><p></p><p>The simulated memory of a person closely related to you in this simulation. This memory can be inherited by that person.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The flashing light symbols have existed for eight years.</p><p></p><p>"Inherit cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently chanted in his heart, while his vigilance reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the celestial curtains of the small worlds conquered over the years, such as Daxuan, Li Realm, and Beast Realm, silver lines suddenly lit up, crisscrossing.</p><p></p><p>Like a giant net, enveloping all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Few beings within the net could perceive the fatal crisis that was about to descend, and some even looked up at the sky in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Only those "strong ones" with some cultivation felt a vague unease in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The eternally unchanging dark You Sea seemed to suddenly stir up an invisible wave.</p><p></p><p>The wave-like fluctuations descended upon Li Fan like a gale, triggering a violent storm around him.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul...</p><p></p><p>Earth-shattering changes suddenly occurred within Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw his own cloud-like Huanzhen Dao foundation instantly turn into a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>Then, in an explosion that devoured all light, it evolved into the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Grotto-Heaven completed the evolution that would have taken millions of years in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The majestic Five Elements, a magnificent sight.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the boundaries between the Five Elements became blurred.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of changes unfolded in the Grotto-Heaven, too fast for the eyes to follow.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang World-Ending Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements merged into one, and all the changes in the newly born Grotto-Heaven were to cope with the world-ending crisis that did not exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>The towering tree in the originally Wood-attributed Grotto-Heaven shed its leaves, leaving only bare branches.</p><p></p><p>But it gradually became like gold and iron.</p>

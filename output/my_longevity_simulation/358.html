        <div class="content">
            <p>Replacing it was a desolate and barren land.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't forget his goal, and after searching the ruins again without finding any useful information,</p><p></p><p>He marked the ruins, chose a direction, stuck close to the ground, and flew away again.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Li Fan found another new ruin in the sea of mist.</p><p></p><p>The scale of this ruin was several times larger than the first ruin.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, the scene of countless bodies piled up was even more tragic.</p><p></p><p>The vivid expressions on their faces made Li Fan feel as if he was almost at the scene of the tragedy.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the emotions in his heart, Li Fan searched around as usual.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't find any valuable information, the bodies in the sea of corpses caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators in the first and second ruins died in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the expressions of fear and despair on their faces, they left no other information.</p><p></p><p>Among so many people, there were still one or two cultivators who were relatively strong in their cultivation base.</p><p></p><p>Before their deaths, they stared in a resentful and unwilling manner toward a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the entity that took their lives was there.</p><p></p><p>Even after several years of death, they still maintained this posture.</p><p></p><p>This inadvertently pointed the direction for Li Fan, an outsider, in the white mist.</p><p></p><p>So, following the guidance of the bodies, Li Fan flew rapidly for a day and found the third ruin.</p><p></p><p>Following the footsteps of the culprit, Li Fan continued on his way. (*Note: The text includes a website link that can be omitted.)</p><p></p><p>The fourth, the fifth, the sixth...</p><p></p><p>Until there was only enough supplies left to last for three more days.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had encountered eleven ruins filled with corpses front and back.</p><p></p><p>While he was rushing towards the twelfth ruin on the way,</p><p></p><p>An eerie thing happened.</p><p></p><p>After flying forward quickly, not long after, he unexpectedly returned to the eleventh ruin.</p><p></p><p>After finding the mark he had made before, Li Fan confirmed it wasn't his illusion.</p><p></p><p>So, he set off again.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the result was the same.</p><p></p><p>After making a circle, he returned to the starting point.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan didn't panic.</p><p></p><p>On his third attempt.</p><p></p><p>This time, he slowed down, continued flying while constantly sensing the direction of the eleventh ruin.</p><p></p><p>Finally understanding what was happening.</p><p></p><p>At a certain position on the way, he encountered something.</p><p></p><p>That made the direction he was heading, in a moment, and without any trace, turn backward.</p><p></p><p>During the first two times, Li Fan was unaware and thought he was still flying forward.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he had turned around.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, not long after, he returned to the starting point once again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with a serious expression on his face, Li Fan stood in front of the area that caused the change.</p><p></p><p>Flying in, his body position didn't change. (*Note: The text includes a website link that can be omitted.)</p><p></p><p>But the eleventh ruin that was sensed behind him had inexplicably appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Frowning slightly, Li Fan turned back and tried to move away from the eleventh ruin.</p><p></p><p>But not long after flying, the direction became disoriented again.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had gained experience and always kept the eleventh ruin behind him.</p><p></p><p>Adjusting the direction continuously, he moved forward.</p><p></p><p>So, after many twists and turns, and spending two more days, he finally arrived at the twelfth ruin.</p><p></p><p>This ruin was the largest in scale among all the ruins.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, there were no traces of bodies on the periphery.</p><p></p><p>When things are abnormal, they are bound to be demonic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan braced himself and explored towards the center of the ruin.</p><p></p><p>In this realm that stood alone, even the demonic sounds from the depths could not reach.</p><p></p><p>Besides the sounds he caused, Li Fan hadn't heard any other noises for a long time.</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan approached the center of the twelfth ruin, the sudden sound of rustling made him break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Through the inexplicably thinning white mist, Li Fan saw on the ground not far away.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator lying face up, but with limbs strangely bent downwards.</p><p></p><p>The hands and feet were irregularly broken.</p><p></p><p>Fingers and toes twisted together like twisted dough.</p><p></p><p>Using these rather creepy limbs, the cultivator crawled in circles laboriously.</p><p></p><p>Unrelenting.</p><p></p><p>For an unknown duration, it seemed like it would never stop.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the creature that had survived for who knows how long in the white mist, Li Fan's scalp tingled, and his heart almost stopped.</p><p></p><p>Holding his breath, he slowly retreated.</p><p></p><p>However, the perception of this twisted creature seemed extremely sharp.</p><p></p><p>It immediately sensed the arrival of a foreign visitor.</p><p></p><p>With a snap of its drooping head, it turned over onto its belly.</p><p></p><p>Then it turned directly 180 degrees, and with its face, it stared closely at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The facial features of the twisted creature in Li Fan's eyes immediately made his heart skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>The creature's facial features were completely inverted and disordered.</p><p></p><p>Two pairs of eyes were located where the mouth should be, constantly moving strangely on the face.</p><p></p><p>It had a nose embedded inside the skull.</p><p></p><p>The mouth, following the continuous positional changes of the eyes, kept opening and closing.</p><p></p><p>Inside were not tongues and teeth, but other faces covered in blood.</p><p></p><p>Although the twisted creature's body had become grotesque, its movements were exceptionally fast.</p><p></p><p>Its hands and feet continuously paddling, it crawled in front of Li Fan in no time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan angrily shouted, "Die!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword kept coming out in succession.</p><p></p><p>As his figure retreated rapidly, the Annihilation Sword remained relentless.</p><p></p><p>However, to Li Fan's astonishment, the black sword light that fell on the creature surprisingly lost its effect of annihilation that it had always possessed.</p><p></p><p>Then, it rushed towards Li Fan even faster.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan continuously unleashed hundreds of sword lights, the creature took them all head-on without showing any signs of injury.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the twisted creature about to pounce on him, Li Fan cursed inwardly and was about to launch another attack.</p><p></p><p>The next second, something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>The twisted creature approached Li Fan, but instead of attacking, it bowed down in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Continuously kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>While kowtowing, it emitted a weeping wail.</p><p></p><p>Tears of blood flowed from its constantly wandering eyes.</p><p></p><p>Its mouth also seemed eager to say something.</p><p></p><p>But all that came out were constantly changing, crying blood-stained faces, unable to express its inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the creature still wailing and bowing in front of him, his mind unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Having temporarily escaped danger, Li Fan halted the progress of his attack.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of this inexplicable situation, Li Fan didnâ€™t act rashly.</p><p></p><p>He patiently tried to discern the content of the twisted creature's cries.</p><p></p><p>"Heav...en..."</p><p></p><p>"Med...ic..."</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>Listening, whether it was due to the long exposure to demonic sounds from the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again heard these two words from the creature's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his astonishment, Li Fan attempted to inquire.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven, medicine?"</p>

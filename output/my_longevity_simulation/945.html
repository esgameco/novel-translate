        <h1>Chapter 945</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the little loli Yanfa recovered and resumed normal work, the waiting time required was no longer as long as ten years.</p><p></p><p>Just four days later, the holy fetus Li Fan once again returned to the space where Yanfa Jue was located.</p><p></p><p>The little loli, who was working on the Fu'an, seemed to sense Li Fan's arrival and suddenly raised her head.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that the person who came was indeed Li Fan, her big eyes sparkled and she immediately had a little idea in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The little loli sat upright with a serious face.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan came forward, she slapped the table with both hands and said in a childish voice, "What kind of gongfa to deduce, what are the requirements for the gongfa, is it creating from nothing or creating from a blueprint?"</p><p></p><p>"Write it down yourself first."</p><p></p><p>Then a blank sheet of paper flew towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have forgotten that Li Fan had treated her illness before, and was only seriously deducing gongfa.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan grabbed the paper, and the lines of words he thought of in his heart quickly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the 'Three Dangers Ghost God Dark Secrecy Record' as the blueprint gongfa, deduce a similar gongfa."</p><p></p><p>"Specific requirements: After practicing the gongfa, the aura and characteristics revealed during operation should be the same as the 'Three Dangers Ghost God Dark Secrecy Record'. But the core is actually different, and it needs to be a brand new gongfa..."</p><p></p><p>The densely packed small characters quickly filled the entire page.</p><p></p><p>But the paper did not enlarge. Instead, after the font size was reduced overall, new blank areas appeared.</p><p></p><p>This cycle repeated more than ten times, but still did not fill up the paper.</p><p></p><p>Although this was due to the complexity of the 'Three Dangers Ghost God Dark Secrecy Record' gongfa, this abnormal scene still aroused the vigilance of the Hedao guarding this space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly sensed a divine sense sweeping over his body.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to explain, the little loli Yanfa took the initiative to make an excuse for Li Fan, "Don't worry, it's indeed just a simple gongfa. It's not an 【Evil Curse】..."</p><p></p><p>The little loli propped her chin with both hands and stared blankly ahead.</p><p></p><p>Countless flashing symbols seemed to appear simultaneously in her big eyes.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense locked onto the holy fetus Li Fan finally moved away.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued writing on the paper. When he finally finished,</p><p></p><p>The white paper turned into a stream of light and flew back into Yanfa Jue's hand.</p><p></p><p>The little loli lowered her head and fell into deep thought, not speaking for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Um..."</p><p></p><p>"The blueprint gongfa is a bit complicated. And you have quite a few requirements."</p><p></p><p>"Well, there are a few more issues that need your detailed explanation..."</p><p></p><p>After pretending to think for a while, the little loli Yanfa suddenly slapped the table again, "To prevent your gongfa from leaking, you follow me!"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could answer, a beam of light shot out from the giant character orb above, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the holy fetus Li Fan disappeared from this space.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Hedao showed his figure with a helpless face.</p><p></p><p>He knew Yanfa Jue's childish temperament. Previously, she was exposed by this "Fan Li" for pretending to be sick. Now encountering him again, she would definitely take revenge and vent her anger.</p><p></p><p>However, it was just a prank and would not really cause any serious consequences.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Hedao simply did not stop it.</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad to occasionally find a punching bag for her, so she won't go on strike at every turn." The white-haired Hedao thought instead.</p><p></p><p>In the world of the endless book sea,</p><p></p><p>As soon as the holy fetus Li Fan entered this place, he felt that there were hundreds of wooden sticks surrounding him from the sky to the ground...</p><p></p><p>The wooden sticks, densely packed and leaving no gaps, came crashing down towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" Li Fan shouted at the critical moment.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sticks stopped an inch away from Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>The little Dharma Loli appeared above, hands on her hips, looking down at Li Fan with a smug expression. "How about that! Do you know your mistake now?"</p><p></p><p>"Apologize to me properly, and I'll spare you!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"Humph!"</p><p></p><p>As a show of force, one of the wooden sticks lightly tapped Li Fan's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the little Dharma Loli with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>His gaze made her heart tighten instantly. "What are you going to do..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm warning you, don't you dare make a move!"</p><p></p><p>"If we really fight, you're no match for me. I... I haven't gotten into a fight with anyone for many years, I'm afraid I might accidentally beat you to death!"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Jue waved her little fists, threatening angrily.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just shook his head with a smile, not answering.</p><p></p><p>This made Dharma Jue even more irritated. "You, you're really annoying!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to admit your mistake or not? If you don't apologize to me, I'm really going to beat you up!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ignored the wooden sticks that were almost touching his face and sighed. "It seems... your illness hasn't fully healed yet."</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>Although Dharma Jue tried her best to hide it, the panic on her little face was not an act.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled. "If you're not ill, then how come you keep wanting to slack off and rest at every turn?"</p><p></p><p>"On the surface, you want to cause trouble for me, but in reality..."</p><p></p><p>"You just want to take this opportunity to rest some more! You won't even let go of such a short time, how lazy can you be!" Li Fan's eyes were like torches as he spoke sternly.</p><p></p><p>The little Dharma Loli's body trembled. "You... how can you wrong me like this!"</p><p></p><p>She stared at Li Fan with a face full of grievance, as if she was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained unchanged, not deceived by her act.</p><p></p><p>However, after a brief silence, he changed the topic. "But, I can't blame you for this."</p><p></p><p>"Alternating between work and rest, maintaining a balance between tension and relaxation, that is the natural way. Anyone who works continuously for so long will want to rest."</p><p></p><p>The little Dharma Loli didn't expect him to speak up for her. She instantly widened her eyes and nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in my opinion, your repeated strikes and slacking off are not driven by your own will. It's merely an instinctive drive of your body."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called insatiable greed arises from self-deception. Just like mortals need to drink when thirsty and eat when hungry. It's your nature, unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke eloquently. The little Dharma Loli had never heard such a theory before and was deeply attracted.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sticks in the sky instantly disappeared. She said thoughtfully, "So that's how it is. No wonder I couldn't control my desire to slack off this time, but every time I did, I always felt a sense of guilt in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"This is the symptom of 'self-deception'," Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The little Loli looked at Li Fan, who had the compassion of a healer, and asked curiously, "Is this also an illness? Can it be cured?"</p><p></p><p>After all, he could see through her pretense of sleeping with a single glance, so the little Loli had faith in Li Fan's medical skills.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no one had ever told her these things before, so she couldn't help but naturally raise the doubts in her mind, following Li Fan's line of thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled. "To cure this illness, it can be said to be both difficult and easy."</p>

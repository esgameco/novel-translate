        <div class="content">
            <p>Ji Hongdao said proudly, "Don't worry, with me here, these people will not dare to be reckless again."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Chen family wouldn't dare to offend both the Strategy Formation Hall and the Guardian Hall at the same time."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan cupped his hands: "Then I must thank Brother Ji first."</p><p></p><p>"My destination for this trip is Fuguang Prefecture and the Great Rift Valley."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a trace of surprise flashed in Ji Hongdao's eyes, and he reminded: "This trip may have some twists and turns."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Sun Luyuan's somewhat surprised look, he was stunned: "What, you didn't know? Due to the previous Xuanhuang Great Turbulence, the Fuguang Great Rift Valley has been squeezed and re-healed."</p><p></p><p>"The terrain has long been unrecognizable. To enter the original rift valley below..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he sighed: "Since it's like this, we can only do our best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan took the slightly recovered Wuliang Mirror with him and followed Ji Hongdao, speeding towards their destination.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the two was obviously extraordinary. On the way to the Fuguang Great Rift Valley, he explained to Ji Hongdao in detail the reason for this trip.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he downplayed and concealed to a certain extent the specific power of the annihilating windstorm that suddenly erupted from the Wuliang Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"You suspect that the ruins where the Wuliang Mirror was originally discovered were actually caused by the Wuliang Mirror itself?" Without personally witnessing the terrible calamity, Ji Hongdao didn't think too much and only regarded it as an existence that could threaten Hedao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Since it's the origin of the Wuliang Mirror, perhaps we can find a way to deal with the annihilating catastrophe of the Wuliang Mirror. As long as we find some records, even if they are failures, they can serve as lessons learned..."</p><p></p><p>The two were chatting when their expressions suddenly turned grim at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Because they unexpectedly discovered that a Hedao cultivator from the Chen family was following behind them, as expected.</p><p></p><p>"It's Chen Ruoyu of the Chen family."</p><p></p><p>"Don't get entangled with him, shake him off."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao transmitted his voice.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped by a layer of white light halo, under the blessing of the formation, the speed of the two suddenly exploded, becoming several times faster in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had disappeared on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Ruoyu also hurriedly sped up to chase after them.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ji, this move of cicada shedding its shell is truly a good trick."</p><p></p><p>"Humph, dealing with these fools who only know how to refine pills is naturally not a problem."</p><p></p><p>Two virtual shadows suddenly appeared out of thin air, and then flew in another direction.</p><p></p><p>After shaking off the pursuit of the Chen family and spending more than half a day, the two finally arrived at the so-called Fuguang Prefecture Great Rift Valley.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked at the raised long dragon mountain range on the ground, and his face couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Brother Sun still remembers the specific location from back then?" Ji Hongdao asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan carefully recalled: "I can only determine the general direction. The rest depends on luck."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, move a little closer to the bottom. I seem to have some faint sensations."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After flying around the mountain range, he quickly locked onto the location of the sensation.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Luyuan was about to forcibly enter underground, Ji Hongdao stopped him.</p><p></p><p>He took out a flying boat: "Get in."</p><p></p><p>"Dust-Crossing Boat?!" Sun Luyuan was a little surprised, then jumped in without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The Dust-Crossing Boat turned into a beam of yellow light and slowly sank underground like melting ice.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the constantly changing soil layers around him and the many forbidden auras left in the ruins, Sun Luyuan sighed with emotion: "It's still..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"It's great to have Brother Ji and your treasure, otherwise it would take quite some skill." </p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao nodded: "It's also a reward from Chief Lu. She has been at the Immortal Alliance headquarters recently and couldn't get away. So she ordered me to run some errands for her."</p><p></p><p>The Duchen Boat collided continuously with buried objects in the earth's layers as it descended.</p><p></p><p>The boat's surface emitted a red-orange glow, dissipating the impacts.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao occasionally made hand seals to set up formations, increasing the Duchen Boat's protective power.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which ancient territory this ravine was, to have buried so many ruins."</p><p></p><p>Not only were there architectural ruins, but as the two went deeper, they could also see large accumulations of bones from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Some were human, while others belonged to unknown giant creatures.</p><p></p><p>Even the knowledgeable and experienced pair felt a secret shock in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, it seems to be right here!" </p><p></p><p>When they had reached a depth of over 3,000 zhang underground, Sun Luyao finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Duchen Boat abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The pressure here was already immense, and the red halo outside the Duchen Boat kept swirling, resolving the external oppression.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan and Ji Hongdao looked around but didn't find the ruins.</p><p></p><p>"The changes are too great, with no traces of the past. However, the depth is indeed about right," Sun Luyuan said.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao also observed: "This place..."</p><p></p><p>A circular formation plate flew out from his bosom and hovered overhead, emitting white light to illuminate the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Under the white light, Sun Luyuan could vaguely see some dark golden characters flashing by.</p><p></p><p>"There are actually remnants of a formation." Sun Luyuan was startled.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't proficient in formations, he knew some basic principles.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, it seems we can enter here."</p><p></p><p>Just as Ji Hongdao was using the formation to search for an entrance,</p><p></p><p>his younger brother Sun Luyao had found it first.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao immediately directed the white light from the formation plate to verify.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, where there seemed to be only solid rock, the frequency of golden characters appearing was higher.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao closed his eyes to deduce.</p><p></p><p>After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, he shouted and pointed forward.</p><p></p><p>Like a talisman paper being torn, countless golden characters shattered and scattered.</p><p></p><p>The Duchen Boat took the opportunity to fly inside.</p><p></p><p>Those shattered characters showed signs of reassembling.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this is a concealment formation that can absorb underground energy and operate automatically."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the formation's style, it's completely different from the present. It should be quite old. I have fully grasped its structure and can freely enter and exit." Ji Hongdao said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan praised repeatedly: "It was so right to ask Brother Ji to take action this time! Otherwise, just this formation alone would have troubled me for who knows how long. But what's strange is that when we brothers came before, this formation didn't exist..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan suddenly became alert.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Infinite Mirror, hearing his brother's conversation with Ji Hongdao, Sun Luyao secretly glanced at the ethereal figure not far away, his heart filled with even more reverence.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao broke the formation in the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>And that senior...</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, he found the entrance.</p><p></p><p>That's right, his ability to discover this place naturally wasn't relying on some sensing.</p><p></p><p>It was all thanks to the senior's guidance.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Sun Luyao's gaze of respect and fear, Li Fan didn't mind as he diverted his attention.</p><p></p><p>While Sun Luyuan and the others were still cautiously exploring here, he had already used the Infinite Mirror to complete a full scan of the ruins the moment they arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Yishi Sect?"</p>

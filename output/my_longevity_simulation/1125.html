            <p>As for the Underworld Prison, with such a large-scale escape incident, it had already become a mere shell of its former self.</p><p></p><p>After completing the transfer of the remaining prisoners, even the entrance to the Underworld Prison was no longer concealed.</p><p></p><p>It was thus abandoned.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed, and no one came here anymore. It seemed as if the world had forgotten about it.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Li Fan's figure slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Suppressed in the deepest part of the Underworld Prison, even I couldn't see their face clearly."</p><p></p><p>"The transfer required three Dharma transmitters to personally come..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Instead of immediately escaping with the group of escaped cultivators, Li Fan directly hid at the entrance. The purpose was to explore the prisoner confined in the deepest part of the Underworld Prison, which he had been unable to approach for the past three years.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the formations in the deepest part were too ingenious for Li Fan to crack, but rather that the jailers in charge of guarding there were actually three Hedao cultivators working together.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that they were only there to suppress that one prisoner. Even when the Underworld Prison above was breached and countless felons escaped, they remained unmoved and did not come out to stop it.</p><p></p><p>When the reception team from the Myriad Immortals Alliance arrived, during their transfer process, Li Fan was able to see that prisoner.</p><p></p><p>There was a vague sense of familiarity to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, being concealed by secret techniques, it couldn't be fully confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Myriad Spirits Grand Formation is completed, it's still best not to stir up more trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until the next life to investigate thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing that needs to be done now is to quietly wait for the opportunity and watch the world turn upside down!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards the distant horizon, as if seeing the Myriad Spirits Grand Formation continuously lighting up in the thousands of mortal worlds above.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Grand Formation shown to the crowd of felons was actually not the complete name of the formation.</p><p></p><p>This formation was derived from the Final Separation Disk's deductions within three years.</p><p></p><p>It represented the highest standard of formations that the Separation Disk could deduce in its current state.</p><p></p><p>Using the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Grand Formation that originally covered the Spirit Wood Realm, the Empire, and the Beast Realm as a prototype, after further deduction, a world-shocking formation was created.</p><p></p><p>The full name of the formation was "Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits, All Living Beings Refining Divinity".</p><p></p><p>The main function of this formation, and the purpose Li Fan went to great lengths to release this group of prisoners from the Underworld Prison and have them work for him, was encapsulated in the four words "All Living Beings Refining Divinity".</p><p></p><p>It had a similar ingenuity to the All Living Beings Refining Divinity Formation that Song Hesong from Ningyuan City in the Fallen Immortal Illusion Realm used when fighting against Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>The killing power of the formation also used the thoughts of the myriad spirits and countless living beings of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, after Li Fan's modifications...</p><p></p><p>It was hundreds of billions of times stronger.</p><p></p><p>Because the materials needed to be consumed increased by hundreds of billions of times.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan used the thousands of small worlds and trillions of living beings in the Primordial Realm, just to be able to block the Faceless True Immortal for a moment.</p><p></p><p>During the three years hiding in the Underworld Prison after the Spirit Wood Realm was annihilated by the Myriad Immortals Alliance, Li Fan had been constantly thinking and reviewing the final world-ending plan.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was the first time confronting the power of True Immortals. Even borrowing force to fight force and watching immortals battle from a distance meant endless risks.</p><p></p><p>After all, these two were truly transcendent immortals.</p><p></p><p>Not single-minded Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If they were really that easy to scheme against, how could they be worthy of the name True Immortal?</p><p></p><p>Once it failed, it would be an irreversible situation.</p><p></p><p>Especially after experiencing the siege of the Myriad Immortals Alliance,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After revealing an unexpected trump card and directly annihilating the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan became more cautious than ever about the plan to destroy the world.</p><p></p><p>He took into account all possibilities.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he discovered a problem that he had previously taken for granted and overlooked.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's original conception, he would first mobilize the power of the immortals in the Xianxu Realm, and then use this transcendent power to trigger the reaction of the Faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, living beings instinctively react to things that threaten them.</p><p></p><p>In the simulation and prediction, the Faceless True Immortal and the immortals of Xianxu should first see each other and fight together.</p><p></p><p>But they ignored Li Fan, the instigator of this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, this is only the case in an ideal situation.</p><p></p><p>What if, after ascending to immortality, their way of thinking is no longer the same as that of mortals?</p><p></p><p>Or, sensing the existence of [Huan Zhen] on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Instead of locking onto an equally matched opponent first, they locked onto Li Fan?</p><p></p><p>If no preparations are made and he is targeted by a True Immortal when the time comes, he may not even have time to flee to the Youjie Realm and forcibly return to reality.</p><p></p><p>The more Li Fan thought about it, the more he became restless.</p><p></p><p>So he finally decided that he must at least find a way to buy himself this sliver of time.</p><p></p><p>And the [Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits, All Beings Refining Gods] Grand Formation was the final answer given by the Separation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Although the gap between cultivators and mortals, and between True Immortals and cultivators, is as vast as the difference between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But when the numbers reach a certain level, a terrifying qualitative change can occur.</p><p></p><p>"The moment of distraction that was bought for me is my only chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>The power of a True Immortal can indeed instantly destroy the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>However, if things really develop as Li Fan predicted, after locking onto Li Fan, in order to catch this ant that is secretly scheming, the True Immortal will not directly destroy the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>This gives Li Fan an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, thousands of mortal worlds, countless living beings' thoughts."</p><p></p><p>"This is such a vast force. But no matter how much I calculate, I can only block them for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"This absolute difference in strength..."</p><p></p><p>"It's really enviable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood with his hands behind his back, silent.</p><p></p><p>With the restraint of the Faceless True Immortal's power, those vicious prisoners will definitely obediently complete the construction of the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>This is not something Li Fan needs to worry about.</p><p></p><p>And once the grand formation is built, it will no longer be under their control.</p><p></p><p>"The day the All Beings Refining Gods Formation is completed is the day the mortal world is destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"It's coming soon, within a year."</p><p></p><p>And during this period, Li Fan only needs to wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>At the final juncture of this world, Li Fan still has some finishing work to do.</p><p></p><p>He first came to Tianling Prefecture, the original location of the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Since the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven, which had been nurtured for who knows how many years, was devoured by Li Fan, a new Five Elements Grotto-Heaven has begun to be born in the formless void known as the "Root of Heaven and Earth".</p><p></p><p>It's just that this process is particularly long.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that the embryonic form of the Grotto-Heaven began to appear.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan strolled in the void, activating the Twisting Dao Divine Ability to comprehend the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the rhythm like a beating heart, Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, carefully waiting for the prompt of returning to reality.</p>

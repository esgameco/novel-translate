        <h1>Chapter 791</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not unfamiliar with the aura faintly emanating from that Heavenly Soul. It was none other than the Heavenly Soul: Ink Kill! </p><p></p><p>In an instant, the eyes of the Holy Fetus Xu Bai became even more dark and profound, as if his gaze could penetrate through thousands of miles of space to reach Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Li Fan, who had just flown back to Changsheng Valley, was hit hard, his figure staggering as if about to fall. This abnormality immediately caught the attention of Liu San. </p><p></p><p>The three from the Medicine King Sect were absorbed in refining Qi. Jiang Yushan was focused on cultivation. Only Liu San was most concerned about the development of the Medicine King Sect. His spiritual consciousness enveloped the entire valley, paying attention to the movements of the sect disciples at all times. Therefore, he was the first to discover Li Fan's abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, are you injured?" Liu San arrived in front of Li Fan in an instant, looking a bit nervous, not seeming to be pretending. </p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just a little mishap in my cultivation. I'll be fine after resting for a bit." Li Fan waved his hand after recovering slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan's breath was gradually stabilizing, Liu San slowly nodded. But there was still some doubt in his eyes. Li Fan did not explain either. After sending Liu San away, he came alone to the secret room of the sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>He first sensed the situation of [Remnant Shadow]. Sure enough, Dong Fang Yao was efficient and swift in his actions. The one hundred and eight [Remnant Shadows] had all been arranged properly. </p><p></p><p>"It's just an unfortunate last resort. If possible, I only hope it will never be activated." Li Fan only glanced casually and no longer paid attention.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to check the situation on the Holy Fetus Xu Bai's side in Tianling Prefecture through the increasingly blurred same-body perception. It was as if obscured by a thick fog, only vaguely able to see the flashing scenes from the occasional gaps.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer sense the specific information about the Heavenly Souls gathered. It could only be clearly perceived that more and more of the Heavenly Souls' powers were concentrating on the Holy Fetus Xu Bai. And as his body size grew closer and closer to the Heavenly Souls, the oppressive might emanating from him could no longer be concealed.</p><p></p><p>Gazes came from all corners of the Xuanhuang Realm. It's just that... In the nearly perfect state of [Unity of Heaven and Man], even the Changsheng Heavenly Venerate would need some time to discern the origin of this [Holy Fetus Xu Bai] who had never appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm before.</p><p></p><p>The sun was obscured, and the entire Tianling Prefecture instantly turned dark as night. Not only did the "field of vision" plunge into darkness, but all kinds of peeping were also blocked by this sudden blackness.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators in Tianling Prefecture were terrified by this inexplicable state, thinking that some great tribulation had descended. Only those few powerful figures at the Harmonious Dao Realm abruptly stood up, looked up at the sky, their faces shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiao, you've made all the preparations, right?" In Changsheng Valley, Li Fan used a communication talisman to contact Jiao Xiuyuan. </p><p></p><p>"Let me say this upfront, I can only make a move once at the most critical moment. Whether it succeeds or not, I will have nothing to do with it afterwards."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I specifically replaced the puppet avatar I'm using this time with your appearance. Completely dissociated myself from you. So don't even think about using me to scare others." Jiao Xiuyuan's reply was very swift. Obviously, he was quite apprehensive about this "deal". It's just that Li Fan gave a price that he couldn't refuse, making him willingly take the risk to try.</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Having received confirmation from Jiao Xiuyuan, Li Fan did not say much more. He simply hung up the communication.</p><p>His gaze turned towards the ninety-eight chaotic character puppets standing straight in the secret room.</p><p>Not only was each puppet engraved with incomplete chaotic characters,</p><p>but the eighty-one puppets, as a whole, also formed a rough shape of the character "chaos".</p><p>However, their core components were still gathered and placed in the very center.</p><p>The final assembly had not been completed.</p><p>"If my guess is correct, after the Sage Embryo Xu Bai merges with the Dao and Mr. Bai fully awakens, the first thing he will do is come to me to seize [Huan Zhen]."</p><p>"There's no avoiding it, no escaping it. Waiting for him here, only in death can I seek life!"</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the center of the chaotic character puppets, Li Fan refocused his attention, trying to sense the situation on Sage Embryo Xu Bai's side.</p><p>That sky-covering cloud seemed to affect even this kind of mutual sensing between the original bodies.</p><p>It had become intermittent.</p><p>Most of the time, it was impossible to perceive.</p><p>Only in brief intervals could he vaguely see the scenes in Tianling Prefecture.</p><p>The distortion of the heavenly principles no longer occurred, as if all the power of the world's essence in the Xuanhuang Realm had been gathered.</p><p>Sage Embryo Xu Bai's appearance had become completely different from that of his clone, Xu Bai.</p><p>The various powerful auras that originally emanated from him during the distortion of the heavenly principles slowly dissipated.</p><p>Returning to simplicity, he appeared like an ordinary person.</p><p>Suddenly, as if sensing something, he slowly raised his head to look at the sky.</p><p>His gaze penetrated the dark cloud layer, passed through the firmament, and reached beyond the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>Li Fan's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p>Because through the shared body sensation, he saw a giant palm pressing down from above!</p><p>In the last moment of the image, he seemed to see the giant palm colliding with the cloud layer of Tianling Prefecture.</p><p>The giant palm was unstoppable.</p><p>The black cloud barrier formed by the will of heaven and earth, in front of it, was as fragile as ceramic, shattering upon contact.</p><p>And Sage Embryo Xu Bai simply watched the giant palm descend.</p><p>There was no fear on his face.</p><p>As the sensory image disappeared, Li Fan silently counted.</p><p>After three breaths.</p><p>He felt the ground shake violently.</p><p>As if experiencing a major earthquake, it took a long time to gradually subside.</p><p>Li Fan knew that the scene he had just seen was not an illusion.</p><p>This earthquake was caused by the aftershock of the collision between the giant palm and the black cloud barrier.</p><p>Changsheng Valley was located in Luoyan Prefecture, about half of the Wanxian Alliance's territory away from Tianling Prefecture.</p><p>Even so, it was still subjected to such a violent impact.</p><p>It could be seen that the collision might have affected the entire Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p>"Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate?"</p><p>This name flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant.</p><p>The black clouds in Tianling were the work of the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao, in order to buy enough time for Mr. Bai's descent.</p><p>And without a doubt, the one who could so easily destroy it was none other than the one who pressured all the new Dharma cultivators...</p><p>Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate!</p><p>Although the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's action easily shattered the Heavenly Dao's cover,</p><p>the purpose of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao had already been achieved.</p><p>Because...</p><p>Sage Embryo Xu Bai, or rather, Mr. Bai, had disappeared!</p><p>There was no longer any aura of a cultivator on him.</p><p>He had completely merged into the Xuanhuang world.</p><p>Like a drop of water falling into the ocean.</p><p>Even if the divine sense of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate could sweep across the entire Xuanhuang Realm in an instant,</p><p>it would still take some time to find Mr. Bai.</p>

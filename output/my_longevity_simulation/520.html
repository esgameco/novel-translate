        <h1>Chapter 520</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Even though orders had been issued in advance, instructing disciples to be extra cautious. They were instructed to isolate themselves as much as possible, not to go out, and to avoid contact with others.</p><p></p><p>Various elixirs were also distributed to the disciples as needed.</p><p></p><p>Butâ€¦</p><p></p><p>All these measures were in vain!</p><p></p><p>The infectious speed and lethality of the strange disease to low-level cultivators far exceeded the imagination of the upper echelons of the Dao sect.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month, almost all the disciples of the Dao sect had contracted this strange disease. And the miraculous elixirs like the Creation Purple Gold Pill were not something all disciples were fortunate enough to enjoy.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary elixirs were almost like placebos in the face of this strange disease.</p><p></p><p>It all depended on the personal luck of the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Those with mild infections slowly improved after enduring a period of suffering. Although their cultivation suffered setbacks, at least they preserved their lives.</p><p></p><p>More severe cases were grim. Despite various life-saving methods and secret techniques, they all failed to survive.</p><p></p><p>What's even more tragic is that now everyone within the Dao sect is in a state of constant fear.</p><p></p><p>Even if these people were to pass away, no one dared to collect their bodies. They were cremated from a distance, with spells used to completely obliterate the remains, serving as a crude funeral.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao sect, there was a sense of gloom and despair, with cries of misery constantly heard. It was truly hard to imagine that this was one of the most powerful sects in the cultivation world today.</p><p></p><p>If the Dao sect is like this, the dire situation in other places can also be inferred from it.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Sect Leader Ji Changxi once again summoned Sister Zhao and Li Fan to the main hall of the sect to discuss the matter of this mysterious disease epidemic.</p><p></p><p>*Cough cough...*</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the main hall, they heard a continuous coughing sound coming from all directions.</p><p></p><p>The various elders and Sect Leader Ji Changxi no longer had their usual spirited appearance.</p><p></p><p>Those who were ill were just trying to force themselves to stay alert. Many elders were simply lying down, with a few puppets on each side lightly massaging them, while they occasionally groaned.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all in the main hall, Li Fan noticed that they had isolated each other with prohibitions and formations.</p><p></p><p>"How have you two been feeling recently?" Sect Leader Ji asked.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Leader, for your concern. In this past month, we have each taken three Creation Purple Gold Pills. Now, Li Fan and I are mostly fine. Many of the symptoms have disappeared, and we will likely recover soon." Sister Zhao replied with her head lowered.</p><p></p><p>*Cough cough,* "Although it is a good thing, one should not be complacent in the future and should still pay attention to personal protection. According to the current situation, even if one recovers from this strange disease, they will still face a second or even multiple infections..." Ji Changxi's face turned grave.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao couldn't help but change color slightly.</p><p></p><p>But before she could react, Ji Changxi spoke again, "I called you here today to give you a mission."</p><p></p><p>"After a period of investigation, we have a preliminary conclusion about the origin of this strange disease."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately focused his attention and listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>"We speculated before that this disease was a reversal of certain laws of heaven and earth by a certain Transcendent being. It wasn't until recently that we finally determined which laws of heaven and earth they were."</p><p></p><p>"In the eyes of cultivators, mortals are like ants. But with this disease, even mortals can slay immortals!" A hint of uncontrollable anger flashed in Ji Changxi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The source of this strange disease was actually a plague that spread among mortals a few years ago."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, it posed no threat to us cultivators, but after a series of manipulations by this Transcendent being, there was a qualitative change. It became a threat to our lives."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, it can be called the Immortal Plague now."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what this powerful Transcendent being of the Longevity Realm is thinking, or what their purpose is, to force us onto a path of death. But the current situation is a bit out of control."</p><p></p><p>"Out of control?" Sister Zhao was surprised, "Has the Immortal Plague developed to such an extent now?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi shook his head, "You've been in the sect all this while and don't know what has been happening outside in the past month."</p><p></p><p>"The source of the Immortal Plague is mortals, and this is no secret. This matter has already spread among the community of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators who were on the brink of death due to the Immortal Plague, in order to vent their anger, have started slaughtering mortals indiscriminately. Now, at the foot of the mountain, it is like a scene from hell."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than causing trouble for that Transcendent being of the Longevity Realm, they vent their anger on mortals. They bully the weak and fear the strong, truly a group of wastes who, if they die, deserve it!" A cold light flashed in Sister Zhao's eyes upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Changxi said, "It's normal for people on the verge of death to lose their reason. It's not their fault."</p><p></p><p>"But indiscriminate slaughter of mortals is indeed going too far. The Immortal Plague lingers inside mortals' bodies, and even if they die, the Immortal Plague will not disappear but instead spread all over. And if they manage to kill off all mortals, how would things be sustained..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi paused briefly.</p><p></p><p>"So, this kind of mad behavior must be stopped."</p><p></p><p>"All the elders are searching for and researching ways to counter the Immortal Plague and are preoccupied. After much thought, this heavy task can only be entrusted to the two of you."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the cultivation world is vast, and relying solely on you two is not enough. Not just our Dao sect, but other sects will also send out disciples to save the lives of mortals."</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao first acknowledged the command, and then raised her own doubts, "In the past, those cultivators might have feared the reputation of our Ten Immortal Sects and refrained from slaughtering mortals. But now, most of them are already desperate due to illness..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi understood her meaning and waved his hand to interrupt her, then continued, "Those who have completely lost their reason need no further words. It's better to kill them and be done with it. As for the others, we can tell them that the Ten Immortal Sects have come up with a way to deal with the Immortal Plague. Let them wait patiently and refrain from causing innocent deaths."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sister Zhao's expression couldn't help but become somewhat strange, "Have they really found a way to deal with the Immortal Plague?"</p><p></p><p>Contrary to her expectations, Ji Changxi nodded slightly, "It was a suggestion put forward by the Longevity Beast of the Mystic Beast Sect. Since the Immortal Plague originates from mortals, and mortals cannot be entirely wiped out, the best course of action is to exile them all to the various subsidiary caves and small worlds within the Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"With no mortals, the concentration of the Immortal Plague in the Yellow Realm will likely decrease significantly. After this, completely eliminating its influence is not a difficult task. At the very least, it can allow us cultivators to live a normal life."</p><p></p><p>"Although the feasibility of the plan is still under discussion and evaluation, it shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Migration Plan..."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>But at this moment, Shuofeng once again waved his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>The sword light slashed on the wooden sword, making a sound like striking a big bell.</p><p></p><p>Both of them hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the sword light suddenly changed its direction, rushing towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>The speed was faster, the sword was sharper!</p><p></p><p>Locked by the attacking sword light, unable to dodge. Li Fan had no intention of exposing his true strength, and this test had also achieved its purpose.</p><p></p><p>So he stretched out his right hand, directly revealing the water attribute Dongtian, calling upon the power of Dongtian's Law Domain to suppress the sword light.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The sword light originally from Li Fan, after being hit back by the wooden sword, seemed to have gained a few more "sharp" attributes of a sword.</p><p></p><p>Even though locked in the Law Domain of Dongtian, it did not stop the forward slashing momentum. With a loud rumbling sound, it vowed to break free from the binding.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly snorted and increased his strength.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he completely suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Shuofeng again, he did not take advantage of this opportunity to launch an attack. Instead, it seemed like something was wrong with him as he was trying to calm down the wooden sword that kept swinging violently.</p><p></p><p>"Let's end this sparring here! I am two realms higher than you, yet we fought evenly, which means I have lost. 新69書吧→69shux.com," Li Fan sighed and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The pride of the heavens is still the pride of the heavens, Foundation Establishment, Dao Origin...."</p><p></p><p>"Is far beyond the reach of us mortals," Li Fan seemed somewhat disheartened.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling deeply, seeing Shuofeng reining in the wooden sword, he couldn't help but comfort, "Friend, do not worry. Most of what I can achieve is also thanks to this wooden sword."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the personality displayed by Li Fan was very appealing to Shuofeng, or perhaps it was because he had no fear at all.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Shuofeng couldn't help but say proudly, "To be honest, this sword..."</p><p></p><p>"Is indeed a wonder of the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"Friend's defeat is not due to lack of combat skill!"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng gently stroked the body of the wooden sword, a hint of infatuation flashing across his face.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to be shocked, he stared at the unimpressive wooden sword in Shuofeng's hand and said, "Is this sword really a wonder of the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"Friend, are you joking? The wonders of the heavens are in harmony with the will of heaven, ethereal and unseen. The only recognized wonders are the legendary YanfaJue," Li Fan deliberately said so.</p><p></p><p>"This broken sword is also a wonder of the heavens?" Li Fan deliberately questioned.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng chuckled, "I recognized it as Heaven's Wonder while forging it. This Heaven's Wonder is named 【Sword】."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Shuofeng gently waved the wooden sword to create a sword flower.</p><p></p><p>"Sword?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this item is the convergence and incarnation of the laws of the Yellow Realm's sword?" he couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng nodded and pointed the wooden sword towards a lush tree not far away.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's gaze, the tree underwent a mysterious change in an instant. With a slight breeze, the leaves falling from the branches drifted with the wind.</p><p></p><p>As it brushed past another tree, it appeared like an unmatched sharp sword, slashing through the air.</p><p></p><p>The tree was immediately cut in two.</p><p></p><p>Another strong wind blew, leaves fluttering. The tree turned into a splendid swordsman, continuously brandishing its sword.</p><p></p><p>The trees nearby collapsed one after another.</p><p></p><p>This strange scene left Li Fan dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, friend's words are not unfounded!" he pretended to be stuttering due to shock, slowly said.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng smiled faintly, "Naturally. This item was obtained by me at great risk from the ruins of the Heavenly Sword Sect from ancient times."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the wooden sword in his hand, Shuofeng recalled the scene at that time, "If you haven't seen it with your own eyes, friend, you can't imagine the shock I felt back then. The sword mound of the Heavenly Sword Sect buried millions of swords. But all these ancient swords inserted into the ground haphazardly, without any rules, pointed slightly curved in the same direction."</p><p></p><p>"Like paying homage to the emperor in the sword."</p><p></p><p>"And in the center of the millions of sword mounds, I found it."</p><p></p><p>A sense of pride flashed across Shuofeng's face, "At that time, I knew that despite my mother's opposition, persisting in cultivation was the most correct choice."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, how could I have this encounter?"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Sword Sect, sword mound......" Li Fan stared at the Heaven's Wonder 【Sword】, with countless thoughts flashing through his mind. However, he ultimately gave up on immediately launching his binding bug technique and acquiring the item for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven's Wonder..." Li Fan's eyes were full of envy.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng waved his big hand, arrogantly said, "I always act as I please. You know my identity, even in our sparring just now, you did not hold back and went all out. Good!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if you were to tell someone else about this, so what? If you have this divine item but can't flaunt it to others and instead hide it, isn't it the same as a secret night operation?"</p><p></p><p>"However, possessing a rare treasure like this will inevitably attract others," Li Fan paused, still finding it hard to understand.</p><p></p><p>"Trifling covetousness?" At this point, Shuofeng suddenly burst into laughter, showing his dominance.</p><p></p><p>A golden armor appeared on his body, radiating a strong pressure, even causing Li Fan to involuntarily step back.</p><p></p><p>"Although this wonder of heaven is extremely rare, it is useless to cultivators at the Dao Merging level and above."</p><p></p><p>"Who under the Dao Merging level can harm me? And even if it's a formidable Dao Merging expert, they might not be able to break through the defense of this armor."</p><p></p><p>Pointing to the armor on his body, Shuofeng said with a somewhat complicated expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the confidence of the top-tier Immortal Second Generation of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"But it's good - without your confidence, it would have taken me a lot of effort to get information about this Heaven's Wonder from you," Li Fan suppressed his thoughts, looked at Shuofeng who had put away the golden armor, and asked again, "Although your wooden sword is indeed extraordinary, I always feel that its specific performance seems somewhat different from the legendary Heaven's Wonder."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because friend has not fully mastered it yet?"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng, upon hearing this, showed a hint of helplessness on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Friend observes carefully! The Heaven's Wonder is indeed not trivial. Even though I have forged a bond with it, I still cannot completely control it. Sometimes it even escapes my control."</p><p></p><p>"Just now, I almost injured you because of this."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan suddenly remembered the scene from his previous life of Shuofeng battling with Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

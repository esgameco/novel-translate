        <h1>Chapter 609</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At the moment when a figure appeared, Li Fan's heart suddenly beat violently.</p><p></p><p>His whole body's hair stood up slightly, and cold sweat even dripped down from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>The scene recorded in the Medicine King Ding seemed to have been influenced by something, becoming distorted and vague.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously taking a step back, Li Fan reacted, his face turning pale.</p><p></p><p>"Just a recorded scene, yet it has such power."</p><p></p><p>"Is that..."</p><p></p><p>"A true immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Before Liu Ruchen fell, she left behind many things.</p><p></p><p>Including the terrifying existence above the Xuanhuang realm that seemed to swallow everything.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, after a cultivator broke through the Harmony realm and passed through the heavenly tribulation, they could be guided to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>But from a certain day onwards, a change occurred.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator who successfully passed the thunder tribulation and ascended to the immortal realm actually returned not long after, looking grim.</p><p></p><p>Thus, people learned that the path to the immortal realm was severed.</p><p></p><p>The original passage to the immortal realm even became a ruin.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, the vast majority of cultivators only knew about the existence of the "Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>What it looked like and its state were unknown to them.</p><p></p><p>With the path to immortality cut off, more and more cultivators lingered in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>However, being at the Harmony realm, their lifespan was limited, albeit extending for thousands of years being the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Those who reached this realm were all outstanding figures favored by the heavens. How could they sit still and await death?</p><p></p><p>And so, the Longevity realm emerged.</p><p></p><p>There were rare and unique treasures in the world that could grant longevity.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed rare long-life treasures in the world, bestowed with special powers by the heavens.</p><p></p><p>When cultivators reached the end of their lives and wanted to defy fate, they needed to seize such powers.</p><p></p><p>That was the position of the Longevity Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The original Longevity realm came about like this.</p><p></p><p>But the positions of the Longevity Fruits were limited, and there were too many Harmony realm cultivators in the world.</p><p></p><p>Thus, conflicts were inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the great battles, a force known as the Profound Sky Sect rapidly rose to power.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Profound Sky Sect was the cultivator who ascended to immortality but returned after, and he was the only existence in the Xuanhuang realm at the time with the breath of the immortals filling his body, just a step away from becoming a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Compared to cultivators and Longevity practitioners, a true immortal represented a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, his strength surpassed that of other Harmony realm and Longevity practitioners by far.</p><p></p><p>Under his leadership, the Profound Sky Sect almost presented a crushing stance, sweeping through the Xuanhuang realm at the time.</p><p></p><p>Apart from being powerful, this person was also cunning.</p><p></p><p>Using the Longevity Fruit positions as bait, he attracted more than ten top Harmony realm cultivators of the time.</p><p></p><p>With the addition of these people, the Profound Sky Sect became unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the Profound Sky Sect dominated the world, with few daring to resist.</p><p></p><p>The so-called half-immortal called himself the Sky King.</p><p></p><p>The twelve strongest fighters within the sect were known as the Kings of Profound Laws.</p><p></p><p>After the Profound Sky Sect almost unified the cultivation world, to strengthen its rule, they were inspired to seize other powers besides the Longevity positions.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, cultivators had revered the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Although they could move mountains and rivers, they believed that their power ultimately came from the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>But after the advent of the Profound Sky Sect...</p><p></p><p>The rules were broken.</p><p></p><p>By assuming the role of the heavens, the Profound Sky Sect, through the edicts of the Sky King within, could grant an ordinary person enough power to rival cultivators.</p><p></p><p>There were cultivators who thought about resistance.</p><p></p><p>But the Sky King somehow obtained a treasure called the Profound Sky Mirror, which could reflect all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>Several secret gatherings aimed towards achieving something had yet to bear fruit before the Profound Sky Sect wiped them out in a single sweep.</p><p></p><p>Most sects were already weak, and after this event, none of them entertained the thought of resistance.</p><p></p><p>But there was ultimately no permanent rule.</p><p></p><p>As the rule of the Profound Sky Sect continued, their arrogance grew. They openly mistreated cultivators within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when all people had had enough, at the call of the ten major sects, the cultivators united and overthrew the rule of the Profound Sky Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, now it seems that the Ten Immortal Sects and the Profound Sky Sect were just the same."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Ruins forcibly absorb all external material energy."</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Immortal Sects claim leadership of all sects under the heavens. For matters concerning the life and death of the world, they never once informed us."</p><p></p><p>In her last words, Liu Ruchen spoke with a voice full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen speculated that something unbelievable must have happened in the immortal realm back then.</p><p></p><p>This ultimately led to the complete severance of the path to immortality.</p><p></p><p>And that corpse on the Immortal Ruins might be an immortal who escaped from the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Not even a true immortal could escape the horrifying suction of the Immortal Ruins. One could imagine the consequences if the Xuanhuang realm fell into the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>It was unlikely that any living being could survive under such calamity.</p><p></p><p>When the Ten Immortal Sects overturned the rule of the Profound Sky Sect and inherited its legacy, it was impossible for them not to be aware of this.</p><p></p><p>But they kept it a secret.</p><p></p><p>Even when the Medicine King Sect wanted to break through the boundary, they didn't issue a warning but watched their entire sect head towards death.</p><p></p><p>It was truly despicable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the scene continued, the Medicine King Ding eventually escaped the horrific incident amid intense tremors.</p><p></p><p>After circling around the terrifying entrance of the Immortal Ruins, it returned to the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The scene disappeared, returning to the panorama of the Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had still not come back to his senses for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Since it involved the lives of all the cultivators in a sect, Liu Ruchen was not rash.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the elders of the Medicine King Sect also agreed to his plan.</p><p></p><p>All of this had fundamental reasons.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor of the Medicine King Sect, Medicine King Sun Piaomiao, had once gone to nearby other cultivation realms in search of the method to ascend to immortality when the path to immortality was initially severed.</p><p></p><p>But to his astonishment, he found that these worlds, just like the Xuanhuang realm, had lost their connection to the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>And delving deeper into the void was beyond his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he could only return helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The beacon within the Medicine King Sect pointed to a cultivation realm called "Xiaoyao," which Medicine King Sun Piaomiao had visited.</p><p></p><p>In Liu Ruchen's view, since the predecessor did not encounter any danger when crossing through the void initially, she believed that as long as she emulated him carefully, there should be no major problem along the way.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that before leaving the Xuanhuang realm, such an incident would occur.</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning, Sun Piaomiao could ignore the attraction of the Immortal Ruins and move freely between the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"But now, escaping from there has become incredibly difficult."</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Sky Sect, along with the Ten Immortal Sects, constantly captures the surrounding caves, small worlds, in an attempt to resist the attraction of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"By now, even the 'weight' of a cultivator is crucial for survival in the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So, does it mean that the attraction of the Immortal Ruins is strengthening as time goes by?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 550</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A group of cultivators led by Long Yueyou, including Zhou Kebao, gathered together.</p><p></p><p>They discussed Li Fan's recent actions.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time they suffered a loss in Li Fan's hands and were forced to cooperate with him, although they did not mention it on the surface, everyone had some knots in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were all prominent figures.</p><p></p><p>Calculating against Li Fan only resulted in being outsmarted by the opponent. Losing money was a minor issue, but losing face was significant!</p><p></p><p>Even though they had already reached a "friendly cooperation" on the surface, it did not prevent them from secretly setting up obstacles for Li Fan at crucial moments.</p><p></p><p>They harbored a deep grudge in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>So they were very concerned about every move of Li Fan, such as entrusting He Zhenghao to raise a substantial contribution, and then massively purchasing goods. Naturally, they could not hide these actions from their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, how do you see it? Follow Li Fan and buy together. Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, do you want to make a fortune following him?" Someone in the crowd sneered disdainfully. "It is well known that this person is extremely deceitful and cunning. Looking back on his past actions, every time he made a big show, wasn't it all premeditated, wanting to deceive others?"</p><p></p><p>"Puxianzhen Ye suffered heavy losses, not that long ago. Haven't you all forgotten?" </p><p></p><p>"Hey, Zhu Daozhu, you can't say that. The present is different from the past. Now, Li Fan holds an official position as the secret envoy of the Congyun City. As a 69 Book Club advocate, how can he still act so recklessly as before? If he maliciously disrupts the market again, undermining the stability of the Immortal Alliance, can the headquarters spare him?" Another person sang a different tune.</p><p></p><p>When this was said, most of the cultivators present nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Right! According to my view, he must have foreseen something big happening, which is why he is making such a big move. It should be noted that the fundraising program overseen by He Zhenghao was established since Li Fan's appearance in the world. In the early days, Li Fan gained a great reputation and it is closely related to this fundraising program. It can be said that it is his signature! I don't believe he would do something that would tarnish his reputation!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's follow him! In terms of financial strength, can those miscellaneous groups compete with us?" </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The crowd was noisy, and at one moment, most of the cultivators were willing to follow Li Fan and operate synchronously with him.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not oppose Li Fan very much, they still had a lot of trust in his abilities.</p><p></p><p>While the people were discussing fervently, Zhou Kebao remained silent and frowned.</p><p></p><p>In the center, Long Yueyou, who had a faint smile on his face but maintained a stern look, after seeing Zhou Kebao's performance, asked, "Zhou Dao friend, how do you view this matter?"</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Zhou Kebao answered directly without hesitation, "Without a doubt, we can refer to Li Fan's purchasing list and buy the same goods."</p><p></p><p>Long Yueyou was slightly astonished by Zhou Kebao's decisive statement. However, he did not interrupt and patiently listened on.</p><p></p><p>"The prices of these items should rise significantly soon," Zhou Kebao continued to express his confusion. "But what puzzles me is if the prices of these listed goods all rise together."</p><p></p><p>"If such a thing really happens, there is only one possibility."</p><p></p><p>"That is a massive-scale battlefield about to erupt."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao lightly flicked his finger, and a light screen appeared in the air at the scene.</p><p></p><p>Many characters emerged on the screen, and the list on it, given by Li Fan to He Zhenghao, was exactly the same without any difference.</p><p></p><p>After Zhou Kebao's words, the crowd quieted down. They stared at the moving characters on the screen, also full of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"War? With the Five Elders Association? It's unlikely, it's been many years since we had a real battle with weapons. Although the recent border situation is tense, it shouldn't escalate to an actual war, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly! Not long ago, the Five Elders Association took away the whole Wanxian Island. We endured it, didn't we? If there really is a war outbreak, it must be breaking through the sky, right?" The first reaction of the majority of cultivators present was disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard any unusual rumors recently? If a real fight is brewing, it wouldn't be without any preparations from all parties below." Long Yueyou was also serious at this moment, inquiring.</p><p></p><p>There was a brief silence.</p><p></p><p>Then the cultivators took out communication talismans one after another, activated their channels, and tried to gather information.</p><p></p><p>However, without exception, they all shook their heads, having no gains.</p><p></p><p>"Weird..." Zhou Kebao was even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>And the cultivators all looked at Long Yueyou, waiting for his final decision.</p><p></p><p>With slightly narrowed eyes, Long Yueyou pondered for a moment, recalling the scenes when he dealt with Li Fan before, feeling that he could not see through this person.</p><p></p><p>So he made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Better to believe it than to have doubts. Li Fan is someone with some real skills."</p><p></p><p>"He must have foreseen some future events, this time we should just follow along!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing some reluctance in the crowd, Long Yueyou smiled indifferently, "Go ahead and make the purchases."</p><p></p><p>"I have checked the list of goods. Although they are not used much in usual times, they are stable in price and can be stored for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"Even if this is another plot set by Li Fan, we won't lose much."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you still don't feel at ease..."</p><p></p><p>"If any unexpected events occur, at that time, our Dragon family can buy all the goods in your hands at the purchasing price."</p><p></p><p>"I guarantee you will not suffer any more losses!" Long Yueyou said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was surprised by his words.</p><p></p><p>Because Long Yueyou did not say "I" but "Dragon family."</p><p></p><p>Watching the cultivators return to their senses with some pleasantly surprised expressions, Long Yueyou proudly said, "That's right, my eldest brother recently broke through to the Combined Dao realm."</p><p></p><p>"With some maneuvers, he will soon be transferred to the headquarters of the Buzheng Hall."</p><p></p><p>"The relevant orders are about to be issued soon, even if I didn't mention it, you fellow cultivators should be able to know soon."</p><p></p><p>After Long Yueyou admitted it personally, the cultivators at the scene were all delighted.</p><p></p><p>Their small group, entwined over the years, was actually already like one entity.</p><p></p><p>All for one, and one for all. Among them, Long Yueyou occupied the dominant position.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon family's influence was huge, with relations spreading across the various states of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was not having a figurehead who could stand up as the backbone.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Long Yueyou's brother's promotion to the Combined Dao realm and being transferred to the Immortal Alliance headquarters,</p><p></p><p>this sole shortcoming would also be remedied.</p><p></p><p>A Combined Dao cultivator in the headquarters of the Buzheng Hall, that would be the pinnacle of power in the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>So they all wholeheartedly congratulated Long Yueyou.</p><p></p><p>"Tianling State, the land of bitter cold, Brother Jiuyuan has been hiding for a long time and is finally about to soar. It is indeed a joyous occasion!"</p><p></p><p>()</p>

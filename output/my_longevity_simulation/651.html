            <p>Was it that he didn't want to?</p><p></p><p>It was just that he simply couldn't achieve it.</p><p></p><p>If we talk about mystical objects of heaven and earth, the laws of heaven and earth, with one's own efforts, one could still struggle to strive for something.</p><p></p><p>However, when it came to the Yuanying, Nascent Soul stage, wanting to obtain powerful, rare Daoist worlds, the essence of heaven, it was useless to rely solely on one's own diligence. Without the background resources of a family clan, insufficient personal opportunities, how could one compete with other cultivators?</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, being able to find a resource, succeed in promotion, was already fortunate. Why would they still have the luxury to be picky and choosy?</p><p></p><p>Like the first Virtuoso, facing the temptation of the essence of heaven and earth and decisively giving up the opportunity to merge with the Dao. Indeed, it was because of his innate talent and did not value the weak essence of heaven and earth. But wouldn't it also be because of his high position in the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, the resources and information he held, far beyond what ordinary cultivators could compare with?</p><p></p><p>The strong could meticulously select and consider for their future path, leading to even greater strength.</p><p></p><p>While the weak could only seize the hard-earned opportunity for promotion, barely break through, thus remaining weak.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, from the Yuanying stage and above for cultivators, the gap in individual strength became increasingly noticeable.</p><p></p><p>Even in battles at the same realm, there was the possibility of instant annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Fan had broken through with the Five Elements' great world, already reaching the ceiling of the Yuanying realm.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of how to find a matching "Heavenly Essence," he was still clueless.</p><p></p><p>What is the "Heavenly Essence"?</p><p></p><p>Dragon Jiuyuan cultivated the "Heavenly Spirit Gives Birth to a Thousand Waters" to achieve Nascent Divinity.</p><p></p><p>Hongxi broke through by relying on "The Great Way Gives Birth to a Thousand Mountains."</p><p></p><p>From the information revealed by these two individuals after their deaths, one could perhaps glimpse some clues.</p><p></p><p>The essence of a human creates blood, while the essence of heaven creates laws.</p><p></p><p>When these laws appeared in the Profound Yellow World, they manifested as "changes in heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>In a certain region of the Profound Yellow world, there were predetermined changes that would occur in the future over a period of time.</p><p></p><p>Extracting the essence of heaven and earth meant extracting and isolating the laws that drove these "changes in heaven and earth," and then applying them to oneself.</p><p></p><p>Thus achieving a significant advancement in cultivation and combat strength.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the initial integration of the laws of heaven and earth into one's body laid the foundation for the future merging with the Dao when necessary.</p><p></p><p>"The changes in heaven and earth often span tens of thousands of years. The sensory abilities of cultivators originally cannot easily perceive them. But with the new method of the Celestial Venerable, one can perceive the extremely subtle changes, first tearing a gap, then continuously extracting and absorbing the 'source power' that heaven and earth slowly releases over thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Although this act is akin to greatly depleting the potential of the world, for cultivators, it can significantly boost their strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts churned, synthesizing past knowledge, constantly pondering.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements' great world, self-sustaining cycle, blending into one, this can be encountered but not sought after. If I were to achieve Nascent Divinity and extract the 'Heavenly Essence,' the most suitable consideration would be related to it."</p><p></p><p>"But if the Five Elements are revealed in the world, they will disperse. Perhaps a single type of 'Heavenly Essence' would only correspond to a certain attribute."</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to achieve multiple techniques like in the Golden Core stage during Nascent Divinity is not that simple."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Apart from creating laws, the "Heavenly Essence" also had mechanisms similar to "immunity" and "resistance."</p><p></p><p>Once one already possessed a certain type of heavenly essence, trying to extract another would be noticed, thus facing a certain level of rejection.</p><p></p><p>"The more one has, the greater the rejection force. With each addition, the difficulty almost increases geometrically. Therefore, for the vast majority of cultivators in the world, extracting one heavenly essence is already a limit."</p><p></p><p>"Even someone like Dragon Jiuyuan, who could single-handedly fight the essence of heaven and earth and ascend to the Dao, faces the same. It's evident how difficult it is."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I can only accommodate two types of heavenly essence simultaneously..." Li Fan thought without blindly trusting himself.</p><p></p><p>"For a perfect promotion, unless..."</p><p></p><p>A glint of insight passed through Li Fan's eyes: "Extracting five different types of heavenly essence simultaneously, using the principle of mutual generation and restraint to achieve self-balance."</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly a far-fetched idea.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention where one might encounter an opportunity to extract five heavenly essences simultaneously, but even if encountered, the probability of success would be minute.</p><p></p><p>But any rational cultivator would not choose to do so.</p><p></p><p>However, for Li Fan, it might not hurt to give it a try!</p><p></p><p>The crystalline stone in his mind continuously emitted a blue faint light, integrating and processing the information he had seen before, slowly deducing possible ways to realize his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A dozen days later, Li Fan sensed the awakening aura of Liu San, and his figure flickered, appearing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like Liu San had spent quite a long time in the Meteor Immortal Realm and was still somewhat adapting to reality upon returning.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of confusion in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But this confusion quickly dissipated upon seeing Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go? Did you meet the cultivator of the Medicine King Sect from back then?" Li Fan asked warmly.</p><p></p><p>Liu San shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's strange. The scenes I experienced this time in the Meteor Immortal Realm were not the ancient cultivation world the young master mentioned. Instead, it was a time and space I had never heard of."</p><p></p><p>"There, the celestial methods were completely cut off, and there were no longer any cultivators in the world. People could only rely on resonating with various ancient relics left behind to wield extraordinary power. It's called the Attendant Divine Artifact..."</p><p></p><p>"And this time, I possessed a little kid who was only seven or eight years old."</p><p></p><p>As Liu San reminisced, he narrated his experiences and sights to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It was quite a journey, undergoing countless bloody killings before finally resonating with the legendary most powerful divine artifact."</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Slayer Sword..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Liu San drew out a brightly shining sword, emanating a rainbow light and seemingly carrying an endless sinister aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze sharpened, but upon closer inspection, he smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Liu San then said, "It has quite a reputation. But in reality, it's just a primordial flying sword refined during the Nascent Soul stage. It just happened to absorb a trace of a fallen cultivator's remnants, making it stand out among a pile of 'so-called' divine artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Liu San cast his gaze over this flying sword before him, making a rather disdainful remark, "Crude crafting technique, extremely ordinary material, truly rubbish."</p><p></p><p>With that, he exerted a slight force.</p>

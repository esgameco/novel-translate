            <p>Chapter 1026: The Destiny of Procreators</p><p></p><p>Lu Chengxue, as a core disciple of the Lu family, had an excellent reputation. </p><p></p><p>In the half-day that Li Fan had been secretly tailing him, a total of thirty-seven people had encountered Lu Chengxue. Every one of them was polite and greeted him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan could see that the smiles on their faces were not fake, but genuine happiness from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After being busy for half a day, Lu Chengxue finally returned to his own cave residence in a leisurely manner.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed him in as well.</p><p></p><p>The defensive formations of the cave residence were naturally non-existent in the eyes of the current Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He entered silently, without being noticed by anyone inside the residence.</p><p></p><p>"Husband is back!" </p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Chengxue returned to the cave residence, eleven female cultivators, all plump or slender and with top-class appearances, came out to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>Three of them were even already pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Faced with so many beauties welcoming him, Lu Chengxue only slightly nodded, his expression cold.</p><p></p><p>He walked straight to the deepest and largest room in the cave residence. </p><p></p><p>The eleven female cultivators followed him, giggling.</p><p></p><p>The door of the room slammed shut, and soon after, the intense sounds of lovemaking faintly emanated from within.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan peeked at the scene inside the room, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>But it was not out of envy for Lu Chengxue's treatment.</p><p></p><p>Rather, throughout the entire process, Lu Chengxue's face remained expressionless.</p><p></p><p>It didn't seem like he was enjoying it, but more like he was completing a mission.</p><p></p><p>And from his conversation with the eleven female cultivators, Li Fan learned the reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, having as many offspring as possible was the most important means by which the Lu family was able to maintain its prosperity.</p><p></p><p>You have to understand, it's not that easy to be a great philanthropist in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, in order to help, you might even have to risk your own life.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Lu family was able to maintain its image of being charitable for so long was because there were simply too many people in the Lu family.</p><p></p><p>So many that the Lu family wouldn't hesitate in the slightest to exchange the lives of its members for the growth of the family's reputation.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the missions assigned by the family, every member of the Lu family had to give birth to a certain number of offspring each year.</p><p></p><p>Every member of the Lu family was also very clear about their own fate. They might have to sacrifice themselves at any time, so living life to the fullest had become a consistent style of the Lu family members.</p><p></p><p>Almost all members of the Lu family had more than ten spouses.</p><p></p><p>As long as they had free time, they basically used it to produce offspring.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some people would always indulge in it and never tire of it. But obviously, not everyone could maintain their enthusiasm in the daily grind of completing tasks.</p><p></p><p>"He's said to be a core disciple of the family, but he can't escape the fate of a stud. At most, he just gets to choose more pleasing spouses."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, it's not a bad thing for me to help you escape."</p><p></p><p>Outside the room, the peeping Li Fan had an expressionless face.</p><p></p><p>He waited until the great battle was over and Lu Chengxue and the eleven beauties were all in a drowsy slumber.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan flash into the room.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chengxue was at the Hua Shen stage, while the other women were at most at the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan grabbed Lu Chengxue's head and absorbed the defenseless him into his own cave world.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even alert the other female cultivators, and then quickly withdrew like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>When they woke up, even if they couldn't find any trace of Lu Chengxue, they would only think that he had left early due to fatigue.</p><p></p><p>And by the time they finally discovered...</p><p></p><p>Lu Chengxue's disappearance must have happened a few days later.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without waking up Lu Chengxue, Li Fan directly gave him a quick end.</p><p></p><p>Letting him die quietly in his sleep.</p><p></p><p>The phenomenon of the cultivator's demise was also concealed by Li Fan's formation. No one in the Lingmu Realm could detect it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a top-grade Dao Forming Stone emitting a crystal-clear white light appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Wanxian Alliance, there was one Stone Mother Fragment, three supreme-grade Dao Forming Stones, and sixteen top-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't expect that among the three targeted individuals this time, there would be holders of supreme-grade stones or Stone Mother Fragments.</p><p></p><p>The top-grade Dao Forming Stone was already enough for him.</p><p></p><p>By continuously merging and strengthening in each lifetime, he was bound to reach the realm of the Dao Forming Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>This top-grade Dao Forming Stone still contained Lu Chengxue's memories before his death.</p><p></p><p>Instead of directly clearing it, he browsed through the scenes within.</p><p></p><p>"He actually obtained this Dao Forming Stone when he was still a child. Moreover, it was effortlessly obtained from his father's legacy."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chengxue's father sacrificed his life to save someone, and the person he saved, grateful for his kindness, sent this Dao Forming Stone as a token of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lu Chengxue was still young, and this person was worried that the Dao Forming Stone would be seized by the Lu family, so he secretly sought him out.</p><p></p><p>With the Dao Forming Stone, Lu Chengxue also exhibited amazing "talent" as a result. Slowly, he was cultivated as a core disciple, until today when he unfortunately died at Li Fan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Lu Chengxue's life was unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>Except for fathering a total of sixteen descendants, there was nothing else worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>After carefully watching all the scenes, Li Fan shook his head slightly: "A mediocre and pitiful life. Even less exciting than my days in Daxuan."</p><p></p><p>"Such a treasure was wasted."</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's current perspective, he naturally looked down on this kind of life.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't delete Lu Chengxue's memories, but stored them in a corner.</p><p></p><p>Then he began to merge with his own Dao Forming Stone.</p><p></p><p>Rather than becoming one, it was more like absorption and enhancement.</p><p></p><p>After all, the main body was still the one in Li Fan's sea of consciousness that had already reached [Dao Forming God One].</p><p></p><p>As the Dao Forming Stone carrying Lu Chengxue's life turned into a starry river of light, it continuously poured into Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Transformation also occurred on the Dao Forming Stone in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>As if in an instant, the sky became higher, the earth farther, and everything in the world became brighter.</p><p></p><p>All the details of past experiences, noticed and ignored, were all reproduced in Li Fan's mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Including information and techniques that he had occasionally glanced at before, were all re-organized from the dusty memories.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The difference between top-grade and middle-grade is like the difference between a single word and the difference between heaven and earth. I really don't know what kind of realm the supreme-grade, or even the Dao Forming Stone Mother, is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes seemed to show the scene of worlds constantly being born and dying, and he sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He tried to extrapolate the immortal-level formations using the Doomsday Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Dao Forming Stone, Li Fan had a great improvement in dealing with data redundancy.</p><p></p><p>He no longer felt the myriad of thoughts and not knowing where to start, as he did when studying before.</p><p></p><p>Now he no longer felt lost, just a slight browse, and a general research direction immediately appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also tried the Heavenly Measuring Ruler.</p><p></p><p>"The number of scenes that can be supervised at the same time has increased tenfold..."</p><p></p><p>With quantified results, Li Fan was very satisfied with the gains this time.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1027: The Bloody Secret of Chaoyuan</p><p></p><p>After realizing how powerful the top-grade Dao Transformation Stone was, Li Fan wasted no time in capturing the other two people.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they didn't hit the jackpot. The Dao Transformation Stones they carried were still only of top-grade quality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan repeated the process.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing a total of three top-grade Dao Transformation Stones, Li Fan once again felt a long-lost qualitative change, as if he had broken through a major realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't become complacent. He re-analyzed his experiences in this world once more.</p><p></p><p>With his enhanced planning abilities, he made general projections on how to successfully break free from the "True Immortal's Net" in the future, return to the true world smoothly, and even reap benefits from it.</p><p></p><p>"But I still haven't reached the level of the Dao Transformation Stone's source, which can project the levels of the real world. I still need to adapt to the circumstances."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent, with numerous thoughts swirling in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After secluding himself for three full days, he first summoned his avatar, Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"You can go to the Congyun Sea first and scare away the Chaoyuan Sect in advance. If there are no accidents, the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect will still fly towards the Jiushan State."</p><p></p><p>"After the cultivators from various small worlds forcibly advance to the Golden Core realm by taking the elixirs from the Medicine King Sect, you can lead them there."</p><p></p><p>"With your protection, they should be able to break out of the mountain of corpses and river of blood left by the Chaoyuan Sect. When they reappear, they will be able to collectively advance to the Nascent Soul realm. At that time, it will be much easier to explore the secrets from the bloody river."</p><p></p><p>The avatar's mind also instantly recalled everything about the Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Chaoyuan Sect was an ancient cave mansion hidden in the Congyun Sea, beneath the three fault lines on the seabed.</p><p></p><p>Before the Congyun Sea was about to suffer a calamity, it fled far away and landed in the Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng, Zhang Haobo, and Su Xiaomei once explored together in search of a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p></p><p>From their experiences, Li Fan also learned the secrets of the Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Chaoyuan Sect was a native sect of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since the great calamity descended, they had disappeared without a trace, as if they had vanished from the world.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the entire sect had been transformed into a strange state, existing between the real and the illusory, isolated from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to have stagnated within it, in an attempt to avoid the disaster.</p><p></p><p>This was the Chaoyuan Sect's original plan.</p><p></p><p>However, unexpected changes always occur.</p><p></p><p>First, the area where they were located was slapped into the Congyun Sea by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, causing the Chaoyuan Sect to be buried deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Later, perhaps due to the influence of the merging forces of the two realms, various bizarre changes gradually occurred within the Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>When Su Xiaomei and the others entered the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect, although the cultivators inside seemed to be living normally,</p><p></p><p>they had actually all turned into faceless blood faces, losing their own appearances.</p><p></p><p>And they themselves had no awareness of it whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>They would suddenly launch attacks as if they had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>As if they had lost their minds, regardless of their cultivation level, they only attacked like beasts, using their physical bodies and claws.</p><p></p><p>Although they wouldn't use divine powers, these faceless blood faces were truly difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely fast and would recover quickly from injuries.</p><p></p><p>Only by cutting off their entire blood face could they finally be killed.</p><p></p><p>After the faceless blood faces were eliminated, they would transform into a red light that attached to the cultivator who killed them.</p><p></p><p>These red lights were actually the source power of the Chaoyuan Sect's world.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Chaoyuan Sect, these seized red lights would also follow...</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>(The cultivator) left together with the monk.</p><p></p><p>It was like some kind of great nourishment, enough to allow cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage to directly advance to a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the rare materials needed for Foundation Establishment, the methods for Golden Core, and the Nascent Soul Grotto-Heavens would naturally evolve from the red light.</p><p></p><p>And if one mastered a special method of sacrificial refinement, one could directly absorb the essence of the red light in the Chaoyuan Sect's world and use battle to nourish battle.</p><p></p><p>As for why such a bizarre scene would appear in the Chaoyuan Sect, it was temporarily unknown.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan guessed that it might still be due to the influence of the fusion of the Xuanhuang Realm with other worlds.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qing sorted out the ins and outs of the Chaoyuan Sect and then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If that red light essence is also useful to me, then maybe my cultivation level might even surpass yours?" Li Qing said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Then you'll have to kill a lot more. Advancing with the Heaven's Oddity is not the same as others. The resources you need to advance to the Nascent Divinity stage might be more than what ordinary cultivators need to advance to the Harmonious Dao stage." Li Fan was not concerned.</p><p></p><p>"If you really achieve the Nascent Divinity stage, relying on the Heaven's Oddity of the Black Sword, you might be able to last two or three rounds against my subordinates."</p><p></p><p>The clone smiled and did not reply.</p><p></p><p>(The clone) accepted the order and left.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the exploration of the Blood River would be the sole responsibility of the clone Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>In any case, once any secrets were discovered, the clone would know, and naturally, he would also synchronize that knowledge.</p><p></p><p>There shouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While deducing and breaking the restrictions of the Dharma Heavenly Venerate, (Li Fan) also began to create a brand new formation according to Li Fan's design.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan himself, he began to study the ball of white light in his body.</p><p></p><p>It was the mirror essence that the Tianxuan Mirror had given him before.</p><p></p><p>Although the Tianxuan Mirror claimed that this mirror essence only coexisted with it, neither increasing nor decreasing.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan really wanted to know, what if he chose to keep this thing after returning to reality?</p><p></p><p>"Most likely, a new mirror essence will suddenly appear out of thin air in the world."</p><p></p><p>"If the Tianxuan Mirror doesn't sense this new mirror essence..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the days since obtaining the mirror essence, Li Fan had enjoyed too many benefits.</p><p></p><p>Just the fact that the Tianxuan Mirror had almost no defenses against him was worth using an anchor point to keep items.</p><p></p><p>"In the final moments of this world, I can try the Tianxuan Mirror's reaction."</p><p></p><p>"If it's detected, I'm going to return to reality immediately anyway, so there's no impact."</p><p></p><p>"And if the Tianxuan Mirror can't detect this suddenly appearing essence, then it will be of great use."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise of all this was that the items replaced by the anchor points were created out of thin air in the space of items returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>Instead of absorbing the original items in the world.</p><p></p><p>"This actually also represents the real possibility of matters related to returning to reality."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell into deep thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's definitely worth a try."</p><p></p><p>At present, Li Fan only had two blank anchor points left.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan already had a guess in his mind about how to increase the anchor points.</p><p></p><p>The previous increase in anchor points was achieved by Li Fan absorbing the Golden Cores of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And at the very beginning, it was by absorbing the Foundation Establishment rare materials of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Then it was obvious that the next step to increase anchor points was likely to absorb what cultivators needed for Nascent Soul, which was the Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As for why Li Fan had personally visited many Grotto-Heavens, but there was no prompt for absorption when returning to reality...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan guessed that it might be because a newborn Grotto-Heaven was needed.</p>

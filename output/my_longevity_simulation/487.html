        <h1>Chapter 487</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The secrets of chaos characters, the extinguishing sword, the overturning palm, the cluster cloud sword...</p><p></p><p>Every one of them is an existence that can surpass levels to kill enemies.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary supernatural powers of monsters and beasts were not even worth Li Fan's attention. However, this nine-headed bird was evidently not in the same category.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a premonition that the rank of this nine-headed fierce bird seemed to surpass that of the Kun Peng.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what surprises this kid Ye Feipeng can bring to me."</p><p></p><p>After testing the ferocity of the nine-headed bird, he took out a clump of Kun Peng's blood from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>With a certain interval of time, he would extract a strand from Ye Feipeng's body for enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had made some progress in studying the power of Kun Peng.</p><p></p><p>Operating the "Furnace Myriad Forms Technique", he still appeared human in appearance. However, his stomach had quietly transformed into the structure of the Kun Peng beast.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the wonderful use of the Kun form stomach for a moment, Li Fan smiled faintly and took out several high-grade spirit stones equivalent to a hundred contribution points, swallowed them.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, these high-quality spirit stones with high spiritual energy content were absorbed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency was several times higher than that of ordinary cultivators' methods.</p><p></p><p>Though not as crazy as the "Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique," it was still quite frightening.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Ye Feipeng's cultivation speed in the previous life was getting faster and faster, such extraordinary ability is truly not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>As the pure spiritual energy erupted from his stomach, Li Fan's expression changed slightly, trying hard to consume it using his technique.</p><p></p><p>However, the spiritual energy flow burst out from his stomach like a violent mountain torrent, unceasingly surging.</p><p></p><p>His attempts to consume it were futile.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to practicing the "Heaven and Earth Refining Technique," Li Fan's physique had been somewhat strengthened, and his meridians were not damaged by the massive influx of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Allowing it to wreak havoc in his body was not a solution.</p><p></p><p>To avoid attracting attention, Li Fan came to Tianyang's side, converting all the uncontrollable spiritual energy in his body into the Blue Cloud Sword, slashing towards the puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>After several continuous slashes, the riotous spiritual energy was finally exhausted and slowly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Although the seemingly magnificent sword light struck Tianyang, not a trace of impact was left behind.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang tilted his head, looking somewhat puzzled at his "senior brother" Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that Li Fan wanted to spar with him, Tianyang raised his fist.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, junior brother, don't misunderstand. Senior brother just made some mistakes in cultivation." Li Fan smiled and waved his hand, stopping Tianyang's action.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang then showed a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>After comforting Tianyang for a while, Li Fan returned to the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have simulated the stomach of the Kun Peng and obtained the shocking speed of swallowing, a cultivator's body cannot be compared to that of ancient monster beasts."</p><p></p><p>"I am unable to promptly convert the absorbed energy into a powerful resource for myself."</p><p></p><p>"However, if I verify it with the 'Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique'..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, getting an idea suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Improving techniques is not achieved overnight. He detached a part of his mind using the Divination One Secret Art to work on this matter.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried the "Peng Flight" supernatural power again.</p><p></p><p>This time there were no abnormal bone wings growing, just Li Fan constantly maneuvering and moving around in the confined space of the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>His speed increased, almost becoming like a phantom in the air.</p><p></p><p>Exceeding the range recognizable by the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan stopped the experiment, satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Good, by combining the 'Peng Flight' method with the incomplete Purple Cloud Divine Thunder Escape, the flying speed has more than doubled."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, as I delve deeper into the blood essence of the Kun Peng, it will become even faster."</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan did not experiment with the "Terrifying Peng Transformation" supernatural power.</p><p></p><p>He still maintained a respectful distance from this ability to completely transform into a monster shape.</p><p></p><p>Although its power was formidable, if he accidentally triggered Senior Brother Zhang's monstrous body technique, it would be a disaster.</p><p></p><p>In fact, among the various supernatural powers displayed by Ye Feipeng in the previous life, Li Fan was most concerned about the existence called "Lineage Transfusion."</p><p></p><p>From Ye Feipeng's subsequent performance, this bloodline transfusion not only could change a person's physique.</p><p></p><p>The transition from "monster" to "sacred beast" as mentioned by Ye Feipeng clearly illustrated this point.</p><p></p><p>It was not difficult to imagine that Ye Feipeng, influenced by the blood essence of the Kun Peng, would show "loyalty" from the depths of his bloodline when he saw the monster Kun Peng himself.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan lacked at the moment was this kind of control over people.</p><p></p><p>He currently relied on coercive methods through premonitory information, involving threats and temptations.</p><p></p><p>While the effect was good, there were inevitably times where he failed. It was not as reliable and reassuring as this kind of secret technique.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I have to wait until the bloodline of the Kun Peng in Ye Feipeng's body becomes purer to easily comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's time to purchase some blood-supplementing elixirs again."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the remaining elixirs in the storage ring and the regular blood extraction tasks to Tianyang, Li Fan returned to Wan Xian Island.</p><p></p><p>Without heading back to the Tian Xuan Mirror, he went straight to the Thousand Miles Hall.</p><p></p><p>It had been nearly two years, but there had been no response yet regarding the task he had assigned Jiao Xiuyuan to excavate the Little Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Feeling somewhat strange, Li Fan personally went to the door to inquire.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan suddenly appear, Jiao Xiuyuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Then his eyes flickered, and he looked a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Seeing Jiao Xiuyuan's appearance, Li Fan already had a clue.</p><p></p><p>Not in a rush, he stared at Jiao Xiuyuan for a long time before speaking.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiao Xiuyuan uncomfortable under his gaze, Li Fan closed the shop door, lowered his voice, and said, "It's not that I intentionally brushed you off, but I'm in a difficult situation!"</p><p></p><p>"With your ability, is there something in the Medicine King Sect left behind that can stump you?" Li Fan found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years have passed; even if there were any restrictions, they should have expired." Jiao Xiuyuan shook his head, saying, "The key was taken by someone else!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? How do you mean?" Li Fan's expression turned grave.</p><p></p><p>There was another unknown variable emerging.</p><p></p><p>"Just when I was about to confirm the location of the Little Medicine King Cauldron, people from the Guardian Hall of the Wan Xian Alliance suddenly appeared."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 817</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"However, he cannot be mentioned in the same breath as me."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's clone's eyes flashed. Based on the experiences from the previous few lifetimes, he took action in succession, instantly spending 500,000.</p><p></p><p>He exchanged all the contribution points for those materials that would rapidly appreciate in value in the near future.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it seems that the fall of Jiushan Prefecture has ultimately produced some impact."</p><p></p><p>"The price trends of some commodities have already changed. Some have erupted ahead of time, while others have experienced depreciation that did not occur before."</p><p></p><p>The clone operated on the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>And a beam of faint light isolated the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Making it unable to perceive anything from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>He spent another 1 million contribution points to purchase a large number of commonly used items.</p><p></p><p>After putting them away, Li Fan quietly left Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>The clone remained stationed without moving, but contacted He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>That's right, this Ji Shaoli was also acquainted with He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>After all, Daoist He had a wide circle of friends, and they were all in the Congyun Sea, so it wasn't strange for them to know each other.</p><p></p><p>However, they had only met a few times and were not close.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist He, how have you been lately?"</p><p></p><p>"Would you like to gather on Haixuan Island?"</p><p></p><p>Not only to He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>The clone sent out banquet invitations to all the cultivators he remembered having some ties with.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"While pushing the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association to engage in a fierce battle, the research on [Establishing Foundation with Me] cannot be neglected."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this is the thing that can truly shake the foundation of the Dharma transmission."</p><p></p><p>After leaving Haixuan Island, Li Fan's eyes flashed as he took a detour straight to Yinyin Island.</p><p></p><p>Upon arrival, he did not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he first carefully observed for a while.</p><p></p><p>He could vaguely hear the wailing sounds of mortals coming from the island.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he was still studying the mysteries of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>That little dog with eyes flowing on its belly was running wildly on the island with a white rib bone in its mouth.</p><p></p><p>It seemed very happy.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Yin anchored for 3 years before successfully establishing foundation with me."</p><p></p><p>"It just passed not long ago."</p><p></p><p>The scene of fighting against Senior Yin in the previous life was still vivid.</p><p></p><p>Even with his Nascent Soul cultivation and countless divine powers and secret techniques, he was helpless against Senior Yin.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he had to use the Chaotic Character Technique to kill him.</p><p></p><p>In this life, in order not to disturb the Dharma transmission, Li Fan would not easily use the Chaotic Character Technique.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was hoping for the other party to help him develop the [Establishing Foundation with Me] method...</p><p></p><p>It would be best if he could persuade him with words.</p><p></p><p>"Come in. Please enter, Daoist Friend!"</p><p></p><p>The stone gate on the island opened with a boom, and Li Fan flew in.</p><p></p><p>That human-handed little dog suddenly turned its head and stared at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It let out a threatening roar, its eyes full of vigilance.</p><p></p><p>With this roar, the white rib bone fell to the ground with a clang.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes moved and he took it into his hand.</p><p></p><p>This rib bone came from the first cultivator surnamed Su who was infected by the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th lifetime, Li Fan threw it out, attracting the attention of the huge monster composed of countless corpses in the white fog, and escaped a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Seeing its beloved object being snatched away, the human-handed little dog's eyes became fierce.</p><p></p><p>However, after Li Fan glanced at it slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be greatly frightened and instantly restrained itself.</p><p></p><p>With its tail lowered, it fled into the building on the island in a gray and dejected manner.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled and followed it in.</p><p></p><p>Not unfamiliar with this place, Li Fan quickly found Senior Yin.</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous few times he saw him, he was staring somewhat crazily at the mortal being tortured by experiments in the transparent cage. </p><p></p><p>His mouth was muttering something unknown.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw the white rib bone in his hand, and Yin Shangren subconsciously caught it.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." He was stunned at first, and then grasped it tightly with force.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren suddenly realized, and fiercely kicked the human-handed puppy.</p><p></p><p>He put away the white rib bone.</p><p></p><p>His face became much more amiable as he looked at Li Fan and asked, "I don't know why you came here, my friend. What is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around and said, "This is not the place to talk..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was instantly speechless.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't dwell on it and led Li Fan to the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>Walking past Yin Shangren's collection gallery, he also introduced it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that Li Fan seemed to be quite knowledgeable about these things as well.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, he could even add a few words.</p><p></p><p>This made Yin Shangren, who had not found a confidant for many things, very pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>His attitude towards Li Fan became more and more friendly.</p><p></p><p>He kicked the human-handed puppy again and had it serve two cups of black, churning spiritual qi bacterial tea.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Yin Shangren to speak, Li Fan took it up in a very straightforward manner and drank it all in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>His expression did not change.</p><p></p><p>"Good tea!" He even said with some lingering interest.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Yin Shangren even more.</p><p></p><p>"This secret room is quite hidden. My friend, feel free to speak your mind." He also took a sip and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Yin, do you know about [Establishing Foundation with Me]?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Fan's words stunned him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." Choking and coughing a few times, Yin Shangren put down the teacup and looked at Li Fan with a somewhat strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, you came for [Establishing Foundation with Me]?"</p><p></p><p>He had indeed mentioned this to some other people before, but most of them thought it was an absurd statement.</p><p></p><p>They just laughed it off.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was the first to visit solemnly like this.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that Li Fan raised his hand to interrupt his words.</p><p></p><p>The next sentence was earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>"When I first heard about your Establishing Foundation with Me method, I was amazed. But after careful consideration, I felt there were major flaws."</p><p></p><p>"So I racked my brains and spent a great deal of effort to finally perfect it."</p><p></p><p>"In my excitement, I came here specifically to share it with you, my friend."</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can point out any shortcomings for me, Friend Yin."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yin Shangren suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Li Fan, his eyes full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He even started laughing, "You perfected the [Establishing Foundation with Me] method? My friend, don't tease me..."</p><p></p><p>However, as Li Fan uttered the oral secrets word by word, the smile on his face quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was first replaced by surprise.</p><p></p><p>Then solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Then shock.</p><p></p><p>In the end, when Li Fan had expounded the entire Establishing Foundation with Me method,</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's body was already shaking uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible..."</p><p></p><p>"How can this be..."</p><p></p><p>His eyes were full of confusion, as if he was verifying the feasibility of this Establishing Foundation with Me method.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he calculated, there was only one result.</p><p></p><p>Flawless and perfect.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's legs went soft, and he stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Pointing at Li Fan with trembling fingers,</p><p></p><p>Unable to say a word for a long time.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Suddenly coughed, seems like something is not quite right.</p>

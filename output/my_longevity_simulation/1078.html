            <p>Chapter 1076: Suddenly Returning to the Dream</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Why have you been in a daze for so long? Could it be that you're thinking about all the fun places I mentioned to you before?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, once we finish our task, your senior brother will take you to properly experience Red Dust Court, Drunken Immortal Building, and more!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's voice startled Li Fan out of his deep thoughts. </p><p></p><p>"Protecting the mortals of Ningyuan City from calamity..." Looking at the somewhat frivolous Zhang Qianmo before him, Li Fan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan wasn't very interested in becoming the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention that under the current new law system, the power of the Xuanhuang Celestial Venerable had diminished greatly compared to its prime and could no longer single-handedly suppress an entire realm.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the Xuanhuang Celestial Venerable, he would inevitably have to directly face the two ruling institutions of the Xuanhuang Realm. He might even provoke the Dharma Transmission to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't particularly afraid, it would be unwise to rashly choose to confront the Dharma Transmission before figuring out its true strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he could really become the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable who suppressed an entire realm like in its heyday, so what? </p><p></p><p>Power was inevitably accompanied by responsibility. Becoming the Xuanhuang Celestial Venerable also meant being deeply bound to the Xuanhuang Realm, making it even harder to break free compared to ordinary immortal venerables.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's goal was not just the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>What he longed for was to leave this star sea of ultimate darkness enclosed by high walls, thereby obtaining true transcendence and freedom.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Having lofty ideals didn't prevent him from first verifying whether the trial of the "Xuanhuang's Heart" was really as he had guessed.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced the scene of "Ningyuan Collecting Longevity Fruit" too many times, Li Fan quickly made up his mind after having a clear goal this time.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, I seemed to have had a dream just now when I was in a daze." He pretended to look somewhat confused as he slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Zhang Qianmo was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, have you secretly cultivated a purple golden core?" Li Fan asked again instead of directly answering.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, Zhang Qianmo's eyes instantly became sharp: "How do you know?"</p><p></p><p>A dangerous aura also suddenly emerged from his body, subtly locking onto Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed completely unaware of this and only looked shocked: "What I saw in my dream just now was actually true?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Zhang Qianmo's expression turned grim.</p><p></p><p>"Does Senior Brother still remember a person named 'Chu Liang'?" Li Fan immediately recounted what he had seen in his "dream"â€”that they were about to be besieged by villains in Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>"Now that you mention it, I do recall such a character back then..."</p><p></p><p>"He actually joined some Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and wants to scheme for our Purple Mist Sect's secret techniques?" A purple light flashed in Zhang Qianmo's eyes, his killing intent chilling.</p><p></p><p>With that said, he was about to fly into the city to root out those hidden insects and eliminate them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, wait!" Li Fan hurriedly stopped Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>"After all, this is just a scenario I encountered in my dream, and there is no substantive evidence. If it's actually a baseless rumor, wouldn't that be..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled bitterly: "It wasn't easy to finally come down the mountain for a trip by completing the task of collecting longevity fruits. If we stir up trouble, Master might not allow us to descend the mountain in the future. It's better to play it safe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, only then did Zhang Qianmo's killing intent subside.</p><p></p><p>"In that case..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's first send a message outside the city to summon Song Hesong, the steward. We'll capture him directly. If he resists and truly exhibits cultivation levels beyond his capabilities..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused for a moment, "Then it means that the scene I foresaw in my dream is correct. With this evidence, it will be easier to report to the sect."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo thought for a moment and nodded slightly, "Junior Brother, you have considered this thoroughly. Let's do it this way."</p><p></p><p>So the two quietly approached Ningyuan City and sent a message from afar.</p><p></p><p>After a good while, Song Hesong finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the two masters..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Song Hesong was bowing in salute, he was struck by two Purple Heaven Divine Thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>"When was I exposed?" Song Hesong was both shocked and angry. He instinctively activated his spiritual power to block the thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>He was about to notify the few people hiding in the city to take action early, but he discovered that the surrounding space had already been sealed off. His heart sank at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Although I can only use Li Chen's own strength, my attainment in formations has reached the Transformation Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Casually setting up a formation to trap a mere Golden Core cultivator is a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>The formation Li Fan had set up at this moment was not too earth-shattering. It was a slight modification of the Purple Heaven Sect's formations he had seen in the past, based on the memories of this body.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo also noticed his junior brother's actions, "You little rascal, I was wondering what you were doing cooped up in your room every day. It turns out you were studying formations on your own?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's tone was a bit surprised. He took out his long halberd and fought with Song Hesong.</p><p></p><p>Although Song Hesong was at the Golden Core stage, without using his Purple Pill, Zhang Qianmo only had the combat power of the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>However, with the combined efforts of the senior and junior brothers, plus the assistance of the formation, it didn't take long before Song Hesong was captured alive.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo was decisive and immediately used the Purple Heaven Soul Search Technique.</p><p></p><p>After a struggle, Song Hesong collapsed on the ground like a pile of mud.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's face revealed a murderous aura, "Junior Brother, the scene you foresaw is exactly the same! This damn bastard!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he was about to strike Song Hesong dead with a palm, but Li Fan stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"After all, he is the outer sect steward. It's better to take him back and let the sect deal with him."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo shook his head, "Junior Brother, you are good in every way, but you are too merciful. Forget it, let's do as you say."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"There are still a few bandits from the Wanxian League in the city. I'll go and capture them now."</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" Li Fan stopped Zhang Qianmo again.</p><p></p><p>"What is it now?" Zhang Qianmo was a bit speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, what do you think of this Wanxian League?" Li Fan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"They are just a bunch of nobodies, not worth worrying about!" Zhang Qianmo said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"Is that really so?" Li Fan stared intently at Zhang Qianmo and asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." Zhang Qianmo looked at Li Fan's serious expression and hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>Then he changed his words, "Alright. This new method is truly strange. Song Hesong, with his mediocre aptitude, was able to cultivate from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core in just a few short years. If we don't deal with this seriously, I'm afraid it will cause quite a disaster."</p><p></p><p>"That's it. I think so too. It seems that the righteous sects have not paid much attention to this Wanxian League yet. Why don't we take this opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan whispered.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's expression changed, "You mean, lure the snake out of its hole?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "That's right. Take this opportunity to gather all the Wanxian League cultivators near our Purple Heaven Sect's territory and capture them all in one fell swoop!"</p>

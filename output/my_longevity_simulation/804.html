        <h1>Chapter 804</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was now the 6th year of the anchor era.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not go to the Wanxian Alliance. Instead, he first quietly arrived at the entrance to the Separated Realm.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the spatial passage, Li Fan flew straight to the vicinity of the volcano in the center of the Separated Realm. In the scorching hot air, there was a thick smell of sulfur.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, one could vaguely see the raging traces of lava that had not yet fully solidified. It seemed that this volcano had just experienced a violent eruption.</p><p></p><p>Suspended in mid-air, Li Fan carefully observed the volcano. The strange feeling in his heart grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, there are a few peculiarities."</p><p></p><p>After a while, a trace of strange color appeared in Li Fan's eyes. Perhaps it was because he had already ascended to the Yuanyuan realm and had a grotto-heaven within his body. Or perhaps it was because he had once merged with the Dao of a small world using Xu Bai's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's perception of "grotto-heavens and small worlds" had become much more acute. With this observation, he suddenly knew where the strangeness in his heart came from every time he saw this volcano in the Separated Realm before.</p><p></p><p>"This volcano does not belong to the Separated Realm at all. It comes from another small world!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder there has always been a sense of disharmony and incongruity!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, the surrounding terrain could already explain the problem. On the boundless plain, a violent volcano rose from the ground. It was obviously a very abnormal thing.</p><p></p><p>It's just that mortals attributed it to the great power of the creation of heaven and earth. But cultivators like Li Fan could indeed discover the reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly became interested. "What's going on? Why would a volcano from another small world abruptly appear in the Separated Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually set up a protective formation around himself and then flew into the crater of the volcano. The scorching hot, churning magma could not harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan went deep into the volcano, trying to find the source of the anomaly from within. It wasn't until he reached the very bottom, where the volcano intersected with the earth's veins, that he finally made some progress.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Even with his mid Golden Core stage level of protection, he still felt it was a bit hot to the touch. </p><p></p><p>"It's not spiritual energy. But it is also a kind of transcendent power."</p><p></p><p>"The Separated Realm is a purely mortal world and does not have the conditions to give birth to this kind of earth fire."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put the earth fire back and carefully observed this space again. Compared to the crater, the magma flow here was relatively gentle and calm. Only occasional bubbles emerged.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the magma sea, there was a very inconspicuous dividing line. Hidden in the orange-red magma, it was completely inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>If one wasn't deliberately looking for it, it would be very easy to overlook its existence. From this dividing line, a power of the same origin as the earth fire faintly emanated.</p><p></p><p>"Another spatial passage?" Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he set up a protective formation around his body and leaped into it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, a fireball smashed towards Li Fan. However, the power was not very great, and it was automatically deflected by the protective formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally thought it was an attack by someone and was on guard. But when he took a closer look, he relaxed. He was instantly attracted by the scenery of this world.</p><p></p><p>This was a world that was completely devoid of life, a pure world that belonged to "fire". A sea of purgatory made up of scorching magma churned endlessly.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, huge explosive sounds rang out. Accompanied by magma erupting into the sky and then bursting in the air. Countless crimson streaks shot across the sky.</p><p>The excerpt describes a fantastical world filled with fire and lava. The protagonist, Li Fan, explores this world and discovers that despite the impressive flames and magma, the power level is at most equivalent to the late Golden Core stage. If he had come at the Nascent Soul stage, even if all the flames in this world burned him together, they wouldn't be able to cause the slightest damage.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan loses interest, deeming the world not very valuable. As he prepares to return through the spatial passage, he notices that near the passage, the lava sea's terrain looks different, as if impacted by a violent collision. He realizes this fire world has collided with and embedded into the mortal world of Li Jie.</p><p></p><p>The fire world's power level clearly exceeds Li Jie's, putting it at risk of being devoured and assimilated. Li Fan recalls the extraordinary talents displayed by Su Xiaomei, Su Heng, Ye Feipeng and others from Li Jie. He had trapped them on Body Transformation Island and Medicinal King Valley for many years. When they finally cultivated, the spiritual energy in Li Jie was gone. Li Fan had expelled them from Medicinal King Valley to see if they could display their talents again, but heard nothing of them before that world ended.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realizes their talent didn't come from themselves, and recalls Su Xiaomei's birth - conceived by Heavenly mandate, without a father. Enlightened, he returns to Li Jie and finds Su Xiaomei's mother, Su Yuqing, in the capital's Scholar Residence. Still a young teenage girl, she's innocently playing with butterflies in the garden. Upon seeing her, a familiar feeling rises in Li Fan's heart.</p>

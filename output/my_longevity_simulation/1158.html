            <p>Chapter 1156: Truly Establishing the Foundation</p><p></p><p>After Li Ping heard Yin Shangren's insights on establishing the foundation, Li Fan's true self also instantly became aware of it at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Bury all of one's past, and build an infinite path for the future?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered in silence.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of his unique treasure, the "Huan Zhen".</p><p></p><p>Judging from his previous action of "establishing the true foundation in a hundred lifetimes", successfully using a part of Huan Zhen to establish a new method foundation, Huan Zhen should have already merged with him as one.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, if I want to complete [Establishing Foundation with Myself], then I must include the complete Huan Zhen..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought emerged, even Li Fan himself felt it was somewhat absurd.</p><p></p><p>When Huan Zhen is activated, everything in the world instantly turns from real to illusory, returning to the recorded anchor point.</p><p></p><p>Even true immortals are no exception.</p><p></p><p>"After Yin Shangren established his foundation with himself, he could apply the world remnant soul law that established him at will. By the same logic, if I successfully establish my foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"There will no longer be a need to rely on Huan Zhen. The limitations of anchor points, charging, etc. can all be ignored. In an instant, the world's creation and destruction, returning to any desired point in time at any moment..."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of ability."</p><p></p><p>"There probably isn't a stronger foundation establishment stage than this, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"This forms a paradox."</p><p></p><p>"If I already have this kind of ability, what new method am I still seeking? Punching the Legendary Method, stepping on the Faceless, it's just a matter of a casual gesture."</p><p></p><p>"If there is no special method that can help me understand and analyze the essence of Huan Zhen in advance, this is a dead end for me."</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes, having too strong a foundation is not necessarily a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inadvertently glanced towards the location of the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when discussing with Yin Shangren, the other party had proposed a feasible method for stealing Mr. Bai's skull.</p><p></p><p>Luring the tiger away from the mountain, tricking Emperor San Mo out of the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Then, using a forged skull to replace the original object.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai used his own life as the price to reverse heaven and earth, and all the spiritual nature on his body dissipated along with it, becoming no different from the bones of an ordinary mortal."</p><p></p><p>"Uh... except for being a bit harder in texture."</p><p></p><p>"So as long as an identical skull is replicated and exchanged without destroying the prohibition, it may be possible to retrieve Mr. Bai's skull without anyone noticing."</p><p></p><p>"Although theoretically so, but in actual operation..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren shook his head and never mentioned this matter again.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had never forgotten.</p><p></p><p>He was also very certain that there was nothing unusual about Mr. Bai's remains.</p><p></p><p>Even the Tianxuan Mirror, after appraising Mr. Bai's rib before, only gave the lowest price of 1 contribution point.</p><p></p><p>"But the skull is an exception."</p><p></p><p>"With Mr. Bai's eternal remembrance existing, it cannot possibly be ordinary."</p><p></p><p>"During the use of the eternal remembrance, Huan Zhen cannot be used. The eternal remembrance also cannot be brought back to be used in the next life. So..."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer flashed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The best method is still to create a relatively safe environment that others cannot attend to, just like stealing the Xuanhuang Jiangsheng in the previous life."</p><p></p><p>"As for the method of luring the tiger away from the mountain, what exactly does Emperor San Mo care about? Perhaps the answer can be found in the Fallen Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"And the situation where the Immortal Alliance headquarters is being robbed and no one has time to take care of it..."</p><p></p><p>"The Legendary Method conspiracy is exposed, forced to appear in the world, attracting all the mysterious...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Huang Jie's gaze." </p><p></p><p>A general outline of the conspiracy instantly took shape within the original plan.</p><p></p><p>"With the overwhelming and unfathomable power of the Dharma transmission, it would be unrealistic to force him to appear and explain using mere strength alone. The only way is to threaten the Xuanhuang Realm that he cares about..."</p><p></p><p>"But this time, I won't have to be the bad guy."</p><p></p><p>On the chessboard, all the pieces were in place, waiting for Li Fan to make his move.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was hiding in a dark corner, making all sorts of unspeakable plans.</p><p></p><p>The wisp of his divine sense that he had split off and attached to Wu Ninglu earlier discovered something quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu was actually pregnant!</p><p></p><p>In the intervals of her focused cultivation, Li Fan's divine sense thoroughly examined the fetus in her belly, confirming that it was indeed the offspring of Sun Ang, the identity Li Fan had taken over.</p><p></p><p>"However, it has been sealed by a secret technique, halting its growth."</p><p></p><p>"This woman is quite interesting too."</p><p></p><p>After observing for some time, Li Fan discovered that Wu Ninglu was not as ordinary and brainless as Sun Ang had appeared.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have another purpose in marrying into the Sun family. </p><p></p><p>Previously, the news of Sun Ang's breakthrough to the Harmonious Dao Realm was accidentally leaked, forcing Sun Ang to participate in the task of guarding the Yan Fa Jue for five hundred years. This was to get Sun Ang out of the way.</p><p></p><p>And all the various benefits that Sun Ang had sacrificed himself for ended up benefiting this woman.</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation progress in one month was higher than the past three years combined.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense even vaguely sensed that before long, she would be able to break through to the perfected Spirit Transformation stage.</p><p></p><p>And on this day, Wu Ninglu, who had been secluded in closed-door cultivation at home all along, finally revealed her true colors.</p><p></p><p>As if suddenly becoming a different person, Wu Ninglu walked to the mirror in the room, her slender fingers constantly caressing her own face.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were dazed, yet flashing with a hint of viciousness from time to time.</p><p></p><p>"Sister is living quite well. Her cultivation speed is even faster than mine..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu's expression changed again, and her smile disappeared: "Wu Ninglu, you're crazy! Possessing me at this time, aren't you afraid of being discovered by the Sun family!"</p><p></p><p>She tried to keep her voice down, but her trembling body revealed her current anger.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu regained control of the body, still with a beaming smile: "Sister, I'm not as bored as you think. If it weren't for the elder's instructions, how would I dare to contact you so easily?"</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully. We received the latest news that within three months, that treasure will return to the Sun family. By then, you need to find out the hiding place of the treasure."</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu's voice grew smaller and smaller, eventually becoming barely audible.</p><p></p><p>The normal Wu Ninglu had a gloomy expression, and finally stomped her foot hard, seeming to have made up her mind.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, Li Fan's divine sense, which had witnessed this scene, instantly became interested.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun family treasure? I haven't heard of the Sun family having anything remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The divine sense transformed into gossamer threads and lurked into Wu Ninglu's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Although she had undergone training and had strong defenses against divine sense intrusions, how could she escape Li Fan's deliberate attack?</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan had already found the answer he wanted.</p><p></p><p>This made him, who was originally just bored and slightly interested, become somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be an existence suspected to be born from an immortal artifact, just like the Kunqian Bone Hand?"</p><p></p><p>"Quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>This treasure of the Sun family also possessed the supreme power unique to the legendary immortal artifacts.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 763</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Sect Leader, I've got this handled," Fang Zaiji said confidently, patting his chest. "My eye for talent is far better than Old Liu's. I guarantee not a single one of these kids isn't an extraordinarily gifted cultivator, one in a million."  </p><p></p><p>"I traveled through over a dozen states, and this is all I could find. You can see how difficult this journey was," Fang lamented.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you didn't even greet their parents and just directly abducted these children?" Liu San's expression turned unpleasant seeing the crying children.</p><p></p><p>Fang rolled his eyes at Liu San. "Don't be ridiculous. The path to immortality is something most mortals can only dream of. I'm benevolently guiding them. Did I need their parents' permission?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, our Yao Wang Sect is still in seclusion. We have to operate discreetly."  Liu San was rendered speechless.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai cleared his throat. "If Mister Fang selected them, it must mean they have a destiny tied to our Yao Wang Sect. I trust his judgement."  </p><p></p><p>"Unlike the ancient times with countless sects recruiting disciples openly, the Immortal Alliance now lets nature take its course. Many talents get buried. This could be an opportunity for our sect."</p><p></p><p>Liu San's eyes lit up. "The Sect Leader makes sense."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll have to trouble you again, Old Liu, to tutor these new disciples first. Before they cultivate their qi..." Xu Bai paused, struck by a thought.</p><p></p><p>After pondering, he changed his mind. "Actually, when first teaching them the cultivation method, don't mention 'borrowing the wonder of the heavenly realm to build their foundation.'"</p><p></p><p>"Only tell them 'to refine their mortal body to build their foundation'!"</p><p></p><p>Liu San and Fang Zaiji were briefly stunned before realizing Xu Bai's intention.  </p><p></p><p>"Brilliant! If any succeed in building their foundation this way, they would have used their own body!" Fang exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>A flicker of hesitation crossed Liu San's face. "Sect Leader, isn't this a bit..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled slightly. "If they truly cannot build their foundation, we can reveal the truth then when they've given up."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Bai's resolve, Liu San could only nod in agreement.  </p><p></p><p>After explaining the "refining one's body" method again, Xu Bai suddenly asked, "By the way, where is Elder Jiang?"</p><p></p><p>"I sensed her return, but..."  </p><p></p><p>Fang laughed mischievously. "She got into a fight and was badly beaten. By a woman no less, who was even more beautiful and mocked her. Jiang Yushan was so furious she's secluded herself in bitter cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, a reprieve from her grating voice." Fang looked immensely relieved.</p><p></p><p>However, Liu San's expression changed. "What? Why didn't you tell me something so important earlier? Was Yushan injured?"</p><p></p><p>As Liu San hurriedly tried to hand off Xu Bai's tasks to attend to this, Fang...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Let's set that aside for now, and hurriedly flee and go visit Jiang Yushan.</p><p>Fang Zaiji pursed his lips: "I don't understand, what does Liu San see in that woman?"</p><p>"With your abilities, it shouldn't be a problem, right?" Xu Bai looked at him expectantly.</p><p>Fang Zaiji, who was arranged to be the laborer, not only did not get angry, but instead exclaimed joyfully: "No problem, of course no problem! The Doomsday Stone Plate, that's something that can almost rival immortal artifacts. I've long thought that Yushan's way of doing things is a bit too rough."</p><p>"Master, don't worry, I will treat it very gently," Fang Zaiji said eagerly, looking at Xu Bai.</p><p>Xu Bai smiled and tossed the Doomsday Circular Plate to him.</p><p>Without waiting for instructions, the delighted Fang Zaiji hurriedly left on his own.</p><p>It was only then that Xu Bai turned his gaze to the group of children in the square.</p><p>If this were the main body, he would certainly have found their clamor to be very noisy.</p><p>But the clone Xu Bai, looking at these noisy children, did not feel much impatience in his heart.</p><p>Instead, a sense of pity and affection arose in his heart.</p><p>Xu Bai silently contemplated the source of the emotions of this body.</p><p>A faint smile appeared on his face as he slowly flew over to the group of children.</p><p>With an appearance like a celestial being and an extremely gentle aura, he instantly attracted the attention of all the children present. They immediately fell silent and stared at Xu Bai with wide eyes.</p><p>Xu Bai interacted with the children very amiably. In just a moment, he had learned all their names and individual cultivation talents.</p><p>"This Fang Zaiji indeed has some abilities, to be able to escape the pursuit of the major sects even in ancient times."</p><p>"The talents of these little children are almost on par with Zhang Haobo's."</p><p>"And Gu Xinghan..." Xu Bai saw a familiar name among these children.</p><p>It was the same as the cultivator who had issued the manifesto in the previous life, revealing the true nature of the "Heavenly Mysterious Sealing Formation" to the world.</p><p>That eloquent and passionate article immediately surfaced in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p>Looking at the five-year-old child in front of him, the two figures gradually overlapped.</p><p>Gu Xinghan, as one of the leaders of the Covering Heaven Sect in the previous life, had led countless cultivators to fight against the Mysterious Net, but had never been captured by the Heaven Alliance. His abilities were undoubtedly remarkable.</p><p>"It seems this little guy might bring me some surprises as well," Xu Bai thought, gently patting Gu Xinghan's shoulder with a deeper smile.</p><p>After a while, Liu San returned, looking somewhat dejected, obviously having failed to even see Jiang Yushan.</p><p>He had to pull himself together and start dealing with the group of children seriously.</p><p>With Xu Bai's previous soothing, the children were much more obedient now.</p><p>When Xu Bai left, the children waved goodbye to him, leaving Liu San amazed.</p><p>Instead of returning to Tianliang State, Xu Bai went straight to the secret chamber in the Longevity Valley.</p><p>Regarding the sudden idea that had surfaced in his mind, he was a bit uncertain.</p><p>He needed to calm down and think it through carefully.</p><p>"Should I, with this body, perform the ritual to enter the Fallen Immortal Realm?"</p><p>This was the idea that had suddenly emerged in his mind when he was facing the children.</p><p>Xu Bai's kind treatment of the children should indeed make him the "good person" that Xu Ke had described.</p>

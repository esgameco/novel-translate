            <p>At the same time, inside the main hall of the Dadao Sect, Li Qing's face drastically changed as he watched the [Fruit of Longevity] in front of him suddenly transform from solid to ethereal, almost disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, he reached out to grab it, wanting to catch it and keep it from vanishing.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten years, he had been using the terrifying power of the [Scripture of Perversion] to constantly corrupt the female cultivators of the Dadao Sect for his own use. </p><p></p><p>He had also secretly selected and cultivated female disciples with exceptional aptitude.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, female cultivators occupied eight out of ten seats among the Dadao Sect elders.</p><p></p><p>Within the sect, female disciples overwhelmed male disciples in both quantity and quality.</p><p></p><p>Although the sect's longevity masters eventually noticed something amiss, the situation had already taken shape. If they truly wanted to eradicate Li Qing's faction, the Dadao Sect might suffer more than just some damage.</p><p></p><p>There was a high possibility of the sect perishing from internal strife.</p><p></p><p>Considering the bigger picture, after several negotiations between the two sides, a compromise was finally reached.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's past misdeeds would be forgiven and forgotten, and there would be no excessive interference in the future. However, he had to guarantee maintaining a certain proportion of male cultivators in the Dadao Sect overall, as well as the purity of newly admitted female disciples.</p><p></p><p>In exchange, a portion of the Fruit of Longevity would be allocated to Li Qing's faction.</p><p></p><p>The Fruit of Longevity grows on the Ruomu tree.</p><p></p><p>Jointly managed by the Ten Sects, one fruit can attest to one longevity.</p><p></p><p>Today was the final moment for Li Qing to finally harvest and obtain his share of the Fruit of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>But at this critical juncture, it actually vanished right before Li Qing's eyes!</p><p></p><p>How could Li Qing accept this after painstakingly scheming for an entire decade!</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing could no longer maintain his composure and let out an angry roar.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you all helping me!"</p><p></p><p>No matter how impotently he raged, he was still unable to stop the Fruit of Longevity from dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, Li Qing turned his head and spoke to his companions in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>And it was just this glance that made Li Qing suddenly feel a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Because in this main hall, including his master Huo Jingtong, more than ten Harmonious Dao female cultivators were all looking at him in unison.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>It was completely different from the affectionate gazes of the past. So unfamiliar and eerie.</p><p></p><p>As if in an instant, all their souls had been replaced.</p><p></p><p>As the tremors of the Dadao Sect grew more intense, Li Qing sensed that the gazes of all the cultivators in the entire sect were now converging on him.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Qing's audacity, he couldn't help but swallow his saliva and take a step back at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Silently, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Zhao Ruoxi, who had been in seclusion for ten years and hadn't been seen for a long time!</p><p></p><p>Looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar beauty before him, Li Qing's heart was filled with doubt and suspicion.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he was already at the peak of the Harmonious Dao realm, just a step away from the Longevity realm.</p><p></p><p>But in front of this former Senior Sister Zhao, his spiritual intuition was frantically warning him.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling a bit dizzy, Li Qing felt as if he had forgotten something very important.</p><p></p><p>The experiences of the past ten years flashed through his mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Then, like a receding tide, they became somewhat blurry and unclear.</p><p></p><p>Like a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Very good."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao stared at Li Qing, and the first thing she said was praise.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I thought I would just give you a little punishment as the price for your previous disrespectful remarks."</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't expect that under these circumstances, in just ten short years, you would..."</p><p></p><p>"You were actually able to do it to this extent."</p><p></p><p>"In all these years, you are the first one to enter me."</p><p></p><p>"It's a very novel experience."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao said calmly, her face showing no signs of joy or anger.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Qing was shocked to realize that the expressions on the faces of the other female cultivators in the great hall were exactly the same as Senior Sister Zhao's!</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing suddenly felt a sharp pain in his head and couldn't help but press it with his hand.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery of the Dadao Sect shook more and more violently.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it could no longer be maintained and crumbled bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shattering light and shadows, Li Qing discovered that the faces of everyone else had now all turned into the appearance of Senior Sister Zhao!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>When Li Qing regained consciousness again, the memories that had been suppressed for a long time finally surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Zhao's illusion realm is indeed powerful..."</p><p></p><p>"Even though I was prepared early on, I still sank into it and couldn't extricate myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing frowned slightly and swept his divine sense over his lower body.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it was just a dream."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the various soul-stirring scenes from the ten years in the illusion, and then realizing that these female protagonists were actually all incarnations of the One Heart Heavenly Venerate, Li Qing couldn't help but be slightly dazed.</p><p></p><p>However, his mind was extraordinary after all, and he quickly sobered up.</p><p></p><p>He concentrated his attention on that world-shocking and outrageous [Scripture of Reverse Ethics].</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard he tried to recall, the memories related to the cultivation method remained like a mirage, unattainable.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's heart was instantly filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>"Such a divine cultivation method, yet I can't bring it out. I wonder if this cultivation method truly exists in reality? Or was it fabricated by the One Heart Heavenly Venerate in the illusion realm?"</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, and after a while, he finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, and the scenery was very familiar.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same as the scenery of the Dadao Sect in the illusion realm.</p><p></p><p>And he was currently standing at the entrance of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the familiar stone path leading up the mountain ahead, Li Qing hesitated and was reluctant to set foot.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you quite capable just now? Why are you so timid now?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mocking voice came from the stone path above.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing looked in the direction of the voice and saw that the speaker was a young male cultivator holding a broom and wearing the attire of an outer disciple of the Dadao Sect.</p><p></p><p>He leaned on the broom and looked down at Li Qing from above.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing knew that the person in front of him was also one of the many bodies of the One Heart Heavenly Venerate, so he didn't neglect him.</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands and respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>Then, he slowly walked up the stone steps.</p><p></p><p>"You know the way, just go up by yourself. I still need to clean up, so I won't accompany you." The young outer disciple walked down the stone steps, brushing past Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Without even raising his head, he casually instructed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he diligently swept the stone steps that Li Qing had walked on.</p><p></p><p>"Although they are all the same person, it seems that each body still maintains its original or specific identity..."</p><p></p><p>"What do you call this, role-playing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing narrowed his eyes slightly and continued walking towards the depths of the Dadao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the eerie and deathly silent scene in the final moments of the illusion realm, where he saw everyone with Senior Sister Zhao's face.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Dadao Sect, it was teeming with life.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Li Qing encountered many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They only glanced at Li Qing once before continuing with what they were doing before.</p><p></p><p>They chatted, argued, and competed with each other.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing even saw several pairs of Dao companions intimately whispering to each other.</p><p></p><p>It was lively and bustling, as if the Dadao Sect of the past had never been exterminated.</p><p></p><p>But the more it was like this, the higher Li Qing's vigilance towards this "One Heart Heavenly Venerate" became.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1176</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Young Lord, is this First Strategist from the [Era]?" </p><p></p><p>On the way to the Tianpivot State of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, the Holy Fetus Li Fan asked this question that he had long suspected.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun paused for a moment, seemingly unsurprised that Li Fan knew about the [Era]-related secrets of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He answered in a low voice, "Yes and no."</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, the Immortal Alliance did indeed use the [Era] to cultivate a group of fearless warriors. But those people, after all, were not born and raised in the Profound Yellow Realm, and lacked a bit of spiritual nature."</p><p></p><p>"Although they could all display shocking talents during the Era simulation process, their actual performance was much worse when they really came to the Profound Yellow Realm. They are quite suitable to be used as fearless cannon fodder. But it's difficult for them to take on major responsibilities." Shang Shaojun shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"But later, the Immortal Alliance found a way to improve. Brother Li, do you know that each Dharma Transmitter has their own exclusive small world?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan responded, "I've heard of it."</p><p></p><p>"Each Dharma Transmitter separates a part of their small world under their command to jointly form a [Primordial Great Realm]. It is said to be a truly cruel and chaotic world. Every hundred years, there will be a thorough cleansing of the creatures in it. Only those who have received collective praise from the Transmitters within a hundred years can survive."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, you should know that the creatures of the [Primordial Great Realm] are either carefully selected conscious souls from the [Era], or the most outstanding geniuses from the worlds of each Dharma Transmitter. To be able to stand out in such an environment... their abilities can be imagined."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's tone was solemn, "This is the origin of the First Strategist."</p><p></p><p>"From the Era to the [Primordial Great Realm], the First Strategist emerged step by step, and was finally valued by the Dharma Transmitters. They used the supreme treasure left by the Celestial Venerable to reshape his body. He was even specially allowed to not erase his previous experience and memories due to being deeply trusted. Even though he currently does not hold any specific position in the Immortal Alliance, no one dares to underestimate him."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, this First Strategist is truly somewhat legendary," the Holy Fetus Li Fan said with some emotion after hearing Shang Shaojun's introduction.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a little puzzled, "For such a character, we just go to his door like this... Young Lord, aren't you afraid that he will directly tie us up and send us to the Dharma Transmitters?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun laughed loudly, "Brother Li thinks too much. Not to mention that I had adventures with the First Strategist back then and have a pretty good relationship with him. The reason why the First Strategist can be deeply trusted by the Dharma Transmitters is precisely because since he was created, his soul has been forever branded with loyalty to the Immortal Alliance. The more experience he has and the stronger he becomes, the deeper this imprint becomes."</p><p></p><p>"This is what he said himself. But he doesn't care, and instead regards it as a great honor. Isn't everything we do also for the Myriad Immortal Alliance? If he knows that the Myriad Immortal Alliance is secretly hiding many conspiracies, he will certainly not choose to ignore it. With his temperament, he will even personally make a trip to verify what we said." Shang Shaojun looked confident.</p><p></p><p>However, things did not go as smoothly as imagined.</p><p></p><p>"What? The First Strategist is not here?"</p><p></p><p>"We clearly made an appointment before!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Strategist's Mansion, Shang Shaojun and Li Fan were stopped.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's face looked ugly, and the pressure of a Harmonized Dao cultivator surged in waves.</p><p></p><p>The two in front of the door...</p><p></p><p>The guard, although slightly pale, managed to maintain his composure and explained, "My lord, I apologize. The truth is that the leader received an urgent secret order from the Immortal Alliance and had to leave in a hurry. The matter was so pressing that he didn't even have time to inform anyone..."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun tried to contact the First Regulation again using the communication talisman, but as expected, no one answered.</p><p></p><p>He exchanged a glance with Li Fan, knowing that there was no point in insisting, and could only snort coldly before giving up.</p><p></p><p>"I don't think the First Regulation is deliberately avoiding us. There must be something important," Li Fan whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm. I'm clear about the First Regulation's personality; he wouldn't make excuses. I just don't know what exactly happened in the Immortal Alliance. If the First Regulation was urgently summoned, it must be a big deal," Shao Jun muttered.</p><p></p><p>With their first target unavailable, the two decided to change course and find Ji Hongdao of Tianyu Province.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't expect that Ji Hongdao had also been transferred away by an appointment order.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other in dismay and directly suspended their search for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. Let me find someone to inquire about it," Shao Jun said, his brows tightly knitted.</p><p></p><p>He quietly stole a Tianxuan Mirror from the Sun family and activated its immeasurable power to spy on the information within.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Tianxuan Mirror had already known about the changes in the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, the result somewhat surprised Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable sent a message saying that the Xuanhuang Realm may experience some turbulence recently, and the Immortal Alliance needs to take countermeasures in advance."</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"Since the establishment of the Immortal Alliance, the Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable has only actively transmitted messages a few times. The Dharma Transmitters attach great importance to it..."</p><p></p><p>After disconnecting from the Tianxuan Mirror's spying and offering some reassurance to him, Li Fan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't sure if the event of the "Celestial Venerable's Message" had occurred in the previous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>However, in the many worlds Li Fan had experienced, the Xuanhuang Realm had never encountered even the slightest turbulence.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable specifically sent a message to give instructions, indicating that the upcoming turbulence can't be too small in scale. If caught off guard and unprepared, it might cause widespread panic."</p><p></p><p>"But the Dharma Transmission only sent a message, and the Venerable himself didn't rush back, which means the turbulence won't truly cause devastating damage to the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The turbulence predicted by the Dharma Transmission is expected to arrive in about a month. By then, we'll know if it's a unique event in this world."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Shao Jun's side, he had also found out the result.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it wasn't as detailed as what was stolen from the Tianxuan Mirror, but it was more or less the same.</p><p></p><p>"The entire Immortal Alliance, from top to bottom, has been mobilized. I suppose the relevant orders will soon be transmitted to the Eternal Immortal Fortress as well..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan pondered for a moment and said, "What we want to accomplish is not something that can be done in a short time. Since the entire Xuanhuang Realm is about to face a potential crisis, we should first prepare to deal with this matter."</p><p></p><p>"The Qingxuan Army cannot be leaderless, and the Chizha Abyss may have changes again. Why don't we return to the Eternal Immortal Fortress first and wait and see."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's suggestion was accepted by Shao Jun.</p><p></p><p>The two then temporarily ended their journey in a hurry and returned to Duanzhang Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the quiet and deep Chizha Abyss not far away, the figure that had appeared at the bottom of the Chizha Abyss earlier flashed before the Holy Fetus Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the uniqueness of this world has something to do with my little actions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, somewhat puzzled.</p>

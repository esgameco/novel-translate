            <p>When Xiao Heng informed Su Xiaomei of this discovery, she couldn't help but smile with joy. New 69 Book Barâ†’69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"Now that we have this clue, we should be able to find it soon."</p><p></p><p>The three exchanged a glance, then stuck to the edge of the abyss, quietly flying towards the depths of the Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>As they descended to about two hundred zhang above the ground, the scenery inside the abyss began to change drastically from the surface.</p><p></p><p>Due to the perennial presence of clouds and mist above, the further down they went, the darker the surrounding environment became.</p><p></p><p>The cliff walls were no longer bare rocks but now rooted with various strange plants.</p><p></p><p>There were luminescent willow vines, predatory pines disguised as rocks.</p><p></p><p>There were even withered black trees lurking like pythons, waiting to strike when prey approached.</p><p></p><p>And accompanying these plants were the peculiar beasts mentioned in the jade slip, which one needed to guard against.</p><p></p><p>These beasts were mostly pitch black, hard to perceive in the dim abyss.</p><p></p><p>Their appearances were grotesque, vastly different from the creatures on the surface.</p><p></p><p>They didn't seem naturally evolved but like fragments forcefully amalgamated from various animals.</p><p></p><p>There were long worms splitting down the middle, opening their mouths to prey.</p><p></p><p>There were strange apes with their heads tucked inside their bellies.</p><p></p><p>There were strange birds with wings made of countless wriggling centipedes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Each unique form of these creatures gave a chilling feeling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in this abyss, there seemed to be a mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>It suppressed the perception range of the cultivators' divine sense.</p><p></p><p>This power became more pronounced as they delved deeper.</p><p></p><p>During the cultivators' descent, these bizarre creatures would suddenly emerge from the cliff walls or the void in the center of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>They would swarm and launch attacks on the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As if harboring a deep hatred for foreign cultivators, these creatures would only cease their attacks upon complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, although there were numerous beings in the abyss below, their power was equivalent to that of late Foundation Establishment stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>For Su Xiaomei and her companions, all at least at the Golden Core stage, they did not pose much of a threat.</p><p></p><p>Having a safe journey, spending nearly half a day, they finally approached a massive boundary monument wedged in the cliff wall.</p><p></p><p>Emblazoned with bright red glowing characters on top were the words "Thirty Thousand".</p><p></p><p>It was visible from afar.</p><p></p><p>And above this boundary monument, the continuous cliff walls were almost hollowed inward.</p><p></p><p>Creating a glittering floating city above the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first resting point for exploring the Cangwu Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"Lincang City."</p><p></p><p>"Going further down, the abyss becomes increasingly dangerous. So, it's necessary to have a place here for rest and supplies."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng watched the unceasing cultivators passing by, silently raising his vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Most of the cultivators exploring the Cangwu Abyss were not easy opponents.</p><p></p><p>Besides gathering the valuable special products of the Cangwu Abyss, they mostly came for the meteorite that fell from the sky that year.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the true identity of the meteorite had been a topic of varied speculations.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the ancient divine cauldron that broke through the realms or some other widely circulated speculation.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, every cultivator who witnessed it felt a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>This meteorite must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, wealth leads to one's death.</p><p></p><p>So it was not difficult to understand why external cultivators tirelessly sought after it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go." Xiao Heng and his group did not enter Lincang City.</p><p></p><p>They flew over the boundary monument and descended to the second layer beneath the earth's thirty thousand zhang.</p><p></p><p>Upon crossing the boundary monument, they seemed to pass through an invisible shield.</p><p></p><p>A peculiar sensation surged in Xiao Heng's mind.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has decreased by a bit, just as rumored."</p><p></p><p>Feeling somewhat heavy-hearted, Xiao Heng inquired with Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, indeed, there's a slight decrease. But for now, the impact isn't significant," Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo replied after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my strength has weakened after all," Xiao Heng thought helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He could only hope that the location of the divine cauldron was within the depth range he could reach.</p><p></p><p>"The Power of Townsealing" was the general term used by cultivators for the inexplicable force enveloping the Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The specific manifestation was that as one delved deeper into the abyss, a cultivator's strength would be correspondingly reduced.</p><p></p><p>In the first layer within thirty thousand zhang, it was not yet noticeable.</p><p></p><p>It merely interfered with the coverage range of their divine sense.</p><p></p><p>However, upon entering the second layer, the effect immediately became apparent.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Qi Refinement Intermediate stage or below, once inside, would become no different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual power couldn't be mobilized, losing their ability to fly.</p><p></p><p>Their fate would only end in one way: falling helplessly towards the bottomless abyss, becoming food for the strange beings along the way.</p><p></p><p>This meant that at the very least, cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage were required to survive in the Cangwu Abyss' second layer.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, as the depth increased, the inhabitants of the abyss also grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the cultivators' powers were continuously suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This led to it becoming harder to explore further down.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and his companions proceeded deeper into the second layer, the "Forest of Lingering Voices," with increasing caution.</p><p></p><p>Trees deeply rooted in the abyss wall grew in defiance of logic, extending their branches willfully towards the void of the Cangwu Abyss at the center.</p><p></p><p>They formed an endless primitive forest occupying a space of fifty thousand zhang vertically.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the increasingly diverse and powerful dangerous creatures, the murmuring whispers emanating from the forest were even deadlier.</p><p></p><p>These whispers caused cultivators to experience various illusions, losing their mental faculties.</p><p></p><p>Those with weak wills would seem as if they had lost their souls, flying towards the center of the Forest of Lingering Voices, never to return.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and his companions were all considered outstanding individuals with strong wills.</p><p></p><p>Combined with their formidable strength, it took them almost a day to traverse the second layer.</p><p></p><p>They descended to a depth of eighty thousand zhang.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the dense forest suddenly became sparse.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be another light source below, and their vision cleared abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Instead of the towering stone monument as before, a huge eyeball growing on the cliff wall now marked the boundary layer.</p><p></p><p>The central pupil of the eyeball was replaced by the two blood-red characters "Eighty Thousand."</p><p></p><p>The eyeball seemed to be alive, constantly rotating and scanning.</p><p></p><p>Feeling someone approaching from above, it instantly fixed its gaze on Xiao Heng and his group.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous pressure bore down on Xiao Heng, making his body tense in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the giant eye glanced at them briefly and then averted its gaze, not looking further.</p><p></p><p>"Whew..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

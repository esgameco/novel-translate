        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just out of curiosity, without getting too entangled.</p><p></p><p>They gathered and walked towards the central area where the Spirit Locking Formation was established.</p><p></p><p>The final division of labor had long been agreed upon.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu was responsible for inspecting the previously constructed Formation units, while Jiang Qigui was in charge of installing and debugging the Formation's hub.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan was in the middle, moving as needed.</p><p></p><p>Wherever help was needed, he went.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qigui's proficiency in Formations was indeed reliable.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu had always been diligent and rarely made mistakes.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan acting as a mediator.</p><p></p><p>With all three working together, they were two days ahead of the original plan in completing the Spirit Locking Formation that shrouded the Chizhu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Out of caution, they chose a low period after the eruption of the Magic Sound Great Tide to perform the final steps.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that everything was in order.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Locking Formation's core hub flew out from Huangfu Song's forehead, transforming into a continually flickering red phantom.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qigui's expression was extremely solemn as he guided the hub into the prepared core Formation without any signs of Li Fan's testing disruptions.</p><p></p><p>The red phantom cooperatively flew into the dense Formation.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of reintegration, the vibrant blue light completely engulfed the surrounding red.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the central singularity point, thousands of rays of light bloomed, connecting with numerous Formation units around the Spirit Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>Shining through the white mist, while extending outward, each Formation structure was illuminated one by one.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in the vast white mist, a miraculous scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>In the white mist, blue light emanated from the central singularity, progressing layer by layer along the veins of the Spirit Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a grand circular blue giant net covering the entire Chizhu Abyss emerged.</p><p></p><p>The devouring white mist and occasional magic sounds were unable to conceal its magnificent stature.</p><p></p><p>Most present were the designers of the Formation themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, witnessing the creation they had labored over for years finally coming to life, they felt a myriad of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, focused on the brightest blue light spot at the center of the Formation, sighing, "Only with Tianxuan can we lock spirits."</p><p></p><p>"The grand scene of the Tianxuan Spirit Locking Formation being popularized is about to unfold. It remains to be seen how the Wanxian Alliance will evolve in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Let's observe for now, and if things go south, we might really have to." </p><p></p><p>"However, I have put in a lot of effort. There are merits and hardships; surely I won't just wither away in this world without seeing it through to the end, right?"</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan pondered to himself, the Spirit Locking Formation finally completed its integration with the Spirit Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>The majestic blue net faded away like receding tides, but Li Fan felt a subtle sensation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As if there were eyes watching over everyone.</p><p></p><p>Led by Huangfu Song, everyone cheered and celebrated the successful completion of the Formation.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Except for Xue Mu, who appeared modest and taciturn, discreetly glanced up.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Huangfu Song's successful acceptance, the construction of the Formations outside the Chizhu Abyss had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the Broken Palm Immortal City, Li Fan inquired about Huangfu Song's next plans.</p><p></p><p>"According to the original plan, I am to meet Director Ji at the newly discovered 'Lost Battlefield' outside the Misty Area to build the Spirit Locking Formation there."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song paused, with a solemn expression, "That area does seem quite peculiar and extremely dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"After careful evaluation, the Alliance has decided to postpone the construction of the Formation in the Lost Battlefield. Instead, we will first seal it off."</p><p></p><p>"Since you've completed one Spirit Locking Formation, there's no mandatory requirement for your work in the future."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, if you wish, you can simply return and rest."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you want to compete, you can opt to support the construction of Formations in other regions."</p><p></p><p>"But only the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance can see the progress and personnel responsible for each Formation in different areas."</p><p></p><p>"For maximum efficiency in competition, it's best to utilize some unconventional means."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song cleared his throat, wearing a 'you know what I mean' expression.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xue Mu and Jiang Qigui pondered, while Li Fan remained indifferent, saying, "My days are numbered, soon to join the Nine Springs below and meet with Daoist Dantai."</p><p></p><p>"Competing for rankings and such no longer matter to me."</p><p></p><p>"However, I am quite curious about the 'Lost Battlefield' you just mentioned, Senior Huangfu."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song, who had been maintaining his composure, had his face twitch at the mention of Daoist Dantai by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing any outburst, upon Li Fan's inquiry, he reluctantly answered, "It's not a secret, so there's no harm in telling you."</p><p></p><p>"As the name suggests, the new Lost Domain is a remnant of an ancient great battle."</p><p></p><p>"Spanning over a thousand and six hundred miles, countless fallen cultivators within it."</p><p></p><p>"Not only is the thick scent of blood still lingering, but the fallen cultivators remain frozen in their final moments."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if this brutal battle just happened recently."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song narrowed his eyes, seemingly recalling the sights within the Lost Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"What's even more bizarre is that we can't distinguish the warring parties' identities."</p><p></p><p>"Dressed in the same faction's attire, some might have annihilated each other while others might have united against a common enemy and perished heroically."</p><p></p><p>"It's more like a chaotic brawl where allegiances blur, rather than a traditional battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Huangfu Song's description, Li Fan couldn't help but recall the 'Chaos Stone Domain' he had encountered before.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if time had frozen there, with corpses still lifelike.</p><p></p><p>While the culprit there was the Celestial Healer, who could it be in this Lost Battlefield?</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, Xue Mu couldn't help but ask, "Senior Huangfu, you mentioned the extreme danger of this Lost Battlefield, but why?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the deceased cultivators there might come back to attack?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song shook his head, denying, "They are already dead and can't die again. Just a touch, and they turn to ashes."</p><p></p><p>"The true danger lies within the domain itself."</p><p></p><p>"When Director Ji led a team into the domain for the first time, they fell into its trap."</p><p></p><p>"Enthralled by the site of an ancient and brutal war, Director Ji was suddenly besieged by fellow cultivators accompanying him."</p><p></p><p>"Besieged?!" Xue Mu couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>"Lost... could it be?" After a moment, it dawned on him, his face filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song nodded slowly, "Indeed, those cultivators were Director Ji's trusted subordinates, absolutely loyal and unswerving, resistant to any tests."</p><p></p><p>"But even so, once they entered that domain, they lost their minds."</p><p></p><p>Regarding Director Ji as mortal enemies, they attacked with no holds barred."</p>

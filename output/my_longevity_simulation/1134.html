        <h1>Chapter 1134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ninety Heavenly Patrol Arrows, only half of them were real objects with actual destructive power.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining half, they were virtual images created by the formation, only for show.</p><p></p><p>However, the tree people of the Spirit Wood Realm had already been frightened by the destructive power displayed by the previous Heavenly Patrol Arrow, and couldn't distinguish between the real and fake ones at all.</p><p></p><p>The central giant tree was closely related to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>When the tree thrives, the realm prospers; when the tree is destroyed, the realm perishes.</p><p></p><p>The huge hole in the trunk of the giant tree made the tree people of the Spirit Wood Realm completely lose any intention to resist.</p><p></p><p>The female chief of the tree people led the entire tribe to kneel down in humiliation before the Great Profound Forbidden Army, expressing their submission.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Sun Erlang, following the instructions of the Divine Emperor of Heavenly Mandate, carved layers of formations on the heart of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know the meaning represented by these formations, but executing orders was the heavenly duty of the Great Profound Forbidden Army.</p><p></p><p>With Sun Erlang's current strength of Golden Core perfection, it was still somewhat difficult for him to activate the formations.</p><p></p><p>And he also had to guard against the counterattack of the tree people.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the deterrence of the Heavenly Patrol Arrows was too powerful, and in the end, the tree people didn't dare to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Once the formations were completed, a burst of gorgeous green light erupted from the heart of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>A figure was born from the light and shadow.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit of the giant tree..." Sun Erlang mused.</p><p></p><p>As he had thought, after the spirit of the giant tree appeared, it didn't stand on the side of the tree people.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it communicated with Sun Erlang via telepathy: "Are you Senior Brother Sun? The teacher asked you to leave half of the forbidden army here to assist in the construction of the formations."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, my name is Lin Ling."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling transmitted a segment of images, and Sun Erlang heard the familiar voice of the Divine Emperor of Heavenly Mandate in the scene, nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>Without losing a single soldier, and only consuming one Heavenly Patrol Arrow, Sun Erlang successfully conquered the Spirit Wood Realm. However, Sun Erlang also knew that this actually had nothing to do with the combat power of the Great Profound Forbidden Army. It was all thanks to the terrifying power of the Heavenly Patrol Arrows that could destroy heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang shook his head slightly, dispelling the sense of frustration in his heart. He led the remaining troops and headed towards the second target minor world.</p><p></p><p>"Dali? Humph..." A hint of killing intent flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After the Great Profound Forbidden Army left, Lin Ling began to supervise the tree people according to the formations taught by Professor Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling didn't have much affection for these tree people.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan, who lectured, taught, and enlightened him at the moment of his birth, was currently the person Lin Ling felt closest to in the world.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Formation of Myriad Spirits of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>"On the day the formation is completed, it will be able to open a passage to the world where the teacher is. And it can also increase the overall spiritual energy density of the Spirit Wood Realm and elevate the world."</p><p></p><p>"First complete the construction of the basic formations, and the remaining key materials will be delivered by the Great Profound Forbidden Army later."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the explanation of the formations taught by Li Fan, and remembering his promise that only by completing the construction of the Great Formation of Myriad Spirits of Heaven and Earth could he go to Li Fan, ...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Great Profound.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the somewhat blurry images coming from the Spirit Wood Realm, Li Fan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although he had decided to return to the truth in the Nether Realm in this life, using the power of the nether to reduce the perception of the Faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan also couldn't predict how much this reduction would be.</p><p></p><p>So the [Myriad Spirits of Heaven and Earth, All Beings Refining Gods] Great Formation was also necessary to be built, just in case.</p><p></p><p>If seeing the scene of billions of living beings perishing at the same time for the first time,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was still a bit unsettled.</p><p></p><p>But after the second time, the second time after that...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan truly had no psychological pressure at all.</p><p></p><p>He collected his thoughts and looked at the person in front of him who was nominally his second disciple in this life.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Sun Erlang's treatment, Li Fan did not teach him the new cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he taught Wang Xuanba the [Zaohua Honglu Gong] that he had researched himself.</p><p></p><p>This version had undergone earth-shattering changes compared to the initial version that simply pried open the body's hidden secrets and crudely strengthened the flesh.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, with the guidance of the Heavenly Doctor and the integration of the "Heavenly Doctor Immortal Classic" and "Patching Heaven Records", Li Fan had a new understanding of how to stimulate the human body's potential.</p><p></p><p>However, to turn theory into practice, it still required some experimentation.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba's special physique was the perfect test subject.</p><p></p><p>"The primordial world, at the moment of impending destruction, instantly erupts with myriad mysterious changes."</p><p></p><p>"Humans should also be like this."</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, the human body is in a state of balance. Only when foreign objects invade or the body faces a fatal crisis will it mobilize its own potential."</p><p></p><p>In front of Li Fan, the seventeen-year-old Wang Xuanba was in a coma with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>His height had already approached three zhang, his entire body bulging with muscles, and his skin was covered with a layer of golden, armor-like keratin.</p><p></p><p>Although human features could still be vaguely discerned, at a glance, he resembled an ancient ferocious beast.</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen types of exotic beasts' flesh and blood have been implanted, of which only seven have been absorbed and integrated by him. The rest have all experienced severe rejection reactions. If I hadn't intervened to save him, I'm afraid he would have already died from blood vessel failure."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan injected a mass of [Celestial Silk Fox] beast flesh and blood into Wang Xuanba's body.</p><p></p><p>Solely strengthening power seemed to cause Wang Xuanba's physical development to become somewhat unbalanced and on the verge of collapse. He needed to be enhanced in terms of agility.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan really wanted to see where the limit of the human body lay.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leaving the realm.</p><p></p><p>The conquest of Dali was even easier than that of Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even without using the Xuntian Arrow, just the group of Daxuan Forbidden Army flying in the sky made the emperor and civil and military officials in the capital kneel on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Adhering to the principle of only one emperor, the Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor, Sun Erlang mercilessly executed the Dali Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he selected Prince Xiao Tianyou of Zhennan as the agent.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the Holy Emperor's Throne in various places in Dali, people quickly accepted the fact of the instant change of dynasty.</p><p></p><p>As well as the existence of that Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Dali also gradually began to transform into a spiritual qi small world.</p><p></p><p>Anchoring for 8 years.</p><p></p><p>"85%."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to before, it has actually slowed down a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Is it due to my current physical condition?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the numbers on the panel and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>In three years, with the incorporation of many small worlds such as Lingmu, Beast Clan, and Lijie into the Daxuan territory, his [Heavenly Emperor Qi Canon] had successfully advanced to the third level.</p><p></p><p>The Daxuan Qi fortune was like the rising morning sun, radiating fierce red light and vigorous vitality.</p><p></p><p>And the actual combat power he could display was equivalent to the early Primordial Realm level in the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had already sensed the bottleneck of the Heavenly Emperor Qi Canon.</p><p></p><p>To advance to the fourth level, the Purple Qi Realm.</p>

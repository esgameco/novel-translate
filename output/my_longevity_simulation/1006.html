            <p>Chapter 1004: Proving Immortality Convergence Array</p><p></p><p>"Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Array?" The Avatar of Heavenly Mysterious Mirror stood there stunned for a while. </p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head, "Although this array has been damaged, it still concerns the safety of the mortal world. Only the main body has the memory of it."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Li Fan felt a little disappointed. But he didn't have much hope for it in the first place, just casually mentioning it.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to make other requests, he heard the Avatar of Heavenly Mysterious Mirror say, "However, if you just want an array of the same level as a reference for breaking the array, I do have other things to offer."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately became interested, "Oh? Such as?"</p><p></p><p>The Avatar of Heavenly Mysterious Mirror pondered for a moment, then broke off another finger and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the amount of information transmitted this time was relatively large, the Avatar's face turned a little pale.</p><p></p><p>His body also became a bit weak as he leaned against the wall and slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused his analysis of the Dharma Prohibition Restriction and began to absorb the contents of the new finger.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was as if his sea of consciousness was filled and churned by something invisible. Li Fan let out a muffled groan, his body swaying uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Pressing his throbbing temples, Li Fan tried to transform the array contents as quickly as possible while reducing the pressure on his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the Avatar of Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, who was sitting on the ground, had a look of schadenfreude on his face.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, not giving a warning in advance was just to see Li Fan make a fool of himself.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the sneer on the Avatar's face gradually turned into solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that Li Fan's speed of adaptation far exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>You should know that the Avatar of Heavenly Mysterious Mirror was not teasing without reason, but specifically selected an immortal-level array from his memory based on Li Fan's information processing ability demonstrated when transforming the Dharma Heavenly Venerate's prohibition just now.</p><p></p><p>Just enough to give Li Fan some trouble, but not really blow his head up.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised the Avatar beyond his expectations at this moment was that in just this short period of time, Li Fan's ability to process information seemed to have greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the speed of improvement was still increasing visibly.</p><p></p><p>"This... exactly..."</p><p></p><p>The Avatar of Heavenly Mysterious Mirror was a little doubtful and curious. If it weren't for the agreement reached between the two parties and the gap in strength,</p><p></p><p>He might have cracked open Li Fan's head on the spot to see what mysteries were inside.</p><p></p><p>And in Li Fan's sea of consciousness, which the Avatar could not perceive,</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Separation Disc was undergoing unimaginably fierce changes.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanji, Convergence of Myriad Spirits." Li Fan kept repeating the name of the array transmitted by the Avatar in his mind, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed a great array that transcended the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Ultimate Separation Disc had not finished deciphering it yet, just accepting the various data of the array still caused its own transformation.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Ultimate Separation Disc had almost pushed the array formations mastered by Li Fan and circulated in the cultivation world to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The road ahead was cut off, with no more room for extrapolation. </p><p></p><p>It could not create something out of nothing like a true master of arrays, opening up new paths from a dead end.</p><p></p><p>It needed new theories and new array frameworks.</p><p></p><p>And now, this "Xuanji, Convergence of Myriad Spirits" Grand Array opened a brand new window for the Ultimate Separation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Xuanji seemed to represent a certain set of...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Part of the formation.</p><p></p><p>The main function of the formation is "All Spirits Return to Numbers".</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, under the coverage of the formation, everything inside will be converted into digital expressions.</p><p></p><p>Realms, including destructive power, spiritual strength, physical strength, etc., will all be represented by specific numbers.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it seems that there is nothing remarkable about this formation.</p><p></p><p>But immortal-level formations often unexpectedly transform the decayed into the miraculous.</p><p></p><p>After digitization, all digital expressions within the formation can be adjusted at will.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is within the allowable range of the formation's operation, there are no restrictions and changes can be made at will.</p><p></p><p>And the final effect is...</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary person without the strength to truss a chicken, after being adjusted by the "Xuanji, All Spirits Return to Numbers" formation, can leap to become an existence with combat power comparable to that of an immortal!</p><p></p><p>Similarly, even if an immortal falls into the formation, as long as they cannot break out of the formation, their values will be adjusted in an instant, losing countless years of accumulated cultivation, and reduced to a mere mortal!</p><p></p><p>It sounds like nonsense, but this actually demonstrates the power of immortal-level formations!</p><p></p><p>I never thought that formations could do such outrageous things. Li Fan's heart was extremely shaken.</p><p></p><p>"If I had this great formation in my hands..."</p><p></p><p>But he didn't let the sudden happiness go to his head.</p><p></p><p>After fully accepting and analyzing the information of the All Spirits Return to Numbers formation, Li Fan suddenly had a feeling of being unable to reach it.</p><p></p><p>Because, "Xuanji, All Spirits Return to Numbers", is not something that mortal cultivators can successfully arrange.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the immortal spiritual energy required to operate the formation, Li Fan had not even heard of the various materials needed to construct the great formation.</p><p></p><p>Although the Terminal Dissociation Disk is powerful, it can only theoretically derive, but cannot turn the formation into reality.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this immortal-level formation did indeed open up a whole new field of formations for the Dissociation Disk.</p><p></p><p>The process of deriving formations, which was gradually stagnating due to the inability to push further, slowly began to accelerate again.</p><p></p><p>The infinite future begins from here.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gradually came back to his senses from the surging emotions, looked at the Tian Xuan Mirror clone sitting on the ground, a little weak and a little shocked, and couldn't help but ask with great concern, "Brother, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>It's not that Li Fan was being hypocritical. It's just that he had already truly gained benefits from the other party, and seeing that there were countless benefits to be gained in the future, he naturally had to care about the other party's safety at all times, treating Tian Xuan Mirror as a treasure mountain that he could dig into at any time.</p><p></p><p>And when the Tian Xuan Mirror clone heard Li Fan's "brother", he instantly got goosebumps all over his body.</p><p></p><p>With a clever move, he stood up from the ground and quickly indicated that he was not in any serious trouble.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan nod his head with relief.</p><p></p><p>"With your All Spirits Return to Numbers formation as a reference, my confidence in helping you break free has increased by a few points."</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence, I will immediately go to contact and start arranging."</p><p></p><p>"You just stay here and don't move. To avoid any accidents."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone was originally going to travel the mortal world to comprehend human nature. Staying in this mortal city naturally didn't matter, so he nodded and agreed.</p><p></p><p>After discussing the possible changes and details that might occur in the future, Li Fan finally asked before leaving, "Brother, do you have any token?"</p><p></p><p>"The Mirror Holder Cang helping you create a human clone should be trustworthy, right? I may be able to contact him this time and add a bit of help."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1120: True Immortal's Sincere Disciple</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were not members of the Multiverse Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They were merely members of the former Cloudy Forest Mutual Aid Society.</p><p></p><p>Since the Cloudy Forest Mutual Aid Society was destroyed by the Dharma Transmitters, they lost contact with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was only their shared, unwavering faith in the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal that allowed them to vaguely sense the existence of the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Alliance has been destroyed, as long as they don't say it themselves, the fact that they once received great kindness from the Alliance will not be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these two are truly people of character.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the announcement issued by the Myriad Immortal Alliance to exterminate the Alliance, not only were they not afraid or tried to hide their past.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they did their best to assassinate the cultivators belonging to the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew that under the divine power of the Reborn Heavenly Venerable, the cultivators would be resurrected after death. But in order to repay Li Fan's kindness back then, they insisted on doing so.</p><p></p><p>In this life, the two received Li Fan's guidance. Dao Xuanzi laid his foundation with the Vast Sea Pearl, while Kou Hong laid his foundation with the 100,000 Mountains Cauldron. In recent years, their progress has been rapid, and they have already reached the mid-Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>But in front of the behemoth that is the Myriad Immortal Alliance, they are just ants. After only killing a dozen or so unimportant Alliance cultivators, they were quickly surrounded by the Dharma Protector Hall cultivators who rushed over from the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi was unwilling to be a prisoner, so he laughed and self-detonated.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong originally wanted to follow Dao Xuanzi, but was stopped by the Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After having his arms cut off and one eye destroyed, he was sent to the Underworld Prison by the Myriad Immortal Alliance to be suppressed for eternity.</p><p></p><p>"Just take advantage of the fact that you can still be eloquent now. I hope that after enjoying the torture of the formations here, you can still be so tough." Facing Kou Hong's incessant cursing, the Myriad Immortal Alliance cultivator who escorted him here was not angry, but sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong, on the other hand, continued to curse non-stop. </p><p></p><p>And Kou Hong's subsequent performance was even somewhat beyond Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was all too clear about the power of the formations inside the high pillars of the Underworld Prison. Ordinary people facing this kind of endless torture simply cannot persist for long. They will instinctively wail and beg for mercy.</p><p></p><p>But this Kou Hong, even if he was tortured to the point of being on the verge of death and losing consciousness every time.</p><p></p><p>The faint cursing sound from his mouth never ceased.</p><p></p><p>"This is certainly related to the brainwashing by the Faceless True Immortal, but it also has to do with Kou Hong's own firm will. Once he decides on something, he must complete it. Even if he dies, he has no regrets."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan first met them, as long as they joined the Myriad Immortal Alliance and worked hard as cattle and horses for more than ten years, they could earn a set of techniques for advancing to the Golden Core stage. But they were unwilling. They would rather risk their lives to explore the ruins of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Later, after finding the true cultivation method of the Nascent Soul stage, the two, who were as close as brothers, fought to the death for a chance at attaining the Dao.</p><p></p><p>And in this life, after being rescued by Li Fan from the mutated immortal miasma, they joined the Mutual Aid Society and became sincere seekers of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>These examples illustrate well the personalities of the two.</p><p></p><p>"He is a malleable talent that can be used by me. At the very least, he should be handier to use than those so-called geniuses." Li Fan looked at Kou Hong not far away, who still had a look of determination on his face even while unconscious, and a hint of appreciation flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In this life, when the destruction of the Spirit Wood Realm was imminent and Li Fan led the members of the Alliance to escape, everyone's performance was taken to heart by him one by one.</p><p></p><p>Those Shanhe Pavilion geniuses who were bought off by Shang Tianci, even though they had already been in the</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Standing before the faceless True Immortal's statue, he made a vow. Even in life and death situations, he never showed any intention of sharing the same fate as the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In terms of loyalty alone, he was far superior to Kou Hong.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, an inconspicuous beam of light penetrated the prison pillar and flew towards Kou Hong, who had fainted not far away.</p><p></p><p>The ferocious expression on Kou Hong's face instantly relaxed a little.</p><p></p><p>When Kou Hong woke up and realized there was something extra in his mind, a trace of unusual color flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, he still pretended to be defiant and angrily denounced the shameless actions of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he began to study the knowledge he had just acquired.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"A detailed explanation of the formation?"</p><p></p><p>"And it's the formation that constitutes this Underworld Prison?"</p><p></p><p>"How did it appear in my mind?"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Kou Hong was shocked to the core and struggled to suppress the urge to investigate everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"If this detailed explanation of the formation is true, then it would be a piece of cake for me to break out of this prison."</p><p></p><p>Having experienced so many things, Kou Hong was much more composed than before.</p><p></p><p>He didn't trust it lightly but instead began to study and learn the contents of this detailed formation explanation for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only roughly learned formations before, this detailed explanation was easy to understand and accessible. Moreover, Kou Hong himself was not lacking in talent.</p><p></p><p>After seven days, Kou Hong had already made a decent start.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a hint of doubt flashed in his mind: "Could it be a trap?"</p><p></p><p>"This is obviously a place used by the Myriad Immortal Alliance to detain felons. How could the formation guarding it be so simple? As a beginner, I can crack it after only studying for a few days?"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong silently attempted to break the formation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his body was extremely weak, and the spiritual power within him was suppressed and unable to be used. However, Kou Hong still managed to exert an influence on the prison formation by using the fluctuations of spiritual power that he had mustered with all his might.</p><p></p><p>The change brought about was that when the Underworld Prison guards once again activated the formation to torture Kou Hong, the pain he felt was reduced by a few degrees!</p><p></p><p>"It's actually real?" Kou Hong, who was suffering, was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly calmed down and began to ponder the origin of this detailed formation explanation in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I am just a small Golden Core cultivator. The Myriad Immortal Alliance doesn't need to put on an act with me."</p><p></p><p>"And the level shown in the wording of this detailed formation explanation far surpasses the Myriad Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>A sacred name suddenly appeared in Kou Hong's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Red Dust Compassionate Immortal."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a stream of heat surged from within Kou Hong's body, circulating through his limbs and bones.</p><p></p><p>It instantly broke the Myriad Immortal Alliance's restrictions, nourishing and repairing Kou Hong's broken body while rapidly improving his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the earth-shattering changes in his body in an instant, Kou Hong's body stiffened, not daring to show any abnormality for fear of being discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his heart was already filled with hot tears.</p><p></p><p>The great and benevolent Red Dust True Immortal had not abandoned him after all!</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance has been destroyed, and there may not be many True Immortal believers left in the world today."</p><p></p><p>"I am deep in prison, yet the True Immortal suddenly bestowed a method of escape..."</p><p></p><p>As he thought about it, Kou Hong's eyes instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>He quickly lowered his head to conceal the excitement in his heart: "I understand. The Myriad Immortal Alliance destroyed the Alliance, and this enmity cannot be shared under the same sky!"</p><p></p><p>"The so-called enemy of an enemy is a friend. Those imprisoned here are all mortal enemies of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. If they were all released..."</p>

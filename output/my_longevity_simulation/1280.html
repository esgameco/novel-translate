        <h1>Chapter 1280</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1276 - Capturing Mo Rubin (7K words, please vote!)</p><p></p><p>At first, Yan Fajue was still a bit cautious. But when she really took a bite, the expression on her face instantly became extremely colorful. Then she started swallowing in big mouthfuls.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm...so delicious...mmm..."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, she devoured the full plate of fried rice. After finishing, she rubbed her slightly bloated belly with a bit of lingering desire, her face full of amazement: "This fried rice of yours is just like the real thing! How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Yan Fajue let out another burp. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said, "When the false is taken as true, the true also becomes false; when the true is taken as false, the false also becomes true. Truth and falsehood are not so easily distinguished."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you have sufficient understanding of the essence of things, you can also create extremely lifelike illusions."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue plopped down on the ground. "I've only eaten fried rice, never made it myself. Same with other delicacies, looks like there's no hope of being self-sufficient. But..."</p><p></p><p>She sized up Li Fan, "Don't tell me, you used to be a chef..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face twitched. Avoiding the question, he changed the subject: "Are you full? Did you remember that immortal character?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue hurriedly shook her head, "Just one dish is not enough! Can you make some more!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, but still waved his hand lightly. A stove, cookware, and ingredients appeared in front of him one after another. </p><p></p><p>Amidst the dancing kitchen flames, one fragrant delicacy after another was continuously served. </p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue watched, drooling, and did not refuse anything that came, stuffing it all into her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Burp..."</p><p></p><p>After a hearty meal, the little loli's belly was already stuffed round like a ball. Very uncouthly, she directly lay down on the ground. </p><p></p><p>"I must say, although you don't look very good, your cooking skills are really not bad." Yan Fajue praised.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded indifferently, "It's just a small business I ran relying on this skill back when I was a mortal. Not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue narrowed her eyes in bliss, savoring the lingering taste on the tip of her tongue.</p><p></p><p>Then she said, "Mmm, I'm a bit sleepy, going to take a nap. You take a look yourself."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Yan Fajue was already snoring thunderously, fast asleep.</p><p></p><p>And in the character light orb, amidst the crisscrossing strokes dancing about, a huge character formed, occupying the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>The profound sound of the Dao that was heard before in the illusion seemed to resound again in a trance.</p><p></p><p>However, it was intermittent, as if an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at this character, motionless. Only when it slowly dissipated did he reveal a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a True Immortal seal character. However, due to the lack in Yan Fajue's memory, the meaning of this True Immortal seal character cannot be fully understood. Even the character she presented has some deviations from the real True Immortal seal character."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to write in the air with his hand as a brush.</p><p></p><p>But he paused at the critical points each time, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The structure of the strokes, the style of the turns, and all kinds of brush tip details are extremely similar to the 'hunger' and 'chaos' characters seen before. But it's even more beautiful, more naturally ingenious."</p><p></p><p>The many True Immortal seal characters Li Fan had encountered before already seemed perfectly flawless in his eyes, with no blemishes to be found. Every part demonstrated the vast and sacred power of True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>But comparisons are odious.</p><p></p><p>Compared with this work of the Dao-Inscribing Immortal in Yan Fajue's memory, those in the Calamity-Ridden Dark Sea of Stars were as crude as children's scribbles.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan discovered that this kind of gap only emerged when the two were presented and compared simultaneously in the mind.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan only reproduced single characters like "hunger" or "chaos", he would still instinctively feel that they were perfect and flawless.</p><p></p><p>This was a very contradictory and wonderful experience.</p><p></p><p>After repeated attempts, Li Fan came to a conclusion: To him, True Immortal seal characters were like a vast ocean. Relying on himself alone, he could only be immersed in it, unable to observe its entirety. However, if there was a work of the Dao-Inscribing Immortal for comparison, it was like an unmoving anchor, or an eye in the sky. It allowed him to extricate himself and open his eyes to see the true situation.</p><p></p><p>Imitating the work of the Dao-Inscribing Immortal, Li Fan reorganized the True Immortal seal characters of "hunger", "chaos" and others that he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the effect was excellent. Although at first glance, it still looked no different from before. However, Li Fan was very certain that the power of these True Immortal seal characters revised according to the authentic version had expanded by at least a third.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that this work of the Dao-Inscribing Immortal is also incomplete. And being transferred from Yan Fajue's memory, it still has some distortions."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Li Fan awoke from his epiphany and let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>"From the clues grasped so far, True Immortal seal characters can be divided into three major categories. The first is the 'chaos character formula' type, which brings all kinds of calamities and destruction. The second is the 'return character formula', which are decrees from the immortal realm. And the last is this..."</p><p></p><p>"The raindrops descending from the manifested characters can be called 'Immortal Sound Jade Dew'. It is also accompanied by the birth of the profound sound of Dao, causing various True Immortals to take action and fight for it. It is probably closer to the legendary 'Dao-Inscribing' characters."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged, and he couldn't help but try to gesture the incomplete Dao-Inscribing characters again to repair them.</p><p></p><p>The result was as expected, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>"With the immortal realm destroyed, where would the Dao-Inscribing Immortal's authentic work from back then be now?" Li Fan couldn't help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's true body was learning the secrets of the ancient immortal realm from Yan Fajue and gaining insights, the Faceless Sacred Emperor Li Ping had also finally completed the final sealing of the Faceless True Immortal stone statue and the ruins of the First Sect.</p><p></p><p>And in his perception, Mo Rubin, who had been fleeing at high speed earlier, had not moved for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this location?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered for a moment and did not directly track him down. Instead, he summoned the Ingenious Monk.</p><p></p><p>"This place... It is said to be where the heart of that giant beast transformed after its death, the gathering point of the earth qi of the Nine Mountains Prefecture." The Ingenious Monk sensed the image transmitted by the Sacred Emperor and shook his head slightly. "I went there once but didn't find anything special."</p><p></p><p>The location the Sacred Emperor pointed to was a swamp in the Nine Mountains Prefecture, the old lair of the Spirit Origin Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual qi is just a bit denser than other places, there's really nothing else special." The Ingenious Monk concluded.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk shrugged, "If it weren't for some disciples from the Nine Mountains Prefecture in our sect, I'm afraid I wouldn't even know the legend that the Nine Mountains were transformed from the corpse of a giant beast after its death. So that thing was called the Tian Beast, learned something new."</p><p></p><p>"However, if you're interested in that place, there is a Foundation Establishment disciple in our sect named Shen Yurou. You can summon him to ask."</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk explained the reason to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Shen Yurou's family had been making a living by excavating underground objects in the Nine Mountains for generations. The Nine Mountains was a chaotic place, and countless cultivators had been buried there since ancient times. It could even be traced back to the era when the Ten Immortal Sects ruled.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family had accumulated a lot of capital by relying on this craft. However, it was ultimately a shady business. Since joining the Spirit Origin Sect, Shen Yurou had abandoned this ancestral secret art.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have heard him say before that his ancestor once dug up a strange building near that swamp. However, it was empty inside, with only some bizarre statues placed there. After his ancestor left in disappointment, he even fell seriously ill and nearly lost his life."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's heart stirred and he flipped through the Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he found the information about this Shen family ancestor. However, there was no record of discovering ruins in the swamp of the Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping immediately left the Great Enlightenment and came to the Spirit Origin Sect.</p><p></p><p>Still disguised as the Sect Master of Spirit Origin, he summoned Shen Yurou and inquired about the details.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yurou was a bit startled by the summons from this sect master who had not shown his face for a long time. He said very cautiously, "This matter is indeed a bit strange. Since that accidental entry, my ancestor contracted some strange illness."</p><p></p><p>"For example, the scene of that underground building often reappeared in dreams, and also..."</p><p></p><p>"Since then, all the men in our Shen family have become feminine, and the women have become masculine. Yin and yang reversed." Shen Yurou seemed to have already accepted reality and said very calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's divine sense swept over Shen Yurou's body but did not detect the influence of any foreign power. It seemed as if it was supposed to be this way.</p><p></p><p>"Is the specific location of that building still preserved?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yurou's face showed a look of difficulty, "In order to prevent other family members from accidentally entering again, my ancestor did not disclose the specific location. However, the specific scene of that building was left in a painting."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Shen Yurou flicked his finger, and a painting appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the four corners, there was a statue each.</p><p></p><p>It was a headless person, making different gestures, as if praying.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of the four statues, a bare round pillar stood tall.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the pillar was very smooth, without any carved patterns. But strangely, the shadow of the pillar projected on the ground seemed to be a ferocious beast, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. As if it would come alive at any time with the shifting light and shadow.</p><p></p><p>"According to my ancestor, inside this building, there would be a constant violent heartbeat sound pounding in the ears. And if you looked along this pillar, it was like suddenly falling into an abyss, surrounded by endless darkness..." Shen Yurou added.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stared at the four headless figures in the painting.</p><p></p><p>Even without the skulls, it could vaguely be seen that the style was very similar to the Faceless True Immortal statue he encountered at the foot of Mount Tai Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing its image, but severing its head."</p><p></p><p>"This round pillar..."</p><p></p><p>That smooth round pillar was undoubtedly the core of this bizarre building.</p><p></p><p>But just from the painting, it was impossible to discern any clues.</p><p></p><p>After dismissing Shen Yurou, Li Ping quietly came to the Great Marsh in the Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In the continuous Nine Mountains region, the appearance of such a large-scale swamp was theoretically very unreasonable. Many cultivators had also come here to explore, wanting to discover some secrets. But they all came back empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stood in the center of the Great Marsh, but only sensed the fishy and decaying smell from it. He did not detect anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for clearly perceiving that Mo Rubin was hiding here.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin probably hadn't noticed Li Ping's approach yet. Although he kept moving in a small range deep in the swamp, he never left this area.</p><p></p><p>Setting up formations around, Li Ping infiltrated underground into the swamp, slowly approaching the sensed location.</p><p></p><p>"Gulu..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his figure abruptly paused.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Li Ping faintly heard a squirming sound.</p><p></p><p>With his current cultivation, he could almost rule out that it was an illusion. So...</p><p></p><p>Li Ping looked around.</p><p></p><p>The sticky, foul-smelling swamp sludge squeezed rhythmically as if it had life.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping suddenly had a feeling that the entire swamp seemed to have come alive.</p><p></p><p>"A trap?"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Li Ping's mind, but he quickly denied it.</p><p></p><p>The attention of this swamp was not on him.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor continued to conceal his tracks. Following the source of the swamp's vital rhythm in his mind, before long, he discovered the strange ancient building that Shen Yurou's ancestor had encountered.</p><p></p><p>From a macro perspective from the outside, this building was surprisingly in the shape of a blank face.</p><p></p><p>And that towering smooth round pillar was located right at the position of the third eye on the blank face. As if a highly protruding third eye, gazing at the sky from underground.</p><p></p><p>Such a bizarre sight made Li Ping's heart tighten.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor did not rashly enter. Instead, he silently laid out a net of refined origin power on the periphery.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with layers of formations for confinement, this place was completely sealed off. He even called upon the power of the Mysterious Yellow Heavenly Dao to seal the surrounding earth veins...</p><p></p><p>Even though he had already laid out so many methods, for some reason, Li Ping still felt that he didn't have much confidence.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment...</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li Ping awakened the cat Bao on his shoulder and took out an item from its belly. </p><p></p><p>It was an unusual treasure obtained from the fishing pond, capable of sealing off space.</p><p></p><p>The treasure appeared quite ordinary, just a plain circular ring.</p><p></p><p>But the flowing golden-white light on it hinted at the terrifying power hidden within.</p><p></p><p>"Binding Space Ring."</p><p></p><p>"Forged by annihilating all living beings in a ring-shaped world and fusing it into the boundary. It not only has the weight of an entire world itself, but also the weight of hundreds of millions of living beings. Once bound, even my movements would be greatly affected."</p><p></p><p>Although the crafting method was undoubtedly evil, Li Ping was not a pedantic person, so he had no psychological burden in using it.</p><p></p><p>He lightly tossed it out, and the Binding Space Ring flew towards the top of the faceless building in the void. In the blink of an eye, it expanded several times, enveloping the entire surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Watching the gradually concealed golden-white ring, the Holy Emperor pondered for a moment and then laid down the final measure.</p><p></p><p>With everything ready, Li Ping flew towards the interior of the building.</p><p></p><p>"You've come."</p><p></p><p>"I've been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, he heard Mo Rubin's voice ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping looked intently but couldn't see his actual figure.</p><p></p><p>However, at the base of the smooth pillar in the center of the building, the drifting shadow seemed like a human shape.</p><p></p><p>It faced Li Ping as if showing a mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>"I've been by Brother Xuanyuan's side for so long that even if I haven't entered the realm of a half-immortal, I'm not completely ignorant of it. Moreover, you're using a plan that was discarded and rejected by Brother..."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the mortal world is strong but harmful and useless." Mo Rubin mocked.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that the power of the mortal world mentioned by Mo Rubin was the essence of the source power condensed from the faith of the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>The way of taking shortcuts will inevitably pay a corresponding price. But what he sought was not to ascend to immortality but for the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Mo Rubin's words, the Holy Emperor examined the details of the building.</p><p></p><p>"A relic of the Mysterious Heaven Sect?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin also seemed to be waiting for something and didn't make a move. He responded, "Hehe, rather than saying it's from the Mysterious Heaven Sect, it's better to say it's my personal backup plan."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xuanyuan is too idealistic. And has too much faith in himself."</p><p></p><p>"I'm different."</p><p></p><p>The shadow under the pillar was stimulated by something and circled around even more rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"I used to have the same mentality as Brother Xuanyuan, thinking that I was the born protagonist and that as long as I did it, there was no possibility of failure. But later, I was severely beaten down, and my cultivation regressed every day. I even had to face the mockery of those I previously didn't even consider..."</p><p></p><p>"I realized!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's shadow suddenly surged up from the ground and floated in mid-air, glaring at Li Ping viciously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not some protagonist at all. I'm just an insignificant little character flowing through the long river of history in the world. As a small character, naturally, I have to pave the way for failure. So, I secretly built this place from Brother Xuanyuan!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin manifested his shadowy arms and pointed to the four headless stone statues around, laughing gloomily, "Look at these statues."</p><p></p><p>"They are genuine immortals who even saved Brother Xuanyuan's life. The people of the sect, including Brother Xuanyuan himself, all revered them. But didn't I still chop off their heads?!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's manic laughter resounded throughout the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping calmly said, "Aren't you afraid of the immortals' revenge?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin laughed even more viciously, "You don't understand at all. Let alone chopping off heads, even if I piss and shit on their statues, the immortals won't care!"</p><p></p><p>"How can mortal affairs enter the eyes of immortals?! Immortals..."</p><p></p><p>"Only care about what they care about!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping just listened silently, neither agreeing nor refuting.</p><p></p><p>"I know that where the power of immortals reaches, it's as if the immortals are present in person. But even immortals' power is not infinite. How could they waste their power on this small statue?"</p><p></p><p>After laughing loudly, Mo Rubin gradually calmed down, "Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"Something the immortals care about appears around the statue."</p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking, the shadow that Mo Rubin had transformed into shrank back into the smooth pillar.</p><p></p><p>The ground of the building trembled slightly, and the pillar also began to emit a faint glow as if something was gestating inside.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know who you are. But I'll give you a piece of advice..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't enter the realm of immortals unless absolutely necessary!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping vaguely felt that the four faceless statues around him seemed to have come to life.</p><p></p><p>Even with their heads severed, they could still observe the field.</p><p></p><p>But their gazes were not on Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were all focused on that glowing pillar.</p><p></p><p>In theory, even if it wasn't the personal descent of an immortal's great power, just the gaze transmitted across countless time and space should be unbearable for mortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the faceless Holy Emperor in the midst of the four statues didn't feel any pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The power was extracted and absorbed?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was slightly shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In his sight, four forces of the same nature entangled into lines, all circling around the smooth pillar, round after round.</p><p></p><p>Stimulated by this great power, the light of the pillar became even more dazzling.</p><p></p><p>The surface seemed to melt, revealing its true form inside.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>A bare flagpole.</p><p></p><p>The flag had long disappeared, leaving only the white jade pole carved with intricate patterns standing tall.</p><p></p><p>"An object from the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the increasingly turbulent energy fluctuations around him, Li Ping retreated slightly, but his gaze remained firmly locked on the white jade flagpole.</p><p></p><p>"Not only the gazes of the immortal statues but even the essence of the source power I arranged outside, the power of the mortal world, are all being mobilized by this flagpole..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mo Rubin's voice rang out again, "When Brother Xuanyuan returned from the immortal realm back then, he did bring back quite a few good things."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention those techniques, even immortal tools could be picked up everywhere..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that he said they were tainted by calamity, so most of them were sealed away and not allowed for us to use."</p><p></p><p>Energy formed a substantial vortex around the flagpole.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the constant tremors, the flagpole seemed like it could break through the void at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I haven't talked to anyone for many years. It feels good to say so much at once."</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to do what I need to do."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's words slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant light burst forth from the flagpole, obscuring all probing from the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the spiritual flag was about to escape from this place.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping had tracked it for so long, naturally, he wouldn't just let it leave based on a few words from Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>The formation and the net of the essence of the source power exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>Golden intertwined fine lines appeared in the void. A dense and impenetrable heavenly net blocked the flagpole.</p><p></p><p>It even completely sealed off space.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the mortal world dares to compete with the true power of immortals?!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's mocking voice came.</p><p></p><p>Under the dazzling light at the front of the white jade flagpole, the golden source power actually melted slowly like snow.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was unmoved. While deploying the remaining essence of the source power like moths to a flame, he activated the formation to intercept.</p><p></p><p>"Mortal formations, also worthy of..."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?!"</p><p></p><p>For the first time, a shocked tone appeared in Mo Rubin's voice.</p><p></p><p>Because the formations Li Ping displayed had already far surpassed his knowledge.</p><p></p><p>It even slowly pulled the white jade flagpole, which was about to pierce through the void, back again.</p><p></p><p>In Mo Rubin's perception, the surroundings were filled with obstructive medium, hindering the flagpole's advance.</p><p></p><p>"The formations of the Xuanhuang Realm have already developed to this extent?"</p><p></p><p>"The level of intricacy is actually not inferior to the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation!"</p><p></p><p>Although shocked in his heart, Mo Rubin didn't slow down his momentum to leave.</p><p></p><p>A white light burst forth from the flagpole once more.</p><p></p><p>As the white light swept past, everything blocking in front was completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>The flagpole easily broke free from the layers of obstruction.</p><p></p><p>It just wanted to leave silently.</p><p></p><p>"Decree!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Ping's cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The Binding Space Ring appeared in the void.</p><p></p><p>It firmly locked the white jade flagpole.</p><p></p><p>"Useless! Useless! Useless! Just a mere boundary tool!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! You're really like a fly, so annoying!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's tone was significantly different from before.</p><p></p><p>Rambling and even a bit crazed.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, something other than white light appeared in the white jade flagpole.</p><p></p><p>It was a human-shaped outline.</p><p></p><p>The human figure wielded a long saber and flew out gracefully, lightly slashing at the Binding Space Ring.</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>The golden-white ring containing hundreds of millions of living beings and an entire cultivation realm broke apart from the middle!</p><p></p><p>However, releasing the white figure obviously consumed a lot from the white jade flagpole.</p><p></p><p>The light dimmed considerably.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, damn, damn..."</p><p></p><p>The sound of Mo Rubin's vicious curses echoed.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't stay to cause trouble for Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he very decisively continued towards the predetermined location.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, you can't stop me!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the flashing light, the white jade flagpole turned into a thin line, shaking off all restraints and about to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an ancient song suddenly and abruptly rang out.</p><p></p><p>The voice wasn't loud but drowned out the trembling sound of Mo Rubin and the white jade flagpole.</p><p></p><p>And Li Ping, who had never personally made a move, also flashed at this moment, arriving at the tail of the white jade flagpole.</p><p></p><p>The golden armor protected his body, and behind the Holy Emperor, the phantom of the Xuanhuang Realm also appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Get in there!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Ping kicked hard at the tail of the white jade flagpole with one foot.</p><p></p><p>Causing the flagpole, which was already eager to leave, to suddenly dart forward.</p><p></p><p>Unable to dodge in time, it flew straight into the black door.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also followed closely and entered.</p><p></p><p>He also closed the passage along the way.</p><p></p><p>And didn't forget to bring along the few loyal Youzu people who risked their lives to lay down the ritual and open the passage to the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>A piece of dark stillness.</p><p></p><p>Even the white jade flagpole, which was as dazzling as the sun outside, could only illuminate a small limited area around it here.</p><p></p><p>And Mo Rubin, who had been very talkative, also seemed to have become mute at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, where is this..."</p><p></p><p>"This place..."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally spoke in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"Now, we can have a chat."</p><p></p><p>The brilliance of the white jade flagpole slightly dispelled the darkness of the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Allowing Li Ping and Mo Rubin to temporarily communicate using language.</p><p></p><p>However, Mo Rubin seemed to not have heard Li Ping's words at all.</p><p></p><p>He emerged from the white jade flagpole and looked around in an unimaginable manner.</p><p></p><p>His expression was both anticipation and fear.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Li Ping spoke up and asked.</p><p></p><p>The three words "Mysterious Heaven King" seemed to trigger some kind of switch.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin suddenly came back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Li Ping, "How do you know about this place?"</p><p></p><p>"And you can even open the passage here?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's tone was very dangerous, as if Li Ping's answer was slightly off, he would fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>"It's been nearly 10,000 years since you fell asleep. It's impossible for nothing to happen."</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping's attitude was very calm.</p><p></p><p>"Not only me but even the current largest cultivation organization, the League of Ten Thousand Immortals, have also mastered the way to open the passage here."</p><p></p><p>"And they are stealing power from here."</p><p></p><p>"Can't you feel it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>At these words, Mo Rubin's expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>He looked into the distance, and the aura on his body fluctuated violently.</p><p></p><p>"How dare they?!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!

            <p>Chapter 1143: All the Stars of Xuanhuang Return</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could keenly sense that Yan Fajue had already woken up. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was still lying on the long table, definitely just pretending to be asleep.</p><p></p><p>The three Guardians of the Convergence were all well aware of this. Letting Li Fan wake up the little loli was just because he was "the new one".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was clear about Yan Fajue's temperament - childish, vengeful, and petty. </p><p></p><p>She definitely wouldn't show a good face to someone who disturbed her rest.</p><p></p><p>And these Guardians were only responsible for monitoring. They really couldn't do anything to Yan Fajue.</p><p></p><p>When the little ancestor's temper flared up, they could only coax and indulge her.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the two divine senses on him, Li Fan didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Following the method Elder Nangong had taught earlier, he used the sealing power of Yan Fa's space here to conjure a gong above the little loli's head.</p><p></p><p>Then he struck it hard.</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue's body trembled violently and she abruptly raised her head.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, she locked onto Li Fan, the culprit, her little face full of anger.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shrugged, looking very innocent: "The rest time has exceeded six hours. It's time to get up and work."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue still stared at Li Fan with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>As if Li Fan had committed some unforgivable sin.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept a straight face and continued, "By the way, according to the rules, the overtime this time will be deducted from your next vacation."</p><p></p><p>"Um... the time you spend staring at me is also counted."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan touched his face, seeming not to mind Yan Fajue continuing to stare at him like this.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that her next vacation time would be reduced, Yan Fajue instantly became like a puffed up little cat.</p><p></p><p>Her big eyes were shrouded in mist, looking at the other two Guardians with a aggrieved expression.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu and the others both turned their heads away.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan showed a kind smile, watching Yan Fajue like watching a good show.</p><p></p><p>He even conjured an hourglass, recording the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>After being frozen for a while, seeing the increasing sand at the bottom of the hourglass, Yan Fajue finally couldn't hold it anymore.</p><p></p><p>She fiercely glared at Li Fan, and slapped the table hard with her little hand.</p><p></p><p>The character light balls that had slowed down a bit instantly evolved rapidly again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's smile remained unchanged. </p><p></p><p>Being here for hundreds of years, he could only pass the time by teasing the little loli.</p><p></p><p>Great Qi, Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>After eight years of earth-shaking development, the Holy Dynasty's aura had molted from crimson to purple.</p><p></p><p>And the "Heavenly Emperor Qi Canon" that Li Fan's avatar cultivated had successfully stepped into the fourth realm because of this.</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing the majestic fortune of billions of living beings, I now have the strength to fight against the Perfected Immortals of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If it develops for a few more decades and this small world is developed to the extreme, it may be comparable to Convergence Cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"But to go a step further and rival Eternal Life..."</p><p></p><p>Avatar Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Grand Formation has been initially established. It's time to expand our territory."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Li Fan, before long, Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Master."</p><p></p><p>The two saluted in unison.</p><p></p><p>Avatar Li Fan waved his hand, and a map with stars densely dotting the sky appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Each white light spot represented a grotto-heaven or small world.</p><p></p><p>And where Great Qi was located emanated a sacred purple glow.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang raised his</p><p></p><p>The figure stared blankly at the map before him, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>As his consciousness focused on those white spots of light, various information about the small worlds they represented correspondingly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I have already explained the current specific layout of the Xuanhuang Realm to you before."</p><p></p><p>"At present, we have not yet directly confronted the forces of the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association. Therefore, the national policy for the next hundred years is to gather the strength of the various small worlds and expand the territory of the Holy Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>"Unite the myriad realms and counterattack the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's avatar did not shy away from the current weakness of the Great Qi Dynasty, but instead painted a bright future for the two beloved disciples of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>As for the Wanxian Alliance, Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba were not completely ignorant. They even knew about the existence of the Dharma Transmitters and Mirror Holders, the highest rulers of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after hearing the great plan of the Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor, not only did they not feel the absurdity of striking a stone with an egg, but instead, their blood boiled and their hearts were eager to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>It was not that Sun Erlang was shallow and ignorant, but that in the past eight years, he had personally witnessed the various changes in the Holy Dynasty. Compared with the Wanxian Alliance he had seen with his own eyes, Sun Erlang firmly believed that one day, the Holy Dynasty would eliminate the Wanxian Alliance and unify the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>There would no longer be any exploitation and oppression, and everyone could study and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>It would be a hundred times better than the sage's rule described in ancient books!</p><p></p><p>In the past eight years, Sun Erlang had also secretly visited neighboring small worlds.</p><p></p><p>There was no difference from the decadent Great Xuan Dynasty of the past.</p><p></p><p>In some places, the lives of the people were even worse than those of the Great Xuan subjects.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang felt that spreading the glory of the Holy Dynasty and the Holy Emperor to these decadent small worlds was a noble and honorable thing to do.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, after hearing the Holy Emperor finally take a direct stance, Sun Erlang's heart was ignited with endless fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>Now the Great Qi Dynasty had a total of nine legions.</p><p></p><p>Each legion commander had already reached the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>As the commander-in-chief of these legion commanders, Sun Erlang, who practiced the "Sitting Immortal Jue", had a strength that was approaching the Demigod realm.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Holy Emperor saying that his foundation was unstable and he needed to accumulate more time to settle down, he would probably be able to absorb the changes of heaven and earth and complete his breakthrough now.</p><p></p><p>Eight years to reach the Demigod stage - Sun Erlang believed that this cultivation speed would be shocking enough even in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Those so-called peerless geniuses of the Xuanhuang Realm couldn't even compare to the legion commanders under him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The more he understood, the more confident Sun Erlang became in the future of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"I will give you one year to prepare."</p><p></p><p>"One year later, the army of the Holy Dynasty will set out from the Holy Capital to conquer the myriad realms!"</p><p></p><p>With Li Ping's solemn declaration, countless purple lines instantly extended from the purple spot representing the Xuanhuang Realm on the map in front. Like tentacles, they tightly bound the myriad small worlds of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Weaving into a huge net, covering the entire map of the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene, Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba couldn't help but hold their breath, their hearts surging!</p><p></p><p>With this state of mind, Sun Erlang went down excitedly to gather the legion commanders and plan for war preparations.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba, on the other hand, stayed behind to accept a secret mission from the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"[All Stars Converge]?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba looked at the code name of the mission, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"First, go to Congyun Sea and Yinyin Island to find a cultivator named Yin Shangren."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba silently recited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There will be another chapter in 15 minutes.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1099</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that you've become dumber?" Baihua Daoren stared blankly at Qiaogong Jushi.</p><p></p><p>"It seems so..." Before Qiaogong could finish, Baihua interjected, "Compared to when I first started, I haven't noticed any significant changes in myself. Could this be due to your own reasons?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong was left speechless upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"There's no use in guessing. It's better to go and try it out for ourselves," Fang Zaiji said, his eyes flickering with eagerness to give it a shot.</p><p></p><p>Everyone chimed in with their opinions.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Li Fan concluded, "The return of the dark power is not as simple as we think."</p><p></p><p>"If it's just a matter of simple absorption, I'm afraid we'll end up being eroded by it, just like Mo Rubin."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Dark Abyss is currently controlled by the Wanxian Alliance. If we want to enter and study it..."</p><p></p><p>"They probably won't allow it."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen said, "Didn't the envoy mention that the Wanxian Alliance also entered the Dark Abyss through some kind of ritual performed by the 'Dark Tribe' people?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if anyone still remembers the specific details of that ritual? If we imitate it, perhaps we can also sneak in."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, it's pitch black inside the Dark Abyss. As long as we're careful, we won't be detected by the other party."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fang Zaiji repeatedly echoed, "The Sect Master's suggestion is excellent! We should definitely give it a try!"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan used the Water Mirror Technique to recreate the somewhat strange ritual scene.</p><p></p><p>Including the chanted syllables and tones, everything was perfectly reproduced.</p><p></p><p>After selecting more than a dozen young disciples to learn it, unsurprisingly, the ritual failed to succeed.</p><p></p><p>"Do we really need those Dark Tribe people?" Fang Zaiji cursed under his breath.</p><p></p><p>The members of the alliance also shook their heads, feeling a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"The Dark Tribe, huh..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already grasped the basic information of all the small worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no information about the Dark Tribe among them, which should have been deliberately concealed by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, we just need to eliminate them one by one."</p><p></p><p>In the process of searching for Xu Ke, most of the small worlds had already been preliminarily investigated.</p><p></p><p>Completing the rest wouldn't take much more time.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's order, countless inconspicuous beasts swarmed towards the entrances of various small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Just half a month later, there was news.</p><p></p><p>In the final image transmitted back before being annihilated, traces suspected to be of the Dark Tribe were discovered.</p><p></p><p>In that small world, there must be people from the Wanxian Alliance guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan personally led Tianyang to infiltrate it.</p><p></p><p>It was not only because it involved the possibility of escaping the Immortal Ruins but also because it was related to the so-called "completeness".</p><p></p><p>Regarding Mo Rubin's demise, Li Fan actually had doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The cunning and scheming Xuantian Sect's Dharma King, who had repeatedly toyed with him, had actually died so inexplicably in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>This made it a bit hard for Li Fan to believe.</p><p></p><p>Especially the reason why he entered the Dark Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's goal should have remained unchanged from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Find the Xuantian King and leave the Darkest Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't pass the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable's illusory realm test, he must have discovered some clues from it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Xuantian King is hidden in the Dark Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps his inexplicable disappearance back then was also related to the dark power?"</p><p></p><p>With all sorts of doubts, Li Fan found the hidden underground...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan a little was that in this small world, there was no garrison of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The number of Youzu people was also very scarce, with less than a hundred people.</p><p></p><p>The tribe was not as strong and healthy as Li Fan had seen before.</p><p></p><p>Each of them was as thin as a rake, as if they were at risk of sudden death at any time.</p><p></p><p>After some investigation, Li Fan vaguely understood.</p><p></p><p>The Youzu tribe before his eyes had fled for their lives from their original homeland.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance captured the Youzu, and they escaped at the risk of their lives and found such a place to hide.</p><p></p><p>"This is even better."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan no longer hesitated. With his full power erupting and cooperating with Tianyang, he was about to suppress this group of Youzu people into his own Dongtian.</p><p></p><p>However, something that Li Fan didn't quite expect happened.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's attack, these Youzu people, who seemed to have no extraordinary aura, burst out with a very strange power.</p><p></p><p>The elders in the tribe, though startled, remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Chanting loudly, a strange fluctuation instantly enveloped the whole group.</p><p></p><p>It was not some kind of illusion, but the attack really missed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Interesting."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan clearly felt the fluctuation of the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>"You can run away from the monk, but you can't run away from the temple."</p><p></p><p>When entering this small world, Li Fan had already used a formation to completely block the entrance and exit.</p><p></p><p>Without his permission, no one could leave this world!</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept around, searching the entire small world, but still could not find the hidden Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan simply launched indiscriminate attacks.</p><p></p><p>The black light full of destructive power fell from the sky and bombarded every inch of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Countless lives were affected.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan remained unmoved and cleared all places in this small world.</p><p></p><p>Under this large-scale, dead-angle cleansing, the group of Youzu people finally revealed flaws.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that something seemed to have blocked his Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword, a flash of brilliance appeared in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He instantly used formations to seal off that area layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>Under coercion, the Youzu people finally showed their figures.</p><p></p><p>They huddled together, looking up at Li Fan in the sky.</p><p></p><p>There was fear and hatred in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The leading elder finally couldn't help but speak at this time: "Why does the Immortal have to kill to the end?"</p><p></p><p>"The number of tribesmen you originally captured in the Sacred Land of Exploration should definitely be enough."</p><p></p><p>"I think you misunderstood. I am not from the Wanxian Alliance. On the contrary, like you, I have an irreconcilable hatred with the Wanxian Alliance." Li Fan said loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, with your meager strength, could you survive under my hands?"</p><p></p><p>With that said, Li Fan immediately operated the Soul Burning Method at full power.</p><p></p><p>The five great Dongtian, under the illumination of blood color, were extremely weird.</p><p></p><p>With the blessing of the Tianyang Immortal Puppet, the strength Li Fan displayed at this time was already comparable to that of an Immortal of Eternal Life realm.</p><p></p><p>The small world he was in couldn't contain it, and black spatial cracks appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth were shaking and gradually disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>Just the aura released had already led to an apocalyptic scene.</p><p></p><p>This made the Youzu people below extremely terrified.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance is currently exploring your sacred land, and I want to take the opportunity to secretly assassinate them."</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to lend me a helping hand?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked in an icy tone.</p><p></p><p>There was no second option. Coupled with the hatred for the Wanxian Alliance, the Youzu people below quickly chose to submit.</p><p></p><p>When he successfully brought them back to the Lingmu Realm and was about to pay respects to the Faceless Immortal as usual.</p>

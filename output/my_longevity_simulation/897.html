        <h1>Chapter 897</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The return of the failed ascension of the Xuantian King caused a great uproar in the Xuanhuang Realm. Countless cultivators sent inquiries, but he ignored them all.</p><p></p><p>After all, this matter was too shocking. If it were to spread, the desperate cultivation world would instantly collapse like the end times.</p><p></p><p>After hiding alone, the Xuantian King took stock of his gains from this attempt and pondered the meaning behind the words of that Faceless Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Xuanhuang Realm, after a period of clamor, gradually returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>With the collapse and disappearance of the ascension passage, the impact of the immortal realm's catastrophe on the lower realms also seemed to gradually vanish without a trace.</p><p></p><p>About a year passed like this, until the Xuantian King suddenly noticed a slight shift in the position of the Dao Marker in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of the change was extremely small.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been paying constant attention, and if his strength hadn't skyrocketed after being baptized by the immortal spiritual energy, he might have overlooked it.</p><p></p><p>But how could the prepared Xuantian King possibly ignore this detail?</p><p></p><p>Another three years passed.</p><p></p><p>By constantly monitoring the changes in the Dao Marker's values, the Xuantian King finally confirmed that the entire Xuanhuang Realm was drifting towards a certain direction in the endless void.</p><p></p><p>What shocked the Xuantian King even more was that it wasn't just the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the other cultivation realms he could observe and contact were doing the same!</p><p></p><p>The conclusion was obvious.</p><p></p><p>Something in the endless void was attracting all the cultivation realms towards it!</p><p></p><p>Recalling the Faceless Immortal's words, "Hurry and escape, or it will be too late," the Xuantian King was instantly horrified.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown if, in that instant, the Xuantian King had the thought of immediately fleeing on his own.</p><p></p><p>As the most talented cultivator in the Xuanhuang Realm at the time, the Xuantian King couldn't bear to just watch his homeland slowly head towards destruction.</p><p></p><p>So, the Xuantian King ultimately made a decision that could be called noble.</p><p></p><p>That was to bring the Xuanhuang Realm along in the escape.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Xuantian King already had a half-immortal body at the time, wanting to move an entire world was purely a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention overcoming that terrifying attractive force...</p><p></p><p>But the Xuantian King didn't give up.</p><p></p><p>After extensively reading the scriptures plundered from the immortals, the scholarly Xuantian King, combining his own knowledge, derived a magnificent, unparalleled grand formation.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian King called it the "Floating Crossing the Starry Void Grand Formation".</p><p></p><p>According to the Xuantian King's calculations, if they wanted to resist the inexplicable attractive force in the endless void, even hollowing out the Xuanhuang Realm wouldn't allow them to break free from that terrifyingly powerful, unimaginable force.</p><p></p><p>So, one of the functions of the Floating Crossing the Starry Void Grand Formation was to lock onto the surrounding void's minor worlds and capture them, initiating inter-realm wars.</p><p></p><p>This would allow them to plunder resources and supplement themselves, while also forming an effect like iron chains connecting boats, slowing the speed at which the Xuanhuang Realm was being pulled in.</p><p></p><p>Killing multiple birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>However, relying on his strength alone to construct such a grand formation was beyond his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>He had to gather and coordinate the vast majority of the Xuanhuang Realm's forces to complete the construction of the Floating Crossing the Starry Void Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>As for publicizing the true situation and rallying everyone to unite...</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian King had considered this too.</p><p></p><p>But after surveying the general character of the Xuanhuang Realm's cultivators, he decisively gave up on that idea.</p><p></p><p>If at this time, those cultivators learned of the crisis facing the Xuanhuang Realm, the vast majority of them would choose to immediately flee.</p><p></p><p>Those who would choose to stay and follow the</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuantian Wang, together with the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm, had absolutely no chance of survival in their attempt to save the realm.</p><p></p><p>The construction of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation required the power of these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xuantian Wang decided to first unify the Xuanhuang Realm to better coordinate their strength.</p><p></p><p>He was a once-in-a-millennium prodigy, and now the only one in the Xuanhuang Realm with a half-immortal body.</p><p></p><p>He also had many immortal techniques inherited from the ascension passage.</p><p></p><p>Achieving this goal was not very difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Everything went as he expected.</p><p></p><p>After persuading twelve top cultivators with equally amazing talents to be his helpers, Xuantian Wang swept away all opposing forces like a hot knife through butter in just a few years.</p><p></p><p>With Xuantian Wang as the leader and the twelve Dharma Kings as his subordinates, they established the Xuantian Sect that dominated the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>All beings in Xuanhuang submitted to their rule.</p><p></p><p>The Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation was also constructed with unprecedented high efficiency.</p><p></p><p>It began to successfully capture and conquer other worlds.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the Dao marker's deviation was also slowly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to be developing in a good direction.</p><p></p><p>However, the arrival of an uninvited guest completely shattered his plan.</p><p></p><p>The moment the purple energy appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm, Xuantian Wang had already vaguely sensed the other party's background.</p><p></p><p>An incomplete half-immortal body that had not been fully cleansed, with deficient immortal spirit energy.</p><p></p><p>It should be a cultivator who, like him, escaped with their life from the collapse of the ascension passage.</p><p></p><p>Xuantian Wang was naturally full of vigilance towards the arrival of this equally matched opponent.</p><p></p><p>But the other party stated that they just happened to pass by. They would stay for a while and leave soon.</p><p></p><p>If the two half-immortals were to fight, it would inevitably cause irreparable damage to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After much deliberation, Xuantian Wang ultimately did not take action.</p><p></p><p>He never thought that this would lay the groundwork for future troubles.</p><p></p><p>When the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation captured a new world again, Xuantian Wang personally led the expedition, leaving a gap.</p><p></p><p>That existence who called himself the Great Master of Tiandu actually lured many native cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm into his Dao arena.</p><p></p><p>He passed down many techniques, secret arts, and divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Upon his victorious return, Xuantian Wang instantly understood the other party's intentions.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use these cultivators to shake the rule of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Fanning the flames and instigating the cultivators to rebel. Then, when both sides were injured, he would reap the benefits.</p><p></p><p>And his ultimate goal was the immortal spirit energy in Xuantian Wang's body.</p><p></p><p>How could Xuantian Wang let him have his way?</p><p></p><p>He immediately rushed into Tiandu and directly confronted the Great Master of Tiandu.</p><p></p><p>Although he suffered some minor injuries, the other party's injuries were definitely much more severe. From then on, he behaved himself.</p><p></p><p>However, the other party refused to leave, and Xuantian Wang had no good solution.</p><p></p><p>Fearing that the other party might take desperate measures, Xuantian Wang simply ignored him.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he also gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the immortal spirit energy seized from the other party, he might be able to directly reshape his true immortal body in the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, infusing it with true immortal power could greatly reduce the resources needed to activate the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm would then be able to quickly escape the crisis.</p><p></p><p>But Xuantian Wang still underestimated the despicableness of some cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps he underestimated the Great Master of Tiandu's ability to bewitch people's minds.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators who had entered Tiandu back then, at the critical moment when everything was about to develop in the best direction.</p><p></p><p>They united and launched a surprise attack on the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the history of the Xuanhuang Realm completely took a different trajectory.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Recalling the past events, the youth's expression became dazed.</p><p></p><p>He looked up, as if he could see that terrifying existence that attracted and devoured everything.</p>

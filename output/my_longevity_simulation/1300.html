        <h1>Chapter 1300</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sun Qi raised his hand, trying to touch the sky.</p><p></p><p>Without deliberately manipulating to absorb, the surrounding spiritual energy rushed into his body eagerly.</p><p></p><p>This feeling...</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi hadn't experienced it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>As if the towering trees pressing on his body were pushed down, Sun Qi felt an unprecedented sense of ease.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>After being dazed for a moment, a hint of ferocity gradually appeared in Sun Qi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, what family, what relatives, they are all burdens!"</p><p></p><p>"Reversing the universe, the universe reversing, at the end of this path, is the one and only through the ages!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sun family! The Sun family is me!"</p><p></p><p>"A family's prosperity, all belongs to one person..."</p><p></p><p>Living under the shadow of the family in the first half of his life, now by a strange coincidence, all his relatives have died. However, Sun Qi did not feel much sadness, but instead felt an unprecedented sense of exhilaration that he had never had in his life.</p><p></p><p>He even vaguely realized that with the death of the other bloodlines of the Sun family, the overall luck of the Sun family did not directly dissipate and disappear. Instead, it slowly gathered towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Give me ten years, no, five years, not only can I restore my skills, I may even be able to achieve the realm of uniting with the Dao..." The beautiful future predicted by a strong intuition made Sun Qi's body tremble with excitement. It even made him want to laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>But another silver-white arrow whistling overhead made his face instantly turn pale and he shuddered.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerated above! Could it really be cultivators from outside the Primordial Yellow Realm attacking..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi shrank his head and looked at the white fog barrier not far away, then gritted his teeth and actively accelerated his absorption of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in this Tianling Prefecture. I have to leave quickly..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that those burdens were all taken away by the tentacles, I still have to rely on myself to cross the white fog barrier."</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi, who was re-cultivating after scattering his cultivation, progressed extremely quickly. In just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, he returned to the peak of Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>More and more bandits were flying in the sky, and Sun Qi became more and more anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I can manipulate flying magic tools, I'll go to a safe place first."</p><p></p><p>"Crossing just one prefecture barrier won't reduce my lifespan by much."</p><p></p><p>"After returning to Foundation Establishment, I can observe my future luck again. But I can't wait now..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi made up his mind, and a layer of transparent spherical shield wrapped around him, flying straight into the white fog.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to reach Shanteng Prefecture, Sun Qi was horrified to find that there seemed to be some figures vaguely in the white fog ahead.</p><p></p><p>Terrified, he immediately manipulated the magic tool to stop flying.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it!"</p><p></p><p>A furious shout, accompanied by colorful spell attacks, flew out from the white fog and all bombarded Sun Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Target eliminated, alert lifted!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Yongchen, the squad leader of the Third Army Corps of the Great Qi who was on guard duty, checked and then reported.</p><p></p><p>"Only at Qi Refining stage, probably an Immortal Alliance cultivator who was in a panic and wanted to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Unlucky, I thought it would be a big fish!"</p><p></p><p>"He's also an unlucky fellow, actually rushing into our alert zone..."</p><p></p><p>"Stop chatting, hurry up and sweep this area clean!" Cai Yongchen snorted coldly, interrupting the idle chatter of his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly sneezed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if something from that Immortal Alliance cultivator who was bombarded to death without a complete corpse had remained and entered his body.</p><p></p><p>Cai Yongchen's mind trembled, but after careful inspection, he found no abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>However, his professionalism as a Great Qi army squad leader did not allow him to directly ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he very seriously reported the origin of the matter and his own feelings in detail through the Sacred Emperor Network.</p><p></p><p>Only after submitting the report did he breathe a sigh of relief and continue to lead his subordinates to carry out the cleanup mission.</p><p></p><p>In Erlang Shen's sea of consciousness, incident reports like this appeared incessantly. It even included the number of sacred army puppets and patrolling arrows consumed on the battlefield, the injured and killed Great Qi soldiers, and even the list of Myriad Immortal Alliance forces that had been captured alive or surrendered...</p><p></p><p>As well as the list of newly produced materials in the Great Qi territory of the Sacred Dynasty's rear.</p><p></p><p>Sets of huge real-time changing data kept flashing.</p><p></p><p>And based on this, the scene of the war situation deduced inside the Dao-forming stone emitting a faint blue light in Erlang Shen's sea of consciousness also underwent corresponding changes.</p><p></p><p>Although there was some resistance in each prefecture of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, the vast majority of the Immortal Alliance's territory had completely fallen into the hands of the Sacred Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly City Dharma Image was suppressed by the Sacred Emperor's Talisman, and new suppression and connection formations were quickly established.</p><p></p><p>"In the deduction, the Sacred Dynasty's winning rate on the outer battlefield is getting higher and higher."</p><p></p><p>"When the situation gradually stabilizes, we can focus on those hard bones."</p><p></p><p>"At present, the number of Immortal Alliance Dao-Uniting cultivators who have appeared on the outer battlefield is thirty-four. There are about a hundred more who should have appeared but never did..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this huge number, Erlang Shen couldn't help feeling a sense of heaviness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Alliance had the patrolling arrows as a great weapon, the Dao-Uniting cultivators were not just living targets who would stand still and let you bombard them.</p><p></p><p>Great Qi soldiers were needed to contain them.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the previous Rainbow Light Leaving the Boundary plan took away a large number of veteran Dao-Uniting cultivators from the Immortal Alliance. Otherwise, this battle would be even more difficult."</p><p></p><p>Erlang Shen looked at the miniature map of the Immortal Alliance in front of him.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the yellow and purple colors used to identify the contested territories of both sides, there was also a unique gray color that indiscriminately invaded all areas.</p><p></p><p>Slowly spreading out from Tianling Prefecture as the center.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the gray occupied, in the deduction of the Dao-forming stone, the Sacred Dynasty quickly resolved the battle with absolute advantage.</p><p></p><p>"Dao-One Insects..."</p><p></p><p>The scene of the Dao-Uniting cultivator of Shanteng Prefecture being captured alive by a team of Golden Core soldiers wearing sacred army armor appeared in front of Erlang Shen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The earth and heaven spirit summoned by the Immortal Alliance Dao-Uniting cultivator was the Crimson Vine.</p><p></p><p>After the Crimson Vine Heavenly City was conquered by the Sacred Dynasty soldiers, this Crimson Vine Immortal Lord arrived late.</p><p></p><p>Countless vine tendrils like fiery dragon pythons erupted in the world, growing wildly and wantonly. The vine branches carried unparalleled mighty power, sweeping crazily. They knocked down a large number of Sacred Dynasty soldiers from the air like swatting flies.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Vine took root in mid-air and multiplied on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had already covered the entire Shanteng Prefecture. The original continuous mountains and rivers had turned into a primitive jungle densely packed with vines.</p><p></p><p>The military power of three army corps of the Sacred Dynasty immediately fell into a bitter battle in the face of the ubiquitous crimson long vines, each with its own spirit.</p><p></p><p>Although they had puppet armor to protect their bodies, they could not withstand being entangled and constantly roasted and absorbed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if this Dao-Uniting cultivator of the Immortal Alliance was really going to single-handedly turn the tide and recapture Shanteng Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>However, the battle situation suddenly changed after a shadow inexplicably descended and enveloped the sky.</p><p></p><p>The originally vibrant crimson vines suddenly became weak in their attacks like frost-bitten eggplants.</p><p></p><p>Even the color of their own crimson flames inexplicably became a little dimmer.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the Sacred Dynasty soldiers, who were previously in a bitter struggle and exhausted, instantly had their fatigue disappear and became lively again after the gray arrived.</p><p></p><p>Their offensive even became more fierce than before!</p><p></p><p>Any casually launched attack would carry spiritual energy that tore open a hole in the previously seemingly indestructible Crimson Vine.</p><p></p><p>The wounds of the Crimson Vine did not heal as before, but instead grew larger and larger in the incessant battle.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some invisible existence was constantly gnawing at it!</p><p></p><p>The huge creature that occupied the entire prefecture's world was eventually reduced to only half the size of an adult.</p><p></p><p>It was captured alive by the Sacred Dynasty soldiers and locked in a specially made cage for imprisoning Immortal Alliance Dao-Uniting cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This cage could isolate the cultivators inside from connecting with the outside world, and force the power of the heaven and earth spirit in the Dao-Uniting cultivator's body into a state of hibernation.</p><p></p><p>Once imprisoned, the Dao-Uniting cultivators were as powerless as mortals and completely unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>After being captured, all the Immortal Alliance Dao-Uniting cultivators were sent to the Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi in the rear for unified imprisonment.</p><p></p><p>As the Dao-One Insects spread, the number of captured Dao-Uniting cultivators also kept climbing.</p><p></p><p>As the situation on the outer battlefield gradually stabilized, the pressure on Erlang Shen's shoulders eased a little.</p><p></p><p>Pressing his swollen forehead, Erlang Shen did not rest, but re-sorted the information gathered from the previous battlefield to prevent missing any details.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he noticed Cai Yongchen's report.</p><p></p><p>He did not think that Cai Yongchen's feeling at that time was an illusion. After pondering for a moment, Erlang Shen ordered someone to bring Cai Yongchen back from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After isolating him, a careful examination was conducted.</p><p></p><p>The result was the same, still nothing wrong was found.</p><p></p><p>But Erlang Shen still felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he finally reported the whole incident and his examination findings of Cai Yongchen to the Sacred Emperor through the Star Network.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, the Sacred Emperor had a reply.</p><p></p><p>"The abnormality in the body should be a wandering primordial qi."</p><p></p><p>"Primordial refers to heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Qi is the source of all things."</p><p></p><p>"It is a blessing, not a disaster, no need to worry. But this wandering primordial qi comes from a fallen cultivator. It may be accompanied by remnant thoughts of the previous self, so it is not suitable to stay on the battlefield now..."</p><p></p><p>Erlang Shen had a sudden realization after receiving the guidance from his master.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he sighed at the wonder of Cai Yongchen's opportunity. This primordial qi could be considered half a heavenly wonder. Although what Cai Yongchen absorbed was only a wandering part, it still had endless effects and could even directly combine with his own Dao foundation, bringing many wonders.</p><p></p><p>"You return to the Great Qi first and recuperate in the Sacred Heart Hall. After completely absorbing this primordial qi, then go back to the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>Erlang Shen explained the origin of the primordial qi to Cai Yongchen, then ordered.</p><p></p><p>"This lowly one hopes that when I return, the war will be over." Cai Yongchen bowed deeply and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Erlang Shen issued a personnel order to fill Cai Yongchen's position.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a small episode, it also showed the impact of efficient communication on the overall war situation.</p><p></p><p>Eliminate all possible hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation of small probabilities of winning ultimately secured the advantage.</p><p></p><p>Days passed, and only a single-digit number of prefectures on the outer battlefield were still in fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>The rest had all been taken by the Sacred Dynasty's army.</p><p></p><p>Erlang Shen was not in a hurry to order a total siege of the remaining Immortal Alliance territories.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he ordered each army corps to build and construct garrison bases on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the captured Immortal Alliance cultivators and materials were all transferred to the Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>In the years of war preparations, the Great Qi had long prepared ample space to accommodate and detain them.</p><p></p><p>Erlang Shen turned his gaze back to the four central prefectures of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"The real counterattack of the Myriad Immortal Alliance should be coming soon."</p><p></p><p>From the faint fluctuations coming from the sealed moonlight, Erlang Shen made such a judgment.</p><p></p><p>Tianquan Prefecture, moonlight border.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan looked at the rising green qi obscuring the moonlight, and a hint of joy flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although only eight days had passed in real time, countless deductions had been made inside the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a glimmer of hope to break the formation was found.</p><p></p><p>Since this formation was so supreme that it was difficult to comprehend, the idea of "breaking the formation" was simply abandoned.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the "Soulless Qi" was directly used to corrode the formation units.</p><p></p><p>The Soulless Qi could suppress all spiritual power fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Under its unceasing misty rising, it indeed took effect.</p><p></p><p>The originally silver thread-like moonlight gradually became shrouded in green smoke.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in the next moment, the formation would be</p><p></p><p>The bright moon in the sky once again shone down its radiant light.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it replenished the lost parts of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lu Xichan had anticipated this and ordered everyone to desperately resist, they were ultimately unable to prevent the moonlight from descending.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the formation restored to its original state, Lu Xichan's face turned ashen.</p><p></p><p>"Chief..." </p><p></p><p>The array masters under her command also turned pale upon seeing this, their eyes revealing despair.</p><p></p><p>"I will go request the Formation Breaking Discs," Lu Xichan said solemnly, admitting the fact that she had failed to break the formation.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a rainbow light, she vanished into the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Less than half a day later, Lu Xichan returned.</p><p></p><p>Behind her followed a cultivator wearing an ink-green Daoist robe, with a mirror-like mark engraved on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was indiscernible, and his gender unclear.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan were present, he would recognize at a glance that this was the unique attire and appearance of the Mirror Holders lineage of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>That Mirror Holder directly ignored all the formation-breaking cultivators present. He first raised his head to look at the silver moonlight enveloping the area and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He then made a slight bow towards the empty space.</p><p></p><p>The mirror mark on his forehead emitted rays of light. A white jade disc appeared in the center of the scene along with the illuminating light.</p><p></p><p>The white jade disc flew on its own, slowly approaching the moonlight pouring down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight distorted and was absorbed by the white jade disc.</p><p></p><p>On the flickering light and shadows erupting from the white jade disc, one could vaguely see countless diagrams of evolving formations.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Holder observed for a moment, slightly frowning.</p><p></p><p>He then released another white jade disc.</p><p></p><p>However, the effect still seemed unsatisfactory, so he directly released nine discs at once.</p><p></p><p>The nine discs revolved around each other, attracting the moonlight to the center.</p><p></p><p>The virtual images of the changing formations instantly sped up countless times.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Formation Breaking Discs are those? They're actually this powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, to think there would still be such a strange object in the world. If formations can be easily broken, then what use are we array masters?"</p><p></p><p>The array masters present discussed via voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan tightly stared at the changing patterns in the center of the discs, her brows still tightly knitted.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, it seems..."</p><p></p><p>That Mirror Holder nodded, looking at the formation in the sky with an even heavier air.</p><p></p><p>He then paused his movements, as if making a decision.</p><p></p><p>Flying to above everyone's heads, he made a strange posture. Then he prostrated towards the empty space in front.</p><p></p><p>Lightly kowtowing, the mark between his brows burst forth with light.</p><p></p><p>Then, the phantom image of an object quietly emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Holder kowtowed nineteen times.</p><p></p><p>Nineteen objects of various shapes also appeared in the scene.</p><p></p><p>There were round discs similar to the Formation Breaking Discs, but of different colors.</p><p></p><p>There were also white jade rulers and green jade slips...</p><p></p><p>The nineteen objects seemed to have spirituality as they flew to the outer perimeter of the nine Formation Breaking Discs.</p><p></p><p>They rotated rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The already somewhat illusory images became even more blurred during the rotation.</p><p></p><p>As a result, their shapes changed. They surprisingly became very similar to the Formation Breaking Discs in the inner ring!</p><p></p><p>And with the assistance of the outer Formation Breaking Discs, the deduction images in the center of the circular formation increased in flashing speed once again.</p><p></p><p>It was almost difficult for people to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, the Mirror Holder said, "In three days' time, a gap can be opened in this formation."</p><p></p><p>"We must take the opportunity to thoroughly resolve the trapping formation."</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Holder pointed to the bright moon overhead.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan lowered her head and said, "I will explain it to the Dharma Transmitting Venerables."</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Holder spoke no further, only single-mindedly guarding over the Formation Breaking Discs and the nineteen phantoms.</p><p></p><p>"How did another nineteen Formation Breaking Discs appear? The formation-breaking ability of a single disc is already terrifying. Nineteen of them stacked together..."</p><p></p><p>"I know! The Profound Cyan Mirror, the Heart Measuring Ruler, the Heaven and Earth Books... these are all secondary manifestations of the Profound Heavenly Treasures!"</p><p></p><p>These words stirred up a thousand waves, shocking the hearts of all the array masters present.</p><p></p><p>"Out of the nineteen, I only knew the Profound Heavenly Mirror had secondary manifestations, but I never imagined there would be so many!"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, after all, it's understandable that nineteen items have been nurtured over so many years. But I've never heard that they can transform into each other! Doesn't that mean each secondary manifestation can erupt with more than a dozen times its own power?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps sensing the discussions among her subordinates, Lu Xichan coldly swept her gaze and then transmitted her voice, "Don't just watch, discuss and study the parts of the formation decoded by the Formation Breaking Discs together."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think everything will be fine once the formation is broken, right? If we can't follow up and make up for it, watch as our Myriad Immortals Alliance's Formation Strategy Hall undergoes a complete change of personnel from top to bottom."</p><p></p><p>These words made the array masters break out in cold sweat. They all shifted their attention from the Profound Heavenly secondary manifestations to the flickering formation phantoms.</p><p></p><p>At the Sacred Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor's gaze penetrated the obstruction of the formation and fell upon the twenty-eight Profound Heavenly secondary manifestations, including the nine Formation Breaking Discs.</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Heavenly Mirror, giving birth to itself and branching into paths..."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor nodded thoughtfully and sincerely praised, "Even after falling into the mortal world, it has never given up on transcending again."</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Heavenly Mirror is indeed a supreme artifact that has been passed down since ancient times in the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor pressed down on the cat treasure who was slightly poking its head out with a curious look, seeming like it would jump up at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Stopped by the Sacred Emperor, the cat treasure was a little dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>It lightly bit the Sacred Emperor's finger, but after being blocked by a ball of golden origin power, the cat treasure finally gave up.</p><p></p><p>It lay back on Li Ping's shoulder to rest.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, great Sacred Emperor, the things below are all great treasures."</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Daoist, whose two eyes had completely entered the vortex passage, could still clearly see the objects in the Profound Yellow Realm below, clicking his tongue in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Each secondary manifestation is equivalent to a path replicated and separated from the Profound Heavenly Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Some of these paths are not even possessed by the Profound Heavenly Mirror itself, but are what the mirror has detected in observing this world over the years."</p><p></p><p>"If this old Daoist still had a human body, I would risk my life to snatch one. Using it as a foundation, it would be of great use even if I were to attain the Dao and ascend to immortality in the future!" The Peerless Daoist kept boasting, as if instigating the Sacred Emperor to take action and snatch them.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping was not moved at all.</p><p></p><p>"I can comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth in the Star Sea. Why would I need to rely on external objects?" Li Ping laughed lightly, directly rendering the Peerless Daoist speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sacred Emperor, are you just going to watch them break the formation?" After a moment of silence, the Peerless Daoist spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"If you send someone to harass them a bit, not to mention snatching some Profound Heavenly secondary manifestations, it would also be good to delay their formation-breaking time."</p><p></p><p>"Peerless, just do well with the matters I've instructed you." Li Ping looked at the Peerless Daoist calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Daoist laughed awkwardly a few times and said no more.</p><p></p><p>"This old man wasn't so talkative before. It seems the mirrors below are indeed of great use to him." Just then, Tian Yang, who had been silent, suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>The paper men of the Crossing Calamity Sect below slightly nodded, not denying it.</p><p></p><p>However, they kept their mouths shut about what specific use they had.</p><p></p><p>"You people from the Ten Sects are as annoying as ever." Tian Yang said softly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible wind swept through the great hall of the Sacred Emperor's Seat, instantly making the paper men of the Crossing Calamity Sect sway.</p><p></p><p>Even the mountain gate of the Crossing Calamity Sect showed signs of being blown.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Daoist waved his hand, and the paper men curled up into balls to resist the wind.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang snorted coldly and shifted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>The strong wind gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have indeed made considerable progress." The Sacred Emperor said with some delight.</p><p></p><p>"Recovering my senses, I have gained new understanding of my memories of my ancestors. And although my true body has died after sleeping in the earth veins for these years, the knowledge gained by my puppet body is still a treasure. The vicissitudes of time, the turning of years, all things in the world are like this..." Tian Yang's small body spoke words of extreme vicissitudes that were very uncharacteristic of him.</p><p></p><p>"By the way... take a look at this."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Tian Yang took out a set of child's bones.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Isn't this the remains of your body from when you were alive?" The Sacred Emperor recognized the origin of the bones at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Tian Yang's expression was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"I can vaguely sense that there is an extremely peculiar power on it. It comes from the obsession I had before abandoning my body back then."</p><p></p><p>"It's different from the current Dharma methods..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Tian Yang's words, the Sacred Emperor also became much more solemn.</p><p></p><p>At Tian Yang's indication, Li Ping took the bones and frowned as he comprehended.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he shook his head slightly and said truthfully, "I didn't sense the energy you mentioned."</p><p></p><p>A golden-red color instantly surged onto the surface of his skin.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang's body dissolved and disappeared into this abruptly appearing golden-red armor.</p><p></p><p>The golden-red armor split into several pieces and flew to the Sacred Emperor's side one after another.</p><p></p><p>They were put on in sequence.</p><p></p><p>They automatically changed according to the Sacred Emperor's body shape.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a puppet battle armor that seemed tailor-made for the Sacred Emperor was formed.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping his entire body, it exuded a majestic and sacred aura.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang's voice was transmitted from his mind: "Don't resist."</p><p></p><p>"Please, look at my life..."</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang, it's time to take your medicine!"</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes instantly appeared before the Sacred Emperor Li Ping's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was the events Tian Yang had experienced throughout his life.</p><p></p><p>However, with Tian Yang actively transmitting them at this moment, it was as if he had truly become Tian Yang himself and personally experienced it all.</p><p></p><p>Senior brothers and masters who had transformed into the Dao sacrificed themselves one by one on the battlefield to protect him.</p><p></p><p>The extremely realistic images and emotions deeply touched the heart of the Great Enlightenment Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang's life is not inferior to anyone!"</p><p></p><p>The cry from Tian Yang's heart also changed from virtual to real, truly resounding in Li Ping's ears.</p><p></p><p>Therefore...</p><p></p><p>The Great Enlightenment Sacred Emperor finally synchronized and sensed the very peculiar thread of energy from Tian Yang's remains.</p><p></p><p>It seemed incompatible with everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>Like a plum blossom in the snow, standing proudly alone.</p><p></p><p>Although it appeared quite weak, it had lasted for thousands of years without fading away with the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it became more vivid with the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>But an invisible existence severed this connection.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor felt a sense of loss in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, with his extraordinary state of mind, he quickly suppressed this anomaly.</p><p></p><p>He first used the cat treasure to probe and found that even it could not identify this peculiar energy. He then looked at the Crossing Calamity Sect below.</p><p></p><p>The paper men of the Crossing Calamity Sect seemed completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>They were still huddled together.</p><p></p><p>"Peerless, do you know anything?" The Sacred Emperor Li Ping wasn't certain, but he still asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Peerless Daoist actually retracted his protruding eyes from the passage.</p><p></p><p>The two eyeballs, with long paper strips attached, flew to the side of Tian Yang's remains.</p><p></p><p>They circled around several times.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the Peerless Daoist's expression, it seemed he had truly recognized something.</p><p></p><p>"This old Daoist merely has a guess."</p><p></p><p>"It can't be considered true."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor waved his hand: "But there's no harm in saying it."</p><p></p><p>As if afraid of being heard, the Peerless Daoist even turned his eyeballs to look outside the Sacred Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he say word by word, "Regarding that Heavenly Capital Great Dharma Master, our Crossing Calamity Sect has had a guess since ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dharma Master has already perished, and what transmits the immortal methods of the Ten Sects is just a thought he left behind after his demise."</p><p></p><p>"Carrying on the Great Dharma Master's dying wish to spread the Dao."</p><p></p><p>As the Peerless Daoist spoke these words, the paper men of the Crossing Calamity Sect huddled even tighter. It was as if some terrifying existence was about to approach them.</p><p></p><p>"The will to spread the Dao is neither a living being nor energy."</p><p></p><p>"It's more like..."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor said thoughtfully, "A resonance of the Great Dao."</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Daoist clapped his hands in praise, "The Sacred Emperor truly has great comprehension!"</p><p></p><p>"When the immortals perish, their Dao becomes empty. The immortal Dao is omnipresent. If there is anyone who can even slightly approach its essence, it will also create a resonance of the Dao."</p>

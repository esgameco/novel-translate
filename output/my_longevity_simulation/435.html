        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan did not rush and patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>After a long time passed, the person's face had a response, "Found it! There is something that is extremely suitable for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What is it?" Li Fan showed some excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Swallowing Heaven and Earth Technique!" the person's face said with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Swallowing Heaven and Earth?" Li Fan squinted his eyes, thought for a while, but couldn't find any related information in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the person's face did not intend to test Li Fan, and directly explained, "It is a technique left behind by a notorious ancient cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"This person forged a unique path, not absorbing spiritual qi from heaven and earth, but directly devouring spiritual veins and earth veins for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Although the progress is extremely fast, he did not control himself, recklessly causing exhaustion of spiritual energy in several states and drastic changes in mountains and rivers in a short period."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, he was discovered and met a fate of being skinned and bone stripped, soul scattered."</p><p></p><p>"However, his secret technique was preserved after being extracted through torture."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered and asked, "So what you mean is for me to use the Great Swallowing Heaven and Earth Technique to secretly absorb the spiritual veins and earth veins of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The face nodded, looking like a patient teacher, "The strongholds of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance are mostly built on earth veins."</p><p></p><p>"As the Guardian of Taian Island, as long as you are careful and only absorb a little each time, you surely won't be discovered."</p><p></p><p>"And this small amount of earth vein energy is already a significant supplement for you as a Building Foundation cultivator. Like this, I believe you can quickly advance to the Golden Core realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan exclaimed, "Leader, you are truly wise and brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>The face, however, didn't buy into Li Fan's act, coldly snorted, "Go and get the first day's test questions from He Zhenghao. Once the results are out and confirmed, we will proceed with the exchange that night."</p><p></p><p>"I will send someone specifically at that time. You just need to handle the handover."</p><p></p><p>"I will also make sure he brings you the Great Swallowing Heaven and Earth Technique." Li Fan was not surprised by the decision of the person's face.</p><p></p><p>After all, five million contributions were not a small amount. It was impossible to entrust a Building Foundation cultivator like him openly with such a dominant role.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan agreed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"You can go now," instructed the face.</p><p></p><p>"We've been meeting quite frequently recently, be careful on the road. Don't reveal any clues at critical moments."</p><p></p><p>"Leader, you can rest assured," Li Fan promised, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>After agreeing on the next contact location, the stone gradually lost its luster, turning into powder.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring the power of earth veins for cultivation..." Li Fan suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"If I can utilize this, the speed of my cultivation in this life may be faster than expected."</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of Zhou Qing'ang, Li Fan quietly flew back to Taian Island.</p><p></p><p>His clone was deeply hidden within the defensive array of Taian Island, not afraid of being discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>But to be safe, Li Fan still set up another array in a secluded room.</p><p></p><p>Then, he used the secret technique of "Concealing the Sky with One Hand" for further concealment.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, he took out a blank jade slip from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, flashes of blue light swirled, and all the previous exam questions from his past life were inscribed into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The recruitment examination of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance includes various subjects such as Politics, Law, Economics, Martial Arts, Devices, Formations, Alchemy, and Talismans.</p><p></p><p>Organized by the various local governing courts, with assistance from the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>All candidates must participate in exams for all subjects.</p><p></p><p>After a comprehensive assessment, a select group will be chosen and transferred to the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance or other important areas.</p><p></p><p>Next would be the allocation of positions based on their overall performance and personal aspirations.</p><p></p><p>The exams were not limited to simple question-and-answer formats; for example, in the Politics section, examinees would face real illusions similar to historical events.</p><p></p><p>They would be tested on their insights and loyalty through various trials and tribulations.</p><p></p><p>For skills like Devices, Formations, Alchemy, and Talismans, besides theoretical tests, candidates also need to demonstrate practical skills.</p><p></p><p>Although many cultivators participated in the recruitment exams, most were just accompanying participants, making the process time-consuming and strenuous.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators were enthusiastic, and the number of applicants increased with each session.</p><p></p><p>Overall, for those interested, the recruitment examination held once every ten years was a grand event.</p><p></p><p>After engraving the first day's questions and the remaining questions in two jade slips, Li Fan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan himself had no intention of participating in the exams.</p><p></p><p>For him, there were more convenient ways to enter the system of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, his main goal in this life was to ascend from the Five Elements Cave to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>"There is still one and a half months left, just wait attentively."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan continued practicing and meticulously pondered possible variables in the future, time slowly passed by.</p><p></p><p>During this period, to avoid any loopholes, Li Fan invited He Zhenghao to Taian Island several times.</p><p></p><p>They would discuss at length with the formation sealed, ensuring that nobody could eavesdrop.</p><p></p><p>Knowing He Zhenghao's temperament well, Li Fan naturally enjoyed their conversations.</p><p></p><p>After a few times, Li Fan had come to treat "Zhou Qing'ang" as a close friend.</p><p></p><p>During their conversations, He Zhenghao proudly mentioned that he had received guidance from an "ancient Heavenly Secrets School cultivator."</p><p></p><p>With a devoted effort, he had completely turned his life around, now on the verge of advancing to the Golden Core stage after cultivating the Nascent Soul technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, feigning extreme admiration, praised He Zhenghao repeatedly and implored him to remember himself if there were any opportunities for wealth in the future.</p><p></p><p>Unable to resist Li Fan's persuasion, He Zhenghao agreed readily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing He Zhenghao's acceptance, Li Fan displayed a contented smile.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, there were no other unusual occurrences in the calm and serene Tianyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Soon, just three days were left until the start of the recruitment exam.</p><p></p><p>After yet another discussion with He Zhenghao, Li Fan suddenly stood up, "It's time."</p><p></p><p>Silently, he flew towards the agreed meeting place with the stony face.</p><p></p><p>Following the same steps as before, he found the rendezvous point for this time's exchange.</p><p></p><p>After verification, the face suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go? Did you get the test questions?" The face's voice showed rare signs of nervousness and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, too, could not conceal his excitement.</p><p></p><p>He nodded, took out the jade slip with the first day's test questions, and placed it on the stone.</p><p></p><p>A yellow light enveloped the jade slip, making the image of the face blurry.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Great! Just wait here. Three days later, everything will be clear."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan's response, the face disappeared eagerly.</p><p></p><p>The yellow light dimmed, but this time the stone did not shatter.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the stone, his eyes full of profound meaning.</p>

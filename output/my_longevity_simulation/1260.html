            <p>Chapter 1257: Stone Mother Returns to the Stars</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's intention was very clear.</p><p></p><p>The war between the Holy Dynasty and the Myriad Immortals Alliance was imminent, and it was time for the Taiyi Sect to make their final stance.</p><p></p><p>When Sun Erlang found Yi Shu in the Holy Capital, he had already been prepared and waiting with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Sun, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang didn't hesitate. He cupped his hands in salute, and the two headed straight for the Taiyi Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, did you gain any unique insights during your time in our Holy Dynasty?" Sun Erlang asked probingly on the way back.</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu smiled slightly, "The state of the Holy Dynasty is different from the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and even more so from the Xuanhuang Realm over the past millions of years. We have also benefited greatly. At present, the sect has reached a consensus and has also gained the approval of the Stone Mother. When the time comes, you will know."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, you might have a chance to meet the Stone Mother this time," Yi Shu added.</p><p></p><p>His words stirred Sun Erlang's heart.</p><p></p><p>When he wanted to probe for more inside information, Yi Shu changed the subject and started talking about his recent experiences in the Great Qi.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Holy Dynasty are well-fed and clothed, so they have higher pursuits in the spiritual aspect. Although their cultivation levels are average, some of their thoughts are truly interesting. This time, I met a literati who wrote a fantasy novel. It describes what would happen in the Xuanhuang Realm if the Dharma Dissemination Celestial Venerable didn't exist..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was slightly startled. Yi Shu continued, "Unlike the simulated world you experienced, although the Dharma Dissemination Venerable doesn't appear in that novel, disasters still descend and the Xuanhuang Realm falls into chaos."</p><p></p><p>"Three Venerables rise from humble beginnings, gaining the momentum to sweep the world and stand against each other. One enlightens and nurtures the people as the 'Teacher of Heaven and Earth'. One, with the pure and noble character of a sage, makes those around him submit willingly and forms an unshakable alliance. This is the 'Supreme Sage of the Human Realm'. One, with boundless might, establishes an immortal dynasty on earth. Wherever his army points, all things submit. This is the 'Supreme Mysterious Immortal Emperor'..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Sun Erlang's expression became very subtle.</p><p></p><p>"The three Venerables fight fiercely for hundreds of years, making it hard to determine the victor. The details in between, deduced by individual effort, are a bit rough and can't be scrutinized carefully. But it's quite interesting and unique..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang couldn't help but ask, "So in the end, who won?"</p><p></p><p>"This 'Romance of the Three Divisions of Xuanhuang' hasn't been finished yet. The literati's doorstep was already blocked by a crowd of people. They all claimed that he was being disrespectful to the Holy Emperor and wanted to teach him a lesson. Although the Holy Dynasty officials didn't intervene, as the Supreme Mysterious Immortal Emperor made some mistakes in the 'Romance', the uproar grew even bigger and nearly led to bloodshed."</p><p></p><p>"That literati didn't dare to write anymore. The plot stagnated, and I also don't know who the final winner is," Yi Shu said with a smile that wasn't quite a smile.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang coughed lightly, "After I go back, I'll send those people away and let him write in peace. It's just a fantasy novel after all. How could the Holy Emperor not tolerate this?"</p><p></p><p>But Yi Shu hinted, "Although the Holy Emperor indeed wouldn't mind, the people of the Holy Dynasty might not necessarily think the same way."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang still wanted to argue, but they had already arrived within the Taiyi Sect's territory.</p><p></p><p>Inside the floating city within the crystal wall in the sky, Sun Erlang entered again. Unlike last time, all the cultivators he encountered on the way greeted Sun Erlang with smiles.</p><p></p><p>As if they were all very familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang knew that the Taiyi Sect shared information as a whole entity. But the feeling of the other party knowing him while he didn't know their details still made Sun Erlang feel a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the journey wasn't long. Soon, Sun Erlang arrived at the core of the Taiyi Sect and met Chen Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai was holding a scroll and reading it attentively.</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu didn't enter.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior." </p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang saluted, but Chen Tianhai remained unmoved as if he hadn't heard.</p><p></p><p>"We won't help each other."</p><p></p><p>This answer was quite unexpected to Sun Erlang, leaving him stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Even if they just pretended to show some support? Sitting on the fence and watching the tigers fight would indeed ensure temporary peace. But after everything settled down, they would definitely face the harshest reckoning.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the Taiyi Sect shouldn't make such an unwise move.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at Chen Tianhai in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Stone Mother's tens of thousands of deductions, all yielding nearly even results for the victor, the reason we made this decision..."</p><p></p><p>"Is more because we've decided to temporarily leave the Xuanhuang Realm," Chen Tianhai said, dropping a bombshell.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!" Sun Erlang was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the much-talked-about Empty Brilliance Rainbow recently?" Sun Erlang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes and no. In fact, the Taiyi Sect has long had plans to travel across the stars. It's just that the starry sea is perilous, so it has always been postponed indefinitely. However, that sword message that came across the starry sea before made us change our minds," Chen Tianhai said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"The sword message illuminated the Xuanhuang sky for seven days. During that time, we conducted a detailed analysis of it and made some small gains. Since the sword message could cross the starry sea, our Taiyi Sect can trace its origin and find the location where it was sent, following its trail all the way," Chen Tianhai said with full confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the starry sea, beneath the high walls, it's truly a place to yearn for," Chen Tianhai sighed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang also seemed to sense the same will from the entire Taiyi Sect.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that this matter could no longer be stopped, Sun Erlang's thoughts turned quickly, wanting to return as soon as possible to inform his master.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Sun, there's no need to rush. This parting, who knows when we'll meet again. Why not meet the Stone Mother?" Chen Tianhai looked at Sun Erlang and suggested.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.</p><p></p><p>The moment he agreed, the surrounding room scenery disappeared. It was as if he was in the starry sea, surrounded by darkness.</p><p></p><p>Only a brilliant blue light came from the depths of the darkness. It turned into a thin line, speeding through the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>The instant he saw this blue line, Sun Erlang had an epiphany in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This was the Dao-Transforming Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>The original Dao-Transforming Stone.</p><p></p><p>"I am not originally of the Xuanhuang Realm. By a coincidence, while traversing the starry sea, I arrived in this realm."</p><p></p><p>A voice appeared in Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't communicated through the five senses or spiritual awareness, but directly through the resonance between the Dao-Transforming Stone crystals in Sun Erlang's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Mother narrated on her own, "Where I came from can no longer be traced. But where I am going, there is an answer to that."</p><p></p><p>These words from the Dao-Transforming Stone Mother sent shockwaves through Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Going where? Stone Mother, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the starry sea, yet not beyond. Not just a</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's just a corner of the universe. If it weren't for the high walls blocking the way, I should have fled far away tens of thousands of years ago. Moreover, having been cut and divided before, I also lost the ability to traverse the starry sky. Helpless and resigned, so many years have passed in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of Sun Erlang suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The blue thin line that was originally flying straight through the starry sea unexpectedly changed direction for some reason and fell towards Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Discovered by cultivators in the Xuanhuang realm, the Taiyan Sect gained its help and leaped to become a famous sect in the world.</p><p></p><p>What was originally cut apart has no reason to be restored.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Xuanhuang realm underwent drastic changes in heaven and earth, and catastrophe descended. In order to resist the calamity that cannot be cultivated together, the Taiyan Sect cultivators took the initiative to merge with the Huadao Stone.</p><p></p><p>Information is indestructible, and the Dao of Transformation reappears.</p><p></p><p>After tens of thousands of years of separations and reunions, the Huadao Stone has once again become the way it was when it first arrived in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The rapidly changing scenes made Sun Erlang's mind tremble.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "Senior has been in the Xuanhuang realm for so long and is almost omniscient. As long as you stay in Xuanhuang, it's not a false statement to say that you will remain unharmed through all tribulations. Why do you insist on leaving? Outside the starry sea, there are too many variables and unknowns. Even for a senior like you, I'm afraid there is no absolute guarantee of survival, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Why must we go? The answer to this question is the same as why you cultivators must cultivate."</p><p></p><p>The words from the Stone Mother left Sun Erlang speechless.</p><p></p><p>"The high walls block the starry sea. But there are some things that it cannot stop." The tone of the Huadao Stone Mother was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>A little perplexed, yet with an inexplicable confidence from an unknown source.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, don't think too much. I'm just planning to go take a look. If we really can't cross the high wall, it's very likely we will return again. As for the reason I wanted to see you this time..."</p><p></p><p>The illusory blue line in front of Sun Erlang's eyes suddenly became like a real object, fiercely shooting towards Sun Erlang's head.</p><p></p><p>Without time to react at all, Sun Erlang was hit by the blue beam.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, no need to be nervous. It's just leaving a mark, in case we want to return in the future and can't find the way back."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we won't treat you unfairly either. Concentrate..."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Mother's words were accompanied by the flashing of the Huadao Stone at the same frequency. In Sun Erlang's perception, countless scenes came flooding in, almost completely inundating his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He quickly concentrated his mind and slowed down the reception of the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Among the vast number of scenes, some showed the Holy Dynasty falling into a bitter battle with heavy casualties. Others showed the Holy Dynasty winning successive victories, with the Wanxian Alliance barely surviving in the four central provinces. But without exception, they were all things that had not yet happened in the real world.</p><p></p><p>"These are all the products of my extrapolation, so I'll give them to you as a reference."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart relaxed, and he quickly thanked the Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>"But I must warn you, little one, not to believe too much in these extrapolations."</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanhuang realm is like a bottomless pond. If the wind is calm and the waves are still, every ripple on the surface of the pond can be extrapolated. But if the fierce creatures at the bottom of the pond all emerge and stir things up..."</p><p></p><p>"The extrapolation of the ripples will necessarily be vastly different from reality. Your master surely knows this principle."</p><p></p><p>"So in fact, with or without our Taiyan Sect, it won't change much."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Huadao Stone Mother was still echoing in his ears, but when Sun Erlang came back to his senses, he had already appeared outside the Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The crystal wall that was originally not very obvious was now shrouded in a layer of mysterious blue light.</p><p></p><p>The entire Taiyan Sect became more and more transparent, as if it would completely disappear from this world at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Little Lang Jun, you must live well."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, our Taiyan Sect won't be able to find the way home." Yi Shu's words, half-joking and half-serious, came through.</p><p></p><p>It also seemed like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, the floating celestial city before his eyes had already completely disappeared from Sun Erlang's perception.</p><p></p><p>"Leaving as soon as they say they're leaving, it's too fast."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang muttered to himself, but there was a sense of loss in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After standing there for a long time, he finally returned and reported the details of the incident to his master.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the faceless Holy Emperor sitting silently above, Sun Erlang couldn't help feeling a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Emperor's next words made him a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What mark, it's just the Stone Mother's teasing. The Huadao God Stone is an unparalleled treasure. That rainbow light sword message, even I couldn't comprehend it for a while, but she had already deciphered it in a short time..."</p><p></p><p>"Master, then what exactly..." Sun Erlang was a little puzzled, "The profound feeling brought by the collision of the blue thin line with the Huadao Stone in my sea of consciousness is indeed real."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor smiled, which was very rare.</p><p></p><p>"It's your fortune, kid."</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, all the Huadao Stones in the world are nothing more than fragments separated from the Stone Mother's body. Although cultivators can use the first method of the Huadao God to make them their own, fragments are ultimately fragments. Even the most top-grade Huadao Stone is ultimately incomparable to the Stone Mother. But the blue radiation that the Stone Mother used on you is like turning stone into gold..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's tone was a little strange: "Although the quality is currently only top-grade, it has been enlightened and has unlimited possibilities in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Given time, it might even become a second Stone Mother."</p><p></p><p>"This..." Sun Erlang was stunned, not expecting the other party to leave such a great opportunity for him after leaving.</p><p></p><p>"No need to think too much. Everyone has their own fortune, perhaps the Stone Mother just found you more pleasing to the eye." The Holy Emperor said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Although Sun Erlang responded as such, judging from his expression, he obviously hadn't been able to adapt to it for a while.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Master, the tens of thousands of results extrapolated by the Stone Mother..."</p><p></p><p>"After you calm down, analyze and report them."</p><p></p><p>"I will follow the master's orders."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was a little dazed as he left the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he arrived at the place where the literatus who wrote "The Romance of the Three Divisions of Xuanhuang", as Yi Shu had mentioned before, was located.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that there were still many people gathered at the door of the house.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't do anything excessive, they stared at the exit with a tiger-like gaze.</p><p></p><p>As if the literatus inside had an irreconcilable hatred with them.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Sun Erlang, their faces lit up with joy, and they couldn't wait to come forward, wanting to tell about the literatus's viciousness.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Erlang interrupted them with a slight frown.</p><p></p><p>The crowd dispersed tactfully.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang strode into the house.</p><p></p><p>The literatus was dead drunk. Sun Erlang picked up the manuscript on the table and started reading.</p>

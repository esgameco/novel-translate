        <h1>Chapter 514</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Inside the gate was a plain white scene, and the disciples of the sect all had faces full of sorrow. </p><p></p><p>Upon hurriedly inquiring, they finally found out what had happened. </p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Great Dao Sect, the strong Longevity Realm expert Fang Dingge, had fallen. </p><p></p><p>As the two were shaken to their core, endless doubts arose.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Lord was already the strongest in this realm. And Fang Dingge, as one of the ten elders of the Immortal Dao, was unrivaled in his understanding of the world and his profound cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Even among the Longevity Lord, he was one of the best.</p><p></p><p>How could a person of this caliber fall just like that?</p><p></p><p>But as their understanding deepened, they felt more and more absurdity and strangeness in this.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the cause of Fang Dinggeâ€™s death a mystery, but even his corpse was nowhere to be found. </p><p></p><p>Instead of saying he fell, it felt more like...</p><p></p><p>he disappeared. </p><p></p><p>But the shattered pieces of his life lamp left within the gate were ironclad evidence that this Longevity Realm expert had passed away. </p><p></p><p>No matter how many doubts and grievances they had, they could not change this fact. </p><p></p><p>In fact, the announcement of the Sect Master's death to the public was only decided after intense discussion among the elders of the sect. </p><p></p><p>Such a major event could not be hidden even if they wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Because the fallen Longevity Realm experts were not limited to just Fang Dingge of the Great Dao Sect. </p><p></p><p>The Tai Shang Sect, Heaven Sword Sect, Crossing Calamity Sect, and Beast Control Sect...</p><p></p><p>It was said that Longevity Realm experts had fallen in all these sects. </p><p></p><p>This news was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>Although the top ten Immortal Sects strictly controlled the information, they could not stop its rapid spread.</p><p></p><p>With so many Longevity Realm experts falling together.</p><p></p><p>Who could have done it?</p><p></p><p>At the first moment, Li Fan and Senior Sister Zhao immediately thought of that person who had passed down the laws.</p><p></p><p>Because those fallen Longevity Lords were precisely the ones who, more than twenty years ago, agreed to unite and assassinate those individuals who passed on the laws.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had suddenly perished, making the Law Passing Immortal Lord of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance the prime suspect.</p><p></p><p>But logically, it did not make sense.</p><p></p><p>The Law Passing had not reached the Longevity Realm yet. If he truly had the power to defeat even the Longevity Lord with his combined techniques, he would have seized the opportunity long ago, rallying all cultivators to overthrow the existence of the ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>But from start to finish, this Law Passing Immortal Lord only appeared briefly when passing on the laws at the beginning and in a few rare instances.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the time, he was nowhere to be found, mysterious to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, after assassinating the Longevity Lords of the ten Immortal Sects, he was seriously injured and had to go into hiding?</p><p></p><p>Even so, he could have reported his heroic deed to the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance to boost morale.</p><p></p><p>But according to Li Fan's knowledge, even the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was shocked by the simultaneous fall of the Longevity Lords.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they were also unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>This incident, from beginning to end, revealed a sense of mystery and absurdity.</p><p></p><p>After learning about the news, Li Fan and Senior Sister Zhao were at a loss for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Realm they had been tirelessly seeking was actually so fragile? They would fall just like that?</p><p></p><p>What was the difference between them and ordinary cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Did their cultivation still hold any meaning?</p><p></p><p>In endless bewilderment, the two of them cultivated together for several days before finally calming down.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is definitely not as simple as it seems. Rather than falling, I more believe that they have broken free from their shackles and transcended boundaries," Senior Sister Zhao said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Shackles?" This was the first time Li Fan had heard of this and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Long ago, Master mentioned it to me casually," Senior Sister Zhao frowned slightly, as if trying hard to remember. </p><p></p><p>"At that time, I asked Master, what is true freedom? To achieve Longevity and be called free? Master remained silent for a long time before sighing and saying, 'Heaven chains all living beings, no one can escape. Even Longevity Realm experts are still imprisoned. When the ten Immortal Sects overthrew the Xuantian Sect, they did not completely overthrow it.' When I wanted to ask more, he refused to say further."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was deeply moved by this, "Longevity Realm experts are still not free?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing her lover lost in thought, Senior Sister Zhao comforted, "Their simultaneous disappearance this time may be a good thing. At least it indicates that Longevity Realm experts have the potential to break free from their shackles and truly transcend."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Li Fan nodded, "Senior Sister, when the time comes, let's cultivate together and break through boundaries. From now on, we will transcend together, free and easy, and leave behind a beautiful story in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>A blush spread across Senior Sister Zhao's face.</p><p></p><p>As their feelings deepened, the two began to cultivate together again.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the Longevity Lords had a profound impact on the current situation in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the funeral arrangements were completed, the Great Dao Sect was once again embroiled in the turmoil of vying for the position of Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The incident had happened suddenly, and perhaps even Fang Dingge himself had not anticipated his sudden disappearance. Therefore, the next successor as Sect Master had not been decided.</p><p></p><p>Also, Fang Dingge's direct disciple, who had only achieved the Nascent Divinity cultivation level, how could they shoulder the heavy responsibility of Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>As the two remaining Longevity Realm seniors within the sect both expressed their reluctance to inherit the position of Sect Master, the various elders below began to eye the position eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the conflict became inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao's Master, Zhang Wangshuang, had already broken through to the Combined Path realm in recent years. Naturally, he also harbored ambitions to become the next Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The struggle for power is often cruel.</p><p></p><p>A year later, the dust settled.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Wangshuang, due to lacking a bit of foundation within the sect, regrettably lost.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master position of the Great Dao Sect was succeeded by Ji Changxi, from the Tianchen lineage.</p><p></p><p>The internal strife within the sect, though not reaching the point of life-or-death battles, inevitably led to some damage.</p><p></p><p>After taking over as Sect Master, Ji Changxi did not initiate any major reforms. Instead, he focused on recuperating and rebuilding strength.</p><p></p><p>To address the gradual decline of the disciples within the sect, he specifically ordered to loosen the requirements for the promotion of outer disciples. And every three years, an internal grand competition would be held, with the merits in nurturing disciples also being an important evaluation criterion.</p><p></p><p>In such circumstances, Senior Sister Zhao, who repeatedly won in the grand competition, gradually became the most shining pearl among the younger disciples of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Li Fan, who won less and lost more, appeared somewhat diluted among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The most beautiful pearl deserved only the strongest hero. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mediocre performance and always trailing behind Senior Sister Zhao naturally made some of the disciples within the sect very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Many outstanding individuals ignored Li Fan's existence and launched fierce pursuits of Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhang Wangshuang, who had a relatively decent attitude towards Li Fan, gradually changed.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the crisis, Li Fan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>On a bright sunny afternoon, he proposed to Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>There were no celestial treasures or peerless artifacts.</p><p></p><p>He just gazed affectionately at her and said, "Senior Sister, be my dao companion. From now on, let's hold hands and seek longevity together."</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Senior Sister Zhao agreed.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

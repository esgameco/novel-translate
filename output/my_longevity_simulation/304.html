        <h1>Chapter 304</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>And like an ulcer attached to the bone, it was difficult to remove.</p><p></p><p>Even though Zhang Zhiliang continuously activated formations to shift the positions of the Five Immortal Lords, it only slightly delayed the burning speed of the crimson flames.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, attack is the best defense!" The voice of Immortal Lord Hongxi rang out.</p><p></p><p>With that said, an inverted mountain pressed down towards the Crimson Flame.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was as thin as a needle, yet seemed to weigh billions of tons. </p><p></p><p>The flames around the Crimson Flame kept jumping, as if blown by a strong wind.</p><p></p><p>Its body involuntarily sank downwards.</p><p></p><p>A shockwave burst out from where the two sides made contact, sweeping and spreading in all directions, stirring up huge waves that continuously expanded outwards from the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>Passing by the myriad immortal islands below, it even caused the Seven-Colored Falling Immortal Formation to sway slightly.</p><p></p><p>Under the inverted mountain, the fire flashed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to disappear for an instant, attempting to use the same trick and change position.</p><p></p><p>However, unexpectedly, in the next second, it was forced to reappear in its original position in a somewhat sorry state.</p><p></p><p>In the surrounding space, one could vaguely see the images of countless mountain ranges rising and falling.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame seemed to be trapped in a cage formed by the mountains, unable to move!</p><p></p><p>It lowered its head slightly, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Next, everyone saw that the flames originally jumping non-stop on its body suddenly became still.</p><p></p><p>Then they fiercely contracted towards the center.</p><p></p><p>Before anyone could react, the Crimson Flame had already transformed from a human form into a pure crimson flame.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling, scorching, filled with destructive power.</p><p></p><p>Even the mountain ranges trapping it began to melt and collapse due to the extremely high temperature.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Crimson Flame was about to break free, attacks from the other Immortal Lords suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>"The Lancang River flows endlessly, never ceasing!"</p><p></p><p>A silver thread descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Like a swimming dragon, it fiercely collided with the flames.</p><p></p><p>Although the river water evaporated in an instant, the Lancang River seemed to be inexhaustible, never stopping, causing the speed at which the flames broke free to slow down by half.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" A childish voice, yet filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the vast river water, a black and red figure flashed, appearing silently beside the Crimson Flame.</p><p></p><p>Without any trace of life aura, even with the Crimson Flame's perception, it was only when he approached that it suddenly discovered him.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang?" Li Fan was naturally familiar with this black and red puppet.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the towering giant he had seen before, the current Tianyang puppet had returned to human size.</p><p></p><p>Even Tianyang's voice was no longer mechanical like before, but no different from a human's.</p><p></p><p>Under the scorching temperature of the terrifying crimson flames, any approaching object would melt.</p><p></p><p>Even the Nascent Soul realm Tianyang puppet was no exception.</p><p></p><p>Its exterior seemed to melt like snow under the sun.</p><p></p><p>But the destruction of its body didn't seem to affect Tianyang's combat power at all.</p><p></p><p>Even when its solid form completely disintegrated, thoroughly becoming a boiling, viscous black and red liquid...</p><p></p><p>Tianyang instead fully unleashed its power.</p><p></p><p>"In life, Tianyang..."</p><p></p><p>"Is inferior to none!"</p><p></p><p>The viscous substance kept surging, like water yet also like fire.</p><p></p><p>It coiled around the crimson flames, refusing to retreat in the slightest no matter how much it was scorched, intending to pollute it with its own body.</p><p></p><p>The crimson flames were forced to shrink by another fraction.</p><p></p><p>As the Crimson Flame was focused fired upon, the power of the flames that had been continuously burning along with the Immortal Lords also diminished quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>So their attacks became increasingly fierce.</p><p></p><p>Under the joint assault of the five Nascent Soul Immortal Lords, the Crimson Flame kept compressing itself.</p><p></p><p>Victory seemed to be in sight.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>After compressing to the extreme, the flames were no more.</p><p></p><p>There was only a red particle emitting a dazzling radiance that made it impossible to look at directly, surrounded by the Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>At a speed surpassing the perception of all the cultivators present, it drew a crimson line that folded back several times in the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the black and red viscous body, it punched a large hole in Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>The matter at the center completely evaporated. The surrounding viscous substance churned, trying to heal, but was suppressed by the residual high temperature and unable to recover.</p><p></p><p>The Lancang River water and the inverted mountain were also split in two by the crimson line in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The river dried up and the mountain collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Two muffled grunts sounded simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Lord Haoxuan fired silver arrows in succession, but the silver light couldn't match the leaping speed of the crimson line.</p><p></p><p>Instead, while pursuing, they were assimilated by it, turning into crimson flames and shooting out again in different directions.</p><p></p><p>The crimson line kept folding back and forth in the sky, freely traversing.</p><p></p><p>Everything that obstructed it was evaporated by its destructive power.</p><p></p><p>Silver light kept flashing, that was Zhang Zhiliang helping the Immortal Lords shift positions to defend against the Crimson Flame's attacks.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the disadvantage of the Immortal Lords kept expanding.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Zhiliang finally made a move again.</p><p></p><p>One, two...</p><p></p><p>Thousands, tens of thousands...</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, countless silver cubes suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>They completely sealed off the space where the Crimson Flame and the five Immortal Lords were battling.</p><p></p><p>They looked chaotic and disorderly, but Li Fan could see that these formations, vast as the stars, had both real and illusory parts, and were forming a certain formation.</p><p></p><p>"Gather spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>A portion of the formations in the sky, following Zhang Zhiliang's voice, simultaneously released a silver light.</p><p></p><p>An ultra-large scale spiritual energy gathering formation composed of countless small spiritual energy gathering formations suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Congyu Sea suddenly whipped up a strong wind, stirring up towering waves.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy madly surged towards the sealed area of the formations, absorbed by the injured Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Icy cold!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang made another move.</p><p></p><p>Another portion of the formations lit up at his call.</p><p></p><p>The temperature in the sky plummeted, and ice crystals condensed in the air.</p><p></p><p>As if even the air was frozen.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the crimson line's movement involuntarily slowed.</p><p></p><p>"Delay!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless silver-white threads shot out from the formations, entangling the crimson line.</p><p></p><p>"Life and death!"</p><p></p><p>"Annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One formation after another was activated under the joint attack of the countless formations.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame's power was suppressed, while the Immortal Lords' power was enhanced.</p><p></p><p>With one side waning and the other waxing, the battle gradually trended towards an equilibrium.</p><p></p><p>The shackles formed by the sun and stars in the sky cut off the Crimson Flame's connection with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>While the five Nascent Soul Immortal Lords could freely absorb the spiritual energy in the Congyu Sea to replenish themselves.</p><p></p><p>Although the Crimson Flame in this world was much stronger than the previous simple furnace worker, if this continued, its defeat would only be a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan thought the battle would still proceed in the direction of a battle of attrition, the situation changed again.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that it was about to fall into an unfavorable position, the Crimson Flame transformed back from a scorching luminous particle into human form.</p><p></p><p>"What is it trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Not only Li Fan, but all the cultivators present were a bit puzzled by this scene.</p><p></p><p>However, the Nascent Soul Immortal Lords in the midst of the battle all felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that in an instant, one after another weapon phantoms completely constructed from flames appeared beside the Crimson Flame.</p><p></p><p>Swords, spears, sabers, halberds, axes, hooks...</p><p></p><p>Then, beside each weapon, a Crimson Flame shockingly appeared!</p><p></p><p>In the sky and on the ground, everything fell into an eerie stillness in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A total of eighteen Crimson Flames attacked the five Immortal Lords respectively.</p><p></p><p>There was an uproar on the myriad immortal islands.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a splitting technique?"</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Lords are already having such a hard time dealing with one Crimson Flame. Now eighteen have suddenly appeared... how can they fight? Isn't this a situation of certain defeat?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't think so. These clones still have a certain gap from the Crimson Flame's main body."</p><p></p><p>"But it makes up for it with sheer numbers! And look, the weapons used by the Crimson Flame are not for show either. Each move is fatal, and its offensive power seems to be much stronger than before."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions of the crowd, some cultivators already had a vague feeling that things were taking a bad turn.</p><p></p><p>They tried to leave through the transmission formations, but were horrified to find that all the transmission formations had lost their effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>Panic then spread on a small scale on the island. Some cultivators rode on escape lights, wanting to fly out of the Congyu Sea alone.</p><p></p><p>But even more cultivators still believed that the Immortal Lords of the Myriad Immortal Alliance would not be defeated.</p><p></p><p>They focused their attention on watching this world-shocking battle.</p><p></p><p>At first, faced with the eighteen Crimson Flame clones that suddenly appeared...</p><p></p><p>The five Nascent Soul realm experts were indeed caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Each of them suffered heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>But after all, with Nascent Soul cultivation, they wouldn't be instantly killed by the Crimson Flame after it split.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhang Zhiliang's powerful support, they all slowly recovered.</p><p></p><p>However, they were still being suppressed by the numerous Crimson Flame clones.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, now is not the time to hold back!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of Immortal Lord Hongxi rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Go all out! As for who can eventually achieve Dao-Integration, it all depends on individual fate!"</p><p></p><p>"I agree! This old man will take the lead and make a fool of himself!" The heroic laughter of Immortal Lord Haoxuan resounded through the world.</p><p></p><p>With a furious shout, eighteen silver arrows appeared on the Crimson Flames' bodies without any shooting motion.</p><p></p><p>They all pierced through their chests!</p><p></p><p>"The water of Lancang River falls from the Ninth Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, the river water fell from afar.</p><p></p><p>When it landed in the mortal world, it split into eighteen.</p><p></p><p>Like eighteen silver giant dragons, they entangled with the Crimson Flame clones.</p><p></p><p>"Creak..."</p><p></p><p>One after another, small mountain peaks the size of an ordinary person's finger fell on the heads of the Crimson Flames.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying sound, as if even space was being crushed, rang out.</p><p></p><p>A very obvious dent was pressed into the heads of the Crimson Flames.</p><p></p><p>And as the mountain peaks continued to descend, the rest of their bodies were also about to be crushed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>The black and red viscous substance suddenly expanded, ferocious to the extreme, also transforming into eighteen bizarre beasts, tearing at the Crimson Flames.</p><p></p><p>The situation changed again, and the battle suddenly became even more intense.</p><p></p><p>The aftermath of the clash kept sweeping over the Congyu Sea below, stirring up sky-high waves.</p><p></p><p>Even the myriad immortal islands seemed to be shaking non-stop, as if experiencing an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>Splitting into eighteen also seemed to be a huge consumption for the Crimson Flame.</p><p></p><p>The color on its body visibly dimmed a little.</p><p></p><p>And with Zhang Zhiliang as a super supply station, the consumption of the Nascent Soul Immortal Lords was much smaller.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the situation began to tilt in favor of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The sun rose and the moon set. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed in this battle.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame suffered great losses, and the eighteen clones merged back into one.</p><p></p><p>Flames still danced on its body, but compared to before, its might had been greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's voice, filled with killing intent, rang out again.</p><p></p><p>As if coordinating with Tianyang's attack, in an instant, the water of Lancang River, silver arrows, inverted mountains, stars of the Milky Way, all fiercely erupted at once.</p><p></p><p>"Why isn't Zhang Zhiliang making a move yet?"</p><p></p><p>"And Ye Feipeng..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this battle to exterminate the world's spirit was about to come to an end, yet these two still hadn't acted, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He flew up slightly and looked around, trying to find any traces of where Ye Feipeng might be.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" When he clearly saw the surrounding scene, Li Fan's heart jumped.</p><p></p><p>While the attention of all the cultivators was focused on the unprecedented battle in the sky, Li Fan discovered that the sea level of the Congyu Sea had unknowingly dropped drastically.</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless seawater had vanished into thin air. As far as Li Fan could see, even some shallower sea areas had their seabeds exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, he hasn't given up." Thinking of the Kun Peng divine ability Ye Feipeng had comprehended, a glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>And just in the time Li Fan was observing the situation around him, the Crimson Flame above finally showed signs of defeat under the continuous attacks of the five Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>The flames on its body were like a candle in the wind, constantly flickering.</p><p></p><p>The final strike of the five Immortal Lords was also about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"I will also lend a hand to help you Immortal Lords!" Zhang Zhiliang's voice sounded in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Fan's ears, there was a hint of coldness in his tone.</p><p></p><p>The tens of thousands of formations sealing the battlefield all emitted a faint light at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Then they all went out simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The instant they disappeared in the sky, they quietly moved and changed their positions.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, a formation suddenly took shape.</p><p></p><p>"Gather spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang's indifferent voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>This voice had already appeared countless times on the battlefield before, and the cultivators present, including the several Immortal Lords in the battle, had already become accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>However, different from before...</p><p></p><p>A huge eye, tightly closed, appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The moment the words "gather spiritual energy" rang out, the eye suddenly opened wide.</p><p></p><p>And the battlefield was shrouded under its gaze!</p><p></p><p>The density of the surrounding spiritual energy dropped at an alarming rate, and the five Immortal Lords immediately sensed that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Zhiliang, you're courting death!" The voice of Immortal Lord Hongxi, both shocked and furious, resounded through the sky.</p><p></p><p>The inverted mountain changed its target and smashed towards the solitary eye in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, the space in front kept distorting.</p><p></p><p>That incredibly heavy inverted mountain that seemed to be able to crush everything simply couldn't fly to the front of the solitary eye in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the attacks of the other Immortal Lords who had come to their senses and were furious also couldn't penetrate this sealed space.</p><p></p><p>All the attacks were in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Two Polarities Dust Formation? You've broken through to the Nascent Soul realm?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Immortal Lord Ziyun, who had not spoken from beginning to end, finally opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The crisp voice caused the faces of the others like Hongxi to greatly change.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang remained silent.</p><p></p><p>On the side, the Crimson Flame, who was originally heavily injured, seized the opportunity to launch an attack on the several stunned Nascent Soul Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Hongxi and the others were forced to re-engage the Crimson Flame in battle.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this time, not only was the spiritual energy in the Two Polarities Dust Formation greatly reduced, and they couldn't recover...</p><p></p><p>Even the solitary eye in the sky would cast its gaze from time to time, immobilizing everyone's movements.</p><p></p><p>Before long, faced with the double attack of the Crimson Flame and Zhang Zhiliang, the several Immortal Lords became covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Zhiliang, you're a dignified Nascent Soul cultivator and a grandmaster of formations, how can you act in such a despicable manner?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid of being ridiculed by</p>

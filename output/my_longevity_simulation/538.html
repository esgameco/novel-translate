        <div class="content">
            <p>Sure, here is the full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Recommended below, switching to the Fetch Book app to read is really convenient, download it here and everyone can try it out quickly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke touched his forehead but seemed to feel nothing.</p><p>"Time will come when you will know its use," Emperor Yi said.</p><p>"What? All riddles. It really makes me angry," Xu Ke muttered under his breath, glancing at Emperor Yi, but ultimately lacking the courage to erupt.</p><p>He was forced to bear it.</p><p></p><p>"Things are settled here, after all, Namming is not a place where humans should linger for long. I will take you away."</p><p></p><p>In the space below, the myriad monsters gathered, and at this moment, there was a final outcome.</p><p>"We firmly support Emperor Yi's great decision!"</p><p>"Under the leadership of Emperor Yi, our Yao beasts will surely usher in a better future!"</p><p>"A small Profound Yellow Realm, let it be!"</p><p></p><p>The Yao beasts roared together, reaching a consensus.</p><p></p><p>As for how much sincerity there was among them, one could perhaps glimpse a bit of it from the faintly mocking smile on Emperor Yi's face overlooking everyone from above.</p><p></p><p>Leading Xu Ke, child Emperor Yi crossed the winding and unmanned passage to reach the large gate at their initial arrival.</p><p>"You may go now."</p><p>Emperor Yi stopped his steps and ordered.</p><p>Xu Ke hesitated. </p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, between you and me..."</p><p>"There will be a day to meet again," Emperor Yi hinted.</p><p></p><p>And while the words were still echoing in the air, her figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>Holding the sphere inside, which seemed to have a heartbeat, Xu Ke summoned Xiaoqing and left the place along with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>During the return journey across the Southern Ocean, perhaps due to Emperor Yi's influence, they did not encounter any other monsters.</p><p></p><p>The journey was safe, and they were getting closer and closer to the Beast-taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, flew and stood on the sphere given to Xu Ke by Emperor Yi.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly very interested in it, his eyes seemed to reveal a greedy desire to swallow it whole.</p><p>"Xiaohei, what are you doing!"</p><p></p><p>Facing Li Fan's probing gaze, Xu Ke tightly held the sphere, his eyes full of vigilance.</p><p>"This is something I need to report back to Senior Luya. You can't just eat it because you have a sudden craving."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan disdainfully glanced at Xu Ke, giving him a claw without explaining.</p><p>During this time, he had been staring at the sphere only because he sensed a familiar aura emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>After careful examination, he confirmed that this faint familiarity came from the rift whales that roamed outside the Immortal Array in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Although we previously found the leaving whales, they obviously had significant differences from what I saw in the future."</p><p>"It's not just in terms of their size, more importantly, according to the information provided by the Imperial Family, the later leaving whales could reproduce themselves by devouring the energy in the void."</p><p></p><p>"Only in this way could they flourish in the vast void, develop so many populations, and complete the plan to completely separate the small world from the core of the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The ones we found before, apparently do not have such characteristics."</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, this little guy..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Beast-taming Sect must have used a hybrid of rift whales and this spherical creature to cultivate new sub-species that met their requirements.</p><p></p><p>"So, after being so busy, it's all because of Mr. Bai's mission?"</p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This story of the Celestial Immortal Realm seemed a bit too lengthy.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he hadn't figured out what the obsession maintaining this segment of time and space was all about.</p><p>And how to unravel it.</p><p>However, Li Fan had a feeling that when he returned to the Beast-taming Sect, he might uncover this mystery.</p><p></p><p>The journey back from the Southern Ocean to the Beast-taming Sect was long.</p><p></p><p>Before half the journey was completed, the duration of their stay in the Celestial Immortal Realm had ended.</p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan found himself back in the real world.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Yi Beast..."</p><p></p><p>Was the plan successful for the subsequent relocation of the monster clans?</p><p></p><p>If it were successful, such a great commotion could not have been concealed from the cultivators of the time.</p><p></p><p>And if there were successful escape examples, then the cultivators would undoubtedly imitate them.</p><p></p><p>They would also try various methods to break the confines of time, to break free from the shackles of the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p>"Back then, the Great Dao Sect had three long-lived hermits who did not show themselves. Not to mention other sects, in the entire Profound Yellow Realm, the number of cultivators in the Longevity Realm was not small."</p><p></p><p>"Now, they have all disappeared, perhaps they left in part back then."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered Emperor Yi's words.</p><p></p><p>"Within the monster clan, there are many discrepancies regarding completely leaving the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p>"Let alone us human cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Some chose to leave and some chose to stay in the face of an unprecedented catastrophe, each making different choices.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>From the Celestial Immortal Realm returning to the real world, the foundation-laying ceremony of the Congyun Immortal City was about to officially begin.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao, in accordance with the agreement, brought the Immortal City Cave Mansion over.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, have a look!"</p><p></p><p>He extended his right hand, and a colorful miniature city emitting light suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Judging by its appearance, it matched the various Immortal Cities of the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"We can't deploy it here, please follow me, Li Dao friend," Zhou Kebao smiled faintly and handed over a delicate white jade carving of a tower.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan looked at the small object in his hand and felt somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>"It is the key to access the Preliminary Realm. As long as you use it as the core, you can participate in the established Preliminary Realm," Zhou Kebao explained to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Li Fan had rented the White Bone Preliminary Realm before and deceived many people from the Rift Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was not unfamiliar with this process.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he held the tower-like artifact and activated the ceremony.</p><p></p><p>After a slight dizziness, when Li Fan opened his eyes again, he was already inside a celestial palace shrouded in white clouds.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Zhou Kebao, there was already another group of cultivators waiting here for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since we've heard of Li Dao friend. It's a fortunate event for us to see you today!"</p><p>"Hehe, Li Fan Dao friend, we can be considered old acquaintances now, right!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan, they warmly came forward to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also smiled and responded one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Well, let Li Dao friend test the goods." After the pleasantries, a stern-looking cultivator with a square face spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao nodded and immediately controlled the Immortal City Cave Mansion in his hand to expand it to its maximum.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a huge floating city appeared above the celestial palace in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Li Dao friend, please!"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1098: The Surging Tide of Darkness</p><p></p><p>Seeing the abnormal behavior of the Youzu people before him, Li Fan remained calm. Ignoring their extreme fear, he forced them to complete the oath of joining the association in front of the faceless True Immortal statue.</p><p></p><p>After they finally calmed down, Li Fan then asked the reason why they were so afraid.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Youzu people trembled for a long time before he could explain, "We have never had the honor of seeing the True Immortal statue before. But the moment we saw it, our people instinctively felt boundless fear."</p><p></p><p>"We have lived in the darkness for many years, and our bodies have adapted to the special environment there. We can barely endure for a period of time under normal sunlight, but in front of the True Immortal statue..."</p><p></p><p>"It's like a light source that is a thousand times brighter than the sun in the sky, suddenly appearing in the pitch black darkness."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Youzu people spoke intermittently, but Li Fan understood his meaning.</p><p></p><p>Just as mortals would feel fear when facing an abyss, the Youzu people also felt extreme fear when they saw the faceless True Immortal statue because they were facing a fatal threat.</p><p></p><p>However, the True Immortal's web was formless and shapeless. Even Li Fan, if he were not the agent of the faceless True Immortal in the Xuanhuang Realm, might not have been able to detect its existence.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, these Youzu people, even the children who had just been born, all felt the power of the True Immortal without exception.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it is inseparable from the power of darkness they possess."</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan learned from the leader of the Youzu people about their understanding of darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Youzu people were actually human beings originally.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient legends passed down in their tribe, in ancient times, the world they lived in still had blue skies, white clouds, and bright sunshine.</p><p></p><p>But one day, after the sun set, it never rose again.</p><p></p><p>People begged desperately in the darkness, but they did not wait for a miracle.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of people disappeared forever in the darkness since then.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, all the survivors were favored by the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>Under the erosion and transformation of the power of darkness, their bodies also slowly changed.</p><p></p><p>They turned into a terrifying appearance with no head and facial features squeezed on their chests.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Youzu people did not understand the essence of the power of darkness. They only regarded it as the only straw to save their lives and the terrible evil god that brought destruction to the normal world, and they worshipped and prayed to it.</p><p></p><p>And this power of darkness seemed to be able to understand their words. It would actually respond and be used by them.</p><p></p><p>The Youzu people did not think that they had mastered the power of darkness, but that it was the gift of the great god of darkness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>However, what the leader of the Youzu people said was different from the introduction of Zhou, the preacher.</p><p></p><p>The Youzu people were obviously the natives of the dark realm, but Zhou said that they were just a special ethnic group that discovered and utilized the power of the dark realm.</p><p></p><p>Zhou should have no reason to deceive himself on such a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the process of the Wanxian League discovering the dark realm is not as simple as he glossed over."</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Next, he pondered the manifestation of this power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the passage to open the entrance to the dark realm is also through a dance ceremony."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not unfamiliar with the power that responded to the inner feelings of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The golden essence of the source power was the true immortal's pursuit of the root of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the process, the abandoned power remains. It is the existence known as the Flower of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to sense each other, there may be a connection between the two."</p><p></p><p>According to the introduction of the Youzu leader, although the power of darkness only appears in their homeland, it is actually ubiquitous throughout the entire Xuanhuang realm. It's just not concretely condensed, making it difficult for ordinary people to perceive. However, if one prays and calls upon it through special methods, they can cross the barriers between small worlds and utilize its power.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's witness, the Youzu leader appeared pious, muttering words in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He launched an attack towards a ferocious beast resembling a lion-tiger in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This lion-tiger beast was a new species recently bred by the empire, with a body as hard as steel. Even a full-powered strike from an ordinary Zhujicultivator would hardly harm it in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>But an extremely bizarre scene occurred.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning, the originally majestic lion-tiger beast suddenly collapsed to the ground, its limbs weak.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were filled with terror, helplessly struggling to get up.</p><p></p><p>But beneath it, it was as if there was an invisible quagmire. In the quagmire, there seemed to be countless hands constantly pulling at it.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's gaze, this lion-tiger beast was slowly devoured by the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Leaving no trace of its remains.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, Li Fan never "saw" the existence of the darkness.</p><p></p><p>But the lion-tiger beast did indeed disappear right under his nose.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully examined the ground where the darkness had descended, finding no remnants of power.</p><p></p><p>"Coming and going without a trace, impossible to guard against." Li Fan stroked his chin, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The group of Youzu people once again collectively closed their eyes in pious prayer.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that only they can respond to the darkness through this kind of prayer. Ordinary humans, no matter how similar they appear, cannot invoke the power of darkness."</p><p></p><p>"It's also easy to understand. Only by joining our Wanjie Alliance, taking the oath of the True Immortal Image, and joining the True Immortal Network, can his prayers be sensed by me. It seems that the power of darkness also exists in such an invisible network."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently pondered: "So the key is how to join this network without being devoured by the darkness."</p><p></p><p>In the dark realm, the bizarre appearance of Mo Rubin's corpse was still vivid in his mind. Just by having the physical body come into contact with it, one would suffer such a fate. It was hard to imagine that if one's body and soul were fully immersed in the darkness, they could escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>And next, Li Fan ordered his subordinate death knights to try to imitate the attempt to communicate with the darkness, which also proved his speculation.</p><p></p><p>Vanishing without a sound, devoured by the darkness. Leaving no trace in life or death.</p><p></p><p>And in a short period of time, frequently invoking the power of darkness seemed to have caused some subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>As the ruler of the Lingmu realm, Li Fan vaguely felt that the entire world had darkened for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After confirming with the Youzu leader, Li Fan knew that this was not his illusion.</p><p></p><p>But rather, the darkness indeed had a tendency to flow towards this place.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decisively suspended the experiment temporarily.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring with various Youzu people for a long time, Li Fan finally had a general understanding of the current situation of the power of darkness in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>It was like a dark ocean converging on the "back" of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Although it was fixed in place by some mysterious force, the all-pervasive nature of the darkness itself caused it to sometimes invade Xuanhuang and various small worlds through any possible "cracks".</p><p></p><p>Invading, and ultimately returning to the dark realm.</p><p></p><p>Cycling back and forth, forming an existence similar to "tides".</p>

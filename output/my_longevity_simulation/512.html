        <h1>Chapter 512</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Blending completely with one's own cultivation power, it was hard to distinguish one from the other.</p><p></p><p>Just like the root source technique of cultivation, if one were to forcefully abolish it, falling back a few great realms would be considered light. There was a high possibility of damaging the foundation of the Dao, and there would be no chance for cultivation thereafter.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Li Fan sat cross-legged on the ground, trying for a long time. In the end, he gave up despondently, his expression ugly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao, the senior sister, also furrowed her eyebrows slightly, saying, "The demonic techniques of the Xuantian Sect are indeed strange. It seems that we cannot easily rid ourselves of it for now."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Supreme Ancestor's 'Supreme Primordial Scriptures' of the Tai Shang Sect can allow cultivators to change techniques as they wish. If we are lucky enough to have a look, maybe we can abolish this 'Heaven and Earth Exchange Taxation.'"</p><p></p><p>"'Supreme Primordial Scriptures'?" Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly. Although he had never heard of this technique before, he faintly felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>As Zhao spoke, she shook her head and gave up on this unrealistic idea: "It's a pity that just like our Da Dao Sect's 'Daoist Deathming Classics,' they are both undiscovered mysteries of our sect, never transmitted."</p><p></p><p>"Only the direct line of the sect's head can cultivate within the sect, let alone outsiders like us."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao's helpless expression, Li Fan embraced her and comforted her softly, saying, "Since things have come to this point, we can only take it step by step."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect has been extinct for a long time, and 'Heaven and Earth Exchange Taxation' is just a dual cultivation technique. I don't think even the senior members of the sect can discern any clues."</p><p></p><p>Although Zhao agreed with a nod, the worry in her eyes was persistent.</p><p></p><p>The two spent half a month recuperating in the secret chamber of the ruins, during which they thoroughly consolidated their realms with the help of their dual cultivation power.</p><p></p><p>They then set off back to the Da Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Zhao used her sword to completely destroy the ruins of the place.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to the mountain gate, the shattered lamp of Qin Shouming had already caused a huge stir.</p><p></p><p>After discreetly discussing with each other, Zhao and Li Fan decided that this matter could not be concealed.</p><p></p><p>They decided to meet the sect leader together, explaining the incident about Qin Shou's following and treacherous intentions which led to his eventual death at their hands.</p><p></p><p>Details were withheld, and the involvement of the Xuantian Sect was not mentioned. They only spoke of how they managed to successfully kill him in a life-threatening situation.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Wangshuang seemed to have been aware of this already and showed little surprise.</p><p></p><p>They were sentenced to ten years of confinement and were placed under protective custody in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Ten years passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>The ups and downs of the Da Dao Sect were no longer related to the two confined individuals.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the two had some reservations about practicing dual cultivation within the sect.</p><p></p><p>But by the third year, they both faced bottlenecks. With courage, they decided to practice the 'Heaven and Earth Exchange Taxation' together again.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to favorable circumstances, or maybe due to their enhanced cultivation, this round of dual cultivation was more effective than three years ago.</p><p></p><p>Zhao broke through to the mid-stage of the Core Formation, while Li Fan's realm reached the mid-stage of the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>The rapid progress of their cultivation left them speechless.</p><p></p><p>The worry in their hearts inevitably surfaced.</p><p></p><p>They knew that occasional breakthroughs could be explained by chance. However, such rapid advancement, beyond what their talents could explain, would surely raise suspicions.</p><p></p><p>If their association with the demonic techniques of the Xuantian Sect were discovered, the consequences would be dire. Even having their cultivation abolished would be considered lenient.</p><p></p><p>After a difficult discussion, they resolved that they would not engage in dual cultivation unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>The plan was ideal, but...</p><p></p><p>Another five years passed, and the mysterious bottleneck reappeared in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>No matter how they practiced, they couldn't make any progress.</p><p></p><p>They struggled and persisted for a year.</p><p></p><p>During that entire year, they didn't rest for a moment, dedicating all their energy to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Trying to break through the bottleneck with sheer willpower.</p><p></p><p>But their efforts were in vain.</p><p></p><p>The despair of their cultivation remaining stagnant tormented them.</p><p></p><p>As individuals devoted to the Dao, Li Fan and Zhao couldn't allow themselves to remain at their current realms indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in the ninth year of their confinement, they couldn't resist and engaged in dual cultivation once again.</p><p></p><p>The intense experience exceeded their previous encounters.</p><p></p><p>As expected, after this round of dual cultivation, the bottleneck disappeared without a trace, and their cultivation advanced further.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't have a breakthrough on the spot, it was not far off.</p><p></p><p>After the passion subsided, a sense of fear crept in for the two.</p><p></p><p>One reason was the fear of their association with the Xuantian Sect's demonic techniques being exposed.</p><p></p><p>The second reason was that the 'Heaven and Earth Exchange Taxation' was so mysterious that they feared being controlled by it for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Both being proud individuals, they couldn't tolerate such a prospect.</p><p></p><p>They began researching ways to break free from this.</p><p></p><p>"In all things, there is the concept of a heavenly father and an earthly mother. From the moment living beings are born, their bodies bear the 'marks' left by heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"It's rumored that the Xuantian Sect usurped heavenly authority and also acquired the power to change these 'marks' bestowed by heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Even ordinary people without any martial prowess, once bestowed by the Xuantian Sect, can become equal to us cultivators today."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it is said that the heavenly kings of the Xuantian Sect also hold what is known as the 'Eternal Life Fruit Position.' Anyone who obtains it can achieve eternal life and share life with heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Zhao explained to Li Fan the hidden bits of information she had gathered from various sources.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal life..." A strange expression flickered in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Are you implying, senior sister, that the Xuantian Sect's techniques also have the ability to manipulate these 'marks'?" Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>Zhao sighed lightly, saying, "It's just my speculation. The remnants of the Xuantian Sect in the world today are just fragments. But from the words, one can vaguely understand how terrifying the original Xuantian Sect was. Their rules were strict, akin to heavenly mandates, imposing their will across the world."</p><p></p><p>"Although they are just resurrected ghosts, breaking free from them won't be an easy task."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held Zhao's hand, his gaze firm, "Rest assured, we will definitely accomplish it."</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and the ten years of confinement had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>The sealed gate swung open, and the two, with anxious hearts, stepped out of the confinement room.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they were worried that their rapid progress over the ten years would raise suspicions.</p><p></p><p>However, upon returning to the sect's gate, they were astonished to find that their progress was insignificant now.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that in the second year of their confinement, a new technique had quietly spread.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the essence of heaven and earth, leveraging the anomalies of heaven and earth, peeping into the laws of heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>Up to defying the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was a complete contradiction to the current practice of sensing the heavenly path and following the natural order. This technique plundered and disregarded all means.</p><p></p><p>However, its actual effects were far superior to the current cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

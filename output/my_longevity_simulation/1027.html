            <p>Chapter 1025: The Mysterious Disappearance of the Huadao Stone</p><p></p><p>Li Fan needed a large amount of elixirs that could directly increase his cultivation level, which were naturally prepared for the cultivators in the small worlds. </p><p></p><p>It had been some time since they collectively practiced the Cangsheng Lingyuan Gong, but the overall progress could only be described as barely satisfactory.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan decided to take a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>The exploration of the entire past of the Xuanhuang Realm, including the Crimson River, had not yet begun in this world. In the future, Li Fan might face the counterattack of the Wanxian Alliance, the Chuanfa Tianzun, as well as the Xianxu Immortals, the Faceless True Immortal, and many other existences.</p><p></p><p>When colliding with enemies of this level, one could never be too careful.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's current strength was low, and he had to borrow strength to fight against them, leaving no room for the slightest mistake.</p><p></p><p>All his energy had to be focused on this. Once it began, he would not be able to spare attention for other matters.</p><p></p><p>However, the formation of the Crimson River in this world was a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not sure whether he could reproduce it and make it reappear in the next world.</p><p></p><p>If he missed the opportunity to obtain secrets from it, it would be quite a pity.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, what Li Fan had to do now was to speed up the pace of exploration as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>In fact, under the command of Li Qing's avatar, a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators from various small worlds had already been sent to explore.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, they all died of old age in front of the Crimson River, unable to bring back any useful information.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the area where the Crimson River was located was very special, hidden within the precious Fishing Pool. Therefore, the anomalies of the cultivators' deaths were all concealed, and outsiders could not perceive them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the secret of the Crimson River would certainly not be kept.</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, let them greatly improve to the Golden Core realm, so there is a possibility of success. Otherwise, the time is too short, and they will just be dying in vain." This was the conclusion drawn by Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>That's why Li Fan had to intimidate the entire Yaowang Sect and order them to focus on refining pills.</p><p></p><p>After visiting the wood-attributed cave heaven, Li Fan invited them all out from his body. He only took a batch of herbs for their pill refining needs.</p><p></p><p>With the trivial matters settled, Li Fan returned to the underground secret room in the Lingmu Realm and took out a list to read.</p><p></p><p>It was the investigation results about the cultivators who were very likely to possess the Huadao Stone, which he had troubled Mo Rubin to investigate before.</p><p></p><p>It helped Li Fan eliminate the vast majority of people who were not suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these names and the dense network of connections behind them, Li Fan sighed slightly, "It's really convenient to have someone at the top of the Wanxian Alliance. Otherwise, just compiling this list of information would probably take me several years, and I might not be able to organize it so clearly."</p><p></p><p>"Mo Rubin only needs to give a simple order, and naturally, someone below will handle it very nicely."</p><p></p><p>Looking at these names, Li Fan's heart stirred, and he took out the Liangtiachi that the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar had given him before.</p><p></p><p>Without a target, Li Fan's current data processing ability naturally could not fully accept the vast amount of information from the all-seeing mirror.</p><p></p><p>But what if he selectively chose?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense once again sank into the endless mirror world.</p><p></p><p>This time, he used the suspects on the list as the desired search results and directly screened out a large amount of useless information.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the pressure was instantly reduced.</p><p></p><p>After half a day...</p><p></p><p>Several dozen mirror surfaces floated in front of Li Fan like light screens, one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Well, there are still some without search results. It should not be because I overlooked them, but due to the scope of the Tianxuan Mirror's own authority. Just like the Creation Stone Tablet only has the</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The history of the native land is recorded, while those foreign immortal cultivation realms have no records alike."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently, secretly observing these forty-five cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Some of them were cultivating within the Tianxuan Mirror, some were exploring the ruins of sects.</p><p></p><p>Some were experimenting with divine abilities, and some were discussing with companions the problems encountered during cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, all of them had passed the initial stage of worrying about contribution points.</p><p></p><p>None of them were working hard on tasks to earn contribution points.</p><p></p><p>After observing for three full days, no cultivator revealed any flaws.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not worried and still waited very patiently.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the Huadao Stone, Li Fan was very clear that once one got used to the existence of the Huadao Stone, it was easy to develop a dependence.</p><p></p><p>Whenever encountering a problem that could be solved with the Huadao Stone, there was no reason not to use it.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was also one's own divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's waiting soon paid off.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, one of them, a Huashen cultivator named Lu Chengxue, while chatting with a good friend, mentioned an old story of a joint adventure many years ago.</p><p></p><p>Because it had been a long time, they seemed to have some disagreements about the details at that time and had an argument.</p><p></p><p>After a slight daze, Lu Chengxue completely recalled and recounted what happened at that time.</p><p></p><p>He convinced his friend.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!" A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This scene was all too familiar to Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it searching for past scenes recorded in the Huadao Stone?</p><p></p><p>Having found the target, Li Fan did not act immediately.</p><p></p><p>But still kept watching in front of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>It lasted for more than a month and a half, and he did not feel bored.</p><p></p><p>The other two were exposed by displaying inhuman memory and data processing capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"It should only be these. If they can resist using the Huadao Stone for such a long time, either they have noticed someone is peeping and deliberately concealed their skills. Or they have completely given up and are not attentive to cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly stood up, left the Lingmu Realm, and went straight to the target.</p><p></p><p>It was also time for the Huadao Stone to be upgraded again.</p><p></p><p>The first target was Lu Chengxue.</p><p></p><p>This person was a core member of the younger generation of the Lu family in Tianquan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Although the Lu family did not have any top experts, the most commendable point was that they were kind-hearted and righteous.</p><p></p><p>Whoever had a good relationship with the Lu family, when encountering any difficulties.</p><p></p><p>The Lu family would definitely lend a helping hand.</p><p></p><p>Even if they encountered insurmountable factors and could not officially step forward to resolve it. Privately, the Lu family members would still extend a helping hand in their personal capacity.</p><p></p><p>In this treacherous Xuanhuang Realm full of intrigues and evil hearts, the Lu family could absolutely be considered a clear stream.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, how many cultivators had received favors from the Lu family?</p><p></p><p>And ordinary passersby basically had a very friendly attitude towards the Lu family who often did good deeds.</p><p></p><p>After all, who dared to guarantee that they would never encounter trouble in the future?</p><p></p><p>Getting along well with the Lu family meant having more ways out in the future.</p><p></p><p>But it was to the core disciple of such a well-received family...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was going to take ruthless action.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the secret technique of the Huadao God, the Huadao Stone and the cultivator's soul merged into one.</p><p></p><p>The only way to remove the Huadao Stone...</p><p></p><p>Was to destroy their soul.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan would not have the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>In the future, life after life, he would do the same.</p><p></p><p>Until the Huadao Stone was of no use to him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Tianquan City, Li Fan, who had already found Lu Chengxue, looked at this enthusiastic and sincere face.</p><p></p><p>He first mourned for him silently for a moment.</p>

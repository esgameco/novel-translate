        <h1>Chapter 775</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Although the holy embryo Xu Bai had already left, the separated body Xu Bai was still immersed in the process of the other's golden pill reaching perfection.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder even just being tainted by a bit of Mr. Bai's spiritual aura, the cultivation talent of the separated body is so terrifyingly high."</p><p></p><p>"My will is the will of Heaven, my heart is the heart of Heaven." Xu Bai muttered these words again, feeling an epiphany in his heart. </p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai is likely an existence akin to the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao. If not for the shackles of the new methods, achieving spontaneous immortality would probably not be difficult for him."</p><p></p><p>Aided by the memories transmitted from the holy embryo Xu Bai, the separated body could fully experience the feeling of "unity of Heaven and man."</p><p></p><p>Currently, the relationships between the main body Li Fan, the separated body Xu Bai, and the holy embryo Xu Bai were quite profound. Although still governed by the same consciousness for now, due to the differing qualities of the three bodies, they would gain different insights from the same matters.</p><p></p><p>The talent of the separated body Xu Bai far surpassed Li Fan's, while the holy embryo Xu Bai was far above the separated body.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the moment it separated from the mother body, the holy embryo Xu Bai received even more severe "pollution." In its subconscious speech, it would do things beyond control, like stumbling on the road for no apparent reason, inevitably affected by some external force.</p><p></p><p>But for now, whether the separated body or holy embryo Xu Bai, they were unaware of and unable to resist this external force causing the phenomena, only allowing the changes to occur silently within themselves.</p><p></p><p>The only certainty was that although the final outcome was predetermined and unavoidable, the holy embryo Xu Bai had not yet developed its own independent consciousness, its behavior still controlled by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This was also why, after realizing he was influenced by Mr. Bai and could not return to his true self, Li Fan actively catalyzed the birth of the holy embryo to seize the initiative! He could even secretly lay a trap in this process.</p><p></p><p>For instance...if Mr. Bai revived autonomously and gained Li Fan's memories, he might attempt "Building the Foundation with Myself," breaking free from the shackles of the transmitted methods to forge a brand new path of cultivation. If this path was theoretically viable, Mr. Bai would be the most likely to actualize it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan would not let him do so, instead manipulating the holy embryo Xu Bai to Build the Foundation with the "Sword of Heaven's Will," still following the path of the new methods.</p><p></p><p>"After Mr. Bai is revived, he may wage a battle against the transmitted methods."</p><p>"Might as well add some difficulty for him."</p><p>Li Fan had no good feelings toward this existence trying to borrow his body for rebirth.</p><p></p><p>However, it was more likely that once this being awakened to self-awareness, the first thing it would do is find the main body Li Fan to seize the treasure "Return to Truth," since it had all of Li Fan's memories.</p><p></p><p>By then, Li Fan would truly be as helpless as a lamb awaiting slaughter.</p><p></p><p>"The time left for me is not much."</p><p>Xu Bai's expression became unusually grave.</p><p>At the holy embryo Xu Bai's cultivation speed, by the day Mr. Bai finally awakened, his cultivation would definitely far surpass Li Fan's.</p><p>Adding that he shared Li Fan's memories, he would be well aware of all of Li Fan's prior arrangements.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The palm of the hand.</p><p>In this situation, trying to escape from the other party's hands.</p><p>It can be said to be as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>The only possible glimmer of hope lies in the [Revert] ability of the [Transformation].</p><p>"Although dead, the true spirit does not perish. Transforming the body, crossing the ages."</p><p>"Little brother Tianyang, whether you can escape this calamity this time depends entirely on you."</p><p>"If there is a next life, I will definitely treat you well!"</p><p>Xu Bai thought to himself.</p><p>After activating the transformation ability, one can abandon the physical body and entrust the true spirit to an object.</p><p>When the duration of existence reaches its limit, one can self-activate the Revert.</p><p>This is the only method that Li Fan could think of to break free from the mental control of Mr. Xu.</p><p>However, if he were to easily [transform his body] now.</p><p>Then, when Mr. Xu's will awakens, he will also have memories of Li Fan [transforming his body]. There is still a high probability that he will find the object Li Fan has attached his spirit to.</p><p>At that time, Li Fan's fate would be even more tragic.</p><p>"To deceive Mr. Xu, I must first deceive myself."</p><p>"Before activating the [Transformation] ability, the target is not certain."</p><p>"At the same time, I also need to use the [Chaos] technique to interfere with it."</p><p>...</p><p>Xu Bai's mind raced, pondering strategies to break the deadlock.</p><p>Seven days later.</p><p>Xu Bai left the secret room and first returned to Tianliang City, resigning from the [Liaison Officer] position.</p><p>"If you have any dissatisfaction in your heart, you can just say it. Why bother quitting your job?"</p><p>"Is it because the position is too low? I can promote you. With the merits you have accumulated over the years, it should be enough to shut others up."  He hurriedly persuaded.</p><p>Xu Bai shook his head slightly: "Thank you for your kindness, sir. It's just that yesterday, I suddenly had a feeling. I feel that worldly affairs are too busy, and they are not of much use to myself."</p><p>"No matter how high the official position or how abundant the resources, if one does not focus on cultivation itself, it is useless. Instead, it becomes a burden to oneself."</p><p>Xu Bai put on an air of seeing through the world, matching his transcendent and extraordinary appearance. He really managed to impress Nangong Shirong.</p><p>"It's just a pity, really. In a few decades or hundreds of years, when I rise to the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance, Tianliang State will eventually be handed over to you. Among my subordinates, you are the most reliable one."</p><p>Seeing that Xu Bai's mind was made up and not just putting on an act, Nangong Shirong shook his head with a sigh, making a final attempt to persuade him.</p><p>After being ruthlessly rejected by Xu Bai, he said, "Tianliang State will always have a place for you. When you change your mind in the future, you can come back anytime."</p><p>"Then I'll thank you in advance, sir!" Xu Bai bowed and left gracefully.</p><p>Nangong Shirong watched his retreating figure, his face full of puzzlement.</p><p>Xu Bai's resignation indeed caused quite a stir.</p><p>After all, positions in the Immortal Alliance are like carrots and sticks. The sudden vacancy of a [Liaison Officer], which is such a lucrative position, naturally attracted various forces to compete for it.</p><p>But soon, an unexpected major event occurred, easily overshadowing the turmoil caused by Xu Bai's resignation.</p><p>In the process of the Immortal Alliance's cultivators conquering a small world, an unexpected major change finally occurred.</p><p>The Taiyan Sect, a renowned ancient immortal sect, not only did not perish, but also existed in a prosperous state in a certain small world.</p><p>A team of Immortal Alliance cultivators who invaded it were easily defeated.</p><p>However, the Taiyan Sect did not harm them, but simply released them all.</p>

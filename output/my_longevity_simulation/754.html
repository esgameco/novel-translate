        <h1>Chapter 754</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San's face showed an embarrassed expression: "Uh, this matter seems a bit difficult..."</p><p>"Hm?" Li Fan was slightly puzzled. </p><p>Before Liu San could respond, Fang Zaiji interrupted: "Heh heh, Sect Master, have you been in secluded meditation for too long? Our Yao Wang Sect no longer has any disciples at the Qi Refining stage. Even those with the poorest talents have long since succeeded in forming their foundation."</p><p>Li Fan's motion of caressing the Separation Talisman paused slightly. </p><p>"Then we can only trouble Mr. Fang to go out and select some promising seedlings," Li Fan said, feigning realization but with some resignation.</p><p>"It's best to carry the Terminal Disk with you and be cautious. Otherwise, if you're discovered by cultivators from the Wan Xian Alliance, it may lead to a bloody battle," he kindly reminded.</p><p>"Uh..." Fang Zaiji's face immediately fell. "Sect Master..."</p><p>"Mr. Fang should leave and return quickly. After all, this concerns the hope of deciphering the Tian Xuan Treasure Manual. I can't feel at ease entrusting it to others," Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p>Seeing no way to refuse, Fang Zaiji glared at Liu San who was watching the spectacle, then flew away directly.</p><p>"I'll go out and take a look too," Jiang Yushan, who had remained silent, suddenly spoke up.</p><p>Liu San was stunned.</p><p>"Staying here for too long feels stifling," Jiang Yushan said indifferently. "It seems quite lively outside now. The countless small worlds that have been hidden for thousands of years are finally revealing their true forms. I'm very interested and may even run into old acquaintances from the past."</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan also nodded in agreement.</p><p>He handed her a Terminal Disk and a communication talisman, cautioning: "Safety should still be the top priority. Our Yao Wang Sect's revival cannot happen without your assistance, Senior Jiang."</p><p>"Don't worry," Jiang Yushan replied coldly, then left through the void.</p><p>"Young Master, I also..." Liu San hurriedly said.</p><p>"Old Liu, you should stay in the Yao Wang Valley. Not long from now, there will be an important matter that requires you and one of my avatars to run an errand together," Li Fan waved his hand, firmly rejecting Liu San's request.</p><p>Liu San showed a bitter expression, unable to disobey Li Fan. He could only go vent his frustrations on the Yao Wang Sect's disciples in the valley.</p><p>Li Fan continued to focus his mind on nourishing the Separation Talisman.</p><p>Meanwhile, his avatar Xu Bai, who had returned to Tian Liang City, learned about the Xian Alliance's recent progress in their campaign to conquer the myriad realms.</p><p>Previously, they had been progressing smoothly. But shortly after he returned to the Xuan Huang Realm, the fervent cultivators finally suffered their first major defeat.</p><p>The first batch of over a hundred cultivators who entered a small world, including three Spirit Severing leaders and fifty Yuanying elite, nearly the entire force was annihilated.</p><p>With such formidable strength, their near total destruction was unexpected.</p><p>The only survivor was a Foundation Establishment cultivator named Lu Zhixian.</p><p>He was at the very back of the team and had only been included in this expedition force due to his relationship with one of the Spirit Severing leaders.</p><p>Originally, he had just hoped to gain some merit, never expecting the situation to take such a drastic turn. Seeing the dire circumstances, Lu Zhixian promptly fled.</p><p>Perhaps it was precisely because his cultivation was so low that the enemy did not pursue him relentlessly.</p><p>Such a crushing defeat naturally caused an uproar and prompted an official investigation from the Wan Xian Alliance.</p><p>With records from the Tian Xuan Treasure Manual's images, Lu Zhixian's suspicion of being a spy was quickly cleared, and he was released without charge.</p><p>However, the release of these images further fueled public outrage.</p><p>With white hair, a wrinkled face, and the appearance of...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old man seemed extremely aged, as if he could die at any moment. </p><p></p><p>However, his movements were anything but vague - they were ruthless and cruel. </p><p></p><p>His beard and hair were like living creatures, suddenly lashing out to injure people. They were like silver dragons that instantly pierced through the bodies of the Immortal Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>What was even more terrifying was that after the old man's beard and hair penetrated the Immortal Alliance cultivators' bodies, they seemed to be able to absorb their life force. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless cultivators rapidly aged, and some couldn't even let out a mournful cry before turning into mere skeletons. Meanwhile, the old man's face became a bit more ruddy.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this white-haired old man was at least at the Dao Realm level. Moreover, he seemed to have a special advantage in his small world, as ordinary Heavenly Immortal cultivators had absolutely no ability to resist him before their life force was completely drained.</p><p></p><p>This scene immediately aroused the great indignation of the Immortal Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"He can actually absorb the life span of cultivators? Such behavior is no different from that of an evil demon! Everyone must go and behead him!"</p><p></p><p>"Well said, fellow Daoist. I support you! Go quickly and cut off his head!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, I didn't expect there to be such a ruthless person in this small world. I don't think just a few Dao Realm cultivators can kill him."</p><p></p><p>"You fools, haven't you realized yet? Lu Zhixuan was the one who deliberately let him out, to act as a beacon and lure more cultivators to their deaths!"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense. But if that's the case, why doesn't he just leave that small world and wreak havoc in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Because he's not as stupid as you."</p><p></p><p>Although this sparked intense discussion, the Immortal Alliance cultivators were not fools. Since there was such a monster in that small world, they would simply go around it. There were countless undiscovered small worlds, so why bother fighting to the death with him?</p><p></p><p>And so, a dramatic scene unfolded. This small world was marked with a red skull on the map by the cultivators, but not a single one was willing to explore it further.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the Immortal Alliance will definitely send people to clean it up."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators all held this mentality and simply ignored the small world.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance's official stance also seemed to tacitly approve of this behavior, as they did not issue any bounty or pursuit order for that small world.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Xu Bai murmured after investigating further. It seemed there was a dispute within the Immortal Alliance about how to handle this small world.</p><p></p><p>One faction believed the scoundrel should be swiftly eliminated to demonstrate the Immortal Alliance's supreme authority.</p><p></p><p>The other faction argued that in future conquests of worlds, they would surely encounter opponents of similar strength to this white-haired old man. If they had to eliminate every such threat, there would inevitably be casualties.</p><p></p><p>Dao Realm cultivators were the pillars of the Immortal Alliance. Losing even one was a huge loss. Even with the existence of the Reincarnation Pavilion, where they could be revived, the Dao Realm cultivators seemed to have a certain fear of "resurrection" and were not eager to be the first to sacrifice themselves.</p><p></p><p>After much effort, Xu Bai finally understood the reason behind this.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, even though there were various methods to revive cultivators and even preserve their previous cultivation and memories, there was a fatal flaw that all Dao Realm cultivators could not ignore.</p><p></p><p>That was, once they entered the Reincarnation Pavilion, they would forever lose the chance to reach the Eternal Life Realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was unknown, but judging from the behavior of the Dao Realm experts, it must be a real and serious issue.</p><p></p><p>After all, which Dao Realm powerhouse didn't have the ambition to cultivate eternal life? Resurrection was merely their last resort.</p>

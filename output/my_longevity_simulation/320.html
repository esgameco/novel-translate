        <h1>Chapter 320</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Song Yang's desperate and somewhat despairing voice faintly came from below. Xu Ke, who had escaped from the jaws of death, looked back to ensure that Song Yang would not catch up.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, not seeing the other party's figure, Xu Ke couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. "Xiao Qing, thank you!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Ke familiarly said to the green phoenix bird, casually stroking its neck. The green phoenix bird let out a soft cry while flying, responding to him.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, due to continuously activating two innate magical powers and being chased after consuming too much energy, his highly tense spirit suddenly relaxed, and he instantly fell into a deep sleep. With this sleep, his duration in the Fallen Immortal Realm also came to an end.</p><p></p><p>When he regained consciousness, he had already returned to the Cultivation World.</p><p></p><p>Recalling this somewhat anticlimactic trip to the Beast Taming Sect in the Fallen Immortal Realm, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this?"</p><p></p><p>Unlike when he previously possessed Li Chen of the Purple Empyrean Sect, having an independent self-consciousness and being able to act freely, </p><p></p><p>The starting point was also extremely low, just a newborn bird hatched from an egg.</p><p></p><p>Basically unable to accomplish anything, spending days just eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>In just over two months, no matter how rapid the growth, the improvement in strength was limited. The Foundation Establishment stage was already the limit. In the Cultivation World of ancient times, this level of cultivation was almost at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Even if wanting to do something, it was powerless. "Could it be that I need to reveal my true form to act freely?"</p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>Unlike the confused thinking when possessing the Mysterious Bird, Li Fan quickly thought of Ye Feipeng, who previously had the Kun Peng sacred blood, cultivating the [Furnace of Creation Technique] to temper and activate the Kun Peng bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this Furnace of Creation Technique that utilizes the hidden methods within the body has a miraculous effect on exotic beasts."</p><p>"It's worth trying."</p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p>"No rush, let's see what changes there will be the next time I enter."</p><p></p><p>Since the mysterious Mr. White appeared in both Ningyuan City and the Beast Taming Sect,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that the scene inside the Beast Taming Sect must be the same as Ningyuan City before. If certain conditions were not met, it would be impossible to escape.</p><p></p><p>Always trapped in some kind of cycle.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it is or not, there's no need to dwell on it. It will be known the next time he enters. Sensing the time limit, it will disappear in about half a year.</p><p></p><p>By then, the matter in Tianyu Province should be settled, and he would head to Tianyun Province.</p><p></p><p>"However, Ji Hongdao may not let me leave so easily."</p><p></p><p>"According to the original plan, the students from each province basically return to their hometowns after completing the training, responsible for the construction of the [Tianxuan Spirit Locking Formation]."</p><p></p><p>"But now that Congyu Sea has disappeared, I don't know what arrangements I will have."</p><p>"Also, before leaving Tianyu Province, there is one more thing I need to do."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan left the closed-door room and came to the room with the Tianxuan Mirror, searching for information related to the bounty offered by Extreme Completion Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to use the Derivation Jade was so precious that no one wanted to miss it.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the originally extremely rare life-extending heavenly treasures and earthly treasures skyrocketed in price, often requiring high-level techniques or special treasures to exchange for them.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that a cultivator had discovered a [Longevity Fruit] from some ruins. It was said that this fruit was refined by ancient cultivators using Longevity Seeds, and could extend life by five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it was only seen in fragments of records, but unexpectedly, it could still be seen in reality.</p><p></p><p>This lucky cultivator, in order to avoid unforeseen circumstances, had already presented the Longevity Fruit to Extreme Completion Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>And he hid in the Tianxuan Mirror space all day, unwilling to go out, just waiting for the time to arrive to redeem the opportunity to use the Derivation Jade. "My Incarnation Longevity Fruit can also extend life by three hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if it can rank in the top three."</p><p></p><p>"Originally I was very confident, but after all, the Mysterious Yellow Realm has a long history and too many hidden treasures. Under heavy rewards, it's normal for things more precious than the Longevity Fruit to appear."</p><p></p><p>"When the results are announced, if it doesn't work in this life, I can also inquire about the origins of the top three and plan ahead in the next life."</p><p></p><p>"However, preparations need to be made in advance."</p><p></p><p>The previous avatar had been buried along with Congyu Sea by the hands of the Ink Assassin. The bounty offered by Extreme Completion Celestial Venerable was the focus of everyone's attention. Actively jumping out and standing under the spotlight was not Li Fan's way of doing things.</p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side, Li Fan decided to create another avatar to receive the reward. Anyway, once the avatar knows the technique, it means the true body has mastered it.</p><p></p><p>"The avatar created by the Stealing Heaven and Swapping Sun Technique is one minor realm lower than the true body."</p><p></p><p>"In order to explain the origin of the Longevity Fruit, the avatar needs to be at least at the Golden Core realm that can enter the Fallen Immortal Realm. In other words, I need to quickly cultivate to the mid Golden Core stage."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on my own cultivation alone is a bit difficult. The new crops have not been planted yet, I can only hope that Xiao Heng will give more feedback on the cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Su Xiaomei and the others have disappeared in the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect for some time. Although during this period she seemed to have disappeared from this world and didn't feed back any cultivation to me at all, I can sense from the subtle connection of the Zuoshan Technique that Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo are still alive. When they come out, they should bring me some surprises."</p><p></p><p>Not putting all his hopes on others, Li Fan continued cultivating after a brief rest.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and the final assessment of the Tianxuan Spirit Locking Formation was soon over.</p><p></p><p>After the results came out, Ji Hongdao sent a message for all the students who were out to return to the Huanyu Branch. Everyone gathered together again, feeling a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao smiled slightly, not in a hurry to announce the results, but first introduced the rewards for the top performers in the assessment that he had mentioned before.</p><p></p><p>Taking out a jade plate, he said, "This is the little thing that caught my eye."</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, all formation masters will be reluctant to part with it once they know its effects."</p><p>"Why don't you all guess, what use does it have?" Li Fan carefully observed the jade plate in Ji Hongdao's hand, feeling it looked familiar.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a bit, he quickly reacted.</p><p></p><p>This thing had a 70% similarity to the "Formation Breaking Plate" he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Formation Breaking Plate was a kind of magic treasure that could analyze the composition of a formation without destroying its structure, thus providing formation masters with a reference for breaking the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this item is an upgraded version of the Formation Breaking Plate?" Li Fan couldn't help but think so. Obviously, Li Fan was not the only one who thought this way. Many students stared at the jade plate with excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have all guessed it, so I won't keep you in suspense."</p><p>"The effects of this item are indeed somewhat similar to the Formation Breaking Plate." Ji Hongdao stroked the jade plate, feeling a bit sentimental.</p><p></p><p>"But it is far more powerful than the Formation Breaking Plate."</p><p>"The original Formation Breaking Plate had a set of one thousand and eighty pieces."</p><p></p><p>"But this small jade plate, with just one piece, can break formations several times faster than the entire set of Formation Breaking Plates."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 542</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Hmph, you've deceived us for so long, truly cunning!" The face on the smooth broken stone showed intermittently, indicating his unrest at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"I should have realized that something was wrong. With Zhou Qing'ang's mediocre abilities, how could he have achieved so many incredible feats in just a few years..."</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I was blinded by his abundant achievements, thinking he had defied fate."</p><p></p><p>"Now thinking back, occasional luck could still explain things once in a while. But several times in a row, luck favoring him like this..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Zhou Qing'ang is not some destined individual." The face carried a trace of vexation, speaking slowly.</p><p></p><p>Yet the face was constantly staring at Li Fan, hoping to see a smug expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's expression remained unchanged. Even after his identity was exposed, he showed no signs of panic.</p><p></p><p>This instead made the face on the broken stone a bit unsure, gradually stopping his words.</p><p></p><p>The underwater ruins became quiet.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the face couldn't hold back and asked in a deep voice, "Who are you exactly?!"</p><p></p><p>"The entrance exam for the Ten Immortals' Union, the events on Wanxian Island on the day it was sealed..."</p><p></p><p>"These are all absolute secrets. Only those in high positions within the Ten Immortals' Union could know about these. They sold us out in exchange for some contributions..."</p><p></p><p>"Was it to gain trust, wanting to infiltrate us in reverse?"</p><p></p><p>After a careful deduction, the face concluded that Li Fan was their ally.</p><p></p><p>"Relax, I am not a spy from the Ten Immortals' Union." Li Fan calmly said, "On the contrary, the purpose of me and your Elderly Five Association is actually the same."</p><p></p><p>"We are both working towards..."</p><p></p><p>"The destruction of the Ten Immortals' Union!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Li Fan's tone was light, but it sounded like a thunderclap in the ears of the face.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The face seemed to stand up in extreme astonishment, staring blankly at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he quickly regained his composure, full of disbelief, "Trying to deceive me again?"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the other's reaction, Li Fan continued, "The Immortals' Union is unjust, treating cultivators as cattle and exploiting them at will. Although it seems like the Ten Immortals' Union's rule is unbreakable now, with all beings submissive. But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone changed, sharp and bold, "We cultivators dare to defy the heavens. If we are not afraid of the heavens, how could we fear a mere Ten Immortals' Union!"</p><p></p><p>"Amongst the masses, there will always be some who would rather die and rise up. They would rather die in battle than continue being treated as livestock!"</p><p></p><p>"Better to die than to live without freedom!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the momentum reached its peak, even the face opposite to him was moved by such impassioned words. </p><p></p><p>Just then, Li Fan suddenly changed his tone, "However, the Immortals' Union is powerful. If we don't have the correct methods of fighting, acting rashly is almost like seeking death. We may not fear death, but we also don't want to waste our precious lives without achieving anything significant."</p><p></p><p>"So..." Li Fan looked meaningfully at the face.</p><p></p><p>The face, after a moment of silence, seemed contemplative, "So, you've set your sights on Elderly Five Association?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan admitted frankly, "Yes. Although from the current intelligence, your Elderly Five Association is not a good entity either. But the enemy of my enemy is my friend."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was profound and straightforward, "Or perhaps, when two tigers fight, one will be injured. Let you dogs bite each other, fight to the death. By then, we will come out and rectify the situation, creating a new world!"</p><p></p><p>The face seemed to hear the most absurd words in the world, not even bothering to sneer, just mockingly saying, "So you're all a bunch of lunatics."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mind, earnestly saying, "When the Sage of the Law passed on his teachings in the past, aiming to establish new laws, overhaul the heavens and the earth, most people must have thought of him as a complete lunatic."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the strict rule of the Ten Sects of Immortal Dao back then is incomparable to the current Ten Immortals' Union."</p><p></p><p>"But where are the Ten Sects of Immortal Dao now?"</p><p></p><p>"Passing on teachings, who knows if we can overturn the sky..."</p><p></p><p>As if he had slipped up, Li Fan hesitated for a moment, then corrected himself, "Who knows if we can't?"</p><p></p><p>The face narrowed his eyes, giving Li Fan a deep look, refraining from further judgment.</p><p></p><p>"In a way, we are natural allies at this moment, aren't we?" Li Fan continued.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, according to our current strategy, we have no immediate plans to go against your Elderly Five Association."</p><p></p><p>"We have no ill intentions. From the various pieces of information I provided earlier, you can see that if we were to secretly obstruct, we could definitely cause your Elderly Five Association significant harm without you even realizing it."</p><p></p><p>"I contacted you through Zhou Qing'ang's identity because our identities cannot be exposed on this square inch of Wanxian Union's territory. If someone suddenly comes knocking at your door, you'd probably think your identity has been exposed, and the best course of action would be to escape immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I know people like you well."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, speaking of Zhou Qing'ang, I suddenly remembered. He is still alive. So perhaps we can return him to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke eloquently and confidently.</p><p></p><p>The face didn't look pleased, "Let that fool take care of himself!"</p><p></p><p>After a while, the face suppressed his anger, enduring it, and asked in a deep voice, "After saying so much, do you still want to cooperate with us?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, asking in return, "Why ask when you know the answer? After realizing Zhou Qing'ang's exposure, instead of immediately cutting off communication, you have been chatting with me for so long, clearly because you are unsure of my identity and are considering the top-secret information I might provide, right?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, no spy would want to keep the same identity forever. They make splendid achievements, then retire. From now on, they no longer have to live in fear but enjoy their hard-earned peace. That's the life they dream of."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 501</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan pondered silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that it was impossible to achieve zero loss in a large project like rebuilding the entire Floating Immortal City. The Immortal City was like a huge and intricate instrument. If it lacked certain key components, it might not be able to function properly.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could conceal things in some way, he would surely be reported by those who were secretly watching.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>"The person who ties the bell must be the one to untie it." Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The group of people behind the scenes calculating against him were only doing it out of enmity and for their own gain.</p><p></p><p>They definitely did not want things to escalate to an uncontrollable level, attracting investigations from higher authorities.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Congyun Immortal City would surely be rebuilt.</p><p></p><p>This was the highest will of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, and no one could defy it.</p><p></p><p>As for who completed the rebuilding work, the Myriad Immortal Alliance actually didn't care. But it concerned the future prospects of Li Fan and the many cultivators following him.</p><p></p><p>"The parts deducted from the material list must still be with Zhou Kebao and the others."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the task at hand is to find a way to make them spit out what they have swallowed."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan activated the killing intent without form, his gaze falling on Zhou Kebao in the dim room of the Dust Crossing Boat.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao was pacing anxiously back and forth, with an indistinct figure continuously flashing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the figure stopped moving, and several figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? What did Dantai Can say?" Zhou Kebao asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"The message was sent, but there was no reply."</p><p></p><p>"And there was no reply to me either."</p><p></p><p>"He directly refused to accept it."</p><p></p><p>Different voices suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao's face turned as red as a pig's liver, wanting to curse directly. But his mouth trembled slightly, and he ultimately held back.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, a figure on the opposite side couldn't help but ask, "What does Dantai Can mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, he instigated us before, how come he suddenly changed his mind and stood on Li Fan's side?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright! Stop arguing!" While everyone was discussing, a voice full of magnetism suddenly admonished.</p><p></p><p>This person seemed to have great authority. As soon as he spoke, all the cultivators quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"At present, it seems that we have been played by Dantai Can."</p><p></p><p>He analyzed calmly, "First, he used Li Fan's contribution of millions of Contribution Points as bait to lure us in."</p><p></p><p>"After we spent a lot of money and opened up the so-called 'path' he provided, he wanted to force Li Fan into submission."</p><p></p><p>"And then he would launch a surprise attack..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao slammed the table, "This doesn't make sense! What does Dantai Can want? Although we can't compare with the Dantai Family, we are not easy to deal with when united! Why does Dantai Can want to make so many enemies for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>This statement was met with agreement from the crowd, showing that they truly couldn't understand Dantai Can's actions.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe, Dantai Can doesn't want to be our enemy but wants to completely subdue us!" At this moment, a figure suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that due to the recent Puban Zhenye incident, Dantai Can was publicly criticized by the Lijuexian Veneration. During this time, his position in the family was extremely precarious. Even some of his original aides have defected to other branches of the Dantai family."</p><p></p><p>"He must want to consolidate his position by all means possible, which is why he's targeting us."</p><p></p><p>This statement made everyone ponder deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly! It seems like his plan has succeeded. We are now in a difficult situation! The plan to coerce Li Fan using the construction period of the Congyun Immortal City has obviously failed. Li Fan and Dantai Can are in cahoots. He probably doesn't even need the materials we deducted."</p><p></p><p>"The Mystic Law Soul Corpse, Celestial Black Crystal Shards, Ancient Shadow Wood..."</p><p></p><p>"These things are strictly prohibited for personal hoarding. There's no problem holding onto them for a short period, but if we keep them and can't use them, if they are found..."</p><p></p><p>"We want to sell them, but apart from building the Immortal City, they serve no other purpose!"</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, besides the Congyun Sea, there is no other floating city under construction."</p><p></p><p>"Dantai Can, this despicable person! He will probably come to threaten us soon!"</p><p></p><p>"It's very likely. After all, whether it's deducting building materials or bribing in secret, both are shady activities."</p><p></p><p>The more they discussed, the more agitated they became.</p><p></p><p>It was the authoritative voice that calmed everyone down.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic; the situation is not as bad as we think."</p><p></p><p>"Everything is just our speculation; it's possible that we are scaring ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao nodded in agreement with the words.</p><p></p><p>"Although this person is an ancient cultivator, he is quite mysterious. With a Golden Core cultivation base, he can stir up storms and has relationships with many senior Nascent Diviners. We mustn't be careless." The person cautioned.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Long, rest assured, I will be careful." Zhou Kebao promised.</p><p></p><p>As the light gradually dispersed, Li Fan also withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"So, they are just a group of miscellaneous people." He smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he carefully considered how to peel off a layer from these people.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao's patience exceeded Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>As the rebuilding work of the Congyun Immortal City began vigorously, and more than ten supporting cultivators from the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance arrived one after another, he still did not probe Li Fan as planned.</p><p></p><p>He acted as if nothing was happening, greeting Li Fan as usual every day.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Taoist Stone in his mind clearly recording their conversations, Li Fan would have thought what he saw was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's patience was also excellent.</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush; play along with him."</p><p></p><p>With more than four months before the completion deadline of the Immortal City's reconstruction, Li Fan could wait.</p><p></p><p>After replenishing some regular supplies through Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>The basic construction progress of the Immortal City was not delayed at all.</p><p></p><p>As for the long-distance teleportation array, Tianxuan Mirror, and the Ministry of Administration complex, they would be built in the final phases.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the materials in hand providing a chance for trial and error.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan was in no hurry at all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while building the Congyun Immortal City, he also did not forget the first task assigned by the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>To build the "Dark Lock Formation" in the foundation of the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's skills in formations had reached a considerable level. Having once personally participated in the construction of the "Celestial Lock Spirit Formation", his perspective far exceeded that of ordinary cultivators.</p>

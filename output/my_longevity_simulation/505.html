            <p>The style of this communication spirit talisman is not much different from the Wanxian League. New69book28shux.com</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan solemnly put it away, then with Li Fan, who had been standing beside him seemingly lost in thought, drove the "Universal Virtue True Boat" into the white mist barrier.</p><p></p><p>Surroundings were all white and vast, even at high speed, visual perception was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Inside the flying boat, Lu Fan closed his eyes slightly, as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>When the "Universal Virtue True Boat" broke through the devouring white mist, he opened his eyes full of excitement, "The passing of lifespan has reduced from around fifteen days to just one day. It's almost negligible! Truly exceeding its value!"</p><p></p><p>"With this thing, the white mist barrier can no longer stop us cultivators. From now on, even though the world is vast, we can go wherever we want, no longer worrying about the loss of lifespan!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan's face couldn't help but show some regret, "It's a pity that the principle of this thing was discovered by our Wanxian League, but it was the Five Elders Association who first popularized it!"</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed a good thing. But we've already delayed quite a bit of time, let's hurry to the OneHeart Immortal Sect." At this moment, only a puppet body with a trace of obsession urged.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems like Jiao Dao is more anxious than me." Lu Fan was first stunned, then showed a knowing expression.</p><p></p><p>He immediately accelerated again and flew north.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Five Elders Association, like the Wanxian League, was vast and sparsely populated.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the road, it was difficult to encounter other cultivators for most of the day. Even if they saw the fleeing light of other cultivators from a distance, both sides intentionally avoided each other.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan had been worried about the possibility of trouble from the Five Elders Association cultivators, but it hadn't happened.</p><p></p><p>In this way, they safely crossed over a dozen states and provinces, and when they flew out of the white mist barrier again.</p><p></p><p>The Universal Virtue True Boat suddenly lost control and plummeted straight to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lu Fan reacted in time, flew out of the boat, and retrieved it back into his storage ring before it crashed.</p><p></p><p>"Here..."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, frowning.</p><p></p><p>This place seemed a bit different from where they were before.</p><p></p><p>The difference was indescribable, but the strange feeling was clear and unmistakable.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the OneHeart Immortal Sect?" Li Fan also looked around and his tone regained its usual liveliness.</p><p></p><p>"Let's investigate the situation first." Lu Fan suggested.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>So the two of them started exploring in the WishMoon Province. Similar to the overall layout of the Human Realm Heaven Territory, the majority of the population was concentrated in scattered towns, with cultivators and ordinary people living separately.</p><p></p><p>However, during their journey, Li Fan and Lu Fan both noticed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>Within the OneHeart Immortal Sect, things seemed unusually...</p><p></p><p>Harmonious?</p><p></p><p>Fights, arguments, common occurrences in interpersonal interactions, but in the WishMoon Province, they seemed to be nonexistent.</p><p></p><p>Even when doing business, there was no bargaining between buyers and sellers.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the journey, everyone was polite and unusually friendly towards each other.</p><p></p><p>Although these heartwarming scenes seemed touching, to outsiders like Li Fan, they appeared somewhat eerie.</p><p></p><p>To be cautious, both of them maintained a smiling demeanor and tried not to stand out among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>While secretly inquiring about rumors regarding the true OneHeart Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>In this land, this was no secret.</p><p></p><p>But the answers they got from the people made Li Fan and Lu Fan feel somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Everyone here knew from childhood about the existence of the Great Immortal Sect in the world.</p><p></p><p>They believed that the highest honor in life was to be able to join the Great Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, the exact location of this sect, and how to enter it, were unknown to them.</p><p></p><p>One thing they believed without a doubt was that as long as you were "sincere" and "sufficiently excellent," you could gain the favor of the Celestial Lord and be selected to join the Great Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>This statement seemed too abstract.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Li Fan and Lu Fan a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After leaving WishMoon Province, they traveled through other states within the OneHeart Immortal Sect for over a month. They found that everyone's statements were surprisingly consistent.</p><p></p><p>This left the two of them, who had been anticipating something, somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Dao, after crossing dozens of states, can't we be considered sincere enough?"</p><p></p><p>In the city of Weichang in the Canhong Province, Lu Fan finished his cup of Ling wine and asked Li Fan somewhat gloomily.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Or maybe our strength isn't enough, and we can't meet Zhao Sister's selection criteria?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan looked confused, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>At first, he followed Li Fan with a nonchalant attitude, deciding to explore the area.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the beautiful and extraordinary Zhao Sister, Lu Fan's feelings were more of jest than actual admiration. After all, in the eyes of cultivators, "beauty" was far less important than cultivation level and realm.</p><p></p><p>But since arriving in the territory of the OneHeart Immortal Sect, a subtle change had taken place in Lu Fan.</p><p></p><p>He became increasingly interested in Zhao Sister and the Great Immortal Sect's existence.</p><p></p><p>The more he learned and understood, the more he felt a strong desire that continued to haunt him, making him restless day and night.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he was consumed by his thoughts, almost losing himself in them.</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, the puppet body, which from the start had only one obsession of entering the OneHeart Immortal Sect, wasn't much affected.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Li Fan didn't alert Lu Fan.</p><p></p><p>Not because he didn't care about their bond, but because Li Fan was aware that the subtle influence of the Celestial Lord's power wasn't something that could be changed with a few words.</p><p></p><p>Maybe telling Lu Fan about his change would make him complacent.</p><p></p><p>As the two sat opposite each other, Lu Fan with a troubled expression and Li Fan with a blank face, suddenly, there was commotion outside on the street.</p><p></p><p>"In the Canhong Province, Wan Zailai, with Gold Core cultivation, defeated thirty-six Yuanying cultivators from Yiliu Province, finally caught the attention of the Celestial Lord and successfully entered the Immortal Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly the pride of Canhong Province, he took out his grievances in a fierce manner!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, now our Canhong Province's 'Immortal Sect Disciples' will outnumber those from Yiliu Province! Let's see how arrogant they can be now!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The voices outside were incessant. Li Fan and Lu Fan looked at each other and immediately began to inquire about the details of the incident.</p><p></p><p>"I understand! As long as we do something extraordinary, attract Zhao... the Celestial Lord's attention, we can enter the Immortal Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan suddenly realized.</p>

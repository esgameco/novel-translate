        <h1>Chapter 665</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Although Li Fan nodded in agreement on the surface, he had his own thoughts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Though Fang Zaiji kept saying that the illusory figure in Tian Du Zhong had infinite mysteries and was undoubtedly a true immortal, there was a strange aura surrounding the matter from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>After the immortal path was cut off for many years, there unexpectedly was a true immortal passing through the Mysterious Yellow Boundary. Moreover, facing ordinary cultivators like ants, he would take the initiative to speak and impart teachings.</p><p></p><p>One couldn't help but wonder, how many cultivators would kindly descend and teach them the ways of cultivation after passing by mortal cities?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, it was the norm for cultivators like Shuo Feng to casually slaughter mortals and be indifferent about it.</p><p></p><p>For the presumptuous cultivators who came knocking on the door, it was already good enough not to be killed. Why would they kindly impart teachings?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if what Fang Zaiji said was true, there were indeed issues with the figure of Tian Du. Perhaps, the preaching was not intentional on its part but rather a spontaneous act.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the young boy who stood beside the figure of Tian Du and was the only one who had intervened from start to finish, the Grand Mage of Tian Du, seemed very suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this person was attracted by the Immortal Burial Grounds and was forced to descend to the Mysterious Yellow Boundary. And his true strength might not necessarily be considered as that of an immortal. However, if the Tian Du wasn't able to be taken down by the Xuan Tian Sect at the beginning, then he certainly wasn't weak. At the very least, he was at the level of a half-step true immortal, equivalent to the 'King of Xuan Tian' within the Xuan Tian Sect." [deleted content for word limit]</p><p></p><p>"And allowing cultivators from the Ten Schools of Immortality to enter the Tian Du might just be to cause trouble for the Xuan Tian Sect. After all, immortals would be concerned about things of the same level."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Spirit Qi?"</p><p></p><p>In almost an instant, Li Fan, as a conspirator, envisioned a grand scheme.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all baseless speculations, one thing was almost certain now. The anomalies in the Source Dao Province should be related to Tian Du.</p><p></p><p>"As both descendants of the Tian Du Purple Qi, why not go to the Source Dao Province?" Li Fan probed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji shook his head repeatedly, "Hehe, better not. The Houdao, who has lived for thousands of years, is definitely stronger than me. Wouldn't I be walking into a trap? Master, let's focus on the task at hand."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly and nodded.</p><p></p><p>After this little incident, the two of them spent most of the day and finally arrived at the border of Stone Linzhou.</p><p></p><p>The scene that met their eyes made Li Fan's heart tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking into the distance, the earth was deeply sunken and charred. Everywhere there were flowing black lava, giving off an apocalyptic vibe.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, black molten fires would spew out from the ground, dispersing in the air and heating the air to scorching levels and distortion.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan even more apprehensive was that the ground and air of this charred basin were irregularly scattered with numerous pitch-black abysses, like a festering apple, a scene of devastation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan noticed that these dark void areas were not completely still. They seemed to have a life of their own, slowly squirming towards the surroundings and suddenly leaping to another location. They would swallow everything in the engulfed area.</p><p></p><p>Facing this rather terrifying scene, even Fang Zaiji, who was in the Houdao realm, had a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do we really have to go?," he hesitantly asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't answer immediately but observed carefully for a while.</p><p></p><p>"If we are cautious, there shouldn't be a problem. The erratic jumps of those void sinkholes might appear without a pattern, but they actually follow certain rules. They only jump to relative blank areas and won't get close to the original sinkhole locations."</p><p></p><p>"So as long as we maintain a certain distance from the void sinkholes and proceed carefully, we should be fine."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, don't we still have the Medicine King's True Cauldron?"</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan threw the Medicine King's True Cauldron towards a nearby pitch-black void.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Fang Zaiji exclaimed softly.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King's True Cauldron emitted an earth-yellow light, enveloping itself. In the midst of the void, though the radiance gradually dimmed, it still persisted for over ten breaths of time.</p><p></p><p>"You see, even if we make a mistake, such a long duration is sufficient for us to escape," as he recalled the Medicine King's True Cauldron, Li Fan looked at Fang Zaiji and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you are too daring. What if something happened to the Medicine King's True Cauldron, then what should we do," Fang Zaiji mumbled.</p><p></p><p>"But don't we have you. Even if the Medicine King's True Cauldron is gone, I believe Master, you can refine a new one for us in the Medicine King Sect," Li Fan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji beamed at Li Fan's words and stopped arguing. Following Li Fan, they flew into the charred basin using the Medicine King's True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan identified the direction carefully and proceeded towards the location as per his memory.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly terrifying. I wonder how a pristine sea turned into such a disaster," observing the surroundings, Fang Zaiji sighed with emotion. "We never experienced such a thing before. Looking at this trend, it seems like the heavens and the earth want to completely destroy this place."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Since the Sea of Clouds was vast beyond measure, their flight speed was affected by the omnipresent void sinkholes. Therefore, it took them over thirty days to reach the entrance of the exotic beast's small world.</p><p></p><p>However, the scene here made Li Fan's expression somewhat unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>The original entrance had been completely swallowed by the void. Naturally, the entrance passage no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan recalled that Han Yi had come out from the small world through a different spot.</p><p></p><p>So he set out towards it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they were lucky this time not to be within the range of the void sinkholes, concealed under the black lava.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what if after we enter, this entrance is also consumed by the void? Does that mean we won't be able to return?" Fang Zaiji discerned the situation and just as Li Fan was about to enter, he suddenly interjected and asked.</p><p></p><p>"No worries, I have made preparations."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Li Fan cleaned up the black lava. Then he took out a thin piece of paper from his storage ring and gently pressed it towards the entrance of the small world.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a drop of ink fell on the paper, gradually forming delicate patterns.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Fang Zaiji squinted his eyes, unable to identify its origins for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Star-stealing and Moon-hiding scroll, it can replicate and record the data of the spatial channel nodes. Later, after entering the small world, by performing the same operation on the entrance of the other side's channel, a new channel can be established," Li Fan explained as the patterns on the scroll fully formed.</p><p></p><p>Following this, Li Fan took out a door-shaped talisman and threw it on the thin paper.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped by the talisman, a light-colored door panel formed.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, we can connect over here," the voice of Liu San faintly echoed from within the door.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed lightly, and the Star-stealing and Moon-hiding scroll flew into it.</p>

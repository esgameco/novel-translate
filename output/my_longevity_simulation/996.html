        <h1>Chapter 996</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Based on the currently known information, the Golden Willpower, also known as the Nectarous Essence of Myriad Spirits, is the remnant of the Faceless True Immortal's search for traces of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>It is said that one is born with desires, pursues the Dao, and never rests until death.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Willpower absorbed by Li Fan before his tribulation was purely energy, without the belief of "pursuing the Dao" within it.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Fan actually sensed an extremely subtle desire for seeking the Dao from the Golden Willpower generated by Dao Xuanzi's feedback.</p><p></p><p>Even after being filtered by the stone statue and having the vast majority intercepted, the remaining residue among all the Golden Willpower was as conspicuous as the bright moon in the sky. So much so that Li Fan clearly perceived it the moment it was generated.</p><p></p><p>"Sincerely seeking the Dao, attaining the Dao leads to immortality. No wonder he fought his brother to the death and chased him all the way into the Immortal Severing Realm for the sake of advancing his cultivation technique."</p><p></p><p>"On the surface, he appears to be so unrestrained, but in fact, his heart's desire to seek the Dao is so firm."</p><p></p><p>The desire to pursue the Dao within the Golden Willpower only existed for a moment before vanishing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt as if he had lost some kind of supreme treasure, and his heart suddenly felt empty.</p><p></p><p>However, with the spontaneous operation of the Profound Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra, this inexplicable sense of loss was quickly crushed.</p><p></p><p>"Having obtained the Pearl of the Vast Sea, Dao Xuanzi's future in this life is promising. Even though Kou Hong knew the information about the other strange earth treasure, the [Hundred Thousand Mountains Cauldron], he was not in a hurry to go. Instead, he patiently accompanied Dao Xuanzi to successfully rebuild his foundation. These two brothers do have some affection for each other."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the future, I can take better care of them..."</p><p></p><p>With the small episode over, Li Fan's attention returned to the Tianquan State Bamboo Sea before him.</p><p></p><p>Silently, Lin Ling and the other two had already infiltrated the Bamboo Sea under the cover of Li Fan and Mo Rubin. They laid down the ambush formation inside.</p><p></p><p>Just waiting for Xuan Sushang to take the bait.</p><p></p><p>A great enemy was approaching, but among everyone, only Lin Ling looked a bit nervous. Tian Yang was honest and simple, while Baihua Daoren, after all, was a long-lived cultivator who had survived the ancient great tribulation and had seen and experienced much. As for Li Fan and Mo Rubin, they already considered this Feixue Immortal Venerable to be in their bag.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed, and soon after...</p><p></p><p>Two rainbow lights, one in front of the other, broke through the void and arrived, landing outside the Bamboo Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Bamboo Sea's protective formation opened, and two rows of eighteen female cultivators wearing red dresses walked out in succession to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>But those two figures didn't even glance at them and walked straight into the Bamboo Sea cave residence.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Lu Xichan? Why did she come along too?" Mo Rubin was a bit surprised but not alarmed.</p><p></p><p>However, he still looked at Li Fan, seeking his opinion: "Are you confident?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he had already transmitted the general information about Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan was a disciple of the previous generation's Strategy Hall formation leader, Lu Xia.</p><p></p><p>Her life's resume seemed ordinary and smooth, taking over from her master.</p><p></p><p>But being able to maintain a calm and undisturbed power transition throughout the entire process was enough to demonstrate Lu Xichan's extraordinary qualities.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly and nodded: "Nothing to fear. Capturing one Harmonized Dao or two Harmonized Dao, there's no difference."</p><p></p><p>"However, Lu Xichan is, after all, the formation leader of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The capturing formation I derived from the [Lifeless Formation Crown] you gave me</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"...there might be a risk of it being broken. If reinforcements arrive at that time, it would be troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope this 'Lifeless Crown Formation' is reliable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Xichan's formation skills were top-notch in the Strategy Hall, it was absolutely impossible for her to break the formation in a short time.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from the fact that she had already entered the formation but was unaware of the hidden dangers within, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>The reason for saying this was merely to conceal the origin of this ambush formation.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin did not suspect otherwise. After pondering for a moment, he said, "Even if she breaks the formation, it will take time. We just need to act swiftly and capture her before she finds the flaws in the formation."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, in front of the cultivator possessed by Mo Rubin, a gray mirror-like surface seemed to appear out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of faint light, in just a moment, another cultivator who looked exactly the same appeared.</p><p></p><p>The mirror surface kept appearing, two became four, four became eight, and finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, there was not the slightest fluctuation of aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Lin Ling and the other two were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan sensed that the eight people in front of him were all living cultivators, and there was no way to distinguish between them.</p><p></p><p>"When the battle starts, I will try my best to transmit power to assist you through these bodies."</p><p></p><p>"But it can't last long..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After Xuan Sushang and Lu Xichan entered the bamboo sea, they rested in one of the bamboo buildings. To avoid alarming the enemy, Li Fan and the others did not spy on them. They only made sure that the two were inside, waiting for Shuo Feng's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng was also very considerate and did not keep everyone waiting for long.</p><p></p><p>As crimson snowflakes slowly drifted down in the bamboo sea, Shuo Feng's figure gradually became clearer from being blurry.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the nearby bamboo building, Shuo Feng's face was full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>However, he ultimately did not dare to show it in front of his mother. Taking a deep breath, his expression became calm as water again.</p><p></p><p>He slowly walked to the front of the bamboo building.</p><p></p><p>"Mother..." Shuo Feng slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Feng'er is back home. Come in quickly, your Aunt Lu is here too." Xuan Sushang's voice, tinged with laughter, came from inside the bamboo building.</p><p></p><p>It didn't sound like she was already a mother, but rather like a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng pushed open the door of the bamboo building and entered.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang and Lu Xichan's gazes instantly focused on Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>At this moment...</p><p></p><p>A loud shout, like a startling thunder, resounded through the bamboo sea.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shuo, don't worry. I, your younger brother, will definitely help you persuade your mother and give you freedom!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Fan said this, not only Shuo Feng and Xuan Sushang were slightly stunned, but even Mo Rubin and Lin Ling were a bit confused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Take action!" Fortunately, Li Fan's transmitted message arrived quickly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and the other three quickly took their positions, and the large formation set up by the four combined Daos was instantly completed.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin also did not hold back. The eight identical bodies exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>From each body, a blurry black figure flew out.</p><p></p><p>Then the shadows expanded, and in an instant, the entire bamboo sea was shrouded within.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Feng'er is quite capable now..." At first, after being stunned for a moment, Xuan Sushang still maintained a calm smile.</p><p></p><p>She thought that Shuo Feng had gathered a group of unruly friends to rebel.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had indeed done such a thing before.</p>

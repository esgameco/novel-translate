        <div class="content">
            <p>"There's no need to worry..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, as if recalling the calamity that befell the immortal realm many years ago, Qiaogong Jushi suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say, after all, the path to seeking the root of the Dao is extremely perilous. Even for ordinary immortals, if they are not nameless true immortals who are one with the Dao, they will inevitably face the risk of falling," Qiaogong Jushi sighed.</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, the two fell into a long silence once again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to be digesting these words, his brows tightly knitted, not knowing what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he came back to his senses and said, "What you just said, Fellow Daoist, that non-believers will suffer backlash, is that referring to the consequences of seeking another root of the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Qiaogong Jushi nodded, "Not only will it alert the source immortals, it may even cause the root of the Dao itself to tremble."</p><p></p><p>"Because, from the information we currently have, each root of the Dao is quite pure, independent, and exclusive. Of course, perhaps above the realm of nameless true immortals, there exists an even more unimaginable realm where various Daos merge. However, that is purely speculation without a shred of evidence."</p><p></p><p>"And the theory of the root of the Dao that I mentioned before is the conclusion reached by our Tianji Realm through researching and analyzing the body of [Ancestor]. It was already the consensus of everyone back then, so it shouldn't be wrong." A hint of melancholy flashed in Qiaogong Jushi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I observe that the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique you created, Fellow Daoist, also seems to have the shadow of this [Root of Dao Conclusion]," Li Fan said in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Fellow Daoist has noticed it too. Not only the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique, even the cultivation method of [Defying the Principles of Heaven and Earth to Attain Immortality] in this Xuanhuang Realm actually secretly aligns with the true meaning of the root of the Dao," Qiaogong Jushi lowered his voice, his tone profound.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Dissemination Heavenly Venerate, this person. Although he hasn't reached the realm of immortals, he has realized the control of upper-level cultivators over lower-level ones with this method, truly terrifying and dreadful."</p><p></p><p>"Although he is not an immortal, he already possesses some of the powers of immortals. Just as I said before, either become his believer and cultivate his techniques, or directly kill him." Qiaogong Jushi was clearly very reverent towards Dharma Dissemination Heavenly Venerate as he whispered.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan frowned, "Then according to what you're saying, if Dharma Dissemination Heavenly Venerate dies suddenly due to some reason, it could even affect all the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi shrugged, "That possibility can't be ruled out. That's why I say this person is extremely terrifying. I even suspect that he is the reincarnation of an immortal. Otherwise, it would be extremely difficult to apply the theory of the root of the Dao so skillfully."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned deeply.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had never considered before. It seems the difficulty of dealing with Dharma Dissemination Heavenly Venerate is far beyond what he had thought.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I see that your two guardian Zaohua Golden Men look exactly the same as Dharma Dissemination Heavenly Venerate. Is there some mystery behind this? Could it be that the Puppet Ancestor of your Tianji Realm also looks like this?" After a while, Li Fan suddenly raised the question in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi quickly shook his head, "Fellow Daoist has misunderstood. The appearance of the Ancestor is incomplete and unrecognizable. The reason I designed the Zaohua Golden Men to look like Dharma Dissemination Heavenly Venerate is probably just because it can better..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"This is due to the mysterious and profound way of heaven." </p><p></p><p>Fearing that Li Fan might not understand, Qiaogong Jushi took the initiative to explain: "Fellow Daoist, look at my Heavenly Mechanism Puppet. Apart from being crafted with Source Power, it also incorporates many components. However, that Forged Golden Man is purely composed of Source Power."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is formed from the Source Power gathered by cultivating the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique, it is ultimately influenced by the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate in the Xuanhuang Realm. Therefore, in order to maintain its structural stability, it was crafted according to his appearance."</p><p></p><p>These few words dispelled the shock and doubts in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>If it was confirmed that the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate was the reincarnation of an immortal, then in the future, he might need to keep an even lower profile in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, from the current situation, even if he wasn't a true immortal, he wasn't far off.</p><p></p><p>"That being said, Fellow Daoist, what is your attitude towards joining our Myriad Realms United Association?" After a long silence, Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi had no hesitation: "Of course, it's possible. Now that the path to immortality is severed, ascending to immortality and seeking the root of the Dao have long become illusory matters. To be able to join the sect of this..."</p><p></p><p>"Compassionate Immortal of the Mortal World..." Qiaogong Jushi recited the title with great respect.</p><p></p><p>"It can be said to be a great honor. You should know that now calamities are rampant across the starry domains, and a true immortal who is still alive is definitely the backer countless cultivators dream of." Qiaogong Jushi's eyes were filled with longing and admiration.</p><p></p><p>"If we can rely on the power of a true immortal, the various plans that stagnated in the past due to insufficient conditions should be able to proceed smoothly." Qiaogong Jushi's last sentence revealed the real reason he was willing to join the Myriad Realms United Association.</p><p></p><p>To avoid arousing Li Fan's suspicion, Qiaogong Jushi hastily took the initiative to explain: "Back then, we gained so much from researching the Ancestor's puppets. The Heavenly Mechanism Puppet is just the most basic type in our conception."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi's eyes shone with light and were full of longing: "We will definitely be able to create true immortal puppets with strength that crushes ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Although they can't be compared to true immortals, I think there should be no problem in confronting Longevity Realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked again at the golden power of aspiration that had been revolving around Li Fan's fingertips.</p><p></p><p>It was the so-called power of the Flower of Dao.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>He retracted the golden power of aspiration back into his Calamity Body and stored it away.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, follow me to pay respects to the statue of the Compassionate Immortal of the Mortal World!"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi only felt his vision blur for a moment before appearing in a circular grand hall.</p><p></p><p>In front, a stone statue with an indiscernible face stood imposingly.</p><p></p><p>And the aura felt from the stone statue was very similar to the remnant aura on the Ancestor's body many years ago!</p><p></p><p>They both belonged to the power of immortals!</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi no longer had any doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Willingly, he followed Li Fan and sincerely recited the oath of joining the association.</p><p></p><p>Almost the instant the oath was completed, Li Fan felt the most devout power among all the members connect with him.</p><p></p><p>It was even a few times stronger than Dao Xuanzi, who was previously evaluated as a "sincere Dao seeker".</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because those who have truly seen the power of immortals become even more devout and cannot give rise to thoughts of resistance." Li Fan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>But to follow the path of a true immortal that already exists in the world and become their lapdog...</p><p></p><p>It was obviously not something Li Fan would do.</p><p></p><p>Of course, occasionally for a lifetime or two, borrowing power...</p>

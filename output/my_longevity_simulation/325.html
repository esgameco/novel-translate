        <h1>Chapter 325</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It didn't even cause the slightest fluctuation of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan wasn't the originator of this black light, personally witnessing it burst out from his own body,</p><p></p><p>Even at a close distance, Li Fan would have found it nearly impossible to detect.</p><p></p><p>When the black light made contact with the mountain, there was no earth-shattering explosion.</p><p></p><p>The hard rock melted away like ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the black light did not slow down in the slightest, continuously moving downward, advancing towards the depths of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Everything that obstructed its path was eroded by the black light, turning into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a pitch-black hole about two fingers wide and bottomless appeared before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Under the observation of Li Fan's spiritual sense, the black light was still penetrating the mountain and descending endlessly.</p><p></p><p>However, while annihilating everything it came into contact with, it didn't mean that the black light had no consumption.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the initial beam of light, in just a few breaths of time, the [Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword] that had drilled a hole through the mountain had already consumed more than half of its own energy.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which is superior, my annihilation black light or Zhong Shentong's seven-colored divine light!"</p><p></p><p>As the black light finally disappeared beyond the range of Li Fan's spiritual sense, he couldn't help but think this way while once again examining his masterpiece that resembled a small-scale abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Zhong Shentong's seven-colored divine light, when used, surges across the sky, endless and inexhaustible, indestructible and unceasing in attack."</p><p></p><p>"Then let me see, with the Five Elements Law as the energy consumption foundation, where my limit lies now.

New ùüîùüó Book Bar ùü®ùü´üÖÇüÑ∑üÖÑüÖá.üÑ≤üÑæüÑº</p><p></p><p>Originally, he could still barely suppress it with his own willpower and the effect of the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Mantra.</p><p></p><p>But slowly, the brutal feeling kept accumulating, eventually forming a powerful thought storm.</p><p></p><p>Almost occupying Li Fan's entire mind.</p><p></p><p>The remaining rationality in his heart told Li Fan that this current situation was his limit for now.</p><p></p><p>So he stopped the offensive, mobilizing the power of the secret realm and Blue Flame to slowly suppress the riot in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><p></p><p>The crazed look in Li Fan's eyes finally completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>With his mind regaining clarity, Li Fan slowly exhaled.</p><p></p><p>"Although this Five Elements Annihilation Sword is powerful, its side effects cannot be underestimated either."</p><p></p><p>"But for me, it's still alright."</p><p></p><p>"If I really encounter an opponent that cannot be defeated even with such a long duration of the annihilation black light, then I might have to consider directly using [Huan Zhen]."</p><p></p><p>Having finished the test, Li Fan stood up, preparing to leave this mountain that was now full of holes on the inside.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, your sword technique is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, a somewhat hoarse voice suddenly sounded behind him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body abruptly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>However, he still forcibly suppressed the urge to immediately use [Huan Zhen], and turned his head to look.</p><p></p><p>He saw an old man wearing a straw hat and a straw cape, who had appeared inside the hollow mountain at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was squatting down, observing the traces of destruction caused by the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword below.</p><p></p><p>On the old man's back, there was also a yellow bamboo-woven fish basket.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be something struggling inside, but Li Fan couldn't see clearly.</p><p></p><p>The old man's attire and appearance were so distinctive.</p><p></p><p>To the point that the moment Li Fan saw him, this name immediately surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the information he had learned from the Tianxuan Mirror before, Li Fan felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, it seemed that this Senior Fisherman had no ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>Still not completely letting his guard down, Li Fan bowed respectfully and said, "Greetings, Senior."</p><p></p><p>The fisherman didn't respond, still carefully examining the surrounding void abyss.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't dare to leave without permission and could only wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the old man finally patted his hands and stood up straight.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, similar, but not quite," he shook his head and muttered softly.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Li Fan with interest and asked, "Young man, you recognize me?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior has heard of Senior Fisherman's great name," Li Fan said frankly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in his dantian, on his golden core, the image of the Seven Apertures Exquisite Heart momentarily appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Fisherman..."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to address me like that, it's not wrong."</p><p></p><p>"After all, most people in this world call me that."</p><p></p><p>"Going along with the times, not being stuck on names, there's nothing wrong with that."</p><p></p><p>The old man's expression suddenly turned a bit lonely.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I know that this is not my real name."</p><p></p><p>"But now, even I myself have forgotten my own name, so what can I ask of others?"</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman said with a hint of self-mockery.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan didn't know what to say and could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman seemed to be lost in memories, dazed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly returned to normal and asked Li Fan, "Young man, what is the name of the sword technique you just used? Where did you learn it from?"</p><p></p><p>"Here it comes..." Li Fan's heart trembled, seeing that the other party had finally returned to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to be negligent and answered, "This sword technique was created by Junior himself. Based on the characteristics of the technique, Junior named it the [Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword]."</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman's eyes lit up: "Five Elements Annihilation Sword, that's a good name."</p><p></p><p>"But the 'Great' character you added in front seems a bit grandiose."</p><p></p><p>The old man criticized bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"But well, for a young man, being a bit impetuous is normal." As if remembering something again, a trace of confusion flashed in the old fisherman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already noticed that this old fisherman was indeed as rumored.</p><p></p><p>His mental state was a bit abnormal.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to disturb him, Li Fan stood quietly to the side.</p>

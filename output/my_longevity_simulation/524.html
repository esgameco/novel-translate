        <h1>Chapter 524</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan walked in the Daodao Sect, with many thoughts in his mind. Inside the mountain gate, the festive decorations everywhere finally diluted the gloomy atmosphere brought by many tribulations.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, disciples inside the gate would encounter Li Fan and stop in their tracks, bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan would nod in response one by one.</p><p></p><p>As the head disciple of the sect, Li Fan received the almost inexhaustible cultivation resources that ordinary practitioners dreamed of throughout their lives, as well as the respect that, even if not sincere, had to be shown.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Fan had already made up his mind. He needed to find an opportunity to escape from the Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Zhao has just been promoted to the head disciple, busy dealing with internal and external matters of the sect. Representatives from other sects also come to congratulate from time to time, and she also has to make time to meet them."</p><p></p><p>"This is her busiest time, neglecting me."</p><p></p><p>"If I miss this opportunity, when she comes around again..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Fan made up his mind immediately.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, taking advantage of a moment when no one was paying attention, he quietly came to the sect's exit alone.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the scenery inside the Daodao Sect, Li Fan suddenly remembered Sister Zhao, whom he had been with for over a hundred years, and couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he gritted his teeth and flew out.</p><p></p><p>He rode eastward all the way until he was out of the boundaries of the Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The inexplicable sense of crisis in Li Fan's heart finally dissipated slowly.</p><p></p><p>"My premonition was indeed correct!" he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was secretly rejoicing at his escape, at this moment, Li Fan suddenly noticed two dazzling lights behind him, arriving before him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they landed in front of Li Fan, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>"Where does the junior nephew want to go?" an elder with long eyebrows sized up Li Fan, smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Elders Dong and Jiang..." Li Fan's expression instantly turned unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>These two were members of the seventeen elder disciples in the Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like his plan to escape had been discovered after all.</p><p></p><p>Although this was the case, Li Fan was not prepared to sit back and wait for his fate.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, let the two elders know that Sister is now the head disciple. Although I am honored by this, I am also somewhat distressed."</p><p></p><p>"Sister's position is now respected, and her strength is constantly improving. As a head disciple fellow, with only the cultivation base of Nascent Soul, it is inevitable that people will gossip. The pressure in my heart is great as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put on a very distressed look and slowly approached the two: "There is much to be done within the sect, and all disciples have their own responsibilities. Only I am idle all day, and it's really..."</p><p></p><p>Without any warning, a dark gray light shot out from Li Fan's eyes, hitting the faces of elders Dong and Jiang directly.</p><p></p><p>It was the vicious technique from Li Fan's practice, the "Soul-Cutting Divine Art", the "Light of Slaying Spirits".</p><p></p><p>This direct attack on a cultivator's soul, even if they were Nascent Soul cultivators, Li Fan had confidence that they would suffer greatly under such a sudden assault!</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for their reaction, he immediately activated the "Divine Eye Escape Technique" and tried to flee rapidly. </p><p></p><p>But at that moment, to his horror, Li Fan realized that the surrounding space had been completely sealed off at some point.</p><p></p><p>The escape technique was fast, but there was no place to use it.</p><p></p><p>Dong and Jiang had actually anticipated that Li Fan would make a move and attack in advance, each holding a precious mirror in their hands to block the "Light of Slaying Spirits".</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, they both showed a mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>"How the head disciple treats the nephew, everyone in the sect has seen. The nephew still intends to betray the sect..."</p><p></p><p>"If the head disciple were to find out, I wonder how heartbroken she would be."</p><p></p><p>Though Li Fan struggled, he was already restrained by the two, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"I'm done for!" Li Fan lamented inwardly.</p><p></p><p>When brought back to the sect, he did not see Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his cultivation was sealed, and he was thrown into a secluded room.</p><p></p><p>Although it was called a secluded room, it was no different from a prison.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought he would soon see Sister Zhao and had prepared many words in his mind, hoping to use his eloquence to save his life.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, it seemed like Sister Zhao and even the entire Daodao Sect had completely forgotten about him.</p><p></p><p>No one came to visit.</p><p></p><p>In the enclosed space, apart from Li Fan himself, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't cultivate. Whenever he tried to focus on cultivation or meditate on his techniques, there would be continuous mocking and ridicule echoing from the walls, making it difficult for him to concentrate.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like it was to prevent him from breaking the seal.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan could stay calm. But as time passed, even with his temperament, he started feeling bored.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, he went mad.</p><p></p><p>Continuously using his body, he struck the walls of the room.</p><p></p><p>Of course, besides making himself bloody, it was all futile.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Li Fan's eyes gradually became dull.</p><p></p><p>Sitting blankly on the floor, like a soulless sculpture.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long it had passed when, one day, the long-sealed door of the room suddenly opened.</p><p></p><p>However, no one entered for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to have not noticed at all, showing no reaction.</p><p></p><p>He just let the door open wide, seemingly oblivious.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten days, a hint of life returned to Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He struggled to prop himself up, tremblingly took steps towards the exit.</p><p></p><p>But due to not walking for so long, his body couldn't adjust, and he fell to the ground all at once.</p><p></p><p>Struggling continuously, he stood up again and proceeded.</p><p></p><p>After just one step, he fell again.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he stumbled and crawled all the way until he finally reached the outside, barely considering it a recovery.</p><p></p><p>The Daodao Sect in front of him seemed unchanged from his memory.</p><p></p><p>Disciples wandered among the peaks, practicing.</p><p></p><p>It even seemed livelier than before.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Utterly quiet.</p><p></p><p>The entire sect, not a single sound of conversation or argument could be heard.</p><p></p><p>As if all cultivators living there were mute.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps...</p><p></p><p>Without using eyes or divine sense, they could understand each other's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan walked unsteadily within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Trapped for an unknown number of years, he looked incredibly disheveled.</p><p></p><p>But everyone seemed to not see him at all.</p><p></p><p>They continued their original actions as if he didn't exist.</p><p></p><p>This constant sense of rejection corroded Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after traversing the entire sect and still not finding that target, Li Fan couldn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>"Sister!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister, where are you?!"</p><p></p><p>After a long thought, he remembered how to speak.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a hoarse voice, he yelled.</p><p></p><p>His voice grew louder and spread throughout the Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, all the cultivators in the sect turned to look at him.</p>

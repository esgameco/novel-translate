            <p>The skill of heavenly healing is indeed strong, but it did not give Li Fan that kind of feeling.</p><p></p><p>Even the giant hands that suppressed the fisherman and the master in an instant only made Li Fan feel stronger in battle, but did not undergo a fundamental change.</p><p></p><p>This is an instinctive feeling in the hearts of cultivators, ineffable and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan faintly felt that it should be true.</p><p></p><p>"No matter whether the heavenly healer is currently in the realm of longevity, he has shown the actual combat power that makes the realm of longevity fear."</p><p></p><p>"In front of such a cultivator, even with more cannon fodder, it is meaningless."</p><p></p><p>"The five heavenly venerables will definitely not take action personally, so the war will be stopped."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the appearance of the heavenly healer and how it would affect the course of history in the mysterious yellow world.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a monitoring signal that had been waiting for a long time and had not received a response came.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved, and his attention instantly crossed thousands of miles, landing on Yin Shangren, who was on the shores of the cloud jungle and Yin Yin Island.</p><p></p><p>After studying the immortal and mortal miasma for a long time, he seemed to have finally discovered something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he fell to the ground, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, it must be my mistake."</p><p></p><p>"This is simply impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's face was full of uncontrollable horror.</p><p></p><p>As if he had discovered a fact that he could hardly accept, he vigorously pulled his own hair, urgently trying to calm himself down. [69 novel].com</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no!"</p><p></p><p>However, he could not control himself at all.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the discovery had greatly impacted his worldview, driving him almost crazy.</p><p></p><p>Continuously banging his head on the ground, not caring at all even when blood flowed freely.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear how long had passed before his face was covered in blood and flesh, his expression completely unrecognizable.</p><p></p><p>"I must have made a mistake, how could there be such a person in the world?"</p><p></p><p>"And how could he be this kind of person!"</p><p></p><p>"Start over!"</p><p></p><p>Seeming to find hope to prove himself, Yin Shangren quickly got up, disregarding the blood on his face.</p><p></p><p>Releasing several mortal test subjects again, he extracted the immortal and mortal miasma from them to study.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This Yin Shangren, behaves erratically, who knows what he has discovered."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Another enigmatic person."</p><p></p><p>"Why not just search his soul directly to clarify things!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of anger passed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, this thought was quickly suppressed by him.</p><p></p><p>Although Yin Shangren appeared to only have foundational cultivation on the surface.</p><p></p><p>But various strangeness emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>It could not be ruled out completely that he was pretending to be weak. </p><p></p><p>"Endure it!"</p><p></p><p>The mysterious yellow world is full of hidden big shots.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who has recently suffered successive blows from Ruoming and the heavenly healer, twitched his face and couldn't help but take a deep breath to calm his restless heart.</p><p></p><p>"Continue the surveillance, hoping to glimpse the truth before he burns himself."</p><p></p><p>For the next period of time, Li Fan first reinvested in refining his doppelganger.</p><p></p><p>For this, he specifically returned to the depths of the cloud jungle, digging up the coffin where Zhou Qing'ang was buried.</p><p></p><p>Watching Zhou Qing'ang still immersed in a dream, sleeping soundly, with a smile on his face, Li Fan snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Not knowing anything might also be a kind of happiness."</p><p></p><p>This time he extracted a few more drops of blood and supplemented the coffin with some spiritual stones to sustain his vitality.</p><p></p><p>Then he reburied him.</p><p></p><p>It was a routine process to create a doppelganger again.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the cloud city, there would be some trouble, but overall it was a minor issue that did not affect the overall situation.</p><p></p><p>As the doppelganger rushed back to the cloud city, Li Fan stood on the surface of the sea, staring at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The "Heaven and Earth Yinyang Dice" suddenly appeared in his hand, with light and shadows changing on it.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan understood.</p><p></p><p>"As predicted before, it seems that the date of the arrival of the Red Flames Burning Sea is about to be significantly advanced."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Should I handle it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated for a long time, ultimately shook his head in silence.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to come sooner and burn all traces."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether to release Ink Kill again..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered his plan against Tianyang Zhenren from before.</p><p></p><p>"Let's ask him when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"Whether to be a lifelong divine incarnation or take a chance to unite the Dao, let him choose for himself."</p><p></p><p>"However, according to his 'Tianyang's life is not weaker than others' character, I estimate he will most likely choose the latter."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan's thoughts suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I always thought that after successfully refining the Red Flames and uniting the Dao, facing Ink Kill would be a certain death situation."</p><p></p><p>"But Tianyang is somewhat special. He has died once before."</p><p></p><p>"Now he is more like a puppet attached to a trace of Tianyang's obsession than a living being."</p><p></p><p>"It's not impossible for him to have a chance to escape death."</p><p></p><p>"Ink Kill's several apocalypses were all confined within the Cloud Jungle. If he escapes to a distant place..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very intrigued by the idea of having a united Dao combatant.</p><p></p><p>Originally, in Li Fan's view, Ink Kill was almost synonymous with invincibility.</p><p></p><p>But after witnessing the true strength of the heavenly healer, this viewpoint quietly changed.</p><p></p><p>It showed that Ink Kill was not invincible.</p><p></p><p>"This is worth trying."</p><p></p><p>"If it fails, it won't be a big loss."</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Calculating, it had been fifteen years since the anchoring.</p><p></p><p>The Red Flames would soon be descending, so preparations had to be made early.</p><p></p><p>"Fifteen years have passed..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt a movement in his heart, pondered for a moment, and then took out a communication talisman from his storage ring to contact Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Jiao Xiuyuan rejected the call.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan tried to contact again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Jiao Xiuyuan refused once more.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not get angry, persevering.</p><p></p><p>After six times, Jiao Xiuyuan finally answered the call.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Jiaoyou, have you become prosperous recently? Are you now turning your back on people?" Li Fan snorted.</p><p></p><p>"How could that be, how could that be, it was just something important that I couldn't pull away from!" Jiao Xiuyuan said in a victimized tone.</p><p></p><p>"Your excuse is really quite clumsy, who doesn't know that you have tens of thousands of avatars, in any case, if one of them has an issue, couldn't you have tens of thousands more?" Li Fan said disbelievingly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, my friend, you are really inscrutable! You actually know that I am about to have a breakthrough soon?" Jiao Xiuyuan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, but this time's promotion is a bit more difficult than expected. If there are no other opportunities, I'm afraid it will be delayed for a long time," Jiao Xiuyuan said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How so?" Li Fan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

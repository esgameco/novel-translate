        <h1>Chapter 842</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Wanxian Alliance wailed in despair across the land.</p><p></p><p>Cong Yunhai was also in the same situation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, on Haixuan Island, a few members of the Mutual Aid Society were left behind to enter closed-door cultivation to prepare for the exam.</p><p></p><p>So during this period, there were no outsiders coming and going.</p><p></p><p>This narrowly escaped a catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>However, at this point, they no longer had the heart to study.</p><p></p><p>The avatar Ji Shaoli closed the teleportation array, activated the island's protective grand array, and completely cut off contact with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>He only used the Tianxuan Mirror to keep abreast of the situation outside at all times.</p><p></p><p>"It's really a matter of time and fate. Fortunately, I chose to enter closed-door cultivation here to prepare for the exam that day. Fellow Daoist Zhang Mu and Fellow Daoist Sun Ying could no longer hold on and have fallen."</p><p></p><p>"The symptoms of the remaining brothers in the Mutual Aid Society are also not mild..." He Zhenghao said with a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Mu and Sun Ying were both members of the Cong Yun Mutual Aid Society.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of thirteen cultivators from the Mutual Aid Society outside. Two of them had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to show the terrifying lethality of the mutated Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>As well as the miserable situation of the Wanxian Alliance under the rampant Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>"The other fellow daoists are also in some danger, and they can't even speak properly."</p><p></p><p>"Although they are all brothers of the Mutual Aid Society, it pains my heart to see them like this. But if we let them in, it's absolutely not possible." Ji Shaoli said in a deep voice at this time.</p><p></p><p>"The Mortal Miasma is treacherous and dangerous, and no suitable countermeasure has been found yet. We are also powerless."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli paused, looked outside Haixuan Island, his expression unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Mortal Miasma can also spread through spiritual energy. I have completely blocked the spiritual energy channels between the island and the outside world. Fortunately, my island always has some spirit stones in stock, so there should be no problem in the short term."</p><p></p><p>"But it is impossible for you all to cultivate. You can only barely maintain survival." Ji Shaoli turned his head back, looked at everyone, his face solemn.</p><p></p><p>"It's already a great blessing to have a place to settle down. As long as we can hold on until the Alliance's specific countermeasures come out, it will be fine." All the cultivators sighed.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this Mortal Miasma? It is said to exist in mortal bodies, but it has no form or taste, and no substance. How could it deceive the Immortal Alliance and spread throughout the world in such a short time?" After a moment of silence, He Zhenghao asked again, full of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Deep in his eyes, a trace of worry flashed again.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present, including Ji Shaoli, could not answer.</p><p></p><p>They were silent.</p><p></p><p>What exactly is the Mortal Miasma?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan also wanted to know the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough... are you two alright?" He squinted his eyes, looking at Tian Yang and Lin Ling, who were both in high spirits on his left and right, and asked somewhat unwillingly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, it's better to speak less. Have a good rest." Tian Yang advised with some concern.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine... cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if all his internal organs were about to shatter and be vomited out together.</p><p></p><p>Although he looked like he was critically ill, Li Fan had no worries in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he calmly comprehended the changes happening in his body.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tian Yang, who was beside him, couldn't help but feel great admiration.</p><p></p><p>"That kid Shang Tianci's symptoms seem to be a bit milder than mine. But he still feels somewhat uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>His divine sense searched all over his body, but he couldn't find any trace of the culprit Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decisively gave up and pondered instead.</p><p></p><p>"No physical form. But mortals, cultivators, and spiritual energy are all its carriers."</p><p></p><p>After surviving for a thousand years, it actually underwent a mutation." </p><p></p><p>"This Immortal-Mortal Miasma is truly a product that goes against the principles of heaven and earth?" A trace of doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he took out the communication talisman left for Yin Shangren and contacted him.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, Yin Shangren's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Li Fan, are you looking for me because of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... Fellow Daoist Yin, you're actually alright?" Li Fan looked at his vigorous appearance and couldn't help but feel a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I'm not like you guys. Perhaps it's because I've been in contact with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma for many years, I only felt unwell for a day or two, and immediately became lively again!" Yin Shangren said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's eyes flickered: "Fellow Daoist, you truly have good luck. I'm not doing well, getting weaker and weaker, I'm afraid it will be difficult to escape this calamity..."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, don't scare yourself. Rest well and you will recover." Yin Shangren said, somewhat unconvinced.</p><p></p><p>"You've been infected for so long, and since you can still speak normally. It means the problem is not serious. For those who are truly in a severe condition, within three to five days, their lives would already be hanging by a thread." Yin Shangren explained with his professional knowledge.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll borrow your auspicious words, Fellow Daoist." Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After coughing for a while and taking a breather, Li Fan asked again: "Fellow Daoist Yin, if we're talking about research on the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, I'm afraid there are few people in the world who can surpass you. What exactly is this Immortal-Mortal Miasma? It has survived for thousands of years and is still so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was silent for a moment, then said softly: "The Immortal-Mortal Miasma is probably a product of cultivators going against the principles."</p><p></p><p>"Although mortal, it can also kill immortals."</p><p></p><p>"Ignoring strength and weakness."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was still puzzled: "If that's the case, what about this mutated Immortal-Mortal Miasma? After going against the principles, how can it change again?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that, perhaps the ratio of the number of cultivators to mortals today is even greater than in ancient times. So the lethality of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma far exceeds that of the past."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered the meaning behind Yin Shangren's words.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly an idea surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yin, according to what you said. The birth of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma was to protect mortals and suppress cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Immortal-Mortal Miasma has reappeared and mutated now. Doesn't that mean that the Celestial Venerable who went against this principle is still in the world?"</p><p></p><p>"Why have we never heard of this Celestial Venerable's name?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Yin Shangren replied with some hesitation: "Regarding this, I already have some ideas."</p><p></p><p>"But it can't be verified yet."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm certain that if we can find out the identity of this Celestial Venerable, we won't be far from completely uncovering the secret of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's voice was a bit elusive. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't pursue the question.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he turned to ask Yin Shangren about his views on the specific direction of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma pandemic.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, there's no need to worry. The Myriad Immortals Alliance still has some experience in dealing with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that now, because we haven't found a way to curb the mutated Immortal-Mortal Miasma, it seems a bit passive."</p><p></p><p>"But I think it should be soon."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the method is appropriate, the end of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma will definitely be the same as thousands of years ago, disappearing again."</p><p></p><p>"It will only exist in the bodies of mortals, as a kind of deterrent." Yin Shangren's tone was faint.</p><p></p><p>His words seemed to conceal some special emotions.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 997</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Feng'er, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang flashed to Shuo Feng's side, her expression solemn. </p><p></p><p>Luo Xichan's first thought was to contact the outside world, but she found it impossible to connect.</p><p></p><p>"You scoundrels, in the presence of the Heavenly Venerable, why do you not kneel!"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous voice resounded in their ears.</p><p></p><p>In the dim sky, it seemed as if the Heavenly Venerable's divine form truly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Glaring down at them with an awe-inspiring gaze.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>An immense, intangible pressure suddenly descended, instantly reducing the bamboo building to dust.</p><p></p><p>The entire ground sank several feet amidst the rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang and the other two were momentarily locked in place by this pressure, unable to move!</p><p></p><p>Before they could even struggle, they saw five blood moons appear in the shadow-shrouded sky.</p><p></p><p>"Silk threads!"</p><p></p><p>An emotionless, icy voice rang out from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of threads descended from the blood moons.</p><p></p><p>Like countless tentacles, they silently and swiftly enveloped them.</p><p></p><p>The threads seemed intangible, but the instant they touched their bodies, a sense of weakness rose from their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Xichan!" Xuan Sushang and Shuo Feng's battle armor suddenly appeared around them.</p><p></p><p>But it could not block these formless silk threads.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xichan's situation was even more dire. Around her, silver symbols representing formations continuously appeared but quickly vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Beads of cold sweat formed on Luo Xichan's forehead, shock in her eyes followed by undisguised terror.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chaotic battle, perhaps others not well-versed in formations did not know what was happening to her.</p><p></p><p>But Luo Xichan was very clear - every time she laid down a formation, a mysterious force would instantly shatter it!</p><p></p><p>The formations crumbled before even fully taking shape!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the other party already knew what formations she wanted to arrange. The speed of breaking them was simply inconceivable!</p><p></p><p>At first, Luo Xichan thought there was a traitor in her Strategy Hall who had leaked all the formations she mastered.</p><p></p><p>But soon, as she took out her most secret formations, she faced the same outcome: instant destruction!</p><p></p><p>Thus, the dread in Luo Xichan's heart spread uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be transported back to when she first met her master.</p><p></p><p>The powerful mastery of formations her master displayed left her in awe, captivated, obsessed. The talent she previously prided herself on was utterly insignificant before him.</p><p></p><p>It was a realm she could not even imagine!</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth is it?"</p><p></p><p>The pride of being the chief of the Wanxian Alliance's Strategy Hall shattered. Luo Xichan only felt countless faces of her master appear in the surrounding shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Xichan ah, you have disappointed your master so much!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't tell people you are my disciple. Your master can't bear to lose face like this!"</p><p></p><p>"Luo Xichan, I cannot die in peace!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not like that, Master..." Trapped in the illusion, Luo Xichan trembled.</p><p></p><p>She had completely lost the will to resist.</p><p></p><p>The thick shadows engulfed her entirely, and she vanished into the bamboo sea.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xuan Sushang's face turned pale. But facing the Heavenly Venerable's divine form overhead and the countless attacking threads, she herself was barely holding on.</p><p></p><p>"Xingwang brothers, I already..."</p><p></p><p>After temporarily sealing Lu Xichan, Mu Rubin's slightly puzzled voice came through. </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it just so happened to strike at her mental weakness. Who would have thought that the renowned chief of the Strategy Formation Hall is actually a coward who's terrified of her master..." Li Fan also responded with a strange laugh.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is." The battle wasn't over yet, so Mu Rubin didn't dwell on the matter.</p><p></p><p>"My remaining strength is rapidly dissipating. I'm afraid it won't be enough to seal Xuan Sushang and Shuo Feng..."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, they're already doomed."</p><p></p><p>While the two briefly communicated, the offensive remained lethal.</p><p></p><p>The three from Tianyang presided over the formation, and even with her battle armor protecting her, Xuan Sushang was like duckweed in the wind, in imminent danger.</p><p></p><p>The crimson light protected her mind, but was constantly oppressed by the gaze cast by the Heavenly Venerate's dharma image in the sky.</p><p></p><p>She had already reached the limit of what she could endure.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xuan Sushang also realized that the phantom image above her head was not actually some Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>It was just the best concrete manifestation to intimidate her mind at the first opportunity. </p><p></p><p>After all, helping the Heavenly Profound Mirror split into human avatars violated the system established by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for Xuan Sushang to say she wasn't afraid in her heart.</p><p></p><p>And the strange laughter constantly coming from the surrounding shadows made Xuan Sushang have one illusion after another, making it difficult for her to resist.</p><p></p><p>The gray threads that had been entangling her body since the beginning of the battle were also accumulating more and more.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts and movements also slowed down because of it.</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth is it?"</p><p></p><p>Before losing consciousness, countless puzzled thoughts flashed through Xuan Sushang's mind.</p><p></p><p>The two Dao-attained cultivators were already restrained, and there was no suspense in the subsequent battle.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng's avatar â†’ Hua Shen realm strength, couldn't even lend a hand in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Under the mental pressure of the four Dao-attained cultivators' formation, he had long since fainted.</p><p></p><p>After imprisoning the remaining cultivators in the Zhuhai Cave Abode in the Dongtian to suppress them, Li Fan looked at the two unconscious Dao-attained female cultivators in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Both had world-shaking beauty, Lu Xichan had a noble temperament, while Xuan Sushang was like a young girl, as if she hadn't lost her childishness.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, my strength is about to dissipate, I'll leave things here to you."</p><p></p><p>The boundless shadows enveloping the bamboo sea converged, finally turning into a blurry figure.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan and said slowly, "If there's news of the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar, contact me as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"The body it occupied has been completely destroyed, remember to bring another one next time we meet."</p><p></p><p>"Still in the hidden cave abode from last time."</p><p></p><p>The voice gradually dissipated along with the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"This battle went so smoothly, Mu Rubin's world-covering shadows played an indispensable role."</p><p></p><p>"Even if we're not adversaries, I still vaguely felt the pressure. I even fleetingly saw the figures of the Heavenly Physician and the Xianxu Immortal in the darkness..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect... is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>The thought flashed by, and Li Fan's attention focused on Xuan Sushang and the other again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, should we withdraw now?" Baihua Daoist asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and shook his head, "You go guard the entrance to the bamboo sea here."</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to interrogate them on the spot for information about the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar."</p><p></p><p>The three received their orders and left.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out two [True Temptation Fruits].</p><p></p><p>"Only these two left, looks like it's time to ask the Five Elders Association for some more."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, slowly weaving an intricate web of lies.</p>

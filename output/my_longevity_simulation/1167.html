            <p>Chapter 1165: The Madman Sharpens His Blade at Night</p><p></p><p>After some investigation, Li Ping confirmed that these light spheres were not of much use to him.</p><p></p><p>He then solemnly returned the light spheres to these anglers who had been selected through many rounds.</p><p></p><p>The first attempt yielded no significant gains. </p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not bothered by this.</p><p></p><p>This fishing tournament was organized rather hastily, leaving little preparation time for the people of Daqi. These winners were all old hands who had been immersed in fishing for a long time. Their victory relied more on experience rather than insight or talent.</p><p></p><p>"With them as examples to greatly inspire the people's enthusiasm, I expect the second and third fishing tournaments should bring me some surprises."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the winners in front of him who were constantly turning the light balls over and over, carefully studying them, Li Ping nodded slightly and his figure shattered and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not fighting on home turf in the Xuanhuang Realm. Without the continuous support of the Sage Dynasty's fortune, Li Ping was afraid he would not even be a match for an ordinary Hedao.</p><p></p><p>It was better to return early.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the precious Fishing Pool could not be moved, he would not have personally risked coming here.</p><p></p><p>"There are still not enough manpower."</p><p></p><p>"Subordinates who are trustworthy and powerful enough are really too few."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sighed softly, then silently pondered a solution.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianquan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The secret chamber of the Sun Family.</p><p></p><p>More than a month had passed since Sun Luyuan left last time. </p><p></p><p>According to previous habits, Sun Luyuan should have returned long ago to feed the Wuliang Mirror with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>But for some unknown reason, Sun Luyuan was still not back this time.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan, who was immersed in studying the remnant formations of the Wuliang Mirror, suddenly noticed traces of the secret chamber's protection being touched.</p><p></p><p>With a glance, he couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Wu Ninglu had somehow really found the entrance to the underground secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was trying to infiltrate the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Although she used secret techniques to change and conceal her aura, how could she escape Li Fan's Dharma Eye?</p><p></p><p>His divine sense quietly flew out from the Wuliang Mirror and pointed lightly.</p><p></p><p>The secret chamber's protective formation instantly changed.</p><p></p><p>Hit by the suddenly strengthened formation, Wu Ninglu's face changed, knowing that she had been exposed.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to stay for a moment, she transformed into a black light and fled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched carefully as Wu Ninglu, after making a circle, removed her disguise where no one was around.</p><p></p><p>She was still harboring a fluke, not escaping directly from the Sun family at the first opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, is this real stupidity, or is she relying on carrying the Sun family's bloodline to act recklessly?"</p><p></p><p>"But it has nothing to do with me. I suppose when Sun Luyuan returns this time, I will be able to control the Wuliang Mirror to meet that Mirror Holder."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's prediction was not bad.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, Sun Luyuan came to the underground secret chamber with a solemn look.</p><p></p><p>He also discovered traces of an outsider's intrusion into the protective formation at this time, and his face changed.</p><p></p><p>With a gloomy expression, Sun Luyuan ultimately did not make it public.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he first placed a mass of essence blood in front of the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a trace of irrepressible desire from the heart of the mirror spirit Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>Snorting coldly, he forcibly suppressed his instinct.</p><p></p><p>The Wuliang Mirror had already been refined by him. The sacrifice of the Sun family bloodline would only shake his control over the Wuliang Mirror.</p><p></p><p>How could he let them have their way?</p><p></p><p>However, in order not to reveal any flaws, he still let Sun Luyao act out a play.</p><p></p><p>After "swallowing" the essence blood, Sun Luyao...</p><p></p><p>Slowly appearing.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I'm feeling much better." He said, going against his heart.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao felt immense guilt for deceiving his older brother. But as a spirit tool, he had no control over himself. He couldn't even warn Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>He could only watch helplessly as his older brother fell into the trap of this terrifying existence step by step.</p><p></p><p>"That old thing's demands are getting more and more outrageous. We just provided him with important information not long ago, and he's unsatisfied again." Sun Luyuan looked at Sun Luyao's faint figure, a trace of gentleness flashing in his eyes, and then said hatefully.</p><p></p><p>"This time the request is even more absurd, asking us to pry into information about the human avatar of the Heavenly Profound Mirror? Based on an unrealistic guess, he wants us to keep trying at the cost of our blood..."</p><p></p><p>"Old thief!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan fiercely punched the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of outsiders, he was the illustrious head of the Sun family, holding an important position in the Protector Hall with high status and power.</p><p></p><p>But in front of the true ruler of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, he was no better than a dog!</p><p></p><p>For the survival of the entire Sun family, he had to be servile and obsequious, with no dignity.</p><p></p><p>"Is there no hope of ever turning the tables?!"</p><p></p><p>A feeling of depression in his chest could not be vented. Sun Luyuan's anger turned into courage, and a thought that he never dared to think of before suddenly naturally surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly reacted.</p><p></p><p>He was startled by this thought himself, and hurriedly suppressed it deep in his mind, not daring to reveal the slightest bit even in front of his brother who had already turned into a spirit tool and was the most intimate with him.</p><p></p><p>Because he clearly understood that according to the style of the rulers of the Immortal Alliance, if they knew his thoughts, then the next day, the entire Immortal Alliance would no longer find any evidence that the Sun family had ever existed. Completely vanishing from the world!</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed to underestimate the effect of the hearts of brothers being connected.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, during my last attempt to spy on the Heavenly Profound Mirror, I actually discovered some interesting things." Sun Luyao suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Sun Luyuan was slightly stunned and looked at his very serious brother.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Profound Mirror discovered traces of a force currently in hiding in the Xuan Huang Realm that may rebel in the future, through various clues." Sun Luyao whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Rebellion?" Sun Luyuan shook his head, not believing that in this vast Xuan Huang Realm there was anything that could shake the rule of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But what his younger brother Sun Luyao said next made his heart skip a beat: "According to the Heavenly Profound Mirror's prediction, this force is very likely to cause great damage to the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was shocked, and the first thought that popped into his mind was to immediately report this heavyweight information to the Mirror Holder Fu to gain merit.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he carefully read through the various pieces of information sent by his younger brother and was secretly shocked...</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's faint voice sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I'm really in so much pain."</p><p></p><p>"If this continues, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold on for long and my spirit will be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Being a dog for someone your whole life, in the end you're still a dog."</p><p></p><p>"Even mortals dare to shout 'The emperor takes turns, this year it's our family's turn'..."</p><p></p><p>His younger brother's soft murmurs were like soul-stealing demonic sounds, circling around Sun Luyuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>The thought that he had suppressed earlier in his heart, under its influence, could no longer be contained and bounced out again.</p><p></p><p>"The great opening of the holy dynasty..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan narrowed his eyes and re-examined the information at hand.</p><p></p><p>The temperature has dropped a lot, everyone please take care to stay warm and go to bed early.</p>

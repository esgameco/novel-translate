        <div class="content">
            <p>"This is a painting scroll I made based on the scenes in my memory."</p><p></p><p>"Although I have revised it hundreds of times, it still hardly captures one ten-thousandth of the spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, every time I calm my mind and redraw it, I benefit greatly as if my body and mind are being purified and cleansed."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't realize it before, but after talking with you, my friend, I just thought of it."</p><p></p><p>"The reason I've been making rapid progress recently may be because I often recall the scenes I witnessed at that time."</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu said with an extremely solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"A mortal becoming a divine being..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the scroll with curiosity and unrolled it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it seemed as if the clouds and wind were changing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A thin, weak figure, dressed in white, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The figure was so small, yet it seemed to stand against the entire world.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, clouds kept rolling and transforming into different shapes.</p><p></p><p>Layers upon layers, piling up and pressing down.</p><p></p><p>The strong wind danced, rolling up the clouds like snow.</p><p></p><p>The white robe fluttered, yet the weak figure stood firm against the overwhelming pressure from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Facing the oppression of heaven and earth, he not only showed no fear, but his aura grew stronger with time.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Then the white clouds rolled back, routed and defeated.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward again.</p><p></p><p>The clouds dispersed, the wind settled, and the sky turned clear and bright.</p><p></p><p>Then strange phenomena suddenly appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden lights flashed, accompanied by strange flowers falling continuously.</p><p></p><p>Various auspicious beasts flew from the horizon, making joyful cries.</p><p></p><p>On the earth, hundreds of flowers bloomed, as if spring had arrived in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>That thin figure seemed to let out a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>Then he clasped his hands behind his back and took another step forward.</p><p></p><p>With this step, he ascended to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Merging with the vast sky, he disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu saw Li Fan staring in a daze, and said with some embarrassment, "My skills are limited, my crude work must be laughable to you, my friend."</p><p></p><p>"What was actually seen was ten thousand times more impressive than what I painted."</p><p></p><p>"But it was just an imprint left on that Divine Transformation Wall. I really don't know how magnificent the scene must have been when this mortal became a divine being."</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu said with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xue's painting skills are excellent, making one feel as if they are personally on the scene." Li Fan politely replied, but his eyes never left the scroll in his hands, staring intently at the white figure in the painting.</p><p></p><p>He found it a bit hard to believe in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a painting imitating and recording the image wall, and might be vastly different from the real scene, the feeling emanating from the figure made Li Fan vaguely feel a bit familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai?"</p><p></p><p>In the Fallen Immortal Realm, Li Fan had several brief encounters with this mysterious powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>But they always just passed by each other, only able to catch a glimpse of his blurry figure.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of this, upon seeing this imitation painting, he recognized him at a glance.</p><p></p><p>At Mr. Bai's level, the focus is on the spirit rather than the form.</p><p></p><p>As long as you've seen him once, it's hard to mistake him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan's intuition had always been very accurate.</p><p></p><p>He could almost be certain that the Tianyun Province's "Mortal Becoming Divine Wall" recorded the scene of Mr. Bai becoming a divine being as a mortal and ascending to the heavens in one step.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly recalled what Xu Ke had said with certainty when he saw Mr. Bai displaying his great power and consecutively slaying many strange beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems Mr. Bai may not have been lying. Before parting with Xu Ke, he was indeed just a mortal."</p><p></p><p>"But with a sudden enlightenment, he became a divine being."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Although he had heard about the matter of a "mortal suddenly becoming a divine being" long ago,</p><p></p><p>legends were still just legends after all.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of talent is needed to become a divine being overnight?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to his own arduous planning through hundreds of reincarnations over many years, and yet he was only at the mid Golden Core stage now,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help feeling a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Even if it happened in ancient times that emphasized the unity of man and heaven and had an extremely high upper limit for sudden enlightenment, this still somewhat exceeded Li Fan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>"It's really..."</p><p></p><p>"The gap between people is just too big."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's mind was ultimately resilient. After a moment, following a brief daze, he came back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head inwardly, he sighed for a while.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he couldn't help wanting to personally go to that "Mortal Becoming Divine Wall" to witness Mr. Bai's magnificence.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he became even more expectant for his next experience in the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fan put away the painting and returned it to Xue Mu.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, my friend. Viewing your great work today, I have also benefited greatly." Li Fan thanked sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu was a bit flustered, "I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it. It was you, my friend, who reminded me in the first place to go to that Divine Transformation Wall. If anything, I should be thanking you."</p><p></p><p>Just as the two of them were mutually being modest, a rather sarcastic voice suddenly rang out, "You two little fellows, really making people's teeth ache with jealousy. Who knows if you're acting or just acting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked over and saw that the speaker was the fat man Huangfu Song whom he had met before at the Huanyu Villa.</p><p></p><p>Not getting angry, Li Fan instead responded with some surprise, "So it's Senior Huangfu Song, I didn't expect you to still be alive?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard from Master Ji earlier that there's no need to worry about Dantai Tao being attacked again, so I thought you had already been..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Huangfu indeed has deep connections, this junior admires you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with a completely solemn face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan bringing up his slip of the tongue from before, Huangfu Song's face instantly turned the color of pig liver, "Little fellow, how can you talk nonsense again."</p><p></p><p>"The incident of Dantai Tao being attacked absolutely has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly nodded, with a look of 'I understand, definitely won't spread it'.</p><p></p><p>It almost made Huangfu Song laugh in anger, "You little fellow, your acting skills have truly reached the pinnacle. Who knows if you're playing dumb or really are dumb."</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu looked at the two of them in confusion, not knowing what riddles they were speaking in.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ji Hongdao's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Huangfu. You're so old, what are you haggling with a junior over."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and bring them over, we're about to set off."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao still had some authority over Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song didn't dare to delay. Snorting coldly, he grabbed Li Fan and Xue Mu with his left and right hands.</p><p></p><p>With a flash and change of light and shadow, they appeared on a flying boat.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao was standing on the deck at the bow, waiting for them.</p><p></p><p>Released by Huangfu Song, Li Fan and Xue Mu quickly bowed to Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao just nodded slightly, but his eyes were fixed ahead, not knowing what he was looking at.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ji, this flying boat is?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan boldly asked.</p><p></p><p>"The original plan was to bring you to join up with the other formation masters of the Tianyu Province's Strategy Hall and head to the Hidden Dragon Grotto Heaven to construct formations."</p><p></p><p>"But I suddenly received an appointment and need to rush to the 【Chizha Abyss】."</p><p></p><p>"Some changes occurred there and they also need manpower, so I brought you along."</p>

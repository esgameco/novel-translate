            <p>When he realized that he was reborn into the ancient cultivation world where the Dao of Immortals dominated and a new law had yet to be born, a bold idea emerged in Jiao Sidao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to follow the Daoist Ancestor of Transmission, to become one of the first few transmitters of the law!</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by the current dominance of the ten sects of the Dao of Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Sidao, who knew well about the future, was very clear that this seemingly eternal rule would be nothing in front of the surging tide of the new law.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the army of new law cultivators, with incredible speed in cultivation, would, under the leadership of the Daoist Ancestor of Transmission, sweep away the ten sects of the Dao of Immortals and establish the great Eternal Immortal Alliance after untold years.</p><p></p><p>And there was no greater achievement than being close to the dragon.</p><p></p><p>If he pledged allegiance proactively before the Daoist Ancestor of Transmission rose to fame.</p><p></p><p>Then, after the Daoist Ancestor left on a heavenly journey, he would surely have a place in the highest ruling body of the Eternal Immortal Alliance, the Council of Transmission!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That's what Jiao Sidao originally thought.</p><p></p><p>And that’s what he did.</p><p></p><p>Giving up the hard-earned identity of an inner disciple of the Seven Star Sect, he traveled from the land of Immortal Continent to the wilderness of Congyun Marsh.</p><p></p><p>After waiting patiently for over a decade, he finally welcomed the great Daoist Ancestor of Transmission...</p><p></p><p>No, now he should be called the Daoist Ancestor of Transmission.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Daoist Ancestor transmitting the law had already spread in the surrounding regions a short while ago.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Daoist Ancestor’s reputation was not prominent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly saying he would transmit the law, who in the world would believe it?</p><p></p><p>When he stood in front of Jiao Sidao, his heart skipped a beat, and he quickly restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he realized that these people would be the major transmitters of the law who would govern the Eternal Immortal Alliance in the future, and his heart beat quickened.</p>

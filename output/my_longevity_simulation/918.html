        <h1>Chapter 918</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Amidst the crowd's astonished and shocked discussions, Li Qing's gaze was also drawn to the circular transparent arena in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that Wan Zailai and Pei Qingshan, who were trapped inside, were already engaged in battle.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan showed no mercy and directly manifested a Qingmu Dongtian, intending to suppress Wan Zailai.</p><p></p><p>However, Wan Zailai remained unafraid. In an instant, his figure transformed from one to two, and from two to eight...</p><p></p><p>By the time the Qingmu Dongtian fully appeared, there were already tens of thousands of Wan Zailai's figures in the arena.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Jian Gui Zong!" (Ten Thousand Swords Return to One)</p><p></p><p>Wan Zailai let out a loud shout. His countless clones, with solemn expressions, simultaneously transformed their bodies into swords and slashed towards the Qingmu Dongtian.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was like rain, bursting forth with a dazzling radiance.</p><p></p><p>Even the great sun in the sky seemed somewhat dim at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan's body was instantly reduced to ashes amidst the countless sword lights.</p><p></p><p>Before he could regenerate his body, the newly born flesh and blood were again annihilated by the sword light.</p><p></p><p>The sword momentum was endless, seemingly without limit.</p><p></p><p>The Qingmu Dongtian also trembled incessantly under the pressure of the sword light, in imminent danger of completely collapsing at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"I surrender! I surrender!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan's panicked voice resounded through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of white light, he withdrew from the arena.</p><p></p><p>His figure was somewhat disheveled, and his face displayed a panic completely different from his previous anger.</p><p></p><p>"You flatter me!" Wan Zailai retracted his swords, and the myriad clones returned to his own body.</p><p></p><p>He looked down upon the cultivators of Yilu State from the sky, his white robes fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan's defeat had come so quickly that it was somewhat beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Wan Zailai's endless sword light was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It left them still unable to recover from the intense suffocating pressure they had just experienced.</p><p></p><p>As a result, they didn't even criticize Pei Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The scene fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>"If there are any who refuse to submit, feel free to step forward!"</p><p></p><p>"My, Wan Zailai's, single sword shall block you!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the white-robed handsome youth, filled with arrogance, echoed above Yilu City.</p><p></p><p>Pressured by his imposing aura, no cultivator dared to step forward and engage in battle for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone was clear about Pei Qingshan's strength. Even if he had reached the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, it was impossible for him to defeat Wan Zailai as easily as the latter had done.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid only a Hua Shen cultivator can subdue this person."</p><p></p><p>However, the Hua Shen cultivators of Yilu State were either inside the Yixin Immortal Sect or had gone to the front lines.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were present, they might not have the dignity to confront Wan Zailai.</p><p></p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator fighting against a Golden Core cultivator was already considered bullying.</p><p></p><p>A Hua Shen fighting a Golden Core...</p><p></p><p>It could no longer be described as oppression. No Hua Shen cultivator could stoop so low as to engage in such a disgraceful act.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if they were defeated...</p><p></p><p>They would likely become the laughingstock of the entire Five Elders Council and serve as a stepping stone for Wan Zailai to thoroughly make a name for himself.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present had various thoughts and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, they actually allowed the white-robed youth to flaunt his prowess above them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Yilu State is indeed devoid of capable individuals!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed Wan Zailai said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, it's better not to be too arrogant."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cold voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>It instantly attracted the gazes of all the cultivators in the sky and on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator, equally beautiful to the extreme and possessing an androgynous appearance, slowly flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"I am Li Qing!"</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands in salute, and then a white light guided him into the arena.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Wan Zailai's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>He had always been accustomed to being proud and arrogant. At this moment, being scolded by a young man who looked younger than him, using a tone of reprimanding a junior, naturally made him very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>"Early Yuan Ying stage?" A hint of dangerous light flashed in Wan Zailai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Without using the power of my cave heaven, at the Golden Core stage, I can suppress you with one hand!" Who would have thought that Li Qing waved his hand and said with the most arrogant tone and a serious face.</p><p></p><p>At this point, not only did Wan Zailai's face change drastically.</p><p></p><p>Even the cultivators of Yilu State who were watching the battle below were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I thought this Wan Zailai was already very arrogant. I didn't expect this Li Qing to be even more arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, why else would he step forward? Yilu State has a vast territory and abundant resources, so I suppose this person should be a hidden talent in the fields!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The crowd was discussing.</p><p></p><p>Wan Zailai let out a gloomy laugh: "Very good. I can't wait to see you being torn apart by ten thousand swords."</p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking, he used his strongest killing move.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Swords Technique!"</p><p></p><p>It was the same as the previous move. In an instant, tens of thousands of clones appeared in the arena.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the Ten Thousand Swords Returning to One, this time it was not a simple sword slash.</p><p></p><p>Instead, each clone used different sword techniques with their fingers.</p><p></p><p>The sky was instantly illuminated by colorful sword lights.</p><p></p><p>One after another, sword phantoms of different shapes appeared.</p><p></p><p>Then, they let out sword howls like dragon roars and whistled towards Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>The sword lights tore through space, causing endless tremors. Even the transparent arena that imprisoned them showed traces of cracks.</p><p></p><p>Facing this magnificent scene, the cultivators of Yilu State below all widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Wan Zailai's true strength?"</p><p></p><p>"Too strong! I'm afraid even Primordial Spirit cultivators would be defeated under this move!"</p><p></p><p>"What is Wan Zailai's background? He's only at the Golden Core stage and already so strong. If he breaks through to the Yuan Ying stage, how terrifying would he be?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone present let out deep sighs of amazement.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they all thought that the unknown cultivator Li Qing would definitely be defeated under this Ten Thousand Swords Technique.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could even feel pity, they heard Li Qing's sonorous chanting amidst the endless sword sounds: "No matter how many tens of thousands of sword techniques you have..."</p><p></p><p>"Encountering me, you still need to lower your head!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was not very loud.</p><p></p><p>But in this instant, in the arena in the sky, a scene occurred that made all the cultivators present dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They saw the countless sword techniques that were like tens of thousands of light dragons rushing towards Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>When they were about to strike Li Qing's body, they were all forced to slow down at the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they completely stopped in front of Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Countless phantoms of different swords appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's gaze swept over them.</p><p></p><p>Then, no matter how unwilling they were, under Li Qing's gaze, all these swords trembled slightly and lowered their sword tips!</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing let out a light shout.</p><p></p><p>The tens of thousands of sword phantoms then turned around and changed direction.</p><p></p><p>They turned back and attacked Wan Zailai, who was dumbfounded, in disbelief, and hadn't figured out what was happening!</p><p></p><p>Just as Wan Zailai was about to be torn apart by his own ultimate technique.</p><p></p><p>A white light surged, and in the next moment, his figure disappeared from the arena.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the ground.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, no one paid attention to him anymore.</p>

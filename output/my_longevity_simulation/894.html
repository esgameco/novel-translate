        <div class="content">
            <p>At this moment, Ji Shaoli stood still like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. The expression of shock and horror froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the yellow withered branch in the other person's hand, a mocking smile couldn't help but appear on the corner of the young man's mouth. </p><p></p><p>"The ancient tree of the earth veins, and this mysterious seven-colored brilliance..."</p><p></p><p>"But a Golden Core stage cultivator actually possesses such a treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Since when did such a remarkable organization appear under the jurisdiction of our Wanxian Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a good look."</p><p></p><p>Under the young man's gaze, Ji Shaoli's soul was slowly extracted from his body. </p><p></p><p>In this instant, his body aged a thousand times over.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, it turned into a skeleton, scattering all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>The technique the young man used was obviously an extremely vicious soul searching technique!</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's soul fell into the young man's hands without any resistance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, with the operation of the soul searching technique, a large amount of information surged in the young man's mind.</p><p></p><p>The young man's body trembled slightly, and a trace of horror flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed as if the soul searching technique triggered a certain restriction in the other party's soul.</p><p></p><p>Before the young man could completely read all the information contained in the soul in his hand, the soul disappeared like a withered flower.</p><p></p><p>The young man didn't take this scene to heart.</p><p></p><p>If the content he saw from the previous soul search was true, then the existence of this kind of restriction in the soul was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that after thousands of years, the Xuantian Sect still lingers like a ghost?"</p><p></p><p>The young man couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>From the search results just now, this cultivator named Ji Shaoli was taken as a subordinate by a mysterious Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>They secretly cultivated forces in Congyun Sea and various places of the Wanxian Alliance, intending to rise again.</p><p></p><p>"What era is it, and they still don't give up. They really don't know their place."</p><p></p><p>The young man snorted coldly, but there was no negligence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The ruins of Purple Mist Sect? They actually hid in that kind of place..."</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes revealed a murderous aura, and his figure slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>His figure paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>Some blurry images appeared in his mind, making him ponder: "The Heavenly Control Department?"</p><p></p><p>"There is actually such an organization."</p><p></p><p>"But thinking about it, it's normal."</p><p></p><p>"My previous naive thought of being able to freely cultivate Dao-matching cultivators just by knowing the existence of the Earth's Spiritual Essence was a bit childish."</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance has existed for thousands of years. If it didn't even have this level of control, it would have been overthrown long ago."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the thoughts in his mind for now, Li Fan looked at the ruins of the Purple Mist Sect not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Since the fish has taken the bait, I'll just sit and watch the show."</p><p></p><p>Eyes narrowed slightly, his divine sense swept over.</p><p></p><p>Soon, according to the intelligence he mastered in his previous life, and that faint trace of vitality that would almost be ignored by ordinary people,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan found that Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect who was in a deep slumber in a sealed secret room deep underground!</p><p></p><p>Looking at his appearance, it was indeed exactly the same as Li Chen of the Purple Mist Sect whom Li Fan had previously possessed!</p><p></p><p>He shot out a ray of annihilation sword qi, heading straight underground.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the destructive power filled with annihilating aura, it seemed to want to devour everything in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Just as the black light was about to touch the secret room, golden threads suddenly appeared in the void.</p><p></p><p>Secret room</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The golden threads forming the protective circle around Li Chen began to disintegrate, but they still managed to keep him shielded at the center.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan relentlessly unleashed several destructive sword energies.</p><p></p><p>The golden threads, under the impact of this immense force, caved inward.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if they would snap at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At this critical juncture of life and death, the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King finally slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, his figure flickering and vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, when Li Chen awoke, he first stood there, dazed for some time.</p><p></p><p>Having slumbered for too long, it would take a while to sort through the memories in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could fully grasp his current situation,</p><p></p><p>He suddenly sensed that the surrounding space seemed to have been sealed off by someone.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that he had just been attacked, Li Chen instantly realized that his hiding place must have been discovered somehow.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, as the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King, a being who could calmly escape pursuit from the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao back then,</p><p></p><p>He remained composed and first took out a porcelain vial from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>He drank a mouthful of the seven-colored jade nectar inside.</p><p></p><p>His somewhat withered aura due to the prolonged slumber instantly solidified.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Chen was restoring his strength,</p><p></p><p>A door opened in the sky, and a team of dozens of black-robed cultivators walked out together.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were solemn, the killing intent surrounding them was almost tangible.</p><p></p><p>The one leading them was none other than the young cultivator who had just searched Ji Shaoli's soul in Congyun Sea not long ago.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly as he swept his gaze over the ruins below.</p><p></p><p>"Three chimes of the bell, it is indeed the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King!" </p><p></p><p>His heart was somewhat excited. With a wave of his hand, the black-robed cultivators instantly flew to various corners in the air, each holding a small mirror.</p><p></p><p>Once in position, boundless cyan light radiated from the numerous small mirrors.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the light swept through the space.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the cyan light, the underground space became transparent.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Chen, who was hidden within, had his figure revealed before the eyes of the Wanxian Alliance crowd.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by the crowd, Li Chen's expression was not panicked.</p><p></p><p>He only stared at the small mirrors in the hands of the black-robed cultivators, his eyes flashing with a bit of reminiscence and a bit of resentment.</p><p></p><p>The young preacher, seeing the look in Li Chen's eyes, snorted coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the surrounding black-robed cultivators, under his direction, raised the small mirrors high.</p><p></p><p>Countless cyan light beams were focused on the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King below.</p><p></p><p>The cyan light was like solid shackles, binding Li Chen.</p><p></p><p>Li Chen showed a mocking expression: "Using our Xuantian Sect's items to try to capture the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King?"</p><p></p><p>"Have the cultivators nowadays become this foolish?"</p><p></p><p>A crisp ringing sound seemed to resonate beside Li Chen along with his words.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the cyan light shackling his body actually exhibited a bizarre bend.</p><p></p><p>The restraints loosened a bit.</p><p></p><p>Different expressions instantly appeared on the faces of Li Chen and the young man.</p><p></p><p>Li Chen's was one of surprise and solemnity.</p><p></p><p>The young man's was one of wild joy.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuantian Sect friend, you'd better come with me!" He took a deep breath, suppressing the excitement in his heart, and said loudly.</p><p></p><p>But Li Chen completely ignored him.</p><p></p><p>The crisp ringing sounded again, and the cyan light emitted by the small mirrors began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if losing control, it erupted fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The cyan light instantly occupied the entire Purple Empyrean Sect ruins.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of the dazzling light, right before everyone's eyes, Li Chen's figure instantly disappeared!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 616</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He had known about this matter early on and didn't care much about it.</p><p></p><p>However, Lord Mi Shi was very dissatisfied with the fact that he had colluded with his colleagues.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Gao Yuan, you are really clueless! Lord Mi Shi has extraordinary methods. How could Zhou Qing’ang's little tricks possibly escape his observation?"</p><p></p><p>"To think you are being so clever..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that living in comfort for too long has dulled your senses." Gao Yuan felt regretful.</p><p></p><p>However, the mistakes had already been made, and complaining now wouldn't change anything.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, judging from the reminder to focus on 'unity,' Lord still values some old sentiments."</p><p></p><p>After being reprimanded by Li Fan, Gao Yuan had to take Zhou Qing’ang's commission seriously.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, when a cultivator joins the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, approval from the alliance headquarters is required. Once the information of the cultivator is submitted to the alliance headquarters, their authorization to enter the Tianxuan Mirror will be generated.</p><p></p><p>However, in practice, the process is not so strict. Because the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance rules over hundreds of states, if everything required approval from headquarters, the overall efficiency of the alliance would be greatly reduced. Therefore, in reality, each state has a certain degree of autonomy to temporarily grant new entry cultivators the qualification to enter the Tianxuan Mirror. It only requires reporting the list of new entry cultivators’ information periodically.</p><p></p><p>After the headquarters confirms the identity of the new entry cultivators, they will issue the formal spatial authorization for the Tianxuan Mirror. During this process, the new entry cultivators themselves will not be aware of it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for ordinary Jin Dan and below cultivators joining, only customary inquiries are needed. Only those with profound cultivation, unknown origins, or internal cultivators within the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance system need to undergo the test of the "White Jade Questioning Platform."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance had everything prepared, so Li Fan started taking action.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, a thousand years have passed, and the world has changed drastically. I intended to find the Valley of Longevity the sect master mentioned, but the terrain has changed so much that despite my inquiries, I have found nothing."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid you'll have to go check it out in person. new69bookshuhx.com"</p><p></p><p>With a serious expression, Li Fan said, "In this era, the number of disciples cultivating the Dao is rare. Old Liu, be cautious. You probably won't encounter any trouble."</p><p></p><p>"If you are unlucky and run into any mishaps, it's best to retreat and prioritize survival. After all, the future revival of the Medicine King Sect can't afford to be without you, Old Liu."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held Liu San's hands tightly, reluctant to part ways.</p><p></p><p>"Please rest assured, Young Master. The old slave has been following the sect master from the very beginning. Perhaps I am indeed weaker in terms of battles. But when it comes to survival...hehe..."</p><p></p><p>"The old slave is not inferior to the cultivators of this era." Liu San confidently stated.</p><p></p><p>Taking the map handed over by Li Fan, he carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he furrowed his brows deeply: "A thousand years have passed, and everything has changed drastically. But the old slave will surely complete the mission."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly added, "Regardless of success or failure, Old Liu, you must return within thirty days. The matters at the Cumulus Sea also require your attention."</p><p></p><p>Liu San nodded and said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind a communication charm, he transformed into a green light and headed straight for the inland of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off Liu San, Li Fan entered the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>After completing the "Bloodline Crossing" for more than forty Foundation Building cultivators in a row, feeling slightly dizzy, Li Fan finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into the appearance of Liu Hang, Li Fan awakened each of these Medicine King Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Initially, everything was fine. The cultivators had not actively activated their techniques, and upon waking up, their consciousness was unclear, and they did not perceive the restrictions of "different laws cannot be practiced together" in the world.</p><p></p><p>However, as the number of awakened cultivators increased, an eerie atmosphere began to brew among the disciples.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously pulling away from their fellow disciples and beginning to emanate dangerous glints in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Observing all this, Li Fan did not stop his actions but continued to awaken the Foundation Building cultivators who were in slumber.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere inside the Medicine King Cauldron became increasingly heavy, and a strong sense of killing gradually permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as the number of awakened cultivators in this small space exceeded thirty, as if triggering something, they instantly sensed the abnormalities within their cultivated techniques.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes instantly turned bloodshot, looking at their fellow disciples as if they were mortal enemies.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they were about to start a fight to the death, Li Fan suddenly displayed the Heavenly Cave Domain, suppressing them all.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he added a binding insect technique, immobilizing them completely.</p><p></p><p>"Disciples of the Medicine King Sect, listen up!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice thundered, momentarily regaining their senses.</p><p></p><p>"Immediately cultivate the 'Supreme Primordial Classic,' and transform your learned 'Worldly Lifeline Scripture' technique!"</p><p></p><p>Due to the bloodline crossing, even though these Foundation Building cultivators were reluctant, under Li Fan's repeated urging, they eventually did as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Before long, they gradually regained their sanity.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Senior Brother, what just happened?" All the disciples were shocked and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan briefly reiterated what he had said to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the Medicine King Cauldron was filled with sounds of shock, questioning, sobbing, and panic.</p><p></p><p>Once they calmed down, Li Fan said sternly, "As the Medicine King Sect is facing life and death crisis, having received my foster father's order to take charge of the entire sect, I must hold you all accountable."</p><p></p><p>"These are not ordinary times. With the current external crises, it is extremely challenging for our Medicine King Sect to regain our footing. One misstep, and we might never recover!"</p><p></p><p>"In such extraordinary times, there is no room for errors. I command you all to strictly abide by it."</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who disobeys will be executed!" Li Fan declared fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Since these people had already undergone Li Fan's bloodline crossing, this intimidation instilled loyalty in them.</p><p></p><p>They all quickly replied, "We obey Senior Brother's command!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes, a displeased expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's disapproval, a clever Medicine King Sect disciple promptly corrected, "We obey Master's command!"</p><p></p><p>The others realized their mistake and echoed the same to show their loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>After subduing these thirty Medicine King Sect disciples, Li Fan temporarily stopped awakening actions.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, go back to your rooms and change into these clothes, and do not bring anything with you."</p><p></p><p>"After you are done, gather here again."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan distributed a bunch of black clothes to everyone and instructed them.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect disciples complied one after another.</p><p></p><p>In no time, there were thirty Foundation Building cultivators in black clothes gathered in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He led them out of the Medicine King Cauldron, awaiting the arrival of his avatar, Zhou Qing’ang.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Zhou Qing’ang arrived quietly.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what you encounter, do not panic, just keep silent. With this Senior Zhou, you only need to follow his instructions!" Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect disciples all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Led by Zhou Qing’ang, the first batch of Medicine King disciples arrived at the towering Cumulus City in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>In terms of grandeur, the current Cumulus City was no less than the main gate of the former Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Hence, they did not attract too much attention.</p><p></p><p>The people in the city saw a group of unfamiliar cultivators following behind Zhou Qing’ang and, while curious, assumed it was a matter within the city and paid no further attention.</p>

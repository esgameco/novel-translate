After waiting for nearly a month and still not hearing any related news, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little confused.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't make sense."</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over and carefully reviewing the situation, Li Fan felt that the problem could only lie with that Dharma transmitter.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of one of the supreme rulers of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, an existence that has survived since the ancient great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's still not comparable to that 'Hunger' character above the Immortal Ruins, the destructive power of the gray mold spot should also be above that of an ordinary immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to resolve it so easily and silently..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, perhaps the correct way to use the gray mold spot is to first secretly devour various places in the Xuanhuang Realm, and then detonate at multiple points simultaneously..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan, who was well-versed in pharmacology, was pondering to himself, the only ideological demon he had left behind, the one occupied by Mo Rubin, finally arrived late once again and sent a message.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, is everything alright?"</p><p></p><p>"Who? Where did this petty thief come from!" Li Fan pretended to have already forgotten what the other party looked like.</p><p></p><p>Without saying another word, he was about to launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>But without the assistance of countless demons, in terms of spiritual power alone, Li Fan was obviously no match for Mo Rubin at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin defended while trying to awaken "Sun Xingwang's" memory. New 67 Book Bar 89SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>After pretending for a while, as an empty stone statue slowly emerged in the empty sea of consciousness, emitting a faint golden light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also slowly stopped his attack.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Mo Rubin for a good while, his expression unfathomable, and said, "You finally came."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, we two brothers almost couldn't see each other again."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was unpleasant, and he glared angrily, "Didn't we agree that when the time came, you would directly step forward and take on the task of sweeping away the demons? How come it was a cunning young man who came?"</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the critical moment when the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate Immortal blessed me, I would have almost fallen for his trick and revealed all the secrets!"</p><p></p><p>"Or was this the result you wanted all along? Using someone else to do your dirty work?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of murderous intent appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's expression changed abruptly, "Brother Xingwang, don't misunderstand! I didn't expect that the Dharma transmitter Jiang would choose to take action personally either!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the commotion you caused was a bit too big, almost overturning the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I was quite startled at the time."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of helplessness in Mo Rubin's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? So it's still my fault?" </p><p></p><p>Although the sea of consciousness was bright and clear, after these words were spoken, Mo Rubin suddenly felt a bit eerie. New 67 Book Bar 89shux.com</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent the other party from going crazy, he quickly changed the subject, "By the way, Brother Xingwang, how exactly did you drive him back? From his subsequent actions, it seems that he returned empty-handed without any gains."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said impatiently, "I already said it was the blessing of the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate Immortal! Otherwise, I would have still been foolishly thinking that I was him and he was me!"</p><p></p><p>After all, only the other few Dharma transmitters knew about Dharma transmitter Jiang's nature.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin inadvertently glanced at the stone statue gradually fading above his head, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"However, our ultimate goal has been achieved. This time I resolved the crisis of demons running rampant. According to convention, after</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"For some time to come, I will be responsible for the important affairs of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"So it's time to put more pressure on the Xuantian Mirror," said Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand: "As usual, you figure out a way, and just let me know if you need me to do anything!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin smiled: "Brother Xingwang, you won't need to take action again this time. Just wait patiently. I will contact you again when there is progress."</p><p></p><p>"This time it's mainly to check on your situation. After all, Transmitter Jiang is really difficult to deal with. I have been avoiding direct contact with him..." Mo Rubin's tone was somewhat heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me more about this Transmitter, so that I won't be caught off guard if I run into him again in the future," Li Fan said, following the conversation.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, on the day he took action, I wanted to warn you. But at that time, it was during the Transmitter Council, and sending out a warning was already the limit."</p><p></p><p>"Transmitter Jiang is the first among all Transmitters. He has the supreme characteristic of 【Everything is as I am】..."</p><p></p><p>"That Gui Xu realm is left by the Transmitting Heavenly Venerate, and can infinitely 【return to the origin】..."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to Transmitter Jiang, Transmitter Jiang is also an extremely difficult enemy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>This time, Mo Rubin did not conceal anything and told everything he knew about the various Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>"It should be noted that, except for Transmitter Jiang who has always held nothing back, other Transmitters, more or less, have their own secrets that are unknown to others."</p><p></p><p>"After all, they have controlled the highest power of the Myriad Immortal Alliance for so many years, with almost countless resources at their disposal..."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows what strange things they have secretly researched. For example, the previous 【Patrolling Heaven Arrow】 was provided by Transmitter Zhao with a mature manufacturing plan."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a conversation, Li Fan not only learned the reason why the gray mold spots did not break out.</p><p></p><p>He also obtained a lot of intelligence about the Transmitters who have always been behind the scenes for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Each Transmitter is a true privileged class of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, with almost unlimited contribution quotas and the highest level of merit at the 49th level each year.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in order to maintain the appearance of the Immortal Alliance system, they enter the system of contribution and merit levels.</p><p></p><p>The Transmitters rely on the Xuanhuang Realm and the Tao established by the Transmitting Heavenly Venerate to exist. Although they can no longer attain immortality, they can still live as long as heaven and earth, and remain young forever.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is said that even if they fall due to some reason, they can reappear in the world by restoring a certain 【backup】 method.</p><p></p><p>Of course, since the birth of the Immortal Alliance, there has never been a case of a Transmitter being attacked and falling.</p><p></p><p>So Mo Rubin didn't know its authenticity either.</p><p></p><p>There are eighteen seats of Transmitters in total, which have not changed since the establishment of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It will never change in the future either.</p><p></p><p>They are the true top brass of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, and any so-called system or decree of the Myriad Immortal Alliance has lost its effect on them.</p><p></p><p>Only the resolutions within the Transmitter Council can affect them.</p><p></p><p>They also have privileges that ordinary cultivators dare not even think about.</p><p></p><p>For example: conscription.</p><p></p><p>Within the territory of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, if any cultivator is selected, regardless of the reason, they have the power to conscript this cultivator into their own small world.</p><p></p><p>And the selected cultivator will disappear as if they have evaporated from the world.</p><p></p><p>No data will be kept.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 799</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>From it, a faint light was emitted. Many blurry images appeared along with the light. When Gu Xinghan was attracted by the images in this light, this jade plate seemed to be like a living thing, conveying a sense of thirst.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan, who came to his senses, was a little confused for a moment. And a little surprised. However, he had heard of treasures having spirituality. After quickly accepting this setting, Gu Xinghan began to feel the jade plate's desire. But it was just a blurry and instinctive reaction. The jade plate could not speak, and it was all up to him to guess...</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan tried various methods, trying to satisfy the jade plate. Spirit stones, ore jade, herbs... The jade plate didn't seem to have the slightest interest in any of these. It still relentlessly emanated a desire for Gu Xinghan. In addition, the other little partners had all successfully built their foundations. He always didn't know how to explain it. The superposition of the two reasons made Gu Xinghan irritable. </p><p></p><p>It was by chance that he saw Elder Fang Zaiji preparing the [Final Disc] for the newly recruited core disciples. The jade plate's frantic agitation instantly made Gu Xinghan understand its goal. "This..." Gu Xinghan was a little hesitant. After all, this Final Disc was a precious thing that Elder Fang repeatedly instructed to be valued. If there was a mistake.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he couldn't resist the jade plate. In a flash of light, the jade plate appeared in his sea of consciousness. Under Gu Xinghan's nervous observation, the jade plate slowly flew down on the Final Disc. Then, from its bottom, it extended dense, tentacle-like small light columns. Sticking to the Final Disc.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Xinghan thought that the jade plate would damage the Final Disc. But after observing for a moment, he found that this was not the case. Instead, the two seemed to be merging into one through those sticky light tentacles. This put Gu Xinghan at ease. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be that these two jade plates and discs are actually the same thing?" Gu Xinghan couldn't help but think so. However, after all, he had a childish nature. Gu Xinghan, who had no results in his research, quickly put it aside. Instead, he began to study the images obtained from the jade plate. </p><p></p><p>"Laying my foundation with me? What is this? It seems to match the situation in my body?" Gu Xinghan was overjoyed. He immediately stopped managing the jade plate and focused on studying the method of laying the foundation with himself. When he woke up from the epiphany, the jade plate had already completely merged with the Final Disc. It's just that this merging process seemed to be forced, like the jade plate was lying on top. And the final product was not so beautiful.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Xinghan didn't care about this point. He knew that this jade plate might indeed be an incredible treasure. Although Gu Xinghan was young, he was not simple. Instead, he was very sober about the dangers of the world. He knew the principle of "a commoner is innocent, but a treasure is guilty", so he decided to conceal the existence of both the jade plate and the method of laying the foundation with himself. </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I can use this new jade plate as a cover. Claim to the outside world that it is my foundation-building wonder..." Little Gu Xinghan thought so. Just like that, under the circumstances that no one knew, the only cultivator in the world who [laid the foundation with himself] began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, his performance made people like Liu San of the Medicine King Sect feel inexplicably happy. Learning with one teaching, mastering all with one understanding. Invincible in the same realm, easily fighting against Golden Core. Gu Xinghan became the most outstanding junior disciple of the Medicine King Sect for a while. Almost the entire sect placed high hopes on him.</p><p></p><p>But... His peak period was as fleeting as a meteor. Before long, his peers broke through to the Golden Core and Nascent Soul realms one after another. And Gu Xinghan was still stuck in place. Thinking that there was something wrong with Gu Xinghan's body, they took turns to personally check for him. But no one could figure out what was going on. </p><p></p><p>And when asked Gu Xinghan himself, he only said that he had tried his best, but he still couldn't go further. In the blink of an eye, thirty years passed. The Medicine King Sect had no choice but to accept this fact. Officially gave up on cultivating Gu Xinghan. But they didn't criticize him too much, and still let him use many resources. It's just that they no longer paid too much attention to him.</p><p></p><p>Facing his juniors whose cultivation levels had surpassed him one by one, Gu Xinghan became more and more silent. He stayed in seclusion all day long, not caring about worldly affairs. Rarely interacted with outsiders. Almost forgotten by everyone. In this way, two hundred and sixty-three years passed. The white-haired Gu Xinghan finally reached the end of his life. </p><p></p><p>"Mixed Yuan Golden Core, Mixed Yuan Golden Core..." "What exactly is Mixed Yuan?" He laughed miserably, his face looking bitter.</p><p>"I want to start from scratch and forge a new path. It's too difficult, really too difficult..."</p><p>"With my successful foundation establishment, I don't even have a chance to regret or change to a new method."</p><p>Suddenly, a warm and smooth jade plate appeared in his hand.</p><p>Compared to more than two hundred years ago, the jade plate's brilliant light had now completely receded.</p><p>Just like a stone that could be seen everywhere on the roadside, it wouldn't attract anyone's attention at all.</p><p>Gu Xinghan looked at this jade plate that had accompanied him for almost his entire life, with a complex expression.</p><p>"Misled me for life, misled me for life..."</p><p>He muttered under his breath.</p><p>Finally, he held the jade plate tightly in his hand. Filled with reluctance, he passed away suddenly.</p><p>Gu Xinghan's death did not cause the slightest ripple.</p><p>Even because no unusual signs appeared after his death, his corpse was not discovered until three years later. </p><p>More than two hundred years had passed, and Changsheng Valley had long changed beyond recognition.</p><p>No one remembered this former hope of the Medicine King Sect anymore.</p><p>No one paid attention.</p><p>The funeral was simple.</p><p>Soon, Gu Xinghan's body was buried in the Medicine King Sect's disciple cemetery in the Beast Realm.</p><p>As one of his few belongings, no one cared about the jade plate in Gu Xinghan's hand.</p><p>It was buried deep underground along with him.</p><p>From then on, it existed in endless darkness.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>Inside the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p>A figure that looked extremely similar to Li Fan, but was extremely frail, let out a muffled groan.</p><p>Wiping the blood constantly flowing from his mouth and nose with his hand, as if he would die from excessive blood loss at any time.</p><p>But his face remained unchanged.</p><p>"A moment in the cauldron, a thousand years in Xuanhuang."</p><p>He coughed lightly, his eyes filled with endless emotion.</p><p>"To be able to personally experience the difference in time flow, this feeling is truly wonderful beyond words."</p><p>Inside the Medicine King True Cauldron was the [Sacred Fetus Li Fan].</p><p>As part of the plan to deceive others, it was a layer of avatar created by Li Fan using his own essence blood and the [Sacred Blood Incarnation Method] before Mr. Bai's arrival.</p><p>Time was short, and his aptitude was the same as the original body.</p><p>So he was just an ordinary person without any cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, the images transmitted from the [Separation Plate] he transformed into were getting faster and faster.</p><p>The massive amount of information almost made his brain burst.</p><p>Fortunately, in the end everything returned to darkness.</p><p>This allowed him to recover a little.</p><p>"Although transformed into an object, because this sacred fetus of mine still exists, I can actually remotely perform simple control over the transformed object."</p><p>"But that's the limit."</p><p>He didn't see the images recorded on the Separation Plate of the battle between the Dharma Transmission and Mr. Bai that took place in the Xuanhuang Realm, as he was outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>But being able to witness the Venerable Dharma Transmission take action for the first time with his own eyes was already a big enough gain for Li Fan.</p><p>Putting aside the thoughts about Dharma Transmission for now, the sacred fetus Li Fan was now becoming a little excited.</p><p>Because he was about to see the legendary [Immortal Ruins].</p><p>Creaking sounds came from all over the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p>Enough to indicate the enormous pressure it was under.</p><p>The sacred fetus Li Fan then used the telescope prepared in advance inside the Medicine King Cauldron to peek at the Immortal Ruins.</p><p>Ahead, it was pitch black.</p><p>The speed of the Medicine King Cauldron was getting faster and faster.</p><p>Huge roaring sounds rose from all directions.</p><p>As if there was a risk of disintegration at any time.</p><p>However, in the sacred fetus Li Fan's field of vision, he still couldn't see anything.</p><p>"Is this it?"</p><p>He was a little disappointed.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Medicine King Cauldron began to disintegrate.</p><p>The violent shaking made it almost impossible for him to stand steady.</p><p>The sacred fetus Li Fan struggled and took the telescope to hide in the core part of the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p>Under the increasing pressure that was almost unimaginable, the Medicine King Cauldron finally couldn't hold on and shattered into countless pieces.</p><p>At the same time, it fell towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p>Just a moment later, the sacred fetus Li Fan felt that even eternal metal wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p><p>But due to his innate personality, he didn't give up either.</p><p>He still raised the telescope and looked ahead.</p><p>Instantly, he was slightly stunned.</p><p>In his originally pitch-black field of vision, at some unknown time, a stretch of wilderness appeared.</p><p>Countless ruins were scattered across the wilderness.</p><p>A tall corpse sat cross-legged on the earth.</p><p>The flesh had almost completely disappeared, leaving only a layer of skin drooping over the bones.</p><p>Dozens of blood-red chains were deeply embedded in the ground.</p><p>Trapping this skeleton on the wilderness.</p><p>And around the corpse, deep trenches crisscrossed.</p><p>On the wilderness earth, they outlined an extremely intricate symbol.</p><p>Although he didn't recognize this symbol, the moment he saw it.</p><p>Li Fan naturally knew its meaning.</p><p>It was a character.</p><p>The character for [Hunger]!</p><p>An endless sense of hunger suddenly surged in the sacred fetus Li Fan's mind.</p><p>At the same time...</p>

            <p>"In this world, there are many things that defy common sense, mountains and rivers change easily, devouring element white mist, the celestial and mortal miasma...</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the Heavenly Sovereign passed on his teachings, the stage has been set for an alternating performance. New 69 Book Bar -> 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"Since that day, I have done everything in my power to try and uncover the secrets behind it."</p><p></p><p>The tone of Yin Shangren was deep, his expression trance-like.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>But what followed was a long period of silence.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Yin Shangren turned around, looked at Li Fan, and with a mocking expression said, "Are you hoping for me to tell you the answer?"</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking?"</p><p></p><p>"I am nothing more than an ordinary foundational cultivator. The mysteries of this world, such as the celestial and mortal miasma, have consumed all my energy. As for the others..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren sneered, "I am not interested."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not angered, he calmly asked, "In that case, could you kindly inform me of the secrets of the celestial and mortal miasma, friend?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure." Yin Shangren readily answered.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial and mortal miasma, it is..." He stopped midway and suddenly his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>With disdain on his face, he spat out and glared at Li Fan with anger, "You also deserve to know?"</p><p></p><p>"You selfish and self-serving cultivator! Revealing his deeds to you would be a great disrespect to him!"</p><p></p><p>"I would rather have all his actions remain buried in history, never to be known to the world! Otherwise, people like you would not only not admire him but would secretly mock him..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren seemed to get very agitated, his gaze towards Li Fan was that of an enemy's. New 69 Book Bar -> 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze towards Yin Shangren slowly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>He immediately activated the Binding Insect technique to capture and interrogate him. At the same time, he was prepared for any sudden outbreak of strength from Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>The result, however, was unexpectedly smooth. Without any resistance, Yin Shangren was captured, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>But shortly after, Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he suddenly realized that the "Yin Shangren" bound by the Binding Insect technique had lost its "life" in an instant, turning into a corpse.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then looked at the other corpses in the basement.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the piled-up, corpse-like bodies on the ground had all raised their heads.</p><p></p><p>All of them stared at Li Fan, revealing a ferocious smile.</p><p></p><p>"Fooling around!" Li Fan was not scared by this eerie scene, he snorted coldly, and in an instant, the Five Elements Heaven Domain enveloped Yan Island.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Five Elements circulated, like a shackle, attempting to suppress all the hundreds of corpses here.</p><p></p><p>But before Li Fan could actually make a move, all those "corpses" of Yin Shangren that were in the area covered by the Heaven Domain inexplicably lost their breath of life one by one, completely dead.</p><p></p><p>This left Li Fan feeling as if he had punched into thin air, frustrated.</p><p></p><p>He swept his divine sense across the entire island, trying to find traces of Yin Shangren. But at this moment, there was no living being on the island except for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Did he commit suicide? I refuse to believe it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, exerting the power of the Heaven Domain, he pulverized all the bodies on the ground into dust. New 69 Book Bar -> 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>But even after they all disappeared, nothing unusual happened.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Yin Shangren had truly perished.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan did not relax at all, he became more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Tick tock...</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound next to his ear, Li Fan's pupils shrank suddenly.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand, and a drop of rainwater appeared out of thin air above him.</p><p></p><p>Then it fell into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Splish splash...</p><p></p><p>The rain grew heavier, and slowly, black shadows fell from above along with the rain.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>They were bodies, whether mutilated or intact!</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan even more chilled was that the faces of these bodies were no longer Yin Shangren's, but his own!</p><p></p><p>After landing on the ground, the bodies struggled to lift their heads with strange and grotesque movements.</p><p></p><p>Just like Yin Shangren before, they stared at him intently!</p><p></p><p>With the same ominous smile on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Without holding back, he thought for a moment, and the Pox Heaven Sword flashed in the basement.</p><p></p><p>The sword light spread, grinding the bodies on the ground into pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Kiki..." A weird laughing sound came from their mouths as they disappeared, as if mocking invisibly.</p><p></p><p>As the bodies vanished temporarily, Li Fan's figure flickered and he had already left the Yan Island in an instant, trying to shake off these eerie bodies.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Tick tock.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had flown out hundreds of miles in an instant, Li Fan still felt the icy raindrops falling on his face.</p><p></p><p>This time Li Fan used the Chaotic Five-Element Life-Depleting Sword.</p><p></p><p>Numerous bodies had just fallen from the sky and were annihilated by Li Fan's sword light.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's face became even more gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that dealing with these bodies seemed more strenuous compared to the last time. Although it was just a subtle difference, there was indeed an increase in energy consumption.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, as the rain continued to fall, the process of Li Fan repeatedly eliminating the bodies confirmed his suspicions.</p><p></p><p>"Troublesome..." Li Fan's face looked grim.</p><p></p><p>He had almost tried all the methods he currently had in hand, yet he could not shake off the entanglement of these eerie bodies.</p><p></p><p>And those bodies that were growing more and more similar to him seemed to be getting 'stronger,' making them more difficult to handle.</p><p></p><p>If this continued...</p><p></p><p>"Am I going to be forced into a corner?" Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he glanced at the True Board and saw a technique he had never fully utilized before.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it once."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As the Chaotic technique took shape, Li Fan felt a sudden surge of spiritual power in his body.</p><p></p><p>As if under tremendous pressure, inside the Five Elements Heaven Domain, there were creaking sounds echoing constantly.</p><p></p><p>Even the normal circulation of the power of the Five Elements was affected.</p><p></p><p>Within the Wood attribute Heaven Domain, the powers of Water, Fire, Metal, and Earth attributes emerged.</p><p></p><p>The same occurred in the other Heaven Domains.</p><p></p><p>The recently born Five Elements Heaven Domain was suddenly plunged into a state of unparalleled chaos. Various strange and peculiar phenomena began to occur.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan, as the master of the Heaven Domain, had no time to spare.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, numerous illusions appeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>No, instead of illusions, it was as if in that moment, he personally experienced countless cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The different experiences of each cycle of reincarnation were vividly appearing in his mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>As if he had split into countless versions of himself, Li Fan felt as if his head was about to explode.</p><p></p><p>At this critical moment, the Xuanhuang Refining Heart Scripture, which had been automatically operating silently, suddenly surged up.</p><p></p><p>"Translations by Google Translate and corrected by a Mandarin Chinese speaker."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1154: Changes in Rebuilding the Foundation</p><p></p><p>"Doing this, isn't it a bit of a waste of resources?" Shang Shaojun asked Li Fan secretly through voice transmission, in front of his trusted subordinate Yan Huan.</p><p></p><p>Then, seeing Li Fan's ambiguous smile, Shang Shaojun also felt that something was amiss. He lightly coughed to cover up his embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>"The name 'Immortal Heart Mantra' is too ostentatious. Shaojun, you can change it to a more ordinary name before passing it down," Li Fan reminded.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun, recalling the techniques previously taught by Yan Faju, said to Yan Huan, "This is the 'Heart Tempering Formula,' passed down by this senior. It can protect you all from being eroded by the demonic sounds. Quickly spread it to the entire army and make sure everyone learns it."</p><p></p><p>The name "Heart Tempering Formula" was so ordinary that Yan Huan didn't show much excitement upon hearing Shang Shaojun's words. He simply bowed to accept the order and began practicing it on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Having such a secret technique at their disposal, yet they are unaware of its value. They truly are..." Shang Shaojun sighed as he watched Yan Huan's receding figure.</p><p></p><p>"If they knew how precious this secret technique is, they might become anxious and find it difficult to learn," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingxuan Army has a million members. Although I have already ordered a strict ban on spreading it, the leakage of the Immortal Heart Mantra is probably inevitable. Isn't my friend worried?" Shang Shaojun looked at Li Fan, full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's series of actions after arriving at the Eternal Immortal Fortress were completely unfathomable to Shang Shaojun. It wasn't for fame, nor for profit.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang cultivators cherish their own techniques. Although it's due to the influence of the law that techniques cannot be practiced together, the inner cognition of cultivators has unknowingly changed."</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient immortal cultivation world era, the grand scene of people sitting and discussing the Dao, sharing with each other, can no longer be seen."</p><p></p><p>"I really dislike it," the Holy Fetus Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with his actions in front of outsiders, there was truly a sense of transcendent nonchalance.</p><p></p><p>"Spread it if you want. As long as it follows my wishes, what does it matter even if it's an immortal technique?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun looked at Li Fan's figure, somewhat lost in thought. Such magnanimity was truly rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>Being with such a character, Shang Shaojun even felt that he himself had become full of heroism.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With all matters in the Eternal Immortal Fortress dealt with, there were no more concerns.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun and Li Fan stood outside the Eternal Immortal Fortress, looking at the vast white mist.</p><p></p><p>"Where are we going next?"</p><p></p><p>Having inexplicably taken on the burden of "saving the Xuanhuang Realm," Shang Shaojun still felt a bit lost when they were about to set off.</p><p></p><p>But things had come to this point, and he had no choice to back out.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun glanced at Li Fan beside him. He was certain that if he went back on his word at this time, the other party would definitely slash at him with a sword.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Shang Shaojun secretly thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan stretched out his hand, and a small sword no longer than a palm instantly appeared in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be sensing something, constantly rotating.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the sword tip pointed in a direction and stopped.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun looked in the direction the small sword was pointing.</p><p></p><p>"Where there is existence, there will be traces. Although that mysterious figure is incomparably powerful, as long as he appears in the Xuanhuang Realm, it is inevitable that he will become entangled with reality. By pursuing him, we can find more evidence," Li Fan said with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun felt that what Li Fan said made a lot of sense and immediately nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't know that the direction the small sword in Li Fan's hand was pointing to had nothing to do with...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was not about tracking the whereabouts of the mysterious figure.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it pointed to one after another of the puzzles that Li Fan had previously unraveled in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all roads lead to Rome. They were bound to find there many pieces of evidence that the Xuanhuang Realm was being transformed by someone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Fetus Li Fan was guiding Shao Jun to uncover the truth hidden beneath the iceberg of the Xuanhuang Realm, in the small world of Daqi, Yin Shangren's experimental base had been initially set up.</p><p></p><p>"The last time I saw Mr. Bai, he told me that after I established my foundation, I might be able to achieve 'Primordial Golden Elixir', 'Physical Infant', and 'Mind Transforming into Spirit'. You may try to extrapolate based on these concepts," Li Ping's avatar said to Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren had just performed a bizarre act in front of Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>His body split open, and another self inside struggled to crawl out.</p><p></p><p>Then, turning his head, he devoured his own flesh and blood shell.</p><p></p><p>The sound of flesh and bones being chewed echoed in the experimental base, and Yin Shangren's face was covered in blood.</p><p></p><p>But his expression was extremely calm as he ate himself, his eyes full of concentration.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he was not eating, but doing some kind of research.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Ping, with countless past memories, felt a slight chill in his heart as he watched Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>It was not about courage, but truly contrary to human nature.</p><p></p><p>Chewing slowly, he finally completely swallowed the other self.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping discovered that Yin Shangren's externally displayed realm had also fallen from the Foundation Establishment stage to the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Yin Shangren wipe his blood-stained hands on his clothes and explain, "To extrapolate the next set of methods, one must first walk on the correct path."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, "There might be some trouble, but leave it to me."</p><p></p><p>As Yin Shangren said this, Li Ping also instantly felt that something seemed to have descended upon the Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Emperor's Qi Scripture, he had merged the fate of the entire dynasty into one.</p><p></p><p>With an external invasion, it naturally could not escape his perception.</p><p></p><p>It was like cold worms slowly crawling on the skin's surface. After a tentative contact, the worms extended sharp spines, trying to pierce into the inner part of the small world of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This place of yours seems to form an independent entity. Perhaps their retaliation will be weaker than imagined," Yin Shangren spoke up at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that the "they" Yin Shangren referred to were the remnant souls of the old world.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Yin Shangren forcibly destroying and changing his own state had attracted the attention of his own kind.</p><p></p><p>The sound of dripping rain started.</p><p></p><p>Yet no raindrops fell.</p><p></p><p>Above Li Fan's head, a thick layer of dark clouds had appeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>Shrouding the sky above the experimental base.</p><p></p><p>The hard basalt ground suddenly became muddy like soil amidst the pattering rain.</p><p></p><p>Pale arms abruptly stretched out from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping frowned slightly, wanting to float and evade.</p><p></p><p>But in this bizarre space that had already been distorted and changed, he had actually lost the ability to fly.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the target of these world specters was not him.</p><p></p><p>To him, those arms were merely illusory existences.</p><p></p><p>Countless arms crawled on the ground, swarming towards Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>And Yin Shangren revealed a grim smile.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the closest arm and yanked it out, putting it in his mouth and taking a big bite.</p><p></p><p>I have to go to the hospital for another checkup at 7:30 tomorrow morning. Although the Golden Alliance is important, my life is more critical.</p>

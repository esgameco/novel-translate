        <h1>Chapter 322</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The strength was in an absolute state of balance, so the brothers had always been at peace with each other," Ji Hongdao said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"But not long ago, I thought about how these treasures would be given to you juniors in the future, and I wouldn't be able to explore them anymore."</p><p></p><p>"In a moment of itchiness, I applied to take them out and play with them for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, this mistake led to the early discovery of its true mystery."</p><p></p><p>As Ji Hongdao slowly recounted the whole story, most of the cultivators present didn't have any special reaction.</p><p></p><p>At most, they were like Li Fan, sighing at the wonders of fate in this realm, even treasures needed to be nurtured.</p><p></p><p>Because the Separation Discs were rewards for outstanding performers, it was not their turn.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators whose names shone brightly in the top nine of the golden list didn't look so good.</p><p></p><p>Anyone would feel bad if a treasure that was already in their hands might disappear at any time.</p><p></p><p>Having become accustomed to and amazed by the wonders of the Separation Discs, only to helplessly watch them fail in competition and gradually disappear from their hands in the end.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it felt miserable.</p><p></p><p>If it really ended up like this, it would be better to have never possessed them from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would inevitably become a demon in one's heart, accompanying one for life, and extremely difficult to eliminate.</p><p></p><p>But from another perspective, the top nine on the list could all be called the favored children of heaven.</p><p></p><p>They all had their own pride, so it was impossible to make them admit defeat without a fight and directly give up.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Ji Hongdao had that expression. Previously, more than a dozen people including Dantai Tao died unexpectedly, which was already a painful loss for the Strategy Formation Hall."</p><p></p><p>"And these top nine cultivators are all outstanding talents and good seedlings. Losing any more of them would be unacceptable."</p><p></p><p>"Nine discs compete for supremacy, the winner takes all. As for the other eight losers, it will naturally be difficult to avoid being affected, and there is even a high possibility that they will never recover from then on."</p><p></p><p>"For the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the greatest use of our batch of students is to universally build the [Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation]."</p><p></p><p>"Even if that winner may become a true master of formation dao, from the perspective of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, eight high-end laborers would be lost at once."</p><p></p><p>"With such a strong determination to build the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation in this world, the Myriad Immortals Alliance naturally won't allow such a thing to happen."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly, and in an instant, he had figured out the ins and outs of the matter.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, at this time, Ji Hongdao also continued, "You are all indispensable talents of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The loss of even one is a huge loss that is difficult to bear. We certainly won't allow such self-destructive things to happen."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, after serious discussion, we have decided to change the prize for this assessment."</p><p></p><p>"From the Separation Discs to the [Formation Breaking Jade Plate] specially made by the Strategy Formation Hall, which was previously only given to formation masters above the Primordial Spirit stage."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao's words failed to stir up much of a splash.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Separation Discs as a precedent, how could a formation-breaking treasure used by Primordial Spirit stage masters compare to the secondary body of the Heavenly Profound Mirror?</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao continued, "The prize for this assessment was determined due to our work negligence. To make up for it, we have also decided to increase the reward quota for the [Formation Breaking Jade Plate] from the top nine to the top one hundred."</p><p></p><p>With these words, the crowd finally became a bit agitated.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had nothing to do with it before, but now a prize had fallen from the sky out of nowhere, so of course they would be a little excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also immediately glanced at the golden list in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Exactly the one hundredth place.</p><p></p><p>The result was a bit beyond his expectations, better than he had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the slight shift of that formation pivot had the miraculous effect of turning the rotten into the divine," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, after being slightly surprised, Li Fan quickly calmed his mood and stared at Ji Hongdao in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He must have more important things to explain.</p><p></p><p>That was the real bombshell theme of today.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, no one knew that the real prize was the Separation Discs before.</p><p></p><p>If there was a problem with the prize, it could be directly announced as a substitute.</p><p></p><p>Why bother to twist and turn like today, constantly mobilizing everyone's emotions?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also treated these Separation Discs with an ordinary heart, so he could calmly analyze Ji Hongdao's intentions like an outsider.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as Li Fan expected, after the crowd gradually calmed down, he finally announced, "As for those nine Separation Discs..."</p><p></p><p>Pausing slightly to attract the students' attention, Ji Hongdao then slowly said, "We have decided to directly catalyze their competitive absorption process through special means."</p><p></p><p>"Within ten years, the last and only Separation Disc will be cultivated."</p><p></p><p>"And this true Separation Disc will not be taken back."</p><p></p><p>"Its ownership still belongs to you."</p><p></p><p>His voice was like thunder, startling Qi Chengcheng and others who were still a bit depressed, and the greedy light flashed in their eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"Although some small mistakes occurred in the process, but!"</p><p></p><p>"Our original intention has not changed!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao said with a heavy tone and a solemn face, "In order to reaffirm the determination within the alliance."</p><p></p><p>"To motivate everyone to strive for the best."</p><p></p><p>"After our application and approval by the headquarters, the final winner of the nine-disc competition will be awarded to the formation master who contributes the most to the [Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation] popularization plan!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He gasped and couldn't help but exclaim in his heart, "What a tactic!"</p><p></p><p>"Today's twists and turns, several reversals, were all for this move."</p><p></p><p>"After several ups and downs psychologically, compared to directly announcing this result, the temptation is much stronger."</p><p></p><p>"Are you still afraid that these students won't work hard for it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could almost foresee that in order to obtain this Separation Disc that "has the hope of growing into the next Heavenly Profound Mirror", in the upcoming construction wave, to what terrible extent these formation masters would involution.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps each of them would become more cattle than cattle and horses.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in this world, the comprehensive popularization of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation will definitely be much faster than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have much time left..."</p><p></p><p>"But why do I always have a vague feeling that the Myriad Immortals Alliance seems to be in a hurry about this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance has been established for thousands of years, and its rule can be said to be as solid as a rock."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation is just a further step. It can be done slowly, there is no need to use so many tactics."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are they in a hurry for?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell into deep thought for a while.</p>

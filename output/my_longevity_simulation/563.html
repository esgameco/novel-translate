        <h1>Chapter 563</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Looking at the backs of the two as they walked away, Li Fan's expression was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>"Just one year of time, and it has been corrupted into this appearance…"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, not long ago, these two were speculating that I was the Fallen Ascended Emperor and wanted to follow me to seek a good future."</p><p></p><p>"Now they dare to deceive and conceal things."</p><p></p><p>A hint of cold light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, the battle of Tianlingzhou in this world was pushed by him.</p><p></p><p>He had already anticipated that some of the cultivators participating in the fundraising project would fall during the battle of Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>However, he had not mentioned this to He Zhenghao in advance.</p><p></p><p>It was just to see what decision He Zhenghao would make when faced with the unclaimed capital.</p><p></p><p>Indeed…</p><p></p><p>"Human hearts are truly fragile under test."</p><p></p><p>"Especially in the face of so many contributions. Having become accustomed to astronomical figures in the billions, how can they be content with their meager salary."</p><p></p><p>"They must find some side income."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head inwardly, not feeling disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to give He Zhenghao a way out during the future Red Flame Incineration Sea, taking into account the teachings of the "Zuoshan Jue" and the hardships of his previous lives.</p><p></p><p>But now…</p><p></p><p>It could wait until the next life.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, with an expressionless face, began selecting the personnel among the cultivators within the Congyunhai system for this recruitment.</p><p></p><p>Yes, when the war begins, the first to be called up will be members of the Xianmeng system.</p><p></p><p>After all, enjoying the special treatment of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance naturally came with corresponding responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Yongshou…"</p><p></p><p>"This person was insolent before, so mark him."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yan. Hmm, I don't have much impression of him. He was not seen at the reconstruction ceremony of the Congyun City or the foundation ceremony of the Xian City. So, mark him too."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Kuo, feedback collector for the Congyunhai cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes glanced over, slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had cycled through Congyunhai for so many years and had been in charge of Congyunhai's affairs for some time in this life.</p><p></p><p>But he had never had the pleasure of meeting this person.</p><p></p><p>Where were the feedback collections he had promised?</p><p></p><p>"If you don't die, who will?" With a firm stroke, Li Fan also marked this person.</p><p></p><p>…In no time, the list of "Recruited Cultivators," which had left He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan entangled, was already complete.</p><p></p><p>In general, Li Fan was rather casual in choosing the names of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After all, in Li Fan's eyes, even if they could survive the Battle of Tianlingzhou, they would not escape the Red Flame Incineration Sea.</p><p></p><p>It only made a difference whether they died early or late.</p><p></p><p>On the orders, He Zhenghao and the others had used the seal left by Li Fan before he secluded himself, the "Secret Letter Ambassador Seal." Now they only needed "Zhou Qing'ao" to seal it before dispatching it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, "Zhou Qing'ao" completed the final step.</p><p></p><p>"The unjust have a hopeless situation; all is the work of Zhou Qing'ao. It has nothing to do with me, Li Fan."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt no pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhou is indeed efficient! Hehe, it seems I will have to trouble you next time!" Soon, He Zhenghao's admiring voice came.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly, brushing him off.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the sea, in the crystal palace.</p><p></p><p>Just half a day later, Sima Changkong, who had gone out to collect brewing materials, hurried back.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Brother Sima, you've returned so quickly?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, friend, you've misunderstood." Sima Changkong shook his head repeatedly and explained, "I had an emergency, that's why I rushed back."</p><p></p><p>"The collection of Tianqing brewing materials is not easy, and I haven't had time to prepare them. If you want to drink comfortably, you may have to wait a while." There was a hint of apology on his face.</p><p></p><p>"No worries!" Li Fan waved his hand, indicating that he didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>"On the battlefield of Tianlingzhou, there appeared something extraordinary, and my 'Blood Division Incarnation' unfortunately was destroyed. So I had to rush back to make a new one." Sima Changkong replied with a somewhat helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary thing?" Li Fan squinted his eyes and welcomed Sima Changkong back into the crystal palace to sit down.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I was shocked when I saw it too." It seemed like Sima Changkong was exhausted from using the escape technique, looking tired.</p><p></p><p>But after resting for a while, he took out a black tin from somewhere.</p><p></p><p>He broke the tin with his hands, and instantly, a large amount of blood flowed out.</p><p></p><p>As if it had just been extracted from the body, a pungent smell of blood lingered in the air.</p><p></p><p>The blood wriggled in the air and slowly formed a humanoid figure.</p><p></p><p>Without hiding anything from Li Fan, Sima Changkong lightly touched his forehead with his right index finger, guiding a drop of blood radiating a rainbow glow.</p><p></p><p>Then he merged it into the blood mass in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After a faint glow, shortly, a complete incarnation of Sima Changkong appeared in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Handing clothes to the incarnation to put on, the incarnation bowed to the two of them and then headed off in the direction of Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Sima Changkong let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, he appeared even weaker, pale, and struggling to stand steadily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan quickly supported him to sit down.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Sima Changkong recovered.</p><p></p><p>"How are you feeling, friend?" Li Fan didn't rush to inquire about the situation on the battlefield of Tianlingzhou but first asked with concern.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine, just need a rest." Sima Changkong shook his head weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this body your true form, friend? I thought it was just a 'Blood Division Incarnation'." Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, after practicing the 'Bloodline History,' where is there still any true form left? It's just that only here in Congyunhai, there is still essence blood that can be used to make a new incarnation." Sima Changkong sighed and smiled bitterly. "It's just that this method of making incarnations consumes a lot of energy, so I need to daily drink Tianqing brew to replenish my depleted energy."</p><p></p><p>"Oh my! I've been greedily drinking so much of your Tianqing brew, isn't it…” Li Fan sighed, expressing regret.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Li Brother, don't worry!" Sima Changkong consoled Li Fan, "As I told you before, after practicing the 'Bloodline History' of our Sima family, our lifespan becomes no different from ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"In this short life of a few decades, it truly passes like a galloping horse, disappearing in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>"In this brief life, meeting a knowledgeable person like Li Brother is also satisfying."</p>

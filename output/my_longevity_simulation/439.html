            <p>"All can devour the earth's veins, equally without moderation."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in ancient times, there were many cultivation techniques that were created by emulating exotic beasts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the sights he had seen in the "Ten Thousand Laws Struggle" area of the Museum of Divine Artifacts, appearing pensive.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, while deducing cultivation techniques inherited the characteristics of exotic beasts, they also brought along their drawbacks."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"If it could be improved through the Deduction Jade to optimize and eliminate the flaw of losing consciousness, it would not be a bad powerful skill."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there may not be a chance in this world. I am about to break through to the Nascent Soul realm, the 'Sitting Mountain Secret' has already reached its limit. To deduce it to a higher realm is the current priority."</p><p></p><p>The image of a young cultivator with a carefree face flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was Han Yi, who in the previous life, with the help of the Heavenly Feathers Dan that could extend life by eight hundred years, successfully obtained the qualification to deduce the Deduction Jade's Combined Dao technique.</p><p></p><p>"To deduce 'Sitting Mountain Secret' to the Combined Dao level requires seizing this person's opportunity in one step."</p><p></p><p>"However, this person seems a bit off. He doesn't seem like someone with a strong heavenly fortune."</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, when my clone and he explored the ruins of the Heavenly Capital, we gained nothing. We even faced constant dangers along the way, almost losing our lives."</p><p></p><p>"I can say that my clone, who had almost no luck, was much stronger than him."</p><p></p><p>"But it is true that he possesses the Supreme Fish Head Color and holds items like the Heavenly Feathers Dan."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I remember, before he became rich overnight, he was deceived by Master Zhu Ji."</p><p></p><p>"By then, I can focus on him more."</p><p></p><p>"See how he went from poverty to prosperity."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, the clone finally woke up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put away the spirit stones and Enlightenment Pills, leaving the clone to continue guarding the Tai'an Island.</p><p></p><p>He changed his appearance again, and through a teleportation array, headed towards the northeast corner of the Sea of Clouds towards Yin Yin Island where Yin Yin Shangren was.</p><p></p><p>Among all the people in the Sea of Clouds, Li Fan was only concerned about a few, and Yin Shangren was definitely one of them.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he comprehend the 'Build Foundation with Me' technique, which was confirmed by Su Changyu in the previous life to be effective, but it still had some flaws that needed refining.</p><p></p><p>What most concerned Li Fan was Yin Shangren's research on the Immortal Miasma over more than ten years, which led him to eventually choose to end his own life.</p><p></p><p>Even ants struggle to survive.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Yin Shangren, theoretically, he would never easily give up his own life.</p><p></p><p>But he did, which could only mean one thing.</p><p></p><p>He truly understood the mystery of the Immortal Miasma in the end, and this result was hard for him to accept.</p><p></p><p>Under despair, he lost the motivation to continue living, so he chose to perish in flames.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also very interested in this mystery.</p><p></p><p>After spending three days, Li Fan secretly arrived outside Yin Yin Island.</p><p></p><p>Moans of mortals could be heard from a distance, one after another.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention of disturbing Yin Shangren; instead, he prepared to release the invisible killing intent to monitor.</p><p></p><p>However, the result surprised him.</p><p></p><p>The moment the invisible killing intent locked onto Yin Shangren, his field of view suddenly split into hundreds of pieces.</p><p></p><p>Except for the one focusing on the experiment on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The rest observed the completely identical, broken and damaged corpses in the basement, alongside Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Under the eyes of heaven and earth, Li Fan discovered that these shattered and seemingly lifeless corpses were actually alive!</p><p></p><p>While lying quietly in the basement, they occasionally moved their bodies or rolled their eyes imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>Watching their eyes, Li Fan even thought that these bodies seemed to be "thinking."</p><p></p><p>This eerie scene made Li Fan feel a little creeped out.</p><p></p><p>"The split-view of the invisible killing intent means that in the eyes of heaven and earth, these living corpses and Yin Shangren are actually the same person."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan's expression became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>He remembered Yin Shangren saying that he had dissected over a hundred bodies in the basement before realizing the 'Build Foundation with Me' technique.</p><p></p><p>"A true lunatic…"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he could comprehend the 'Build Foundation with Me' technique, which could be considered a heaven-defying cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>"If he intended to cultivate, he would probably easily reach the Combined Dao realm."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, he got lost in his research on the Immortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the only Yin Shangren who could still function normally, unable to help but sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Throughout his multiple reincarnations, Li Fan had seen many so-called geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Even Senior Brother Zhang, who suppressed ten thousand years with his law body, or Mr. Bai, who turned from a mortal to a deity in an instant, were all existences that could leave a mark for a hundred generations.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Fan's perception, none of them seemed as extraordinary as Yin Shangren, who had only reached the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly spied on Yin Yin Island for several days.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren seemed tireless like a machine, conducting experiments, recording, thinking.</p><p></p><p>Then repeating the experiments.</p><p></p><p>There was no trace of weariness on his face, only deep immersion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even observed that whenever Yin Shangren delved into thought, the faces of the hundreds of corpses in the basement showed a more pronounced 'contemplative' look.</p><p></p><p>"It's like hundreds of myself thinking about the problem simultaneously…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is the reason he can unravel the mystery of the Immortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered Yin Shangren's crazy mutterings about Su Changyu in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, where did these bodies come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh! I remember!"</p><p></p><p>"That was quite a downpour! Countless bodies fell from the sky like rain, and I seized the opportunity to scrounge up some…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, "The hundreds of corpses picked up from the heavy rain, were they all him?"</p><p></p><p>"This is truly bizarre."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, unable to find any relevant examples from the secret stories of the Profound Yellow Realm he had seen before, Li Fan had to temporarily suppress it.</p><p></p><p>After a few more days of spying from the outside, until the mortal materials on Yin Yin Island were exhausted, Yin Shangren had to go out to find more mortals for experimentation.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan quietly leave.</p><p></p><p>"Let's keep monitoring him at all times. With the 'Altering Dao Sole Deity' secret technique, it won't affect my usual cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After deeply looking at Yin Shangren's departing figure, Li Fan reverted to the appearance of a cultivator from the Tianji Sect and returned to the Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>After taking an Enlightenment Pill and activating the 'Enlightenment' state, Li Fan entered seclusion for the time being.</p><p></p><p>With the dual enhancement, even though Li Fan was cultivating a difficult technique like the 'Sitting Mountain Secret,' his progress was swift.</p><p></p><p>Over two months later, a pure feedback suddenly appeared in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan woke up from seclusion with this sudden breakthrough in cultivation.</p>

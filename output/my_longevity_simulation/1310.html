        <h1>Chapter 1310</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan should not have been able to embark on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When he first went from Daxuan to Liuli Island, just the step of expelling the mortal miasma from his body almost completely cut off his path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the dual blessings of the Xuanhuang Purifying Heart Mantra and the Purifying Spirit Pool, he was able to officially cultivate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time as he shed the miasma from his body, the Xuanhuang Purifying Heart Mantra formally became the Xuanhuang Tempering Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Mantra also became his alternative Dao foundation, accompanying his cultivation for life.</p><p></p><p>The higher Li Fan's cultivation, the more his Xuanhuang Mantra Dao foundation also expanded. Like pillars, they became an important part of supporting Li Fan's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And in the previous life, when Li Fan widely spread the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, the consequence was that these Dao foundation pillars...</p><p></p><p>Became weakened due to the massive separation.</p><p></p><p>His original body's Dao foundation was not just the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, but also the experience and knowledge brought by Huanzhen and hundreds of reincarnations. Therefore, the impact on him was negligible.</p><p></p><p>But this negative effect of separation was naturally amplified in his avatar and divine spirits. The weaker the separated entity, the more so it was.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just him who was affected by the widespread transmission of the Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortal Heart Mantra itself had its effectiveness weakened by more than a notch due to this spread.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from the performance of the Qingxuan Army and the Daqi Forbidden Army, who cultivated the Immortal Heart Mantra in the previous life, in the great war.</p><p></p><p>They barely managed to remain calm in the face of danger, but they were far from the orthodox Immortal Heart Mantra's "experiencing a thousand calamities while the immortal heart remains unchanged"!</p><p></p><p>The gap became even more apparent when Li Fan, as Huanzhen, returned to this life and monopolized the Immortal Heart Mantra alone.</p><p></p><p>"Techniques cannot be cultivated together..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems it's not that the Dao of Xuanhuang Realm is suppressing the abrupt evolution of cultivators. Rather, it's something deeply imprinted in the depths of Xuanhuang Realm, originating from some tradition of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, perhaps this is not only related to techniques not being cultivated together. It's also closely related to the position of Xuanhuang Grand Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the Immortal Heart Mantra that Mr. Bai passed on to the world to offset the power of Xuanhuang's reverse principles should have originated from the Xuanhuang Grand Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Grand Celestial Lord, appointed by the Immortal Realm, controls immortal artifacts and oversees Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, he can be said to possess supreme authority.</p><p></p><p>However, this Grand Celestial Lord of the Immortal Realm is not so easy to become.</p><p></p><p>Not only is there a colleague who acts as a monitor and secretly holds him back, inheriting the position of Grand Celestial Lord also means inheriting the Immortal Realm's restraints and punishments for the Xuanhuang Grand Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>After Huanzhen returned to this life, only when Li Fan reviewed did he remember Sun Tianci who was burned by the Burning Heart Flame.</p><p></p><p>"Even though the immortal path is now cut off, the Immortal Realm's countermeasures are still effective."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Heart Mantra being unable to spread widely is probably one of the Immortal Realm's many restrictions on the Xuanhuang Grand Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also recalled what happened after Sun Tianci successfully inherited the position in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Bell, the Taixu Qingming Lamp, the Purple Qi Weaving Dream Shuttle, and the Chaos Origin Five Elements Disc."</p><p></p><p>These four were the only remaining immortal artifacts in the legacy of the Xuanhuang Realm's Grand Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>There was also a condensed ball of immortal spirit power, originating from those immortal artifacts detonated by Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Before the immortal path was cut off, this trial period was actually the time to wait for the Immortal Realm's review and appointment."</p><p></p><p>"After the immortal path was cut off, the Immortal Realm's appointment became empty talk. However, according to the procedures set by the Immortal Realm back then, if there was no response from the Immortal Realm within three years, the review would be considered automatically passed. Generally speaking, as long as one doesn't encounter the destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm like Sun Tianci did, as long as one quietly waits for time to pass, they can obtain the complete authority of the Grand Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"And before that..."</p><p></p><p>The immortal artifacts in the Grand Celestial Lord's legacy simply could not be utilized. This was also one of the reasons why Sun Tianci was easily persuaded by Li Fan's avatar in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Facing the pressing Fa Tianzun, the newly appointed Xuanhuang Grand Celestial Lord really did not have the ability to contend with him.</p><p></p><p>"According to Sun Tianci, these immortal artifacts bestowed by the upper realm all lack spirit within them. The Xuanhuang Celestial Lord of the lower realm has no immortal spirit power and can only drive them by relying on the restrictions left by the Immortal Realm and consuming the artifacts' own power."</p><p></p><p>"In a sense, they are undoubtedly consumables. When Mr. Bai collected them one by one back then, who knows how many times these immortal artifacts had been used. It's really hard to say how much power they still have left."</p><p></p><p>"But after all, they are immortal artifacts. Leaving them unused in the depths of the Fallen Immortal Realm is no different from letting treasures gather dust. In this life, I still need to retrieve them. Not to mention there's also that ball of pure immortal spirit power."</p><p></p><p>Only after personally using immortal spirit power to lay out the world-ending immortal formation did Li Fan truly understand the strength and transcendence of immortals.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the Ultimate Disintegration Disc emitted an extraordinary seven-colored light.</p><p></p><p>Within the radiance, true immortal formations were being deduced non-stop.</p><p></p><p>The birth of immortal formations, the operation of immortal formations, the destruction of immortal formations.</p><p></p><p>During the process of the All Things Return to Void Grand Formation ending the world in the previous life, the Ultimate Disintegration Disc collected ample formation data. As if it had truly completed the metamorphosis distinguishing immortals and mortals, it could now spontaneously deduce immortal formations according to Li Fan's needs, just like deducing mortal formations.</p><p></p><p>Even though the deduction speed was extremely slow and the load on the Disintegration Disc was very high,</p><p></p><p>Under the orderly arrangement of the Disintegration Disc's simulated personality, it would not affect Li Fan's normal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the main direction of deduction for the Ultimate Disintegration Disc's immortal formations was the downgrading of immortal formations.</p><p></p><p>The goal was to be able to drive them with slightly lower-grade energy at the cost of slightly reduced formation power.</p><p></p><p>Immortals and mortals were different. Li Fan had no way to create immortal spirit power on a large scale. Even if he could obtain some from the Grand Celestial Lord's legacy, it would not be enough to support Li Fan's plans in this life.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, source power essence that was infinitely close to immortal spirit power was almost inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>If immortal formations could be driven with source power essence, it would undoubtedly save a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Even if Fa Tianzun and Tian Yi returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, he could easily handle them.</p><p></p><p>There would be no need to painstakingly create a Holy Emperor avatar to confront them.</p><p></p><p>In the world-ending immortal formation of the previous life, Li Fan had seen the true strength of Fa Tianzun and Tian Yi very clearly.</p><p></p><p>With a set reference of strength, he could also grasp it when creating immortal formations.</p><p></p><p>The transparent figure that flashed by after Fa Tianzun's body was annihilated appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At that time, in the chaotic world-ending storm, it was extremely confusing. He also didn't get a clear look.</p><p></p><p>But he vaguely felt a hint of familiarity from that transparent figure.</p><p></p><p>"If there's a chance in this life, perhaps it can be verified."</p><p></p><p>When true immortals descend, everything in the Xuanhuang Realm is like ants.</p><p></p><p>With a leap of the cat, even the phantom of a true immortal is not a meal on a plate.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the Xuanhuang Realm and the outside of the high wall can be seen.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't mean that everything in the Xuanhuang Realm has lost its value.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan was a mortal Grand Preceptor, the gap between him and Xuanhuang Changsheng was like the gap between the Xuanhuang Realm and the outside of the high wall today.</p><p></p><p>However, after 126 reincarnations, the former mortal Grand Preceptor was already able to use Xuanhuang Changsheng as a chess piece.</p><p></p><p>So what if one can hunt true immortals outside the high wall?</p><p></p><p>Give Li Fan another 126 lifetimes, and he may be able to similarly use true immortals as chess pieces!</p><p></p><p>It's just that the current outside of the high wall is a complete unknown to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he is not yet strong enough to set foot outside the high wall.</p><p></p><p>So everything still needs to proceed step by step according to plan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan completed another cat sculpture.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept over, and he had carved 9,999 wooden sculptures within three years.</p><p></p><p>They filled the wooden house, further squeezing the already not very spacious space.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a wisp of flame surged from Li Fan's fingertip, and he threw it towards the pile of cat wooden sculptures.</p><p></p><p>The flames rolled and instantly turned into a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>But it only burned the cat wooden sculptures and did not spread in the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sculptures vanished in the flames, without black smoke, not even flying ashes.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, these 9,999 wooden sculptures were devoured by the great fire and completely disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>As if they had never appeared.</p><p></p><p>The countless cat images reflected in his eyes also gradually disappeared with the dying fire.</p><p></p><p>After standing still for a long time, Li Fan shifted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Huanzhen interface.</p><p></p><p>The jumping and flashing light reflected familiar characters.</p><p></p><p>This simulation has ended. You can choose one of the following options to retain:</p><p></p><p>1. An item you possess in this simulation.</p><p></p><p>2. Your cultivation realm in this simulation. </p><p></p><p>3. The simulated memory of a person closely related to you in this simulation. This memory can be inherited by that person.</p><p></p><p>4. Give up the above choices to speed up the charging progress.</p><p></p><p>However, after this paragraph of text that he had read countless times, there was an additional new prompt.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes slightly focused.</p><p></p><p>New variable interference detected. In this simulation, you can additionally choose one item to retain.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous paragraphs, this line of text was slightly different.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was the same as the scene Li Fan last saw in Huanzhen in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Flickering and unstable, the frequency was much faster than normal Huanzhen prompts.</p><p></p><p>And being able to choose two items to retain was also unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"New variable interference..."</p><p></p><p>Having waited for three years, he was not in a hurry. Li Fan still did not make a choice immediately like before.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he pondered very carefully, carefully savoring this sentence of Huanzhen's prompt.</p><p></p><p>Since discovering that devouring the wonders between heaven and earth and grotto-heavens could increase Huanzhen's anchoring and charging progress, Li Fan knew that Huanzhen seemed to grow by devouring objects useful to it, like eating.</p><p></p><p>Wonders of heaven and earth, grotto-heaven worlds, and even eternal imprints and Li Fan's own experiences...</p><p></p><p>Were all among the objects that interested Huanzhen.</p><p></p><p>Of course, once Huanzhen devoured them, it would no longer be interested.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan was very certain that even if he encountered forces from outside the high wall again in this life, if there were no other substantive gains, Huanzhen's rewards would not appear again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't care much about this extra choice.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan really cared about was Huanzhen's attitude.</p><p></p><p>Previously, without exception, only when Huanzhen truly gained benefits would it give rewards.</p><p></p><p>And this time, just by sensing the so-called new interfering variables, Huanzhen generously gave extra rewards...</p><p></p><p>This sudden generosity, in Li Fan's view, was undoubtedly a temptation.</p><p></p><p>Guiding and luring Li Fan to explore outside the high wall.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly indicating that outside the high wall, there must exist objects that Huanzhen was extremely interested in or extremely useful to it.</p><p></p><p>As the fundamental bottom line of his growth so far, if Huanzhen could have any changes, Li Fan would definitely be the biggest beneficiary.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan couldn't help but be excited.</p><p></p><p>But just like the previous decision, outside the high wall, every step was perilous and required long-term planning.</p><p></p><p>"With just me alone, it's really a bit difficult to set foot outside the high wall."</p><p></p><p>"But the Xuanhuang Realm has already proven its potential in multiple reincarnations."</p><p></p><p>"If I have the help of the myriad beings of the Xuanhuang Realm, I will undoubtedly be much more at ease."</p><p></p><p>The first step to leaving the Dark Starry Sea was to be able to cross the high wall.</p><p></p><p>Just this major premise alone, Li Fan would probably need to go through many attempts to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the high wall had trapped the beings of the Dark Starry Sea for ten thousand years, and Mr. Bai's plan to cross the high wall by detonating immortal spirit power was just a guess.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sea, the rumors of the Heavenly Sword Sect, demon race, and even the Ten Immortal Sects crossing realms and leaving in the past all lacked any substantial evidence to prove they succeeded.</p><p></p><p>If the immortal path</p><p></p><p>In the endless time of isolation and towering walls, what force from the darkest starry sea truly crossed the high walls...</p><p></p><p>Then perhaps it could only be...</p><p></p><p>The Shang Immortal Vessel.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the shocked expression of the Holy Fetus from his previous life flashed by, when he learned of this matter from Ai Tianjue.</p><p></p><p>"They want to pilot the Xuan Shang Immortal Vessel to crash into the high walls, in a reckless attempt to break out of this starry sea." Ai Tianjue's tone was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>After the shock, the Holy Fetus couldn't help but ask: "Then did the Shang Immortal Vessel succeed?"</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue was silent for a long time, before saying with a complex expression: "If they had not succeeded, why would the Xuan Immortal Vessel have regarded the three words 'Shang Immortal Vessel' as taboo for a thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>"It... it succeeded?" The Holy Fetus was endlessly shocked, his heart shaken for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>"The Shang Immortal Vessel still exists, and is outside the high walls." Ai Tianjue sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because of the Shang Immortal Vessel's success that our Xuan Immortal Vessel also clearly realized that the power of immortals is perhaps the only way to escape from this darkest starry sea. But even when the starry sea was prosperous, searching for immortal tools was already extremely difficult. Let alone after the destruction of the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, after the great calamity, the entire destroyed starry sea was filled with remnants of the power of true immortal seal characters. Only then did our Xuan Immortal Vessel begin to study this power."</p><p></p><p>All kinds of things inside the Xuan Immortal Vessel flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Shang Immortal Vessel still exists. It is outside the high walls."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan repeatedly pondered this sentence.</p><p></p><p>He did not believe that in the life-and-death crisis of his previous life, Ai Tianjue would still deceive him.</p><p></p><p>So the Shang Immortal Vessel's escape should be true.</p><p></p><p>"There is still a connection between the Xuan and Shang Immortal Vessels."</p><p></p><p>"If a way to cross the high walls is found, this connection can be used to go to the Shang Immortal Vessel."</p><p></p><p>"With the Shang Immortal Vessel as a bridgehead, it should be much easier to gain a foothold outside the high walls."</p><p></p><p>Due to the split back then, the Xuan Immortal Vessel did not contain information that could help cross the high walls.</p><p></p><p>What was valuable in the Xuan Immortal Vessel should be the secret collection called the Hundred Heard Immortal Records, as well as the research on true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>"Profound Yellow, Immortal Vessel."</p><p></p><p>"Using the power of these two realms, forge a bridge to cross the high walls."</p><p></p><p>"Then drive the living beings of Profound Yellow to explore the way ahead for me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly made plans.</p><p></p><p>With this goal as a staged endpoint, there was still much Li Fan needed to do.</p><p></p><p>First, improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had an immortal formation protecting his body in the future, the Profound Yellow living beings' transformed spirit realm was still somewhat stretched. Li Fan urgently needed to improve his own strength to face the Dharma Transmission, Heavenly Doctor, True Immortals, and even forces outside the high walls.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, the battle between the Holy Emperor, Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Doctor had already made him see clearly the future path.</p><p></p><p>Like the Holy Emperor, relying on the fortune of the Holy Dynasty and the favor of the Heavenly Dao was ultimately inferior to the Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Doctor, whose great power belonged to themselves. Although they similarly reached the upper limit that this starry sea could bear, it was very obvious that the actual combat power of the Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Doctor was more than a notch above the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"I am still under the shackles of the Dharma Transmission's new law. Cultivating in the starry sea may not be suitable for me either."</p><p></p><p>"The most practical method..."</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, the new law that the Holy Emperor imparted to the living beings in accordance with the Heavens and Earth indeed directly pointed to the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Using the self to build the foundation, mixed origin golden core, physical nascent soul, mind and spirit transformation, starry sea unity with the Dao...</p><p></p><p>And finally, the resounding Dao and eternal life, truly made one's heart surge with the thought of it.</p><p></p><p>In the first three years of this life, every time Li Fan recalled it, he felt its mysteries were endless.</p><p></p><p>But it was still the same problem.</p><p></p><p>Although the new law was good, it was only theoretically feasible. There wasn't even a single cultivator in the world who could truly cultivate to the mixed origin golden core stage according to the new law...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who possessed the Huan Zhen strange object, found it as difficult as ascending to the heavens even for the first step of using the self to build the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the even higher realms that followed.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Dharma Transmission's method was still more suitable for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the new law cultivators lamented that "the immortal path ahead cannot be trodden, the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate is above", because back then, the upper limit of the new law cultivators in the Profound Yellow Realm had already been fixed.</p><p></p><p>Even at the eternal life realm, in the entire darkest starry sea, it really couldn't stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>But times have changed.</p><p></p><p>After the tireless work of the Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Doctor, the two paramount existences of the starry sea, for thousands of years without rest, it could be said that the current Profound Yellow Realm had already gathered all the remaining essence of the destroyed realms in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Not only had its scale expanded dozens of times, but in the previous life, under the urging of the immortal spirit power, Li Fan also saw the immense vitality hidden deep within the various states, ready to erupt at any moment.</p><p></p><p>As the future homeland in the Heavenly Doctor's plan.</p><p></p><p>The potential of the Profound Yellow Realm had never been truly unleashed.</p><p></p><p>The current Profound Yellow Realm's unity with the Dao was indeed limited in strength. But the future evolved Profound Yellow Realm might be a different story.</p><p></p><p>"The blue comes from the indigo but is superior to it, ice water is colder than water because of it." Li Fan softly chanted.</p><p></p><p>"Who says the Grand Tutor's power and influence must be inferior to the Emperor's?"</p><p></p><p>After the Profound Yellow Realm received the nourishment of true immortal power, as it upgraded itself, the laws of the Heaven and Earth, and even everything born in the world, would undergo a metamorphosis along with it.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Li Fan had clearly witnessed this process with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This was when the vast majority of the immortal power was used on the All Things Return to Void Grand Formation. If all the immortal power was used to catalyze the Profound Yellow Realm, the spirit of Heaven and Earth born from it would definitely be unprecedentedly powerful..."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on this unity with the Dao, it might even be possible to control immortal power." Li Fan secretly deduced.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan, all the cultivators of the Profound Yellow Realm, except for the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, were sucking the blood and flesh of the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>No matter how they tempered the principles of Heaven and Earth, they could not exceed the upper limit of power that the Profound Yellow Realm itself could provide.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan wanted to do was to first push the upper limit of the Profound Yellow Realm to soar, and then carry out the act of uniting with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the uncontrolled upgrade of the Profound Yellow Realm might even lead to the shaking of the Dharma Transmission's foundation..." Li Fan's eyes moved slightly as he deduced something.</p><p></p><p>It was still the analogy of the prison cell from before.</p><p></p><p>The various eternal life beings of the Profound Yellow Realm dismantled the beams of the prison cell, replaced them themselves, and integrated into the prison cell.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan wanted to do was to expand this prison cell.</p><p></p><p>After its scale expanded several times, he would then carry out the act of replacement.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission indeed had nearly complete control over the old prison cell. But if the area of the prison cell suddenly expanded several times...</p><p></p><p>He would face the risk of the Profound Yellow Realm going out of control.</p><p></p><p>"This plan has another advantage."</p><p></p><p>"With my understanding of the Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao, as long as I don't show any intention of using the spirit of Heaven and Earth to unite with the Dao, It will not be hostile to me. It might even secretly help."</p><p></p><p>"After all, I am helping It complete Its evolution."</p><p></p><p>"And with the assistance of the Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao, I can deceive the Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Doctor outside the starry sky without them knowing."</p><p></p><p>"By the time they realize something is wrong and want to return, the immortal formation set up in advance will be enough to block them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered the plan for a while and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>In addition to improving his own realm, he could also enhance his combat power through external forces.</p><p></p><p>For example: true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life in the Xuan Immortal Vessel, Li Fan comprehended five brand new true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not complete true immortal seal characters, but imitations restored by the immortal vessel cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But they were enough to deal with the paramount existences of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan's greatest gain regarding true immortal seal characters in his previous life did not come from the Xuan Immortal Vessel.</p><p></p><p>But from Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal seal character in Yan Fa Jue's memory was different from the pure destructive power permeating the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved, and he flashed to the outside of Jieli Mountain, above the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Using his hand as a brush, he completed it in one stroke.</p><p></p><p>An extremely profound character appeared and collapsed the moment it appeared.</p><p></p><p>This was because the foundation building stage cultivation was not enough to support its display of power.</p><p></p><p>But in that instant when this true immortal seal character appeared in the world.</p><p></p><p>In the small world of Da Xuan, a clap of thunder suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>There were no dark clouds gathering, but a rain fell, covering the entire small world.</p><p></p><p>Originally in the depths of winter, under the nourishment of the rain, it gradually became warm like spring.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even sensed that wisps of spiritual energy were born from somewhere in the Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Different from being created through the Dao Bug.</p><p></p><p>Although this spiritual energy was thin, it was derived from the small world of Da Xuan itself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hovered high in the ninth heaven, watching the changes in the vitality of the small world of Da Xuan in the rain.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him even more was that the consciousness of the Heaven and Earth of the small world of Da Xuan seemed to be gestating.</p><p></p><p>Because there was no spiritual power, there was no consciousness of the Heavenly Dao in Da Xuan before. Or it could be said that the consciousness of the Heavenly Dao of Da Xuan was extremely weak, so weak that even Li Fan could not sense it.</p><p></p><p>However, just under this true immortal seal character that Li Fan casually wrote, the small world of Da Xuan actually underwent changes in just a few days that might have required accumulation for thousands or even tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly does this power of evolution come from?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze swept across the Heaven and Earth of Da Xuan, but he couldn't find its source.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't force growth, it didn't overdraw the potential of the small world."</p><p></p><p>"As if it was born out of thin air..."</p><p></p><p>"This might be called the power of creation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>That true immortal seal character surfaced in his mind again.</p><p></p><p>"Creation..."</p><p></p><p>He kept repeating these two words in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That true immortal seal character seemed to come alive in a daze, spontaneously wandering and changing.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still far from its true form.</p><p></p><p>"Creation!"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>An unstoppable thought surged in his heart, wanting to continue exploring the secrets of creation.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Li Fan seemed to remember something, and his eyes regained clarity.</p><p></p><p>He directly suppressed the greedy thought.</p><p></p><p>"Using it is still possible."</p><p></p><p>"But to rashly try to comprehend it..."</p><p></p><p>"Might face unknown dangers."</p><p></p><p>A hint of realization flashed in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>This true immortal seal character, which might be called the Dao of Creation, was obviously even more precious than the characters of Chaos and Hunger. In Yan Fa Jue's memory, even true immortals were fighting over it.</p><p></p><p>Even if the immortal path was severed, Li Fan could not guarantee whether there was a true immortal somewhere in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending this Dao.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the one who was ultimately able to seize the Dao of Creation and make it his own in the true immortal great war back then was conceivable.</p><p></p><p>The mere high walls might not necessarily be able to block them.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the great terror beyond the high walls of the starry sea, Li Fan became even more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just a hypothetical enemy that most likely did not exist, Li Fan did not have any lucky mentality.</p><p></p><p>"If the Profound Yellow Realm undergoes metamorphosis, and is then supplemented with the power of creation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked down at the small world of Da Xuan undergoing drastic changes at this moment, and the Profound Yellow Realm in the near future seemed to appear before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If true immortal seal characters were the ultimate external power Li Fan could rely on.</p><p></p><p>Then the limit of Li Fan's own divine abilities still had to fall on the Huan Zhen Art.</p><p></p><p>"When the real becomes false, the false is also real."</p><p></p><p>Apart from being able to use this to create the existence of a simulated personality that could be called an omnipotent spirit tool, Li Fan was more touched by the transformation of the real and the false.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had not yet inherited the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Fan's sea of consciousness, the transformed spirit realm cultivation that he once possessed, cultivated using the Heaven and Earth transformation when the Profound Yellow Realm was destroyed as material, appeared.</p><p></p><p>Silently recalling and comprehending.</p><p></p><p>As if that cultivation had not disappeared with the activation of the Huan Zhen Art.</p><p></p><p>Standing still in midair, not knowing how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>An extremely strong aura suddenly descended upon him.</p><p></p><p>The small world of Da Xuan seemed to sense something, and the Heaven and Earth trembled because of it.</p><p></p><p>But the anomaly only lasted for an instant.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the anomaly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The clouds were light and the wind was gentle, as if everything had never appeared at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, revealed a faint smile.</p>

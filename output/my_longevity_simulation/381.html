            <p>Li Fan glanced at Huangfu Song and found that he looked accustomed to the situation as if it were a routine. "Click" - tapping the table joyfully, he finished the spiritual tea that emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Wanxian Spirit Tea, this is a good thing. It is said to be an ancient recipe handed down from ancient times. After drinking it, there will be a slight increase in spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Each person is limited to one cup, young friend, why don't you try it?" </p><p></p><p>After drinking the spirit tea, Huangfu Song patted his stomach, took a deep breath, and called out to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Following Huangfu Song's lead, Li Fan also drank the Wanxian Spirit Tea in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Compared with the effect of Xuanhuang Refining Heart Mantra, there was no difference at all, or even better.</p><p></p><p>"Good stuff!" Despite that, he still showed a very pleased expression.</p><p></p><p>Just as he put down the tea cup, Li Fan felt the Dust Crossing Boat beneath him sway slightly and gradually come to a stop.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that something unexpected happened?" Feeling surprised, Li Fan looked towards Huangfu Song who was slowly getting up.</p><p></p><p>"Don't just sit there, we should have arrived at the Five Elements Grand Cave." Huangfu Song said.</p><p></p><p>"So fast?" Li Fan was slightly stunned, then somewhat astonished.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in his perception, it had only been a little over the time taken to drink a cup of tea since they set off.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also well aware of the maximum speed of the Dust Crossing Boat.</p><p></p><p>By this calculation, the Five Elements Grand Cave was not far from the Zhu Pi City?</p><p></p><p>As if sensing Li Fan's thoughts, Huangfu Song smiled and said, "Don't bother calculating. This Dust Crossing Boat not only shields our perception of the external space but also affects our perception of time."</p><p></p><p>"You think you've only been gone for half a day?"</p><p></p><p>"In fact, it may well have been seven or eight days."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's also possible that it was only the time you perceived."</p><p></p><p>"It's meant to keep you guessing."</p><p></p><p>"After the previous incident involving the spy from the Ziqiong Immortal Envoy, the Alliance has become even more cautious."</p><p></p><p>While shaking his head, Huangfu Song walked towards the outside of the cabin.</p><p></p><p>"Affects the perception of time passing." Li Fan's heart sank. This was the first time he had encountered technology related to time within the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"But it could also simply be a distortion of perception."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his thoughts, Li Fan followed Huangfu Song to the deck.</p><p></p><p>Upon leaving the cabin, an unseen, almost solidified water-based spiritual energy rushed toward them.</p><p></p><p>Having been in the Sea of Clouds for years and having once built his foundation with the Sea Blue Pearl, Li Fan was especially sensitive to water-based spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>He was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the Water-Attribute Cave of the Five Elements Grand Cave, which is like an enlarged version of the Concentrated Sea Blue Pearl."</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, Li Fan swallowed the spiritual energy, refining and absorbing it. Through this, he gained a clearer understanding of the purity of the spiritual energy here.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, however, Li Fan noticed that the cultivators around him, including Huangfu Song, all raised their heads to gaze at the sky with expressions of indescribable amazement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also followed their gazes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Dust Crossing Boat was above an extremely even boundary.</p><p></p><p>Below, was an endless, vast, and boundless water world.</p><p></p><p>Above, was an enormous tree rooted in the sky, with countless branches connecting it to the water world - an inverted towering tree.</p><p></p><p>Each branch was as broad as a plain in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>One could faintly see many plants growing on top, and even on some trunks, there were rows of lush trees.</p><p></p><p>"The original Water-Attribute Cave was simply a vast blue water world."</p><p></p><p>"However, not long ago, the scene of a Wood-Attribute Cave suddenly appeared outside the water world."</p><p></p><p>"The two began to merge gradually. This is the phenomenon of the Five Elements Returning to One."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Buyi appeared and, looking at the magnificent scene in the sky, explained to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Five Elements Returning to One. So, is there any signs of the invasion of a Metal-Attribute Cave under the water world?" A cultivator on the boat couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi nodded, "Under the endless water layer, indeed one can see golden light everywhere. However, it is not an invasion of a Metal-Attribute Cave."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, it is the Water-Attribute Cave invading the Metal-Attribute Cave."</p><p></p><p>"Just like the Wood-Attribute Cave above our heads is doing."</p><p></p><p>"Gold gives birth to Water, Water gives birth to Wood. But at this moment, is it reversed?" Huangfu Song continued.</p><p></p><p>"So in the end..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not as simple as we imagined." Qi Buyi walked to the side of the Dust Crossing Boat, enveloping a mass of water with spiritual energy and showcasing it to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Five Elements Return to One, the water quality in this Water-Attribute Cave was extremely pure. But now..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi flicked a spark of fire into the water mass.</p><p></p><p>Something astonishing happened in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The total volume of the water mass could clearly extinguish the spark Qi Buyi flicked.</p><p></p><p>But after encountering the flame, it started burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>In front of everyone's eyes, it burned more and more vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, it turned into a lump of black scorched earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clearly saw that the strange phenomenon occurring was not due to the strength of the flame but rather the change in the nature of the "water."</p><p></p><p>"This is still water?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, if so much water inside this cave suddenly ignites, what would happen then?"</p><p></p><p>People on the Dust Crossing Boat looked at each other in fear, pondering deeply.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the worries of the crowd, Qi Buyi said, "The change you see happens only when the water is taken out separately."</p><p></p><p>"However, when it remains an integral part of the entire cave, it won't ignite and turn into soil."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"As for why this phenomenon occurs, there is currently no clear answer."</p><p></p><p>"This is also the purpose of our visit."</p><p></p><p>"The abnormality occurring in this cave is different from the usual Five Elements Returning to One."</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance is very intrigued by this. According to previous calculations, the Five Elements Returning to One should be completed within five years at most."</p><p></p><p>"And as the progress continues to accelerate, this number is likely to decrease significantly."</p><p></p><p>"What we must do is to ensure that before the complete return of the Five Elements, we finish building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array that envelops the Five Elements Grand Cave."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the first group of pioneers who have already arrived to build the array, more reinforcements will arrive successively."</p><p></p><p>"We are part of this effort, mainly responsible for the water-attribute domain coverage."</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi explained the mission purpose of this journey succinctly.</p><p></p><p>"Even though it's just a cave, it is extremely vast."</p><p></p><p>"Even larger than the entire Xuanhuang Province where we are from."</p><p></p><p>"Most areas here still lack teleportation arrays, and relying solely on flying is too slow."</p><p></p><p>"For the convenience of future work, the Alliance has prepared some special tools for you."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Buyi took out a black and gold droplet-shaped object and displayed it in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sky Escape Shuttle, a flying treasure specially made by the Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Its speed..."</p><p></p><p>"Is extremely fast."</p>

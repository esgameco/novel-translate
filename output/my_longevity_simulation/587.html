        <div class="content">
            <p>The dry leaves rustled, occasionally a few floated from the tree tops, disappearing without a trace before reaching the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clearly saw the fleeting twisted and agonizing faces on the leaves' surfaces.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, anyone seeing such a bizarre scene would inevitably feel horrified.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in Li Fan's eyes, this place called "Life-Burning Land" was indescribably beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, the foul-smelling air entered his lungs, strangely feeling somewhat sweet.</p><p></p><p>So he greedily took a few more breaths.</p><p></p><p>Carefully observing the monks on the trees, he found that they all had pitch-black eyes, indiscernible facial features, and wore eerie smiles.</p><p></p><p>【New chapter update delay issue, has finally found a solution on the app where you can change the source, download the xbyuan source-switching app here, and at the same time, view the latest chapters of this book on multiple sites.】</p><p></p><p>Their hair connected with tree branches as if for hanging.</p><p></p><p>Some monks' clothes were still intact.</p><p></p><p>While some seemed to have been hanging on the tree for quite some time, their clothes had long been corroded, looking shabby.</p><p></p><p>Some decaying branches wound around their bodies, covering *** places and deeply penetrating their flesh.</p><p></p><p>Wonderful, wonderful!</p><p></p><p>Without the Old Decaying Wood's introduction, upon entering the "Life-Burning Land," Li Fan already understood everything operating here.</p><p></p><p>Facing this eerie scene, Li Fan not only did not feel vigilant or fearful but instead clapped and praised. (Translation note: The text mentions a website which appears to be a spam or advertisement, blocked content is substituted with asterisks.)</p><p></p><p>His tone even carried a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>As if all cultivators in the world should be hung on tree branches.</p><p></p><p>And to be pierced through the flesh by the withered tree before him was an unimaginable glory!</p><p></p><p>How about it, fellow Daoist, wasn't what I said true? The Old Decaying Wood seemed to be getting weaker, coughing continuously for a long time before finally recovering to ask.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, fellow Daoist's words are true! Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Truly a great creation! I wonder, what should this tree be called? He gazed at the withered giant tree with a hint of fascination in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Originally called "Ruo Wood", but now… The Old Decaying Wood also raised its head, with an inexplicable expression on its face.</p><p></p><p>It's called "Genhuan Huanheng Yuan."</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely tongue-twisting term, but the moment Old Decaying Wood mentioned it, Li Fan understood its significance.</p><p></p><p>From ancient times, it had already appeared and would continue to exist eternally. Standing above the River of Life like a wall supporting the sky.</p><p></p><p>No, I still prefer its original name. Li Fan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Old Decaying Wood let out a dark chuckle, indifferent: A name is just a code. As time passes, successive generations of beings change, and the names they are called by also keep changing.</p><p></p><p>But it won't have any impact on its existence.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, as he spoke this sentence, a hint of cloudiness seemed to pass through the Old Decaying Wood's eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan agreed: Although that's true, today is different from the past.</p><p></p><p>Every moment spent here brings many spontaneous images into Li Fan's mind. (Translation note: The text mentions a website that appears to be a spam or advertisement, blocked content is substituted with asterisks.)</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan naturally knew a lot of relevant information.</p><p></p><p>He showed a hint of nostalgia and recited to himself: "Born beings of the heavens and earth, Ruo Wood shortens their lives. Absorb life, produce the elixir of life, those who take it can live long."</p><p></p><p>In the Old Decaying Wood's cloudy eyes, upon hearing the verse from Li Fan's mouth, they also faintly glimmered.</p><p></p><p>After remaining silent for a long time, the two men resumed their conversation.</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoist, you are indeed a person of great wisdom! The Old Decaying Wood sighed heavily.</p><p></p><p>There have been thousands of practitioners who visited here in the past, yet it's very rare to see someone like you with such rapid changes in thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes and spoke solemnly:</p><p></p><p>It's not that I have wisdom, but they are inherently ignorant.</p><p></p><p>What essential difference is there between the practitioners here and other beings?</p><p></p><p>Trees bear fruit, flowers produce nectar. Beasts give birth, birds lay eggs.</p><p></p><p>People take from these, thinking it's ordinary. Why is it hard to accept when one is taken by others?</p><p></p><p>Do they truly think they are the spirits of heaven and earth, the masters of all things?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted.</p><p></p><p>The Old Decaying Wood was caught off guard as Li Fan seemed to speak out what he had prepared to say, feeling somewhat dumbfounded for a moment.</p><p></p><p>I see it as nothing but "survival of the fittest."</p><p></p><p>Now, swallowing, one feels comfortable. One day being eaten by others, there should be no complaints. Heaven's justice is good, and retribution is unshakable!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and immersed himself.</p><p></p><p>The Old Decaying Wood stared at Li Fan for a while, suddenly understanding something.</p><p></p><p>What a pity, what a pity!</p><p></p><p>The Old Decaying Wood shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan ignored him as if he hadn't heard the old man's words.</p><p></p><p>Still, his gaze was fixed on the withered Ruo Wood before him, as if there was something deeply attracting him.</p><p></p><p>But to unexpectedly have such anomalies among the cultivators… The Old Decaying Wood frowned slightly, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Cough…</p><p></p><p>He suddenly burst into a violent cough, faintly showing green blood flowing from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Ruo Wood above his head began to move without any wind, and numerous dry leaves fell along with it.</p><p></p><p>So good to die, so good to die!</p><p></p><p>Seeing something, the Old Decaying Wood's face suddenly revealed a fierce look of madness.</p><p></p><p>He then burst into wild laughter: Indeed, heaven's justice is good, and evildoers have trials within trials!</p><p></p><p>This kid staying with me is pointless. It's better to send him back to cause trouble!</p><p></p><p>Retribution, everything is retribution!</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>After being frenzied for a long time, the Old Decaying Wood gradually regained calm.</p><p></p><p>Returning to being just like when he met Li Fan outside.</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoist, now that you have seen it in person, you must have some idea of our product's quality.</p><p></p><p>Can we continue the previous transaction? He smirked and asked.</p><p></p><p>Transaction? Li Fan turned his head, feeling a moment of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Oh, that thing! No rush! He waved his hand, surprisingly rejecting the proposal.</p><p></p><p>Hehe… The Old Decaying Wood let out an unpleasant laugh: Although this place is good, it's not where you should stay.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm outside seems more suitable for you.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was about to retort but was grabbed by the Old Decaying Wood's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Rolling gray mist surged from the ground, about to envelop him once again.</p><p></p><p>Why are you so eager to make me leave, fellow Daoist? Li Fan asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The Old Decaying Wood smiled sardonically, not answering.</p><p></p><p>You want the Golden Elixir, right? Well, since you've been a good person, I'll just give you some for free this time!</p><p></p><p>The vision was completely obscured by the gray mist, and Li Fan vaguely heard the Old Decaying Wood saying such things in his ear.</p><p></p><p>With a sudden flash before his eyes, Li Fan stumbled and found himself back in the secondary courtyard of the Tianlingzhou Discussion Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Old Decaying Wood, the "Genhuan Huanheng Yuan," and the countless hanging monks had all disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed as if it was just a hallucination for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But the dry yellow tree branch quietly placed on the table was proof of something.</p><p></p><p>Without the influence of the Ruo Wood, Li Fan had regained his normal thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Recalling his recent experience, he felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>Just fearing that the Old Decaying Wood might still be spying from the side, he forcibly suppressed his fear, pretending to be calm.</p><p></p><p>Urgent notice: New address activated-, please rebookmark!</p>

            <p>"Strange, it should be around here, can't be wrong."</p><p></p><p>"But how..."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi furrowed his brows tightly, flying around the area below for most of the day again.</p><p></p><p>Still unable to find the exact location of the opportunity he sensed.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed pointing here, but I can only lock onto a general area. As soon as I enter it, that kind of feeling in my heart inexplicably disappears."</p><p></p><p>"It's like something is deliberately interfering."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Yu's heart was both happy and worried.</p><p></p><p>Such a situation had never happened to him before. According to the records of fate, it was either that this opportunity was too great, exceeding the limit he could bear at the moment, which would be a disaster rather than a blessing. Or the good fortune here was hidden, preventing outsiders from discovering it.</p><p></p><p>"Stable operation for many years of the novel app, comparable to the old version of the book-chasing artifact, the app for changing sources that all bookworms are using."</p><p></p><p>"I can only go down and search for it myself. If things are not possible, I will stop here. After all, no matter what, preserving life needs to come first." After pondering for a moment, Han Yi made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Moving away from the sea of clouds, he traveled for a long time, gradually calming down. He felt that he had been affected by the backlash of fate during this period, and his decisions had been too impulsive. With his knowledge of the "Book of Fate" and the plume of the mysterious bird, plus the awareness of a small world where the destined mysterious bird fell and had not been explored yet.</p><p></p><p>As long as he did not fall prematurely and proceeded step by step, he could steadily achieve the realm of deity transformation and Dao fusion.</p><p></p><p>Even the realm of immortality was not impossible to consider.</p><p></p><p>The "Book of Empty Tribulations" was good, but it was just an embellishment. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Han Yi's mindset gradually became more peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Without the obsession of having to find the opportunity, he casually strolled with the idea of "what is meant to be will be, and what is not meant to be, should not be forced."</p><p></p><p>This place was a small city where ordinary people gathered, without any immortal cultivators guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi also concealed his cultivation base, pretending to be an ordinary person, blending in the crowd.</p><p></p><p>However, the aura of a cultivator was difficult to conceal, and Han Yi stood out among the ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Although it couldn't be confirmed whether Han Yi was a true "immortal master," his extraordinary aura clearly indicated nobility and power.</p><p></p><p>The common people subconsciously avoided him, making it difficult for Han Yi to truly blend in.</p><p></p><p>His plan to secretly search for the opportunity was a failure.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the ancient cultivators practiced heart cultivation. Even though they reached a high level of cultivation, they could still live harmoniously with ordinary people, without any discrepancies. I really don't understand how they did it."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the ordinary people in the city, even before he could speak, they were already trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>Although there were questions asked, the answers were vague. None of it was relevant.</p><p></p><p>It was simply a dream to find the true opportunity among them.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi couldn't help feeling a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Opportunities are like this, pursuing them on purpose only ends up in disappointment."</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to give up, he left the city pretending and returned with a different face, wandering around the city for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>All to no avail. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>He wanted to try his luck in the surrounding areas of the small city, but the location he sensed shrank once again.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity was within the city!</p><p></p><p>This visible but untouchable feeling made Han Yi feel suffocated and nauseated.</p><p></p><p>The calm emotions he had finally achieved were once again agitated.</p><p></p><p>He began to feel impatient and anxious.</p><p></p><p>But the more anxious he became, the more elusive the opportunity seemed.</p><p></p><p>And so, he didn't know how long he had stayed in the city, almost treading every inch of the land.</p><p></p><p>Still, there was no harvest.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary people in the city noticed this.</p><p></p><p>They may not have cultivated themselves, but it didn't mean they were foolish.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the cultivator had been wandering in the city for a long time and was reluctant to leave, clearly meant he was searching for something.</p><p></p><p>So the news of "treasure in the city" spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>Although including Han Yi, no one knew what this treasure was.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't stop the people in the city from becoming suspicious and paranoid.</p><p></p><p>Whether they found it themselves, hid it secretly, and changed their fate by using the treasure; or chose to report it, hoping for a reward from the immortal master.</p><p></p><p>For the ordinary people in the city, it was an opportunity to completely change their destiny.</p><p></p><p>They ransacked their homes, took out items that had been around for years and looked suspicious, carefully examining them.</p><p></p><p>The subtle actions of the ordinary people in the city couldn't escape Han Yi's scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>As long as the sense of fate remained, the opportunity was still there.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to monitor the entire city.</p><p></p><p>After a few more months passed like this with no progress, Han Yi finally decided to give up.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I am destined to be devoid of it." Han Yi sighed in disappointment, preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he suddenly sensed that the long-standing unchanged sense of fate had changed!</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's heart rate instantly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his consciousness swept through the entire city, and Han Yi noticed an old man wearing a raincoat with a fish trap on his back, appearing to be leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Is it him?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi didn't know the exact name of this person. He only knew that he was called "Lao Yu" by the people, a common fisherman.</p><p></p><p>He would fish in a river to the east of the city every day and sell the catch in the city.</p><p></p><p>Because of his silence and lack of promotion, his business was mediocre. However, his low prices allowed him to make a living.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi had met this man before, but besides a raincoat, he had nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Living in poverty, there was no trace of any treasure in his possession.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he recently caught something from the river?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's mind raced, and when he saw the fishing trap on the old man's back, he became even more certain of his speculation.</p><p></p><p>He stood up abruptly, ignoring many things, and headed straight towards the fisherman outside the city.</p><p></p><p>However, as he eagerly approached to ask the old man, the wrinkled old man suddenly looked up in Han Yi's direction and casually glanced over.</p><p></p><p>This glance was like a bucket of cold water poured over him.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's body stood on end, feeling a sudden horror.</p><p></p><p>"This is wrong!"</p><p></p><p>His inner perception began to scream frantically, and the auspicious sign of fate he had sensed turned into an unimaginable disaster.</p><p></p><p>He instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity in this place was not some treasure. This fisherman was not an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>He was a true powerful being hidden for some unknown reason in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity was himself!</p><p></p><p>He had been staying in the city all along, hence the sense of fate always enveloped and located him in this small city.</p><p></p><p>He had unknowingly ignored the real dragon numerous times.</p><p></p><p>Now that he chose to leave, the sense of fate had changed!</p><p></p><p>If he had just impulsively angered this powerful being...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Han Yi, who had figured out everything, broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>His flying speed slowed down immediately, and Han Yi decided not to take this risk and gave up on it.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, and why are you here?"</p>

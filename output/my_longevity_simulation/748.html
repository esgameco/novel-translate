        <h1>Chapter 748</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"We all come from different small worlds, and compared to the Xuanhuang Realm, we have an innate gap in levels. However, we also have advantages that cannot be overlooked."</p><p></p><p>"That is diversity."  </p><p></p><p>"Just as your [Empire] can manipulate strange beasts for battle, over the years, other small worlds have also developed different, bizarre abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they are weaker than the immortal arts of the Xuanhuang Realm, if we can concentrate all our strength and combine the strengths of the myriad realms, it's not impossible for us to summarize and research a system that can rival the immortal arts."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai spoke expansively.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing's first reaction was to shake her head. However, before she could open her mouth, Xu Bai raised his hand to stop her and said solemnly: "As the saying goes, 'matters depend on human effort.' Everyone knows hope is slim, but at this juncture, we have no choice but to fight desperately."</p><p></p><p>"The mortals ruled by cultivators, what kind of life do they live? I imagine you understand that better than I do, Daoist friend."</p><p></p><p>"The members of the Allied Realms are all rulers of their realms. Even if they die, they probably wouldn't want to live the life of cattle and horses."</p><p></p><p>"The Allied Realms is the overriding trend. Those who are unwilling..."</p><p>Xu Bai's expression suddenly darkened: "Although it won't come to crossing swords with you, it's also impossible for us to provide you shelter anymore."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing said softly: "Friend, you don't need to worry too much. Our Empire absolutely will not side with the Xuanhuang Realm. However, imperial affairs are not something I can decide alone."</p><p></p><p>"Please wait here for a moment, friend. I need to discuss with the Empress and the Imperial Council."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Bai nodded in understanding. At the same time, he also made his own request: "I've heard that the Empire was built on the corpse of a three-headed divine bird."</p><p></p><p>"Yet the bird's skull was cut off by a sword strike from a cultivator back then."  </p><p></p><p>"Such an extraordinary sight, since I've come here, if I can't see it with my own eyes, it would be a great pity. I wonder if my friend can fulfill this long-held wish of mine?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing looked at Xu Bai's smiling face, her eyes flickering. After a moment, she agreed: "It's no big deal. Since you're interested, friend, I'll have someone take you there later. But the place where the skull was cut, there are still sword qi and lingering resentment, so you'll need to be very careful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai looked surprised, and then delighted: "For the sword qi to still remain after so long, one can imagine the grandeur back then. With you saying that, friend, I'm even more looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing smiled without speaking. After she left, about half an hour later, a girl who looked around seventeen or eighteen, wearing a gauzy dress, walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, please come with me."</p><p></p><p>The girl in the gauzy dress summoned a swollen, spherical strange beast. A hole opened in the sphere, and the girl walked inside. </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, also somewhat curious, followed her in. Inside the sphere were seats for people. Once they entered, it began swelling up again.</p><p></p><p>It floated slowly out of the pointed tower palace, speeding rapidly towards the distant "Imperial Sacred Ground."</p><p></p><p>The body of the spherical strange beast gradually became transparent, allowing Xu Bai to see the surrounding scenery.</p><p></p><p>"This is a [Flying Sphere Beast]. After swelling up, it can soar through the nine heavens, riding the winds with extreme speed. When the people of the Empire travel to the Sacred Ground for sightseeing, they often use this method..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is the way it is," the woman in the gauze skirt explained softly to Xu Bai.</p><p>...</p><p>As the woman gently introduced, they soon arrived at one of the severed heads of the Crimson Nine-Headed Beast.</p><p>"This is one of the nine sacred temples."</p><p>Xu Bai followed the woman into the quiet building, and as soon as he stepped in, he vaguely sensed the sound of howling and wailing.</p><p>The floor and walls were covered with black stone slabs, making the solemn and gloomy temple stand out.</p><p>Without the woman's guidance, Xu Bai walked towards the direction where the sound came from, towards the depths of the temple.</p><p>The deeper he went, the louder the cries of the strange beasts became.</p><p>From the woman's introduction, Xu Bai learned that these were not just the sounds of the Crimson Nine-Headed Beast before its death.</p><p>Rather, they were the collective lamentations of the countless strange beasts that the empire had slaughtered and sacrificed over the years to appease the wrath of the divine bird.</p><p>Every sacred temple had countless strange beasts that had met a tragic end.</p><p>The lingering resentful spirits were enough to turn the ordinary area into a hell-like underworld.</p><p>But in this temple, although it felt eerie, there were no haunting vengeful spirits.</p><p>This was because there was a supremely sharp sword qi that firmly suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh..."</p><p>A strand of hair suddenly floated down, causing Xu Bai to stop in his tracks.</p><p>Ahead, the black flesh and blood were tangled together like vines, occasionally twitching, making it hard to believe that this was the corpse of a demonic beast that had died thousands of years ago.</p><p>And above the black mass of flesh, there was a red sword qi.</p><p>Like a long rope, it floated unsteadily.</p><p>In fact, this red sword qi was invisible to ordinary cultivators, let alone common mortals in the empire.</p><p>They could only infer the presence of "immortal sword qi" from the constantly suppressed black flesh and the occasional sword qi bursts.</p><p>But Xu Bai could see everything clearly.</p><p>Xu Bai closed his eyes slightly.</p><p>A scene suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>It was a flash of red light that illuminated the heavens and earth, seemingly even faster than lightning.</p><p>The sharpness contained within it was as if it could cleave the heavens and earth.</p><p>"It appears like a rope, but is actually... a sword," Xu Bai contemplated, gazing at the red line before him.</p><p>"Is this the red rope that Senior Bai gifted me? Compared to the [Wooden Sword] I saw in the Fallen Immortal Realm, this sword qi has an even stronger aura of retribution."</p><p>"Rather than a pure sword, it seems to carry a hint of punishment."</p><p>Countless realizations kept surging from Xu Bai's heart.</p><p>He seemed to see the figure of Senior Bai lightly plucking a strand of thread.</p><p>And then the mighty and peerless Crimson Nine-Headed Beast died on the spot.</p><p>...</p><p>Xu Bai remained immersed in his contemplations, unaware of the passage of time.</p><p>The woman in the gauze skirt did not dare to disturb him, standing silently behind Xu Bai.</p><p>Not far from Xu Bai, separated by a wall of the temple, Little Qing and a graceful young woman were intently staring at Xu Bai through the transparent wall.</p><p>"How is it? Can you confirm it?" Little Qing asked, a rare hint of urgency in her eyes.</p><p>The young woman kept her eyes closed. Her eyelashes were trembling, and beads of sweat were rolling down her face.</p><p>After a long time, she suddenly opened her eyes, a look of shock on her face.</p><p>"How can this be?" she exclaimed. "When I looked at him, it was as if I was looking at myself!"</p>

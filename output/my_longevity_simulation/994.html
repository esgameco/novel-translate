        <h1>Chapter 994</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan began analyzing the information about the Zhangjing Sect's "Cang" lineage given by Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there wasn't much information about Cang himself.</p><p></p><p>It was only known that Cang was also a survivor of the Great Calamity. When the Dharma Heavenly Venerable re-established the Wanxian Alliance, in addition to the Dharma practitioners who responded one after another, Cang, who "knew how to take advantage of the situation," also rose to the top in one step by surrendering at the first opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the internal analysis of the Dharma practitioners on Cang indicated that there must be other factors involved for him to become a Zhangjing Master. He must have had an extremely special reason to be chosen by the Dharma Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>There was obviously much more information about Cang's daughter, Feixue Immortal Venerable Xuan Sushang.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang was born before Cang joined the Wanxian Alliance, and her mother died protecting Cang in a battle between cultivators when she was very young.</p><p></p><p>The father and daughter relied on each other for survival, so Cang doted on Xuan Sushang extremely.</p><p></p><p>Especially after Cang gradually gained power, he became even more generous in rewarding Xuan Sushang.</p><p></p><p>According to incomplete statistics, just in the four central states of the Immortal Alliance, Xuan Sushang had more than 200 cave abodes and territories of various sizes.</p><p></p><p>This did not include the offerings from the various families attached to Xuan Sushang.</p><p></p><p>It was said that Xuan Sushang's cultivation talent was actually average, but at her level, even if her talent was poor, it could be made up for with sufficient resources.</p><p></p><p>Especially under the new law framework.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang cultivated smoothly all the way to the Hedao realm.</p><p></p><p>It was said that on the day of sacrificing the Aura of Heaven and Earth: Feixue, Cang sent out as many as five Hedao powerhouses to escort her and ensure that there would be no accidents.</p><p></p><p>After Xuan Sushang was promoted to Hedao, she finally gained a little more freedom.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Cang did not allow her to leave the jurisdiction of the four central states of the Immortal Alliance. And wherever she went, someone would be sent to keep an eye on her.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after being liberated, Xuan Sushang spent nearly a hundred years traveling through most of the Wanxian Alliance's territories.</p><p></p><p>During this period, only a general outline of her specific whereabouts could be investigated.</p><p></p><p>After having enough fun, Xuan Sushang finally settled down. Perhaps out of interest, she began to devote herself to the study of artifact refining. The Immortal Alliance's Artifact Refining Hall was fully open to her, allowing Xuan Sushang to learn the most advanced artifact refining knowledge of the Wanxian Alliance. Her artifact refining skills also progressed rapidly, and she became famous throughout the world by successfully refining a peerless battle armor that could withstand the joint attack of five Hedao powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>After that...</p><p></p><p>It seemed that she had had enough fun and gradually became low-key.</p><p></p><p>Except for frequent interactions with a few good friends such as Lu Xichan, the chief of the Strategy Formation Hall, she rarely appeared in public view.</p><p></p><p>Until she suddenly issued a message of a martial arts competition to find a husband, once again shocking the world.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, no one took up the challenge, and it ended in a farce with Xuan Sushang mysteriously becoming pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang's son was Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to appear out of nowhere, without ten months of pregnancy or any information about his father.</p><p></p><p>Just as Cang's love for Xuan Sushang was somewhat deformed, Xuan Sushang's discipline of Shuo Feng was also almost harsh.</p><p></p><p>According to the information, until he reached the Yuanying stage, Shuo Feng had never left that cave abode in Tianquan State.</p><p></p><p>He could only peek at the outside world through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This situation was alleviated after Shuo Feng successfully transformed into a divine being and struggled with all his might.</p><p></p><p>According to the secret investigation by the Dharma transmitters, this golden light armor not only had a freakish defensive ability, enough to withstand the joint attack of more than ten Dao cultivators, but even the divine soul was also protected as firmly as an impenetrable fortress.</p><p></p><p>After the golden light armor disintegrated due to damage, it could still directly transfer Shuo Feng to a safe place.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Every once in a while, Shuo Feng has to report to and pay respects to the Immortal Feixue."</p><p></p><p>"Although their meeting places are not fixed and are only notified in advance, it is possible to infer the few most likely ones..."</p><p></p><p>"The next one should be in twenty-three days."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the names and information of the five cave abodes that were circled, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh slightly, "Even at my speed of earning contribution points, it would probably take more than ten years to buy such a cave abode."</p><p></p><p>"This kid, born not knowing how much he has."</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng's face appeared in front of Li Fan's eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"At this point in time, he shouldn't have the intention to thoroughly re-cultivate yet and should still be at the Divine Transformation stage."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of stimulation he received to make such an impulsive decision."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the safest way is to lie in ambush at the Sword Tomb of Tianjian Sect and capture him without anyone knowing."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there's not enough time. And Xuan Suhuang also needs to be captured together..."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Transformation Stone in his mind kept flashing with a blue light. Li Fan began to infer based on the various forces he had at his disposal.</p><p></p><p>"If it's just to trap and capture them alive, there shouldn't be a big problem."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I alone am barely enough, let alone with the help of Tian Yang and Bai Hua."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... but I still have to pull Mo Rubin in as well."</p><p></p><p>The various techniques, divine powers, and the general information of their cultivation methods used by Xuan Suhuang and Shuo Feng when cultivating and practicing martial arts in the Tianxuan Mirror all appeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the strengths of both sides, one possible future scene after another flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"As the direct descendants of the mirror holder, they should be well aware that the information in the Tianxuan Mirror is by no means a secret. I believe their true combat power is definitely not limited to what's on the surface."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I also have many hidden cards."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a day and night of inference, Li Fan was almost fully prepared for this ambush.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was just a matter of waiting for the best time to strike.</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Li Fan took out the Wusheng Diadem and the Ink-Stained Evil Book gifted by Mo Rubin to study for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Wusheng Diadem was like a living creature. A rough scan with divine sense revealed that the formation inside was like countless fierce beasts fighting each other, devouring and evolving.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency naturally couldn't compare to the Separation Disc combined from nine discs, but it still gave Li Fan some brand new inspiration.</p><p></p><p>If Mo Rubin's attempt to obtain the Separation Disc failed, perhaps the Final Separation Disc could be split into two again and let them confront each other.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would be more efficient to infer new techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to feed the Wusheng Diadem to the Separation Disc, but unfortunately, the Separation Disc wasn't interested in it at all. It didn't even bother to look at it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, sensing the aura of the Final Separation Disc, the countless formations that made up the Wusheng Diadem instantly became agitated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and directly suppressed and sealed this treasure.</p>

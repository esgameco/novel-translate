        <h1>Chapter 1247</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The world has Ruomu, day and night consuming life and longevity. ‚òÖÂΩ° ‚ûÖ‚ûàÔº≥Ôº®œÖùìß.œÇùëúùïÑ ÂΩ°‚òÖ"</p><p></p><p>"No reincarnation in life and death, only immortality remains..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not startled by the sudden appearance of Ruomu. Instead, he slowly chanted with a steady pace. At the same time, he turned around and looked straight at the most ancient tree between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu, on the other hand, looked at the Faceless Holy Emperor, with a hint of doubt flashing in his old eyes. </p><p></p><p>However, what Li Ping said next made the wrinkles on Ruomu's face deepen.</p><p></p><p>"Your whole being is bestowed by heaven and earth. If it weren't for the favor of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, the so-called [Heng Huan Huan Heng Yuan] would be nothing more than an ordinary big tree."</p><p></p><p>"When the Heavenly Dao is in peril, you don't rise up to fight, but live in hiding..."</p><p></p><p>"It was you who first betrayed the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, not the heaven and earth abandoning you first." Li Ping had no sympathy at all and sarcastically mocked.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Ruomu's expression froze on his face, motionless.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the ancient tree itself swayed its branches and leaves slightly. The countless cultivator fruits hanging on it also shook along with it.</p><p></p><p>"Rise up and fight? Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao has been suppressed, what can I do? On the contrary, you, with the body of a cultivator, devoured the Heavenly Dao's cultivation. Saying these things, don't you find it ridiculous?" Ruomu stared at Li Ping for a long time, unable to see through his background.</p><p></p><p>However, cultivators in the world are more or less the same.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the faint aura that originally belonged to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao on Li Ping made Ruomu make a judgment and refute.</p><p></p><p>It was just a verbal jab, without direct action.</p><p></p><p>It was not that Ruomu suddenly changed his nature and became good-tempered, but...</p><p></p><p>He really couldn't win.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not actually shown, in fact, Ruomu's spiritual sense was frantically warning him. As the most ancient spiritual being between heaven and earth, Ruomu's intuition had reached a mysterious point where he could almost glimpse the possible future.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu was very sure that if he fought with this uninvited guest, the one who would perish would definitely be himself.</p><p></p><p>And the oppressive aura on the other party, even stronger than the Longevity Realm cultivators he had seen before, made Ruomu even more certain of his judgment.</p><p></p><p>Indeed. Ruomu was now critically ill and dilapidated. But he was still alive after all.</p><p></p><p>Of course he wouldn't seek his own death.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with Zhen taking back his own things?" Li Ping no longer suppressed, and released the aura of the devoured Xuanhuang evil thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"This is?!" Ruomu's mind was instantly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He could naturally distinguish between the fragmented laws absorbed by cultivators and the complete Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>But how is this possible?</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate?" This thought suddenly flashed in Ruomu's mind, but it was quickly denied by him.</p><p></p><p>Even if most of his power had been lost, the deep connection with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao still remained. If there was a new Great Heavenly Venerate succeeding, he couldn't possibly be unaware.</p><p></p><p>"Taking back his own things, could it be the Heavenly Dao itself?" Ruomu thought with some disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This guess was really hard to believe, but it was the most consistent with the current situation.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be confirmed yet, but it didn't prevent Ruomu's attitude from suddenly changing.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally stated his intention to take back Ruomu's power.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Ruomu to react, Li Ping changed the topic: "When the Heavenly Dao was in danger, the Xuanhuang ancient objects watched indifferently and did nothing to save it. Therefore, the Heavenly Dao instinctively took back your powers."</p><p></p><p>"Although there were external forces helping the Heavenly Dao recover, this process of taking back has not stopped. Everything is predestined. You don't need to resent it."</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to completely end it."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's gaze turned back to that towering, decaying ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>As well as the countless Golden Core cultivators sinking on it.</p><p></p><p>"However, now it seems that you didn't do nothing at all. Even if it's just a drop in the bucket, you did make some effort."</p><p></p><p>A golden, vast power suddenly burst out from Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>A golden giant hand instantly appeared near Ruomu's main body. It gently picked one of the cultivator fruits on the treetop.</p><p></p><p>With a light squeeze, the cultivator's body instantly vanished into ashes, leaving only an incomplete Golden Core suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's action of picking his own fruit did not cause the slightest fluctuation in Ruomu's mood.</p><p></p><p>Only in his eyes, a hint of vindictiveness flashed instinctively.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm today are wrong?" </p><p></p><p>After a brief silence in the Jianren Shou space, Li Ping suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"How can it be just wrong? I wish I could turn all these ungrateful wretches into fruits and torture them for eternity." Ruomu finally responded through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators in the world certainly have their faults. But the root of their conflict with heaven and earth is the essence." Li Ping said very calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Why do cultivators devour heaven and earth? It's just because this is the only path they can take. The root of everything comes from that Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's voice kept echoing, and Ruomu also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was clear about this truth.</p><p></p><p>But what can be done?</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter was too strong after going against the laws of heaven and earth. Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao itself couldn't resist, let alone the living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Zhen wants to set things right, kill the Dharma Transmitter, and return the Dao to heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to help me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's cold voice reached Ruomu's ears.</p><p></p><p>However, the one making such a grand declaration now was the possible incarnation of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao...</p><p></p><p>This made Ruomu not know how to answer for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu was clear that if he chose to refuse, then a great battle between the two would be inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention who was stronger, just saying that this was where his main body was located, if the battle took place here in retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could win, he would definitely suffer heavy damage again, and it wouldn't be long before he completely broke down.</p><p></p><p>But to be subdued by a few words, Ruomu felt all kinds of unwillingness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Your decline, in addition to your own injuries, is also related to the severed flow of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"If you pledge allegiance to Zhen..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping took a step forward, his figure shattered with a bang. Under the blessing of the golden light surrounding his body, his thirty-three-foot tall figure expanded tens of thousands of times in an instant, almost becoming the same size as Ruomu's main body.</p><p></p><p>He placed a hand on Ruomu's trunk.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>In Ruomu's space, a vortex suddenly appeared in the dark and desolate sky.</p><p></p><p>The reflection of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared in the vortex.</p><p></p><p>The green aura was extracted from the vortex and slowly drifted towards the aging Ruomu.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Ruomu excitedly straightened his originally slightly hunched back, his eyes full of joy and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the favor of the Heavenly Dao, which had been slowly dissipating for thousands of years, had returned to him for the first time!</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said</p><p></p><p>Sure, here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Indeed, all of his transformative powers came from the blessings of the Primordial Heavenly Way. </p><p></p><p>Without the nourishment from the Heavenly Dao, he was like a tree without roots, water without a source, slowly withering away and entering a state of chronic death.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Primordial Heavenly Dao unprecedentedly infused him with a bit of power again.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was not the familiar power of life and death that he was used to, it still made him extremely excited and revived his vitality.</p><p></p><p>The withered branches and leaves of the Ruomu tree trembled greatly from top to bottom. </p><p></p><p>Quite a few cultivator fruits fell from above due to this, smashing into pieces. Only the shattered golden cores, glowing with different lights, were left lying quietly on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Traces of greenery appeared on the body of the Ruomu tree. </p><p></p><p>Just as Ruomu was intoxicated in enjoying the vigorous vitality that it had not felt for a long time...</p><p></p><p>The golden giant transformed by Li Ping suddenly removed his palm placed on the tree trunk.</p><p></p><p>The vortex above Ruomu disappeared abruptly.</p><p></p><p>The descending green vitality also vanished like bubbles at the same time, turning into specks of green light and scattering in the wind, not falling on Ruomu's body.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst Ruomu's wails, the tender buds that had just been born also instantly withered and fell.</p><p></p><p>Slowly drifting down from the top of the tree.</p><p></p><p>"I want more!"</p><p></p><p>"Give it to me quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of the old Ruomu tree erupted with shocking resentment. </p><p></p><p>Glaring fiercely at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Then, upon seeing the other party's empty face and extremely cold aura, Ruomu instantly calmed down again.</p><p></p><p>The fierce expression froze on his face, not daring to make the next move.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also just quietly gazed at the other party.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the scene was eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>Until the withered yellow leaf happened to fall above Li Ping, and he gently reached out to take it.</p><p></p><p>The silence was finally broken by Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>He said the words that he had not finished saying just now: "Just as you saw and personally experienced."</p><p></p><p>"If you repent and stand on my side again, it's not impossible to return to the ancient peak times."</p><p></p><p>Ruomu's expression was obviously shaken.</p><p></p><p>Struggling on the verge of death and suffering for thousands of years, now that he finally tasted a moment of youthful flavor, to let him give it up again...</p><p></p><p>How could he do it?</p><p></p><p>"I know that you were severely injured in ancient times, and more than half of your core power was seized by cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"But the current Primordial Heavenly Dao is also vastly different from before."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping continued.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a month to consider."</p><p></p><p>"By then, I will come again."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not excessively force Ruomu to make a decision immediately. </p><p></p><p>Leaving only this sentence, his figure disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>This was a space dominated by Ruomu, yet Ruomu didn't even notice how the other party left.</p><p></p><p>Without the outsider, this place returned to the same deathly stillness it had been for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu narrowed his eyes, constantly savoring the taste of vitality just now.</p><p></p><p>Comparing it with the current situation, he couldn't help but feel a sense of loss welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty began.</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Li Ping did upon returning was to issue a holy decree.</p><p></p><p>Reallocating some of the Youzu people to appease the Primordial Heavenly Dao by shifting their function towards the Dark Abyss Sea.</p><p></p><p>"In the current state, forcibly having the Primordial Heavenly Dao infuse power into Ruomu still had some impact."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it was just that little bit..."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the gap caused by devouring the Primordial Evil Thoughts before, it also has a bit to do with Ruomu's identity."</p><p></p><p>"After all, in the eyes of the Heavenly Dao, these Primordial Ancient Objects are not much different from traitors."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered slowly.</p><p></p><p>This action was not entirely fruitless.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu, having had a taste, would definitely not refuse Li Ping's request.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to give him some time to make a decision.</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't choose to take action by force, directly devouring it like he did with the Primordial Evil Thoughts...</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Heavenly Dao created it, and it became a fixed part of the Primordial World. If it naturally loses the Heavenly Dao's favor and perishes, perhaps turmoil can still be avoided."</p><p></p><p>"But if I rashly devour it, firstly, it will alert the other immortal powerhouses in this realm."</p><p></p><p>"Secondly, the anomaly in the Primordial World might be noticed by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate far away in the Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping didn't care about the five Heavenly Venerates of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>But he had to consider the existence of the Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Physician Venerates.</p><p></p><p>"Now is not yet the time to truly confront them."</p><p></p><p>"Just wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had ample patience.</p><p></p><p>He believed that in less than a month, Ruomu would take the initiative to contact him.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he still needed to try to reverse some of the relationship with the Primordial Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Some existences that the Primordial Heavenly Dao abhorred appeared in Li Ping's eyes again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>The border between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang easily passed through the defensive formation at the border of the Myriad Immortals Alliance and entered the territory of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures passed down by Master are indeed profound, the formations of the Myriad Immortals Alliance can be broken almost instantly."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang carefully observed the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem much different from the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"But Master said that this place is shrouded by the power of Heavenly Venerate's reverse principles, so it's better to keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>A simple map appeared in his mind. After identifying the directions a bit, Sun Erlang concealed his figure and sped away.</p><p></p><p>Following the Faceless Holy Emperor's instructions, he headed straight for the True Reality Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how I can meet this 'True Reality Heavenly Venerate'?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang pondered as he flew.</p><p></p><p>With the formations and secret techniques passed down by Li Ping to conceal his aura, no one could discover him along the way.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was very close to the True Reality Kingdom, the nearby anomaly attracted Sun Erlang's attention, making him slow down involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>A huge flying ship with a rather unreal feeling suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen cultivators wrapped in armor flew out from the ship at the same time.</p><p></p><p>They held strange magic tools in their hands and were also shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place, hurry! We can't let the other teams get ahead of us!"</p><p></p><p>They flew above a jungle on the ground, and the magic tools in their hands simultaneously released light beams of different colors.</p><p></p><p>The light beams locked on, and a snow-white giant ape suddenly appeared in the jungle, letting out an earth-shaking roar.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>Because this demon beast was actually hidden so ingeniously that he couldn't even sense a bit of its aura before.</p><p></p><p>And even now, while the giant ape was fiercely battling with that team of cultivators,</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang still couldn't sense any aura of living beings from that demon beast.</p>

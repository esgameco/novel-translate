            <p>Chapter 1233 Heaven Bestows Great Strength</p><p></p><p>The perspective shifts back to a moment earlier. ‚Ä¢._.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢¬¥¬Ø``‚Ä¢.¬∏¬∏.‚Ä¢` ‚ûÖ‚ùæ—ïùî•ùìæ◊ê.ƒåœÉùìÇ `‚Ä¢.¬∏¬∏.‚Ä¢¬¥¬¥¬Ø`‚Ä¢‚Ä¢._.‚Ä¢</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sacred Emperor, having devoured the remnant world will of the Congyun Sea and returned to the Daqi Small World, finally gained a more concrete understanding of the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he needed to focus all his attention on the many trivial matters within the Sacred Dynasty. There wasn't much spare time left for his own contemplation.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Ping could handle all matters, big and small, within the Sacred Dynasty with great ease, without even using a third of his power.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the pure quantitative increase in his divine soul, Li Ping's senses also seemed to have become more acute.</p><p></p><p>As he looked down upon this world, he discovered the nascent consciousness of the small world that was being nurtured due to the world's upgrade. Previously, the Daqi Small World merely operated spontaneously according to instinct, unlike the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, which had very obvious "personified" manifestations. However, because of Li Ping's continuous transformation of the Daqi Small World, it had already met the basic conditions for the birth of self-consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The birth of a world's will is a rather lengthy process. According to Li Ping's estimate, if it proceeded at the current normal speed, it would take at least a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>However, if Li Ping continued to promote Daqi's upgrade, this time would be correspondingly shortened.</p><p></p><p>The Daqi Small World's current state was entirely due to Li Ping's transformation. The Sacred Dynasty's Daqi fortune, which had merged with Li Ping, was flourishing and unstoppably powerful, also exerting various subtle influences on the small world.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators are born of heaven and earth. But for Li Ping, the current Daqi Small World seemed more like his creation. The grace of recreation was like that of the world's father and mother...</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the Sacred Emperor's throne, all sorts of profound insights kept surfacing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>They originated not only from his own thoughts but also from the help of this world.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping felt that he seemed to have grasped some extremely critical information.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, his train of thought was unexpectedly disrupted by a sense of forewarning in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Upon investigation, Li Ping discovered that in the net of Source Power Essence he had laid out, a prey actually showed signs of breaking free.</p><p></p><p>Strands of peculiar fluctuations emanated from its body, as if wanting to escape the restraint of the golden giant net.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Luyuan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping still had some impression of this Wanxian League Hedao cultivator who had just expressed his intention to surrender to the Sacred Dynasty not long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the people from the Wanxian League discovered and took action?" Li Ping couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly sensed what was happening to Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's heart instantly became a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Source Power Essence in Sun Luyuan's body, Li Ping instantly arrived at his side.</p><p></p><p>Reaching out his hand and placing it on Sun Luyuan's shoulder, surging golden power continuously poured into his body.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Sun Luyuan's body, which had been slowly becoming a bit transparent, finally solidified again.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty, for saving my life." Realizing what had just happened, Sun Luyuan said in lingering fear, his face full of trepidation and gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping slowly withdrew his hand, but his senses still did not leave Sun Luyuan's back.</p><p></p><p>He could not directly observe the existence named [Qingfeng].</p><p></p><p>"You are quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Qingfeng's voice happening to ring out, Li Ping would have almost thought she was Sun Luyuan's illusion.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to believe</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xin, it turned out that there were things within the Xuanhuang Realm that even Li Ping could not observe.</p><p></p><p>"What are you?" </p><p></p><p>Without any intention of insult, Li Ping asked rather solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan lowered his head, hiding all the expressions on his face.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Qingfeng was not angered either: "I wish I knew myself."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I have forgotten," she said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>"My memory is not very good. Except for Xiaoxu, A-Liu and a few others, my impression of the other people is not very deep..."</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?" Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>"Li Ping," Li Ping replied concisely. </p><p></p><p>He sensed a presence similar to Yin Shangren's in Qingfeng. But there seemed to be a subtle difference.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can help you remember." His intuition told him that the secrets Qingfeng held might be helpful when the time came to go to war with the Wanxian Alliance in the future. So he took the initiative and said.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I feel you have ulterior motives."</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that Qingfeng would see through the ploy with a single sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there are not many in this world who are truly good to me." Qingfeng's tone became gloomy and low once again.</p><p></p><p>And the moment Li Ping heard these words, the golden Yuan power within his body surged spontaneously. </p><p></p><p>This was a sign that his active body protection had been triggered.</p><p></p><p>Since Qingfeng chose to make a move, Li Ping naturally would not hold back either.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the majestic phantom image of the Holy Dynasty suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Golden light poured out from the Holy Dynasty's image unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>Forming a giant hand, it directly grasped the position where Qingfeng was.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping thought, since he could not observe the other party, he might as well directly seal off and take away the space where Qingfeng was, and bring it back to study slowly.</p><p></p><p>But this extremely strange Qingfeng could not be subdued simply by this method.</p><p></p><p>However, Qingfeng's voice still came from that void.</p><p></p><p>"You want to take me back?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to be with me forever? If so, why resist then?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense." Responding to Qingfeng was a cold snort from the Faceless Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>On Li Ping's originally empty face, vague features actually began to manifest.</p><p></p><p>But they did not look like ordinary human features. More like the evolution of different energies.</p><p></p><p>Especially those two eyes, silver-white vortexes, as dazzling as the starry river in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The power of heaven and earth, bestowed upon me."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's majestic voice resounded like thunder.</p><p></p><p>The sky over Luoyan Prefecture instantly changed color due to these words.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to drag me down, you'll have to see if you have what it takes!"</p><p></p><p>Sensing the extremely close connection between himself and the Xuanhuang Dao of Heaven, Li Ping then released the protection of the golden Yuan power, allowing Qingfeng's strange power to devour him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Flashes of lightning appeared one after another in the overcast clouds, and the earth trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The color of Li Ping's body faded for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But soon, it returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Instead, on Qingfeng's side, some blurry images were actually pulled out!</p><p></p><p>"Found you!"</p><p></p><p>Two beams of light suddenly shot out from Li Ping's vortex-like eyes.</p><p></p><p>Like chains, they locked onto Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Come out!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping let out a furious shout, and the golden giant hand appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing the silver chains, it gave a fierce pull.</p><p></p><p>The previously small black spatial fissure that was healing instantly showed signs of violently collapsing outward.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share our website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

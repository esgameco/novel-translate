        <h1>Chapter 1194</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1192: A Thousand Years of Soul Returning Home</p><p></p><p>Even though the Holy Dynasty of Daqi's paper strength has been expanding rapidly, it is still far from enough to contend with the Myriad Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Society at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the initial stage of the plan, the focus is still on infiltration and erosion.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Upheaval of Xuanhuang more than half a year ago, the Immortal Alliance lost quite a few grassroots cultivators. Now, there are already rumors circulating that in the upcoming recruitment exam, the Immortal Alliance will expand its recruitment to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping has already selected a batch of promising candidates, ready to send them into the Myriad Immortal Alliance when the opportunity arises.</p><p></p><p>Although grassroots cultivators seem insignificant, they can slowly erode the internal governance of the Immortal Alliance like woodworms. Moreover, as time passes, the greater their cultivation and merits, the higher their positions will be, and the harm and influence they cause will gradually increase.</p><p></p><p>The investment cost is extremely low, but the effect is excellent. The more, the better.</p><p></p><p>"With the existence of the golden source power network, not only can they successfully infiltrate the Immortal Alliance, but they can also be firmly controlled from beginning to end."</p><p></p><p>"Without the need to meet in reality, information and even material exchanges can be completed."</p><p></p><p>"This method of contact is far more covert and secure than the Myriad Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Society, making it extremely difficult for them to discover."</p><p></p><p>In addition to eroding the Myriad Immortal Alliance from within, reducing its potential must also be carried out simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Realm, all the top cultivators in the next hundred years must be captured. If they cannot be used by me, they should be eliminated as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"We can even divert the trouble and frame the Five Elders Society for the assassination plans."</p><p></p><p>"I will sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight..."</p><p></p><p>While weakening the Myriad Immortal Alliance by various means, Li Ping will certainly not slow down the development of the Holy Dynasty of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>Once the number of Youzu people reaches a certain scale and enough pure golden source power is collected, Li Ping will use it to transform the Tiandi Wanling Formation.</p><p></p><p>The Daqi Small World will be truly built into an impregnable fortress, hidden and drifting in the void.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that since the arrival of top talents like Yin Shangren and Ou Daozi in the Daqi Small World to serve me, the momentum of the Holy Dynasty, which had already hit a bottleneck, has ushered in the possibility of another breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"This is [one waxes as the other wanes], I have devoured the fortune that originally belonged to the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It's just not enough to fully satisfy the promotion."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to devouring fortune from the outside world and the need for accumulation over time, the position of the Daqi Small World itself is also a major constraint. Perhaps it's time to consider upgrading the small world."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Ping returned to the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Sun Erlang, surrounded by a murderous aura, appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The once valiant youth has grown into a god of slaughter who strikes fear into the hearts of people in the Holy Dynasty of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>Commanding the Holy Dynasty's Imperial Guards, he has conquered various realms. Over the years, countless living beings from other small worlds have died tragically at the hands of Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master!" Sun Erlang knelt on one knee.</p><p></p><p>"How is the construction of the Myriad Beings Formation in various realms?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>"Eleven have been completed. Six are still under construction." Sun Erlang was concise and to the point, while transmitting the specific information through divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"In the recent period, temporarily suspend the conquests. Expanding too quickly requires proper digestion. In those small worlds, anyone with the intention to resist shall be killed without mercy. I don't want the backyard to catch fire when we officially go to war with the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said...</p><p></p><p>The meaning revealed in the letter made Sun Erlang's spirit tremble.</p><p></p><p>This made Sun Erlang, who had been conquering those small worlds as if he were cutting melons and vegetables, feeling no pressure at all and even feeling a bit bored, suddenly become excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally saw what Sun Erlang was thinking with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>"If you've seen too many sheep, you'll think that the whole world is full of sheep. Not to mention the Wanxian Alliance, even some of the hidden small worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm are not something that our current Shengchao Daqi can match." Li Ping said lightly, then pointed at Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"You go to this place for a visit. It is where the ancient Taiyan Sect is hidden, and you see if you can convince them to join our alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Taiyan Sect..." Sun Erlang's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Go. That place is a bit special, you will know when you get there. Don't force it, my purpose is just to let you restrain the pride in your heart a little."</p><p></p><p>Unlike the cultivation strategy for Ou Shangtian, when Sun Erlang's path showed a little deviation, Li Ping chose to actively help him correct it.</p><p></p><p>In addition to having a deeper relationship with Sun Erlang, Li Ping also needed a powerful senior disciple to suppress all the other disciples.</p><p></p><p>So he couldn't help but spend a little more effort in cultivating him.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this kid will gain something from the trip to Taiyan Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping thought to himself as he sat on the Sage Emperor's throne.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Sun Erlang, following the Sage Emperor's instructions, arrived at Yi Xing's tomb.</p><p></p><p>After collecting Yi Xing's remains and the white papers all over the ground, Sun Erlang went straight to his destination.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that within the territory of Daqi, there would still be such an ancient cultivator's tomb. I just don't know what the purpose of these papers that Master specifically asked me to collect is." On the way, Sun Erlang carefully studied them for a while, but was unable to discover the mystery within.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the doubts in his heart, Sun Erlang soon arrived at his destination.</p><p></p><p>Taihua Prefecture, Mount Taixuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master said that the entrance to this Taiyan Sect is hidden inside this mountain?"</p><p></p><p>After searching for a while, he couldn't find any traces of a spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang couldn't help but feel a little troubled.</p><p></p><p>If he used brute force, it wouldn't be impossible to forcibly open up a passage inside the mountain. However, he came here this time to be a persuader, to convince the other party to join the Shengchao alliance, so recklessly destroying the other party's sect residence like this...</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Sun Erlang still didn't act rashly.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Taixuan, he chose a Fengshui treasure spot.</p><p></p><p>He dug a pit in the ground, and then took out Yi Xing's remains.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to prepare to bury it in the ground...</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared behind Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, it came!" Sun Erlang secretly said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, however, he pretended to look like he was facing a great enemy: "Who is it?!"</p><p></p><p>That figure didn't pay attention to Sun Erlang, but just stared blankly at Yi Xing's remains.</p><p></p><p>As if immersed in some kind of memory, he remained motionless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was not a reckless warrior, and naturally would not disturb this figure whose strength seemed to be unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>He just waited patiently in silence.</p><p></p><p>"If you had waited a few more years, brother, maybe everything would have been different."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, that figure sighed, waved his sleeve at Yi Xing.</p><p></p><p>Yi Xing's remains disappeared in an instant, and he turned his head to look at Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Little gentleman, why have you come?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at the face in front of him that seemed to be about the same age as himself, hesitated for a moment, and still truthfully stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>There may be more chapters coming around 12:30...</p>

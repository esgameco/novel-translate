            <p>To be honest, building the headquarters of the "Multiverse Alliance" in a grand and true-to-its-name manner is not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Let's not mention how to coordinate and plan, or how to successfully construct the continuous building complex.</p><p></p><p>Just designing a building that is worthy of the five characters "Multiverse Alliance" requires some effort.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had previously presided over the reconstruction of the Congyun Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>He has relatively more experience in this aspect.</p><p></p><p>He also had some exchanges with the construction masters sent by the Immortal Alliance headquarters to support.</p><p></p><p>So objectively speaking, the blueprint personally designed by Li Fan is not too bad.</p><p></p><p>It's just...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan always felt that it lacked a bit of flavor.</p><p></p><p>"After all, I'm an amateur, not a professional."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I need to find a reliable person to supervise this matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't stay in the Lingmu Realm all the time.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Ling's strength has greatly improved and she has received a lot of resource support from the Five Elders Council, it's time to consider Tianyang's Convergence Dao plan.</p><p></p><p>Even with the detailed understanding of the Earth and Heaven Souls obtained from the intelligence provided by Mr. White, there are still considerable risks in the plan to converge the Earth and Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the more prepared, the better.</p><p></p><p>If Tianyang successfully converges with the Dao, Li Fan will consider formally devouring the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven and returning to the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>He will definitely be too busy to spare time.</p><p></p><p>So before that, he needs to find a reliable person to be responsible for the construction of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Numerous cultivators' information flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan locked on the target.</p><p></p><p>The construction master, Ou Daozi.</p><p></p><p>Although he only has the cultivation of Huashen, he has unparalleled talent and insights in architectural design.</p><p></p><p>It is said that many buildings inside the Immortal Alliance headquarters were designed by him.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance Heavenly City's reconstruction and renovation also consulted Ou Daozi's opinions.</p><p></p><p>However, later on, he was dissatisfied with the fact that after the blueprint design was completed, the Immortal Alliance forcibly erased his memory.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he chose to retire to the mountains and never contributed any effort to the Myriad Immortal Alliance again.</p><p></p><p>Even without any position, Ou Daozi is not someone that the current Li Fan can invite.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan plans to directly use the "True Temptation Fruit".</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi himself is not weak, plus his unique talent, so it can't be considered a waste.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who has a lot of experience in this regard, prepared several plans to act according to the situation.</p><p></p><p>If it really doesn't work, he can only use force to persuade.</p><p></p><p>After staying in the Lingmu Realm for a few more days and collecting the 100 Immortal Alliance entry exam question banks replicated by Shang Tianci, he set off with Lin Ling and Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>Still walking in the surging earth veins.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that with Lin Ling, daily travel in the Xuanhuang Realm has indeed become much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, they reached their destination.</p><p></p><p>Guanglan State, Fuxing Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This state is located in the south of the Immortal Alliance, relatively remote and not very prosperous. It is almost the same level as the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>But the Fuxing Mountain in its territory is quite famous.</p><p></p><p>Originally it was not called by this name, but was called "Baoyuan Mountain".</p><p></p><p>About two years ago, the originally calm Guanglan State suddenly experienced an earth-shattering event.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of cultivators witnessed with their own eyes the collapse of Baoyuan Mountain amidst a huge roar.</p><p>The strange phenomenon lasted for nearly half a day, and countless cultivators in the mountains did not have time to dodge and died tragically.</p><p></p><p>Just as the cultivators were still in shock, something that left them dumbfounded happened.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of countless cultivators, Baoyu Mountain, which had originally sunk underground and turned into a vast abyss tens of thousands of feet deep, actually reappeared under the shroud of a yellow light!</p><p></p><p>At that time, it was like a broken porcelain being restored; like tea water poured into a river flowing back into the bowl.</p><p></p><p>As if time had reversed, Baoyu Mountain, which had indeed turned into ruins, was restored to its original state!</p><p></p><p>Such a strange event was bound to cause a great sensation.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because it was too mysterious, cultivators who did not witness it with their own eyes simply would not believe it.</p><p></p><p>However, although the mountain reappeared, the impact of its collapse did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who died tragically in the mountain collapse, and the surging of the earth veins caused by the collapse of the mountain range, were indeed not fake.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after extensive investigation and argumentation, even if they did not believe it, most cultivators accepted this fact.</p><p></p><p>They became more and more curious about how this strange event happened.</p><p></p><p>A total of several investigation teams were sent out, and they almost turned Baoyu Mountain inside out.</p><p></p><p>But they still could not find the reason.</p><p></p><p>As time slowly passed, the Immortal Alliance, which had always made no progress, had to temporarily give up the high-profile investigation.</p><p></p><p>Only one investigator was left here to keep watch.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, cultivators who happened to hear about the events of that year came to explore out of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Because Baoyu Mountain also had a new name, "Revival Mountain".</p><p></p><p>But the scenery of Revival Mountain was indeed ordinary, and there was nothing attractive about it. As time passed, fewer and fewer people came. It was gradually forgotten by people.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan reincarnated before, he also took time to come and travel around.</p><p></p><p>He also found nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Ou Daozi this time, he would not have revisited the old place.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring about the other party's specific residence, Li Fan and his group went straight to the middle of Revival Mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, when they arrived, they found that the thatched cottage in the mountain had long been empty.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan couldn't help frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his divine sense through the thatched cottage and carefully observing the traces, Li Fan found that the other party had just left not long ago.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in addition to Ou Daozi, there seemed to be traces of another person living there.</p><p></p><p>"It's a child, it should be Ou Daozi's son." After recalling the information, Li Fan made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>"But leaving in such a hurry..."</p><p></p><p>"Is he hiding from some enemy?" Li Fan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you want to find the people in this thatched cottage? I can find them."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was a little puzzled, Lin Ling took the initiative to say.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What method do you have?" Li Fan became interested.</p><p></p><p>He had just tried, Ou Daozi had intentionally erased his own traces to prevent being tracked.</p><p></p><p>"There are many trees in the big mountain, just ask them." Lin Ling said a little shyly.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's approval, Lin Ling excitedly cast her magic.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, spots of green light surged from various parts of Revival Mountain.</p><p></p><p>As if forming a green light river, it drilled into Lin Ling's body.</p><p></p><p>"I see them!"</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Lin Ling clapped her hands happily and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tian Yang followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit interesting, they didn't escape through the Tiancheng teleportation array. Instead, they fled into the wild mountains and forests."</p><p></p><p>"Is it a panicked escape, or..."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>At the critical moment, Ou Shangtian erupted once again. A brilliant yellow light enveloped an area of tens of thousands of meters.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators affected by it were all returned to the state before they surrounded Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>By the time they reacted, Ou Shangtian and his son had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Furious, they continued the pursuit, only to find that only Ou Shangtian was left fleeing.</p><p></p><p>After resisting for a while, he was finally captured by a lucky fellow named Xie Xiantao.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the covetous gazes of other cultivators, Xie Xiantao made a wise move without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>That was to hand over Ou Shangtian to the Wanxian Alliance in exchange for a reward.</p><p></p><p>In fact, during the escape, Ou Shangtian had killed no less than a hundred cultivators from the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although it was forced self-defense, he had violated the laws of the Immortal Alliance after all.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian was already a major criminal in the eyes of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the authorities had not intervened, but that didn't mean they weren't paying attention to the matter.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, shortly after Xie Xiantao publicly announced his choice,</p><p></p><p>a team of black-clothed cultivators arrived at the scene and took him and the dying Ou Shangtian away.</p><p></p><p>The sensational nationwide manhunt event was also declared to have come to an end.</p><p></p><p>As for the other protagonist of the event, Ou Shangtian's father, Ou Daozi,</p><p></p><p>no one cared about him anymore.</p><p></p><p>Except for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In a gloomy jungle in Luoyan Province,</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi hid under layers of dead leaves, seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>But when he thought of his son exhausting his own abilities to protect him and lure away the enemies,</p><p></p><p>his heart ached and he was in agony.</p><p></p><p>"Wanxian Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi's eyes were red, and the faces of those who participated in the pursuit kept flashing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he dared not move, for fear of being discovered.</p><p></p><p>Quietly nursing his wounds.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sigh suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi was startled and wanted to escape, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!" Seeing Li Fan, the culprit, Ou Daozi was furious.</p><p></p><p>He was about to go berserk and perish together with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But he was suppressed by the joint efforts of Lin Ling and Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>He was already weaker in strength, and now he was severely injured and had lost most of his combat power.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he was completely subdued.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p></p><p>"I originally just wanted to ask you to help design a building, but before I even met you and your son, you hurriedly ran away. You even used tricks to take my life. If I weren't lucky, I would have died on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even settled the score with you yet."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, it was all the people from the Wanxian Alliance who hunted down and captured your son alive. What does it have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said innocently.</p><p></p><p>"Preposterous!" Seeing Li Fan talking nonsense in broad daylight, Ou Daozi was already furious to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The blood vessels on his forehead bulged and kept throbbing.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he was going to fight Li Fan to the death on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Your thinking is wrong." Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He took out a crystal clear fruit and showed a kind smile.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, open your mouth. Eat this and you'll understand."</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi's heart was suddenly filled with an ominous premonition: "What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't answer either.</p><p></p><p>He handed the Zhenshi Temptation Fruit to Lin Ling and forced-</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Xing fed the fruit to Ou Daozi.</p><p></p><p>As the fruit entered his stomach, Ou Daozi's struggles gradually weakened.</p><p></p><p>The look in his eyes towards Li Fan also began to change.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you want to save your son?" </p><p></p><p>"Although companion wonders usually cannot be transferred, the Wanxian Alliance has many methods. Who knows what suffering your son might endure." Li Fan whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Wanxian Alliance!" Ou Daozi's eyes instantly turned bloodshot with agitation. </p><p></p><p>"Our Wanjie United Association exists precisely for this purpose!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the Fruit of True Temptation, Ou Daozi's mind was quickly rewritten. </p><p></p><p>He joined the Wanjie United Association with the goal of destroying the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He began to treat like-minded individuals such as Li Fan as his own kin.</p><p></p><p>From Ou Daozi's mouth, Li Fan also learned the secret of Ou Shangtian's companion wonders.</p><p></p><p>"My son has two kinds of companion wonders."</p><p></p><p>"One I knew about since he was young - the [Book of Ten Thousand Deaths] that can predict the manner of one's future death."</p><p></p><p>"As for the [Kunqian Bone Hands] that can reverse heaven and earth, that was awakened two years ago when Guiyuan Mountain collapsed."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, he had just entered the Qi Refining stage, but suddenly encountered a natural disaster like a mountain range collapsing. His life hung by a thread."</p><p></p><p>"At the critical juncture between life and death, his potential erupted. Only then did he activate the previously hidden ability of the [Kunqian Bone Hands]."</p><p></p><p>"The collapsed mountain reappeared. This was truly too shocking. So this kid actually kept it hidden even from me."</p><p></p><p>"Until recently, he hurriedly found me and urged me to leave. He said he foresaw an extremely terrifying group of people who would soon come knocking..."</p><p></p><p>Along the way to the Lingmu Realm, Ou Daozi recounted the whole story to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained normal: "Countless futures, countless possibilities. What he foresaw may not necessarily be true."</p><p></p><p>"If I really wanted to take action, just relying on the two beside me, you would be powerless to resist."</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi's eyes showed a trace of confusion, and then he let out a long sigh: "A misunderstanding actually led to me and my son being unable to meet again..."</p><p></p><p>"There will always be opportunities. Fellow Daoist, what do you think of my Lingmu Realm?" Li Fan changed the subject, pointing to the small world under intense construction.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk..." Ou Daozi observed for a while, shaking his head repeatedly, a hint of disdain in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The location is good. But the design and construction plans are really subpar..."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't quite match the reputation of the Wanjie United Association."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan didn't show any anger.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he cupped his hands and said, "Then I'll have to trouble Fellow Daoist to work hard and transform it."</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi narrowed his eyes and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Already quite obsessed with this path, very quickly, Ou Daozi immersed himself in his own plans and visions.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, feel free to do as you wish. If you need anything, just tell the leader of the treemen here directly."</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's approval, Ou Daozi temporarily forgot his earlier grief.</p><p></p><p>He threw himself wholeheartedly into the construction of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Although it took some twists and turns, fortunately the initial goal has been achieved."</p><p></p><p>"Kunqian Bone Hands, Book of Ten Thousand Deaths..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>According to Ou Daozi, Ou Shangtian had not actually fully mastered the abilities of the Kunqian Bone Hands.</p><p></p><p>During his escape, he seemed to sense that there were still powerful abilities hidden within that had not been tapped.</p><p></p><p>If given a bit more time, perhaps he could really achieve time reversal to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just Ou Shangtian's guess.</p><p></p><p>The specifics were still unconfirmed.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"Junior..." </p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao slightly frowned his eyebrows, "Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu's body trembled lightly, and he hurriedly said, "I am willing to follow senior's instructions."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Ji Hongdao slowly nod, but the expression on his face when looking at Xue Mu was not as kind as before when dealing with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The construction plan of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation in each state will not officially start for more than a year."</p><p></p><p>"Although some cave heavens have gradually begun to arrange the formation, for the sake of fairness in the competition, I will still wait until a year later, when the competition begins, to apply to transfer you in."</p><p></p><p>"However, this point needs to be made clear to you in advance."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao seemed to remember something, looked at Li Fan, and added, "During this year, I will not restrain you."</p><p></p><p>"You can go wherever you want."</p><p></p><p>"The four continents of Tianyu have many wonders and unusual sights. For us cultivators, observing them will greatly benefit the growth of our cultivation and the level of our own skills."</p><p></p><p>"You haven't had time to visit since you came to the Tianyu Continent, right? It just so happens that you can take this time to have a good look around."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you return immediately after receiving my message, that will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao suggested with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's hesitant look, he smiled and said, "Don't worry too much. The accidents that Dantai Tao and the others encountered can no longer happen now."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved, and he didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, thank you senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you two can go down too! I'm a bit tired from mingling with you juniors for so long." After Ji Hongdao finished explaining, he waved his hand to dismiss the two.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Xue Mu both bowed and then left the Huanyu Villa.</p><p></p><p>"Li... Fellow Daoist, I wonder what plans you have for this year?" Inside Tianyu City, Xue Mu asked a little stiffly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Fellow Daoist Xue, there's no need to be nervous." Li Fan looked at Xue Mu with a kind expression and replied, "A year's time, it can be considered long or short."</p><p></p><p>"If one goes into seclusion, it will pass in the blink of an eye. If one travels around, I'm afraid one could roam all over the four continents of Tianyu."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation does not depend on this moment. On the contrary, the opportunity is rare, so I plan to follow Senior Ji's suggestion and travel around the nearby states."</p><p></p><p>"What about you, Fellow Daoist Xue? I observe that your aura is fluctuating, seemingly showing signs of a breakthrough?" Li Fan asked in turn.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu was startled, "Fellow Daoist has good eyesight to see through this. To be honest, during this period of closed training, although it was a bit hard, I also had some insights. The bottleneck that originally trapped me in the Foundation Establishment stage naturally dissipated, and I can break through to the Golden Core stage at any time."</p><p></p><p>"Then I must congratulate Fellow Daoist!" Li Fan also looked very happy.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because they were the last people from Congyun Sea, with an inherent intimacy bonus, or perhaps it was because Xue Mu was not good at socializing and had not communicated much with others during the closed training, so he had held back for too long.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xue Mu suddenly opened up and started pouring out his grievances to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Fellow Daoist doesn't know. If it were back in Congyun Sea, I would have been more than satisfied to form a Golden Core in my forties."</p><p></p><p>"However, after coming to the Tianyu Continent and seeing countless outstanding talents, they basically all formed Golden Cores with two or even three methods."</p><p></p><p>"Comparing the two, I'm naturally unwilling to just form an ordinary single-method Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>"But the free time left for me is only one year. In one year's time, it may be a bit difficult for me to comprehend another Golden Core forming method."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, a conflicted expression appeared on Xue Mu's face.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a smile appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so Fellow Daoist is troubled by this matter."</p><p></p><p>"I have a method that may help Fellow Daoist overcome this hurdle. I wonder if Fellow Daoist is willing to give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu was slightly stunned, then overjoyed, "Please teach me, Fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't keep him in suspense and slowly said, "Does Fellow Daoist know that in the neighboring Tianyun State, there is a wonder called the 'Wall of Mortals Becoming Gods'?"</p><p></p><p>"Mortals... becoming gods?" Xue Mu's eyes lit up and he gently shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"This screen wall records the scene of mortals becoming gods and ascending to the heavens in one step during ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"When this wonder reappears, it will also trigger a resonance with the laws of heaven and earth, accompanied by countless astonishing anomalies."</p><p></p><p>"Almost all cultivators below the Deity Transformation stage can gain insights from observing the wonder of 'Mortals Becoming Gods'."</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, there was even a cultivator who comprehended the Great Dao and finally formed a five-method Golden Core!"</p><p></p><p>"I see that Fellow Daoist's aptitude and comprehension are both extraordinary, so why not try your luck?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Xue Mu with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu was full of excitement, "There is actually such a wonder?"</p><p></p><p>"Heaven is really helping me!"</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun State, I'm going right now!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu muttered to himself, his face flushed red, and he ran straight towards the teleportation plaza in Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>After walking a few steps, he seemed to remember something and turned around, asking a little embarrassedly, "Fellow Daoist Li Fan, why don't you come with me?"</p><p></p><p>"I have other arrangements. Fellow Daoist, don't worry about me and go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xue Mu didn't insist.</p><p></p><p>He bowed solemnly and said, "Regardless of whether this trip yields any gains, Fellow Daoist's guidance is a kindness that I, Xue, will never forget."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, having you say that is enough." This was what Li Fan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't say it so bluntly.</p><p></p><p>The play that should be acted still needed to be acted.</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand, he said nonchalantly, "It was just a casual remark, Fellow Daoist doesn't need to take it to heart."</p><p></p><p>However, judging from Xue Mu's expression, he had already firmly remembered Li Fan's "kindness of a few words".</p><p></p><p>"These days, honest people with pretty good aptitude like him are quite rare." Looking at Xue Mu's retreating figure, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"He can barely be considered half a crop, which is better than nothing."</p><p></p><p>After Xue Mu left Tianyu City, Li Fan came to Liangqu City on the border of Tianyu State through the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>He had already investigated before that this area in Tianyu State was relatively desolate with few people.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concealed his figure and flew at extreme speed close to the ground for two days, finally finding a suitable hiding place.</p><p></p><p>Under a gorge that looked like a thread of sky, Li Fan dug out a secret room in the mountain as usual and then blocked the entrance.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan went into seclusion outside to escape the sight of the Tianxuan Mirror and test the magic he had in mind.</p><p></p><p>The Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword.</p><p></p><p>A long time later, Li Fan, who had experimented countless times in his mind, opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The five elements as the foundation." He silently recited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Golden Core circulated, the five elements generated each other, and a huge, endless rotating force surged from his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"Slaughter of Heaven and Ink as the edge."</p><p></p><p>A hint of madness flashed in his left eye, and a trace of gloom appeared in his right eye.</p><p></p><p>In the face of the two forces that annihilated everything, the rotating power of the five elements slowly converged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly pointed towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>A jet-black light bloomed from his fingertip.</p><p></p><p>Shooting rapidly downward.</p>

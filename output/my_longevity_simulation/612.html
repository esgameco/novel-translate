        <div class="content">
            <p>The blood essence of the Kunpeng, filled with a fierce and sinister aura, gushed out, moving like a living creature and wriggling continuously in the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>With a single reach, Li Fan enveloped it in the Cave Heaven Law Domain.</p><p></p><p>He began to analyze and comprehend it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of his research was naturally to reenact the three divine abilities Ye Feipeng had displayed in his last life - Kun Devouring, Peng Flying, and Bloodline Crossing.</p><p></p><p>Among them, with the Five Elements Cave Heaven he now possessed, Kun Devouring divine ability was dispensable for him.</p><p></p><p>Peng Flying evasion technique was worth emulating.</p><p></p><p>However, the most important skill Li Fan urgently needed to master was the Bloodline Crossing.</p><p></p><p>This ancient supernatural ability derived from demonic beasts could influence and manipulate others' thoughts subtly by transferring one's essence blood, gradually turning them into loyal followers who would only consider the bloodline owner's interests.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, although Ye Feipeng, who initially detested his demonic bloodline, had eventually pridefully identified himself with the bloodline of the Kunpeng. The term "demonic beast" had gradually transformed into "sacred beast."</p><p></p><p>Using such abilities to control the members of the Medicine King Sect was quite suitable. However, if the numbers increased, the risks of these methods would escalate sharply, especially since the members of the Medicine King Cauldron were all acquainted with each other.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only required them to refine pills for him and occasionally act as his enforcers, as he couldn't monitor them constantly.</p><p></p><p>Without forcible control, they might bring some "surprises" to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, mastering the Bloodline Crossing was imperative for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's senses, every tiniest particle of Kunpeng blood seemed to have its own consciousness, emitting sharp and terrifying screeches, causing Li Fan to furrow his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>He picked out a drop of blood and absorbed it with his finger, observing its transformation process on his flesh.</p><p></p><p>Once the Kunpeng blood made contact with Li Fan's flesh and blood, the previously harsh sounds vanished instantly.</p><p></p><p>It became eerily quiet, with tiny tentacles attaching to Li Fan's flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Channels of continuous flashing red light were drawn through these tentacles into the Kunpeng blood. The Kunpeng blood then seemed to boil, undergoing self-transformation.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, it became strikingly similar to Li Fan's own flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Even as Li Fan, the master of the flesh and blood, witnessed this entire process firsthand, it was challenging to discern any difference between the two entities without careful scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>After completing its self-evolution, the Kunpeng blood didn't release its tentacles but instead emitted a series of dark-red rays, transferring them back to the attached flesh and blood. As these attached flesh and blood were continuously infused with the dark-red blood, they began undergoing some unknown changes.</p><p></p><p>Later, to Li Fan's gaze, even these transformed entities swiftly extended small "tentacles," launching attacks toward the nearby, unchanged flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Homologous evolution..." Li Fan pondered aloud as the Cave Heaven Law Domain power suddenly erupted, turning the eroded flesh and blood along with the original Kunpeng blood into ashes.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Li Fan's body was missing a part, his face blushing slightly. However, he quickly recovered his composure.</p><p></p><p>"The Cave Heaven remains, and the cultivator survives." Li Fan sighed slightly. "The new method is surprisingly practical in this regard. If it were an infant realm ancient cultivator, recovering from such an emptying of the body would be quite laborious."</p><p></p><p>After his recovery, Li Fan once again absorbed a cluster of Kunpeng blood and ingested an Enlightenment Pill, closing his eyes to feel the process of Bloodline Crossing.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, he eliminated the changed flesh tissues.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out the Kunpeng blood to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>And thus, he repeated this process until the chamber was almost empty except for the last jar of blood, where Li Fan finally ceased his actions.</p><p></p><p>A glint of insight flashed in his eyes as he pondered, "It seems that the process of transforming the human body with Kunpeng blood shares some similarities with the New Law, pillaging the heavens and eventually seizing control. Analyzing part of it first, then homologous evolution, creating a perfect imitation... Propagating massively and taking over in the end."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan retrieved a sleeping Medicine King Cauldron cultivation realm cultivator from the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator instantly woke up but was immobilized by Li Fan's "Binding Insects" divine ability, unable to move. He struggled in vain, panic-stricken, watching Li Fan helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained unfazed, silently controlling his drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the invasion process went smoothly.</p><p></p><p>After homologous evolution, it quickly occupied most of the internal space of the Medicine King Cauldron cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But somewhere, a flaw appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Cauldron cultivator began to exhibit a rejecting reaction toward the controlled flesh, convulsing violently and spewing blood incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he met his demise.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies." Li Fan expressed with a blank face.</p><p></p><p>He then looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The serene clouds and gentle breeze suggested no anomalies.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the heavens do not mind your kind, the old school cultivators like you," Li Fan remarked.</p><p></p><p>He then selected another Medicine King Cauldron cultivator for experimentation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>After more failed attempts, Li Fan paused momentarily.</p><p></p><p>"I was too hasty," he reflected. "Rapid expansion can lead to the body's backlash."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"If we view the target cultivator as a complete world, then my drop of blood is akin to a cultivator of the New Method," Li Fan mused. "I may not have the Kunpeng divine ability, but I can still cultivate methodically."</p><p></p><p>A realization dawned on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although he had expended much mental energy, the results were promising. The lucky individual, completely unaware of the changes occurring within him, continued to sleep soundly.</p><p></p><p>Yet Li Fan sensed a peculiar connection forming between them, unlike the directive control he had over his clones. He could only clearly discern the person's physical state and even vaguely sense their passing thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced back at the True Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, a new divine ability, "Bloodline Crossing," had been added to the list. However, Li Fan's lack of excitement was unusual.</p><p></p><p>During his comprehension of the Bloodline Crossing process, he sensed some peculiarities, reminiscing about the forgotten inspiration that had flashed through his mind initially.</p><p></p><p>If he viewed this fortunate individual as a representative from the Xuanhuang Realm, with the world within, then cultivators of the New Method in the heavens and earth undoubtedly represented the "mutated blood essence" that subtly transformed the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In that case...</p>

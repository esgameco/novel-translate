            <p>Huangfusong glanced at Li Fan and cleared his throat, saying, "Director Ji's cultivation is profound and unfathomable, naturally he cannot lose his self-will."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the accompanying cultivators are all formidable as well. Joining forces, Director Ji also found it somewhat difficult to defend against them."</p><p></p><p>"For self-preservation, Director Ji had no choice but to kill them all."</p><p></p><p>Huangfusong appeared very regretful.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the others couldn't help but be slightly stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, they seemed to have some realization but dare not dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed too dangerous. It's no wonder it had to be temporarily sealed off," Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Huangfusong swept a warning look at Li Fan and transmitted, "Kid, what you need to know has been told to you. Don't push it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just pretended not to hear.</p><p></p><p>"I will be heading to other territories tomorrow to oversee the construction of formations."</p><p></p><p>"If any of you have any needs, you can come find me before then."</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the Eternal Immortal Stronghold, Huangfusong smiled and spoke to Xue Mu and Jiang Qigui.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, he didn't even spare a glance and left.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>After years of hard work, success finally came.</p><p></p><p>The first thing everyone did upon returning to the Palm Oasis City was to check their ranking on the leaderboard.</p><p></p><p>Within these five days, there had been a drastic change in the points leaderboard.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qigui's contribution skyrocketed due to overseeing the entry into the Tianxuan Formation Key.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, relying on his previous advantage, had slightly more total points than him.</p><p></p><p>But both of them had dropped out of the top ten, approaching around the twentieth ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at this, it seems that there have been many places completing the Tianxuan Lock Spirit Formation in these days. The top of the leaderboard even has some unfamiliar faces."</p><p></p><p>"I feel it's somewhat unfair. Building formations above the Deep Abyss is much more difficult than in the ordinary territories. Master Li and the others should have earned more points," someone remarked.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that the points have been adjusted according to the difficulty? After all, the Deep Abyss, while dangerous, might not be the most perilous place in the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li Fan, look, Guo Yezhong has jumped to three hundredth place!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions, Xue Mu whispered to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I noticed that too. What do you think, friend?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The points of everyone are not fixed but increasing all the time. In this situation, for Guo Yezhong to rise so suddenly is quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"And it's only after the completion of many formations that this explosive increase happened..."</p><p></p><p>"I think, perhaps this person was involved in the initial design of the Tianxuan Lock Spirit Formation," Xue Mu, appearing taciturn but not dull-witted, analyzed calmly.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he said, "Director Ji mentioned that the points are determined based on the contributions in the construction of formations."</p><p></p><p>"As the founder of the formations, naturally, with each completion, there is credit to him."</p><p></p><p>"This explains the current situation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled Guo Yezhong's appearance when he first saw him at the academy.</p><p></p><p>"He was just a Golden Core Formation Master back then, right?" he asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xue Mu also felt hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he only contributed one idea?" he hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"There's no use in overthinking. Let's focus on our own tasks," Li Fan advised.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu looked at the elderly Li Fan, his face solemn, nodding in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Involved in the initial design of the Tianxuan Lock Spirit Formation and then reaping the benefits."</p><p></p><p>"Not only can he gain a significant amount of points in this competition, but once the Lock Spirit Formation is completely popularized, his status will definitely rise."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good strategy!"</p><p></p><p>Upon parting ways with Xue Mu and returning to his room, Li Fan couldn't help but think this way.</p><p></p><p>"If time could reverse thirty years, perhaps no one would understand the Tianxuan Lock Spirit Formation better than me in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Marvelous! Just need to be cautious when revealing it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan indulged in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>After night fell, Li Fan quietly went to Huangfusong's place.</p><p></p><p>As if expecting Li Fan's visit already, there was a bowl of spirit tea on the table, waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>Not bothering with pleasantries, Li Fan drank it in one go.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he looked at his age limit on the True Age Board.</p><p>It had only increased by one year.</p><p></p><p>"It's barely satisfactory," Li Fan shook his head, looking genuinely unimpressed.</p><p></p><p>Huangfusong couldn't help but laugh a bit, but didn't dwell on it. Instead, he went straight to the point and asked, "As someone on the brink of death, why do you still push yourself like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it better to live out the rest of your life peacefully?"</p><p></p><p>"Still thinking about climbing the rankings? What are you thinking?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1231</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had personally witnessed the true power of the Starvation Spell in the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he naturally felt a sense of awe towards the high walls that could firmly restrain the suction force of the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>This was followed by an irrepressible curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Profound Immortal Boat's exploration of the other side of the Starry Sea also stopped more than two thousand years ago. With the changes in time and space, the maps recorded back then can only serve as a reference for me, and don't have much practical value."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the recent great upheaval in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the main areas where the Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Doctor appear in the Starry Sea are where the world's remnant graveyards are located."</p><p></p><p>"Something must have gone wrong at the foot of the high walls. It actually caused the usually stable tidal suction force to erupt in the opposite direction towards the interior of the darkest Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>Various thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter was able to notify the Myriad Immortals Alliance in advance, indicating that this matter must be related to Him. And his summoning of those sixteen Dao-merging cultivators here is very likely also related to this matter."</p><p></p><p>At this thought, Li Fan's heart stirred: "If I wait here like a mantis stalking a cicada, I might really be able to wait for that seven-colored rainbow light."</p><p></p><p>"Based on my previous time crossing the Starry Sea and the flying speed of the seven-colored rainbow light..."</p><p></p><p>"If I can really encounter it, it should be within these few days."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Having finished reading the parts he was most interested in, Li Fan began to organize some of the other important gains.</p><p></p><p>Not only could this life help the Great Enlightenment to start more smoothly, but it was also a great help for Li Fan's future reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the most important thing for Li Fan was the refining of the [Dao Dan].</p><p></p><p>In the early difficult years after the split of the Immortal Boat, the Profound Immortal Boat cultivators, who were extremely short of supplies, accumulated quite a rich experience in cannibalism.</p><p></p><p>The prototype of this Dao Dan originated from that period.</p><p></p><p>With limited resources, how to maximize absorption efficiency to the greatest extent possible became the most important thing for the Profound Immortal Boat cultivators at that time.</p><p></p><p>Dao Dan, this secret technique of refining cultivators into pills, was the culmination of the experience gained from the dark historical period of the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>Not only could it refine the memories and souls of the opposing cultivators and make them one's own.</p><p></p><p>Even talents, temperaments, and innate divine powers could all be integrated into one's own body!</p><p></p><p>Of course, side effects were also inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the raw materials used to refine the Dao Dan, the more significant the side effects.</p><p></p><p>If one's own strength was insufficient and the pill was forcibly taken, it would be a case of overexertion with no benefit, and there was a high possibility of suffering a backlash, becoming neither human nor ghost.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of madness, one would not recognize even close relatives and would go on a killing spree.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, later on, when the Profound Immortal Boat gradually stabilized, this Dao Dan secret technique became one of the forbidden techniques of the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>Only the true core of the Immortal Boat had the qualifications to know about it.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite complicated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan studied the entire refining process in detail and frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Pill refining was not Li Fan's forte, but his formation level had already reached the point of being miraculous.</p><p></p><p>The Dissociation Disk simultaneously analyzed, dismantled, and transformed each step into corresponding formations.</p><p></p><p>"As long as this formation is laid out, it can achieve fully automatic Dao Dan refining. It saves effort and worry."</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't care much about innate divine powers now, in any case, I have mastered another special means."</p><p></p><p>"It's also extremely useful for deterring those so-called heaven's pride geniuses."</p><p></p><p>"The only concern is that this method in the Profound-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two segments of the Starry Sea not only had different time flow speeds, but the Xuan Immortal Boat was also exposed to the chaotic and disorderly Darkest Starry Sea without the protection of the native world's power.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't dare to guarantee that the rules here would be equally effective in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"If there's a chance, we'll know by trying."</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Dao Pill, the only other thing that Li Fan was somewhat concerned about was a means of communication that could minimize the interference of the remnant power of the True Immortals in the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was created by the second head of the Immortal Pivot Institute.</p><p></p><p>It was called "Boundless".</p><p></p><p>Its principle was to create a power with a "resistance" attribute to the remnant power of the True Immortals based on the Dao attributes that still existed in the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, its shortcomings were also very obvious.</p><p></p><p>It required knowing the precise space-time coordinates of the other party.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to the ubiquitous suction force in the Darkest Starry Sea, this communication could often only be carried out unidirectionally.</p><p></p><p>That is, along the direction of the suction force.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Immortal Boat had almost no records of other survivors in the Darkest Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>So this Boundless communication method was not taken seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xuan Immortal Boat, in the Sea of Relics.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was comprehending the Dao of the Darkest Starry Sea, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A playful expression flashed in his eyes, and he immediately shot out a silver light in the direction where he sensed the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just an act of Li Fan's whim.</p><p></p><p>The location of the Xuan Immortal Boat was too far from the Xuanhuang Realm and was also very close to the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan actually had no confidence that this Boundless message could be successfully delivered to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was purely for fun.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus had gained a lot in the Xuan Immortal Boat, after all, it was the accumulation of a civilization.</p><p></p><p>Even if it wasn't the most top-notch part, it was still precious to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The perspective returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since the return of the Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment, Sun Luyuan had been particularly busy.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't visited all the peerless geniuses on the list, he had also roughly investigated their situations through his own connections.</p><p></p><p>Although Ou Shangtian didn't urge him about the matter of winning them over, Sun Luyuan deeply understood that this was his first task after joining the Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he have to complete it successfully, but he also had to do it beautifully, leaving no room for criticism, and even making people can't help but praise him.</p><p></p><p>After careful selection, Sun Luyuan quickly decided on his sacrificial target for establishing merit.</p><p></p><p>That was the renowned Kong You Immortal in the Immortal Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Kong You Immortal's cultivation was also at the Harmonious Dao stage.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of ordinary cultivators in the Immortal Alliance, Kong You was far more important than Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Kong You's own unparalleled beauty in the Immortal Alliance, it was also because of her accompanying spiritual object, the "Yin-Yang Jade".</p><p></p><p>Kong You Immortal could use the Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation method to fuse the Yang half of the "Yin-Yang Jade" with her Dao companion, upgrading the Dao companion's Foundation Establishment spiritual object, Golden Core, Nascent Soul Grotto-Heaven, and even the Transformation of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to make a mediocre person leap into a peerless genius, and to further advance a peerless genius to become an unparalleled existence that could shake ancient and modern times in the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan had heard about it long ago during the Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Several disciples under the Great Enlightenment's Holy Emperor currently had no Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>If he could deceive Kong You and arrange a match, not only could he use Kong You's reputation to make future subversion easier, but he could also bestow favor upon the Holy Emperor's disciples.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan narrowed his eyes, and a plan had already emerged in his mind.</p>

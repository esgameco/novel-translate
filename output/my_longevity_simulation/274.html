        <h1>Chapter 274</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Li Fan's burning gaze, Zhang Qianmo pondered for a moment and said, "As for my life's wishes..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't hide it from you, junior brother. Since I entered the Purple Dawn Sect and embarked on cultivation, I have always had three major goals in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that they were deeply hidden in my heart, and I never mentioned them to anyone."</p><p></p><p>"Now that you insist on asking, junior brother, I don't mind sharing them with you."</p><p></p><p>"Just take it as a joke, don't take it seriously!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's expression turned solemn as he slowly said, "I have three wishes."</p><p></p><p>"First, demons and evil spirits are rampant, causing living beings to suffer. I want to kill all the demons in the world and restore a bright and clear universe."</p><p></p><p>"Second, the Ten Great Immortal Sects are growing old. They have power but lack virtue, and can no longer win the hearts of the people. I want the Purple Dawn Sect to replace them."</p><p></p><p>"Third, all the sects in the world cherish their own ways. There are countless cultivation techniques in the world, but they are all kept secret by each sect. Ordinary cultivators, even if they spend their entire lives in a sect, cannot fully comprehend all the sect's treasured techniques. Let alone the countless other methods in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Life is limited, but the Dao is limitless. How regrettable! Techniques can be cultivated together, but no sect is willing to share their methods with the world."</p><p></p><p>"Narrow-minded and shallow! If I ruled the world, I would collect all the cultivation techniques and make them public."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone can choose the most suitable technique to cultivate. In no time, the prosperous era of immortal cultivation in ancient times will surely reappear."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's words were shocking, uttering his three life wishes in one breath.</p><p></p><p>Each one was more frightening than the last.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Li Fan also couldn't help but fall into deep silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he couldn't help but slowly exhale and say, "Senior brother, your ambitions are lofty. Junior brother admires you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Qianmo laughed loudly, "It's just some wild thoughts I had after encountering all kinds of injustices since I started cultivating! Junior brother, just take it as a joke, don't take it seriously!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he sped up towards Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also followed closely behind, secretly thinking, "I can only pray that this place is not maintained by Senior Brother Zhang's obsession. This senior brother of mine is truly no ordinary person. His wishes are a bit outrageous."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what his true ending in history was."</p><p></p><p>The two didn't speak along the way, and quickly reached Ningyuan City in silence. </p><p></p><p>Concealing their auras and transforming into the appearance of mortals.</p><p></p><p>The two senior and junior brothers swaggered through the city gate and entered the city.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, split up with me and take a look to see if there's anything unusual in this city first," Zhang Qianmo transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, you're not going to look for your old flame Chi Xia, are you?" Li Fan exposed his plan with one sentence.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Qianmo immediately felt a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to explain, he heard Li Fan suddenly say, "If my spiritual intuition is correct, the danger in this city is aimed at the two of us."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm afraid there must already be an ambush set up around Miss Chi Xia."</p><p></p><p>"If Senior Brother meets with her rashly, you might just be walking into their trap."</p><p></p><p>"With Senior Brother's powerful cultivation, you naturally don't fear them. I'm just afraid Miss Chi Xia will be implicated and perish."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Qianmo felt it made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he transmitted his thoughts, "Junior brother's consideration is indeed more prudent. In that case, let's first secretly figure out all the informants in the city, then meet up and make plans."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's figure slowly disappeared into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Already knowing full well the deployment of the ambush personnel in Ningyuan City, Li Fan naturally didn't need to go through the trouble of scouting again.</p><p></p><p>The reason for guiding Zhang Qianmo to do this was to delay the outbreak of battle.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he wanted to examine this Ningyuan City again.</p><p></p><p>To find the real protagonist.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Fan had already gone through more than ten cycles in this Fallen Immortal Realm's Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Through Zhang Qianmo's words just now, even though he was somewhat reluctant to believe it, Li Fan was very clear that he had likely been mistaken all along.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist of this stage play was someone else, not Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>Because Senior Brother Zhang's obsession was too great.</p><p></p><p>While the stage of Ningyuan City was too small.</p><p></p><p>The mere incident of "encountering an attack while seeking the Longevity Fruit" could not match Senior Brother Zhang's grand ambitions.</p><p></p><p>"Then, who exactly is the owner of this space-time's lingering thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swept his gaze over the busy mortals in Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be among these people?"</p><p></p><p>With this question in mind, Li Fan began to wander around Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>The mortals lived here in peace and contentment, unable to have the slightest perception of the impending catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Following the crowded flow of people, Li Fan arrived on a road called "Yongqing Street".</p><p></p><p>The roadside was filled with all kinds of stalls, and many mortals with excited expressions were playing here.</p><p></p><p>Strolling among them, Li Fan felt as if he had returned to Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>That long-lost mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan's footsteps paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense probed the surroundings, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Then, he deliberately walked towards a dead end not far away.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, several thin figures hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>Walking all the way to the depths of the alley, they were surprised to find that the person they were following had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to retreat, they found a figure blocking the exit.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the five people who had been following him and tilted his head.</p><p></p><p>Five mortals.</p><p></p><p>And they were all skinny and weak children.</p><p></p><p>The oldest looked only six or seven years old, all skin and bones.</p><p></p><p>"What are you little kids following me for?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked with some amusement.</p><p></p><p>The five children were caught red-handed and looked a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>But in response to Li Fan's questioning, none of them answered, only staring at him intently.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was about to speak again, he heard one of them suddenly shout, "Doggy!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the fierce barking of a vicious dog suddenly rang out behind Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The fierce dog arrived in an instant, about to pounce on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally planned to directly crush it to death, but when he saw the "fierce dog's" appearance, he couldn't help but stay his hand.</p><p></p><p>No matter how viciously it barked, he picked it up in front of his eyes and carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it had the limbs of a dog...</p><p></p><p>But its body and head were human.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"A demon beast?"</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy surged out from his body and circulated inside the creature.</p><p></p><p>Its barking gradually weakened and it fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Doggy!"</p><p></p><p>The five children behind thought Doggy had died and let out anguished cries.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, disregarding the absolute difference in strength, they all pounced towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>With a light sweep from Li Fan, they all fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"It's not dead now."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to keep its life, answer a few questions for me."</p><p></p><p>The few children looked at each other and had no choice but to nod in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"This dog..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused and corrected himself.</p><p></p><p>"What's the deal with this child?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>That's right, after the examination just now, Li Fan discovered that the monster in front of him with a human body and dog paws.</p><p></p><p>Was not some demon beast.</p><p></p><p>But a human.</p><p></p><p>It's just that it had dog limbs "grafted" onto it.</p>

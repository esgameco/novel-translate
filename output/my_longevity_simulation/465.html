        <h1>Chapter 465</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In each monument where few traces of human presence can be found over the desolate wilderness, his figure may exist.</p><p></p><p>Even with his own strength, he can stir up storms in the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>There's a bit of a taste of mixing commerce with the Tao.</p><p></p><p>But it seems that this person's luck is a bit poor.</p><p></p><p>He claims to never engage in losing deals, but based on Li Fan's interactions with him, Jiao Xiuyuan seems to often end up losing money in business.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was when Li Fan first met him and he hoarded a large number of Shape-Cloaking Talismans, only for their prices to plummet due to the Five Elements Grand Cave's influence.</p><p></p><p>Or later when he painstakingly excavated some small Medicine King Cauldrons, as long as the true Medicine King Cauldron returned, he would surely make a fortune.</p><p></p><p>However, as if he was destined not to have such luck, he sold all these small Medicine King Cauldrons early on at low prices.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he never truly loses, but it seems that he always misses the opportunity to strike it rich."</p><p></p><p>"Even in the previous life when we cultivated the Zhuang Ling Mistweed together, he ultimately squandered the massive wealth he had acquired due to a slight greed and being too slow to act."</p><p></p><p>"Only in this life, he truly seems to be making considerable profits. I wonder if something will change about him."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered, he carefully observed the objects Jiao Xiuyuan had placed on the shelves, hoping to find items similar to the small Medicine King Cauldrons to seize a small opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The items on the shelves were diverse, with all sorts of talismans, formations, elixirs, and more.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paid particular attention to the items that appeared to be of some age.</p><p></p><p>The majority of them were in a state of disrepair, filled with traces of history.</p><p></p><p>Scrolls, various decorations, unrecognizable artifacts that had completely lost their spiritual aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swept his gaze over them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he paused at an old painting.</p><p></p><p>His expression became somewhat serious as Li Fan took the painting down and unfolded it slowly.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the painting itself had anything special, but the content depicted on it caught Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>The painting depicted a majestic mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>The vast sky and earth were in one color, with dozens of cultivators standing in the clouds, pointing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Within the sea of clouds, the majestic buildings on the mountaintop appeared vaguely.</p><p></p><p>Phoenix birds, dragon turtles, and various strange beasts moved through the mountains.</p><p></p><p>On the square below the mountain, hundreds and thousands of young disciples who had not yet shed their childishness stood gazing up at the cultivators in the sky, their faces filled with excitement and envy.</p><p></p><p>Truly, it portrayed a flourishing and prosperous sect atmosphere!</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had seen this sect gate before, and the scene of prosperity depicted in the painting was completely different from reality.</p><p></p><p>With corpses strewn all over and blood flowing like a river.</p><p></p><p>The mountain gate shattered, turning into ruins everywhere.</p><p></p><p>It was at the time when he was in the Great Abyss, and after the dense mist dissipated, he saw this scene at the bottom of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>The four words "Immortal Dao is dead" carved on the cliff wall back then deeply shocked Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Fan already knew that this must have been the aftermath of a calamity that occurred when the sect's disciples turned on each other after a catastrophic event of incompatible cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Which sect is this exactly? Why did I see this scene back then?"</p><p></p><p>It's important to know that everyone sees different scenes from the bottom of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan might have seen this ruined sect by some coincidence.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan believed that there might be some sort of guidance in it.</p><p></p><p>After carefully folding the painting and finding no other valuable items during his search, Li Fan approached Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao? Friend Jiao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan called out symbolically a few times, seeing that he still didn't respond, he reached out to touch him.</p><p></p><p>Not because he had any strange desires, but to take advantage of this rare opportunity to study Jiao Xiuyuan's diverse puppet techniques.</p><p></p><p>Although the "Miraculous True Spirit Transformation" was already an awe-inspiring divine skill, there were still some minor flaws.</p><p></p><p>Born from the "Daylight Thievery Scripture," it could only maintain one clone at a time, which was somewhat regrettable.</p><p></p><p>If it could incorporate various puppet techniques and further advance...</p><p></p><p>"A thousand incarnations, indistinguishable."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan fantasized in his mind, his actions were swift and decisive.</p><p></p><p>"Almost identical to a real person, even using spiritual sense to penetrate and sense, it is difficult to detect the difference."</p><p></p><p>"I have seen scenes of puppets after their death, their decaying appearance resembling rotten wood. Could it be that Jiao Xiuyuan's puppet incarnations are all made from a certain type of wood?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continuously inspected the puppet in front of him, combining his knowledge and carefully pondering, feeling that he had gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was secretly pleased, he suddenly noticed Jiao Xiuyuan's eyelids trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>His heart skipped a beat, and Li Fan moved away instantly.</p><p></p><p>After a short moment, he realized that Jiao Xiuyuan's previously dull eyes had regained their vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, are you awake?" Li Fan pretended to be very concerned.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Friend Li Fan? What are you doing here?" Jiao Xiuyuan looked at Li Fan with some suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally wanted to tell Jiao Xiuyuan about the things he had investigated, but unfortunately, he had already signed a confidentiality agreement and couldn't speak about it.</p><p></p><p>So, as a compromise, he informed Jiao Xiuyuan that he had come here to hide temporarily to avoid the crowds.</p><p></p><p>"I noticed that I lost contact with this puppet shortly after Miss Lu Xichan arrived, and I knew that something serious had truly happened. As expected."</p><p></p><p>"A confidentiality agreement, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan glanced at Li Fan, guessing the reason he was avoiding the discussion.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder things seem a bit unsettled over at Tianquan and Tianyu Prefecture..." Jiao Xiuyuan squinted his eyes, about to delve deeper into his thoughts, but inadvertently swept a glance over his own shop, his face suddenly changing.</p><p></p><p>He swiftly moved to the shelf and checked it again, then exclaimed, "How come a painting seems to be missing?"</p><p></p><p>"This was something I painstakingly excavated from a pile of junk!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was about to say that the painting was with him.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he discovered in shock that the puppet in front of him had exploded with a 'bang,' splitting into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was not flesh and blood flying around but wood debris fluttering in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao!" Li Fan was also momentarily stunned by this turn of events.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine!" In an instant, another puppet emerged from under the counter.</p><p></p><p>His face was gloomy as he took out a broom to clean up the scene.</p><p></p><p>"What was that just now?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I engaged in a losing business, so it was difficult to sustain it." Jiao Xiuyuan didn't explain much, just shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly strange, how could the fine painting disappear? Who has the audacity to steal it right under my nose?" After finishing cleaning, Jiao Xiuyuan rubbed his chin in frustration and anger.</p>

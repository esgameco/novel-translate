            <p>"Hmph, I have inquired through others, and it does seem to be true. However, it is foreseeable that the price to obtain this secret technique will be extremely high. Those prominent families, in order to maintain the 'purity' of their descendants, no matter how much it costs, they will definitely find ways to achieve it!"</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, fellow daoists do not need to be overly resistant! The existence of the Wheel of Reincarnation may be a good thing for us!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How so?"</p><p></p><p>"You see, anyway, we can be reborn in eighteen years. If you feel that your talent in this world is limited and there is no hope for cultivation, you can just commit suicide directly. Maybe in the next life, you will be born into a good family with exceptional talents..."</p><p></p><p>The naive words immediately provoked laughter from other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoist, have you drunk too much spirit wine?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about whether you have such good luck or not. Also, have you ever thought about why it takes eighteen years for resurrection? Are the true spirits reincarnated completely random among the deceased cultivators during those eighteen years? I bet there are hidden tricks in it that people don't know!"</p><p></p><p>"I actually think what he said makes some sense. Think about it, our talents are mediocre, and this life offers no hope of rising. Even if we have descendants, they are destined to be bullied and oppressed. That's why I never thought about raising offspring before. But now..."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it's not impossible. Besides the fusion of my son with the true spirit, how amazing my talent was in the last life. Just having the additional lifetime of cultivation experience is already a supreme wealth. If luck is even better, it may lead to a great rebirth. By then, father relying on the son's nobility, hmph!"</p><p></p><p>"Friend, what you said actually makes some sense."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Similar arguments occurred throughout the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, through Nan Gong Shirong, learned more details about the Wheel of Reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"The rumors are true, there is indeed a secret technique to prevent newborns from merging with true spirits. However..."</p><p></p><p>"It requires eight million contribution points, and must be executed in the mother's body in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Truly damn crazy! After all these years of hard work in Tianling Prefecture, I haven't accumulated that much."</p><p></p><p>"There is also the 'Mirror of Reincarnation', which can peek into the memory of the true spirit merged with the newborn. If unsatisfied, hm..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'True Spirit Guide', placed on the prepared flesh, can increase the accuracy of the true spirit reincarnating into a designated body."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Ultimate Body Shell', in the Wheel of Reincarnation, can perfectly replicate one's current flesh for the perfect resurrection in the next life."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Soul Cleansing', allows the true spirit to maintain emotions from the previous life during the eighteen years in the Wheel of Reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Decree of Reincarnation', doesn't require an eighteen-year wait. The true spirit can be resurrected immediately after falling."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai and Nan Gong Shirong looked at the contents on the jade slips in front of them, each with a different expression.</p><p></p><p>"Surprisingly, there are so many flashy gimmicks! Each one is a treasure beyond reach for ordinary people!" Nan Gong Shirong cursed secretly.</p><p></p><p>"But this 'Decree of Reincarnation' is really good. If combined with the 'Ultimate Body Shell,' wouldn't it be like having an extra life? No, with sufficient contribution points, it's basically immortal and can resurrect indefinitely!" he exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there are any other restrictions." Xu Bai's eyes flashed, nodding in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"All circumstances are considered. It seems that the Wuxian Alliance has long been prepared. It may cause some turmoil, but I believe that cultivators will quickly adapt to it." After scanning through the various items listed on the jade slip, Xu Bai said so.</p><p></p><p>"Once obtaining eternal life, the world will change in an instant. This 'Lord of Reincarnation' is truly extraordinary. The Xuanhuang realm is about to usher in a new era." Nan Gong Shirong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I just wonder what the situation is on the side of the Five Elders. Can the power of the Lord of Reincarnation reach them?" Xu Bai suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Nan Gong Shirong hesitated, "I'm not sure either. But, I heard that a certain deal seems to have been reached, only as a trial in a small area..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Xuanhuang realm cultivators gradually adapted to the existence of the Wheel of Reincarnation in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the first case of resurrection occurred.</p><p></p><p>A golden core cultivator named Ximen Yang, in front of everyone, self-detonated and perished.</p><p></p><p>However, shortly after, he reappeared vividly in everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>His appearance and behavior were just like before.</p><p></p><p>He even remembered the self-detonation incident and boasted to everyone about his experience of self-detonation, death, and rebirth.</p><p></p><p>The news spread quickly, making the cultivators who had some doubts about Reincarnation become convinced.</p><p></p><p>With more and more cases of rebirth by Xuanhuang realm cultivators appearing on the ground, the existence of Reincarnation began to be gradually accepted by the public.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the swallowing white mist.</p><p></p><p>Even though barely visible through the boundless mist, the three could faintly see the Wheel of Reincarnation above their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, now cultivators are like they have no fear of death, there are so many people even in the deep white mist." Dongfang Yao scolded in anger. Before he could finish his words, a Bodhisattva's True Boat whizzed past them.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say nonsense before? With the Lord of Reincarnation, everyone can be reborn. What's there to fear about death? In eighteen years, you can be a hero again!" Huangfu Song sneered.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe in this Wheel of Reincarnation. There must be something fishy about it. Think about it, talking about preserving memories in a bit of true spirit. Even if you are reborn, if you merge with someone else, are you still yourself? Even if you have a prepared body to achieve so-called resurrection, I really died at that time. The one who is reborn is just someone else with the same memories as me!" Dongfang Yao's expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>"Both of you brothers must not be deceived. Be careful and cherish your lives!" he admonished.</p><p></p><p>"When did you become so sharp, Dongfang? What you said seems to make some sense." Huangfu Song frowned slightly, pondering and said.</p><p></p><p>As the two debated, Li Fan was thinking about something else.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Reincarnation from the previous life has never appeared in the world, let alone this Wheel of Reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>"The reversal of the law of life and death, which should have become the natural law of the world, like the 'Lord of Worry,' is naturally integrated. Now this reversal of the law of life and death needs the help of the Wheel of Reincarnation. Does this mean that the Lord of Reincarnation has not reached the most perfect ideal state?"</p>

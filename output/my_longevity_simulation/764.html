        <h1>Chapter 764</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that Mr. Bai must have a great connection with the Meteor Immortal Realm. While sending a spiritual clone like Xu Bai to enter it might attract the attention of the Mr. Bai existing in the Meteor Immortal Realm...the result was destined to be unpredictable fortune or misfortune.</p><p></p><p>Ever since being transported here, after experiencing so much, Li Fan had long stopped easily believing anything, even what he saw with his own eyes. Especially when it concerned matters of life and death for him. </p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Xu Bai ultimately suppressed the inexplicable urge welling up inside him to explore the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Things seem strange, I must be cautious," Xu Bai's expression was inscrutable. </p><p></p><p>This body was refined from Xu Ke's essence of blood combined with the spiritual aura of Mr. Bai. Just being imbued with a trace of his spiritual aura caused many strange phenomena to appear on Xu Bai, including but not limited to "being favored by heaven and earth, having outstanding innate talents", "often feeling empathy welling up in his heart", and "unbidden thoughts frequently arising in his mind beyond his control."</p><p></p><p>All of this was enough to illustrate Mr. Bai's formidable power. It made Li Fan instinctively wary. If the influence was limited just to the spiritual clone, it would be fine. What Li Fan truly feared was this change gradually seeping through the connection between the clone and his true self, subtly influencing his original body.</p><p></p><p>At that point, would he still be himself? Even if he was, could he shake off this "contamination"?</p><p></p><p>Correct, in Li Fan's eyes, this bizarre phenomenon that altered his original nature was absolutely a form of contamination to him - something he could never accept.</p><p></p><p>"If there are any signs that my true self is being influenced, I must immediately withdraw the clone," Xu Bai made a firm decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Calming his mood, Xu Bai returned his expression to normal and left the Longevity Valley. Back in Tianliang Prefecture, he continued handling the various matters the Celestial Communication Office was responsible for.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the great campaign to conquer minor realms began, he had taken on another duty - to monitor the number of discovered minor realms and celestial pockets within the territory, coordinating and directing cultivators to subjugate them.</p><p></p><p>The root cause was that currently, all unknown minor realms represented vast amounts of merit and contributions for cultivators. Unless it was a special circumstance, no one would choose to share them with others. They would first share with close friends and family.</p><p></p><p>Only when the power within a minor realm was too great for their small group to handle alone would they reluctantly share with others.</p><p></p><p>The Cosmos Alliance had envisioned that after discovering entrances to minor realms, they would openly share the information with all cultivators in the alliance - an extremely rare scenario.</p><p></p><p>But after so much time had passed, cultivators had come to their senses. Conquering minor realms was actually a non-renewable resource - possibly the only opportunity in their lifetime to rapidly accumulate such merit and contributions.</p><p></p><p>If so, they naturally had to carefully calculate and maximize their benefits. So after the initial rapid expansion, the pace of conquering realms slowed considerably.</p><p></p><p>Hence, this new duty was added for him. Although there were no compulsory measures, he at least held an official Cosmos Alliance position. When he took the lead, it often facilitated many small groups to form powerful alliances.</p><p></p><p>So he did not encounter much resistance, but rather gained quite a reputation.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the news spread, there would be cultivators who would actively come to seek help.</p><p></p><p>The more he interacted with them, the more Xu Bai understood their demands.</p><p></p><p>First, they could share the information about the entrances to the small worlds they controlled with others. But in return, the cultivators who profited this time, if they discovered other small worlds in the future and needed help, they would also have to prioritize these people.</p><p></p><p>It was a mutual aid relationship.</p><p></p><p>Second, conquering the small worlds was not as simple as eating and drinking. It required constantly facing bloody slaughter, and the slightest carelessness could result in death on the spot. Therefore, the accompanying cultivators must be trustworthy. Not to mention sharing life and death, at the very least they couldn't stab each other in the back.</p><p></p><p>Third, the so-called "water that nourishes one's own field should not flow out to others." If possible, the small worlds within the Tian Liang Prefecture should be consumed by the local cultivators of the Tian Liang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai had experienced countless reincarnations and claimed to understand the human heart. But when faced with these cultivators with hidden agendas, he still felt a bit overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Often, the group of cultivators he introduced, who appeared to be in perfect harmony on the surface, would ultimately have only a few return.</p><p></p><p>They would not mention the cultivators who had fallen in the team, but would instead start blaming each other.</p><p></p><p>Yet the next time he contacted them, asking if they were willing to form a team to conquer together, they would most likely still agree.</p><p></p><p>Because although they knew the other party's dark behavior, they at least knew some of the details.</p><p></p><p>Compared to completely unknown and unfamiliar partners, they were actually more trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>"The human heart is truly unfathomable and difficult to fathom," Xu Bai sighed.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the names of the cultivators were like chess pieces, with different arrangements based on their temperament and abilities.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was trying to find a way to maximize the utilization of the cultivators' power in the Tian Liang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It was also not a bad idea as another unique cultivation method, he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Now, a total of thirteen small worlds have been discovered in the Tian Liang Prefecture. One of them is extremely dangerous, and several attempts to conquer it have resulted in no survivors, so it has been temporarily shelved. The remaining twelve have been completely cleared of half..."</p><p></p><p>After the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance completely destroyed the resistance forces in the small worlds and completed the scanning of the small worlds with the Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror, the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance would send a team of black-robed cultivators to take over, expelling the common people and sealing the entrances. What they were doing inside, Xu Bai didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Even when Xu Bai inquired with Nangong Shirong, he couldn't find out anything.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the feedback from his many cultivators, the entrances to these small worlds disappeared mysteriously shortly after being taken over by the black-robed cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although the locations were still marked on the map of the Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror, when they actually went there, they couldn't find the specific entrances.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that they were hidden in some way, but the entrances themselves had undergone changes."</p><p></p><p>"The entrances are still there, but they seem to have been encrypted in a way that makes them impossible to find through ordinary means," Xu Bai concluded after exploring the sites in person.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Xu Bai was busy in the Tian Liang Prefecture, the true self of Li Fan had finally bid farewell to the enthusiastic Shuo Feng and left his mansion.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had also gained a lot during the days he was entangled in combat with Shuo Feng, he was more amazed by Shuo Feng's rate of progress.</p><p></p><p>From the initial state where he had no ability to resist "Extracting Threads and Severing Life," and could only rely on his somewhat peculiar physique to endure.</p>

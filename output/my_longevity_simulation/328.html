            <p>"Stand on one foot and turn two circles to the left. Then turn three circles to the right."</p><p></p><p>To verify, Li Fan ordered coldly again.</p><p></p><p>If the previous request was a bit rude, then Li Fan's current demand could be considered quite outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Asking a female cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage, whom he just met for the first time, to perform such a bizarre and ridiculous act.</p><p></p><p>No normal person would agree to it.</p><p></p><p>But surprisingly, Lu Xuejing actually followed the instructions seriously, step by step, and completed the entire set of movements.</p><p></p><p>However, she stared at Li Fan with eyes that seemed to be burning with flames.</p><p></p><p>As if she wanted to grind his bones to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But what kind of person was Li Fan? How could he be intimidated by a little girl who had just started out?</p><p></p><p>With a slight smile, he said to Lu Xuejing, "It seems you're still not clear about your current situation."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you even dared to be disrespectful to the old fisherman whose background is unknown... Perhaps you indeed need to be taught a lesson."</p><p></p><p>"Keep turning circles like just now, and don't stop without my order."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>A flash of humiliation passed through Lu Xuejing's eyes, but her body was very obedient.</p><p></p><p>She began turning circles in a comical manner.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't pay attention to her for the time being, but pondered the reason that led to the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when the old fisherman handed Lu Xuejing over to Li Fan, he used words like "item" and "thing" to describe her.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, in the fisherman's eyes, this little girl who was unfamiliar with the ways of the world belonged to him as an object.</p><p></p><p>Then, after obtaining the Stealing Sky and Swapping Sun Order, he gave this "item" to Li Fan in exchange.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the ownership of this item fell to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As the owner of the item, Li Fan naturally had the power to control everything about it.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know how the old fisherman managed to do it, judging from Lu Xuejing's obedient behavior towards Li Fan now, this had already become an established fact.</p><p></p><p>"The thing is correct."</p><p></p><p>"But where does its great use lie?"</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how beautiful a female cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage was, she definitely couldn't be of much use to Li Fan who wholeheartedly sought immortality.</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan didn't let Lu Xuejing stop turning circles, and directly asked, "Tell me the information about your mother."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of hope flashed in Lu Xuejing's eyes, and she said intermittently, "My mother is called Lu Xichan, the chief formation master of the Formation Hall in the Myriad Immortals Alliance, with the cultivation of Harmonious Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the girl's words, Li Fan was shocked and a sharp light flashed in his eyes as he looked at Lu Xuejing.</p><p></p><p>"The chief of the Formation Hall, needing to set up the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation for an immortal cave, a Five Elements Grand Immortal Cave..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be like this?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan thought of a possibility.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what the old fisherman saw in me. But since he has already placed this great opportunity before me, I mustn't miss it."</p><p></p><p>"If I can probe some information about the Five Elements Grand Immortal Cave, even if I have to return to the mortal world directly in this life, it would be worth it. If I can personally enter the immortal cave and observe from the inside, that would be even better."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes burned with intensity, and his heart was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>However, he wasn't blinded by this unexpected fortune and quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"A Harmonious Dao Immortal, and also the chief formation master. Her strength must be unfathomably deep. Although I have now gained control over her daughter, if I want to use this as leverage to coerce or seek any benefits, I'm afraid it would only lead to death."</p><p></p><p>"As for the specific course of action, I still need to plan carefully."</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, seeing that the anger in Lu Xuejing's eyes had gradually disappeared and been replaced by a tearful, pleading look on her face.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly formed an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>He finally shouted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing felt relieved and stopped the ridiculous movements.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can go home now." Li Fan said directly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing was stunned at first, looking at Li Fan in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Then a hint of wild joy surged on her face.</p><p></p><p>With her body regaining freedom, her instinct was to escape from this place and get far away from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, many demonic whispers kept ringing in her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the relationship between us is your most important secret. You can't reveal even a bit of information to anyone in any way."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"You'll have to end your own life."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice was extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing's body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"After you return, don't say anything and act as usual. Quietly wait for my notification."</p><p></p><p>"If someone asks, just say that you were captured by the fisherman and lost consciousness. Then you were rescued by a stranger, but before you could express your gratitude, the benefactor had already disappeared without a trace."</p><p></p><p>A communication talisman flew to her side.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice sounded at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Take it."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may go."</p><p></p><p>Having received the order from her master, Lu Xuejing put away the communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>Without daring to look back, she flew towards the distant horizon.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, watching the little girl's receding figure.</p><p></p><p>"Conspiring against a tiger for its skin is extremely dangerous, but once successful, the gains will be a hundred or thousand times greater."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I'm a bit more careful and cautious, and return to the mortal world immediately if I sense something amiss, the risk can be minimized."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, in fact, it's not as dangerous as I imagined. The fisherman's methods are bizarre, and even I, as the person involved, can't detect them."</p><p></p><p>"If that girl wasn't so unbearable and acted too obviously, I probably wouldn't have thought that such an absurd and unreasonable thing could happen."</p><p></p><p>"Wait..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling seems a bit similar to the anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the people in the Yunshui Palace of the Congyun Sea, as well as the master pulling the ox cart, surfaced again.</p><p></p><p>"The body of the Heaven-Slaying Sword is hidden in the Yunshui Palace, and everyone in the Yunshui Palace has transformed into anomalies."</p><p></p><p>"Is the owner of the Heaven-Slaying Sword also like this?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened back then?"</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he saw that Lu Xuejing, who was originally flying high in the sky at the far horizon, had turned into a black dot.</p><p></p><p>But she suddenly fell straight down like a kite with its string cut.</p><p></p><p>Breaking many tree branches, she disappeared from Li Fan's sight.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an image suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing, with an extremely pained expression on her face, her body twisted, rolling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Twitching all over.</p><p></p><p>Like a mortal without air, or a fish out of water.</p><p></p><p>Struggling in despair.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene before his eyes, Li Fan seemed to have an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>As the master's item, she couldn't leave the master without permission.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had just said it verbally, he didn't exercise his authority as the master.</p><p></p><p>Because at that time, he still didn't know what kind of control he had over his item.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Fan had finally experienced it firsthand.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1264</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan spoke on and on, while Li Fan seemed to still be in shock and pain from learning that his beloved wife had passed away.</p><p></p><p>"It was fate, it was destiny. No wonder I had been feeling uneasy recently," Li Fan said with sorrow. "Trapped here, I couldn't even see her one last time."</p><p></p><p>"Does our son have a name yet?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan calmly replied, "Sun Tianci. Ninglu personally named him before she died."</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Li Fan said with both grief and some relief, "Tianci... a good name."</p><p></p><p>After discussing Sun Tianci, Sun Luyuan's expression gradually turned serious as he brought up important matters. </p><p></p><p>"Your eldest uncle, Sun Luchang, is leaving."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan briefly recounted the appearance of the sword light in the sky, bringing news of the Xuanshang celestial boat from the distant sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit surprised. "From the looks of it, traveling beyond the starry skies is not a good thing at all. Can it be declined?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shook his head. "In the current situation, the upper families of the Immortal Alliance who know the inside story are avoiding it like the plague, while the ignorant lower-level garrison Immortal Dao cultivators are fighting to go. Naturally, they won't tell them the truth in order to have more scapegoats. It's quite ironic."</p><p></p><p>"Although Uncle is at the Immortal Dao realm, he's gotten used to an easy life in recent years. I'm afraid..." Li Fan said with some concern.</p><p></p><p>"If I wasn't stationed here and couldn't leave, I would definitely go to the outer sea of stars in place of Uncle."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke with determination, quite in line with Sun Ang's previous behavior. </p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan didn't suspect him, but showed a displeased look. "Our Sun family's influence has grown too strong. Guarding the Yanfa Orb, traveling beyond the starry skies... It's hard to say these arrangements don't carry a hint of the Immortal Alliance deliberately suppressing us."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much. Just stay here and live peacefully."</p><p></p><p>Without revealing to Li Fan that the Sun family had already pledged allegiance to the Holy Dynasty of Daqi, Sun Luyuan just warned Li Fan to put stability first in all matters.</p><p></p><p>"I've already informed Elder Xu," Sun Luyuan said before leaving. "Perhaps you won't need to stay the full 300 years before succeeding and leaving."</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch has taken great care," Li Fan said gratefully. </p><p></p><p>"By the way, after sitting here in meditation for several years, I've summarized my life's learnings and made some gains."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, please pass on this 'Prospering Orthodox Dao' text to Tianci for me."</p><p></p><p>With that, an ordinary-looking piece of writing appeared in Sun Luyuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Scanning it over, there was nothing special about it. </p><p></p><p>It was just common methods for cultivating the heart and illuminating the will.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan nodded and immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Then he bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>Once Sun Luyuan's figure disappeared, Li Fan sneered in his heart, "In just over a hundred years, it's questionable whether the Xuan-Huang Realm can even survive that long."</p><p></p><p>But he also knew there was secret monitoring by the Myriad Immortal Alliance here, so he didn't dwell on it, the thoughts just flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Yanfa Orb slacking off again, Li Fan couldn't help but painstakingly urge and admonish it once more.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Holy Dynasty of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>Holy Dynasty Secret Weapon Testing Grounds.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping and Qiaogong watched as Sun Erlang strived to control the third [Holy Punishment God Puppet].</p><p></p><p>Holy Punishment God Puppet was the name Li Ping gave to the golden puppet to distinguish it from ordinary Holy Soldier Puppets.</p><p></p><p>"This Sun kid really has exceptional talent. His adaptability is frighteningly strong, already mastering the third God Puppet. Unexpectedly, he might be able to control all our reserve God Puppets," Qiaogong praised endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, those in my Spirit Origin Sect are all useless."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, you've always been in the Holy Dynasty. Is the Spirit Origin Sect in Jiushan Prefecture doing alright?" Li Ping asked casually, his gaze fixed on Sun Erlang in the testing ground, sweat constantly dripping from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong waved his hand. "In Jiushan Prefecture, my puppet is stationed there. Those fools, every time they see me, they nod and bow, not daring to raise their heads. How could they distinguish the real from the fake?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qiaogong paused. "But counting the time, that fellow from the Myriad Immortal Alliance who collects taxes is probably coming. Perhaps I'll need to go back for a trip then."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that Qiaogong used the Spirit Origin Merit in Jiushan Prefecture to gather a large amount of source power, which was permitted by the Myriad Immortal Alliance. The price was to hand over a portion of it.</p><p></p><p>A large portion.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance shouldn't lack expendables. Why are they still so concerned about your little bit?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong said nonchalantly, "Who knows? Maybe it's because this kind of unscrupulous thing is inconvenient for them to openly get involved in."</p><p></p><p>"But..." Qiaogong seemed to remember something. "Now that you mention it, I do recall, the previous Immortal Alliance envoy inadvertently mentioned that the Myriad Immortal Alliance seemed to have too large an internal deficit and could only increase revenue and reduce expenditure."</p><p></p><p>"I even joked with him at the time, saying the Myriad Immortal Alliance looked extravagant but was actually a pauper."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Ping fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Source power is nothing more than pure, ownerless cultivation base. Normal cultivators don't need it..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"When the Immortal Alliance envoy comes this time, I'll meet him in your place," Li Ping decided.</p><p></p><p>"Great, great, great." Qiaogong, unable to get away, was more than happy to agree.</p><p></p><p>He immediately transmitted to Li Ping in detail the scenes of the previous few meetings.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong showed a proud expression and clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Then a faceless body instantly appeared in front of Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Holy Emperor's huge three-zhang-three stature, this faceless body was only normal human size.</p><p></p><p>But it could be considered a proportional miniaturization, with an appearance almost no different from Li Ping's.</p><p></p><p>If the Holy Emperor was too suspicious, he might punish Qiaogong for the crime of great disrespect.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he just stared at the puppet body with interest, a bit surprised. "It's actually a real flesh body?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong nodded. "Yes. Didn't you say you wanted to borrow it to go to the starry skies? The sea of stars is full of crises, and there are some strange things that only a real flesh body can sense. I suffered a big loss before coming to Xuan-Huang back then."</p><p></p><p>A trace of heartache flashed in Qiaogong's eyes, and he continued to introduce to the Holy Emperor, "I referenced Tianyang's Shen Hua Dao, as well as your precious disciple's flesh cultivation technique."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation aptitude of this flesh puppet is not to be expected, but complete sensory connection is no problem. And like the Holy Soldier God Puppets, it can integrate the world's spirit and the essence of source power. Although limited by the innately weak body, its strength will be discounted, but with Immortal Dao realm strength, as long as one is cautious, there should be no problem for self-preservation in the starry skies."</p><p></p><p>"As long as one doesn't encounter strange calamities in the void," Qiaogong said very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor nodded.</p><p></p><p>A bit of golden light flew from his fingertip...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power surged out, infusing into the flesh puppet in front.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of controlling it like a clone or an arm arose from his heart. </p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor carefully comprehended these familiar yet unfamiliar sensations, as a glimmer of realization welled up in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take this body with me."</p><p></p><p>With a flash of golden light, the Holy Emperor and the flesh puppet body disappeared together.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong refocused his attention on Sun Erlang inside the testing ground.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Holy Dynasty's treasury.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor, avoiding Qiaogong, was modifying the puppet body.</p><p></p><p>His purpose for venturing into space this time was to comprehend the Dao. </p><p></p><p>He still had requirements for the aptitude of the body he would possess.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It didn't mean the Holy Emperor couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>His large hand touched the top of the flesh puppet's head, slowly infusing Xuanhuang Heavenly Grace into it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly...</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor actually felt a sense of familiarity welling up in his heart, causing his hand movements to pause slightly. </p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he suppressed this abnormality.</p><p></p><p>The originally stiff-looking body gradually became more lifelike.</p><p></p><p>As one heavenly material and earthly treasure after another from the Holy Dynasty's treasury was refined into liquid essence by Origin Power and infused into the puppet body,</p><p></p><p>This body appeared increasingly crystal clear and exuded fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Even the always sleeping Cat Treasure was attracted, suddenly waking up and surveying its surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Discovering the source of the fragrance was the body refined by Li Ping, a trace of disappointment flashed in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just as it was about to go back to sleep, it received instructions from the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Cat Treasure shook its head a bit reluctantly, but in the end couldn't resist the temptation of the promised Origin Power essence, and let out a lazy meow.</p><p></p><p>Then with a leap, it actually transformed into a blue, transparent glass cover.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping Li Ping's refined body inside.</p><p></p><p>Strands of blue light were released from the container. After drifting for a moment, they all drilled into the interior of the puppet body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Ping had a thread of consciousness attached to the puppet body, so he could personally experience the specific changes it underwent after being bathed in the blue light.</p><p></p><p>"Flesh and blood reorganization, the sublimation of life form."</p><p></p><p>"Even without cultivation, the strength of this body will surpass the generally accepted Yuanying stage cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor carefully sensed the differences between this body and his original body.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't yet understand what consequences the differences would lead to. But he could almost be certain that these differences were created to deal with some special situations.</p><p></p><p>While the blue light cover continuously carried out the transformation, a flash of realization also crossed Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>He could even use this function of the Cat Treasure to infuse the special abilities of the creatures absorbed and simulated by the Cat Treasure into this body, turning them into the body's innate divine powers.</p><p></p><p>However, after all, it was an artificially created body. Doing so might cause it to undergo immeasurable changes.</p><p></p><p>He could slowly try it out in the future.</p><p></p><p>The blue light cover grew dimmer and dimmer, and finally the light completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Cat Treasure looked as if it had fought a great battle for three days and nights, its face haggard, and even its originally glossy fur seemed a bit yellowish.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping fed it a big mouthful of golden Origin Power essence, and only then did the Cat Treasure fall into a deep, contented sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Item replication, creature simulation, this is the Cat Treasure's third function."</p><p></p><p>"Yijing Bone Marrow Replacement."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly amazing!" Li Ping exclaimed in awe.</p><p></p><p>The puppet body had already awakened from the sublimation, and Li Ping sensed that this body was even more suitable for his soul than the original body.</p><p></p><p>"Why not directly swap bodies?"</p><p></p><p>A thought welled up irrepressibly from the depths of his mind, but in an instant, it was forcibly suppressed by the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Cat Treasure's Yijing Bone Marrow Replacement function was not a one-time thing.</p><p></p><p>If the effects on the puppet body were already so good, naturally it wouldn't be much worse on his true body.</p><p></p><p>There was still time, and plenty of opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping concentrated his thoughts on the puppet body and began to adapt to and try operating it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Before the puppet body could fly out of Xuanhuang, it first received a message from Qiaogong.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance envoy was coming to the Lingyuan Sect in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>A golden light flashed on Li Ping's body, instantly transforming him into the appearance of Qiaogong Jushi.</p><p></p><p>Silently, he appeared inside the Lingyuan Sect headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the arrival of the Immortal Alliance envoy.</p><p></p><p>And the puppet body left behind by Qiaogong had long prepared the large amount of collected Origin Power.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally looked down on these low-quality energies.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention compared to Origin Power essence, even compared to the Origin Power formed by the Holy Dynasty's subjects cultivating the Lingyuan Technique, they were far inferior.</p><p></p><p>"The quality of the submission this time seems to have improved a lot?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master is thoughtful." The Immortal Alliance envoy praised, carefully putting away the orb containing the Origin Power.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping imitated Qiaogong's tone of speech and replied with a smile, "I recently learned a profound technique that can invisibly remove the complex thoughts of the sect members, allowing them to spend more time cultivating the techniques."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance envoy's eyes lit up, "There's such a divine technique?"</p><p></p><p>"What? Is the envoy also interested?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance envoy was a bit embarrassed, "The Immortal Alliance's deficit has grown again recently. If it's convenient for the Sect Master..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping waved his hand, "No problem, but I'm just a minor Daoist. If the envoy is interested, I'll tell you about it."</p><p></p><p>"No distracting thoughts, dwelling in one's own spirit. Myriad methods cannot invade, touching the profound and mysterious..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping spoke, he chanted and actually directly revealed this profound technique.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance envoy was overjoyed and hurriedly concentrated on listening.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't notice that his mind was slowly sinking along with the other party's gentle chanting.</p><p></p><p>When the Immortal Alliance envoy's eyes became completely vacant and fell into a state of utter daze, Li Ping smiled slightly and flicked out a point of gold, flying into the other party's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>As expected, there was the protection of the Immortal Alliance's restrictions.</p><p></p><p>But under the silent lurking of the Origin Power essence, the defense line was like paper, and was silently penetrated.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Ping found the information he wanted in the other's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The power of ten thousand cultivators, condensing a penetrating spear."</p><p></p><p>"Directly reaching deep into Xuanhuang, the endless Dark Sea..."</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had always been curious about how the Wanxian Alliance found and maintained the entrance to the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the Dark Tribe people's confession, the passage excavated by the Wanxian Alliance in the Dark Sea had obvious differences from the passage opened by the Dark Tribe's traditional methods.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because they didn't completely trust the Dark Tribe people, or perhaps it was because the Wanxian Alliance wanted to firmly control the passage to the Dark Sea in their own hands.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the Wanxian Alliance came up with a method of directly opening a passage between the Xuanhuang Realm and the Dark Sea by using highly condensed Origin Power.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because the Wanxian Alliance has been eyeing the Dark Realm covetously that the power of the Dark Sea has been constantly diminishing."</p>

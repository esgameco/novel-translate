        <h1>Chapter 961</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Living in a remote mountain in Tongyan Prefecture, Li Fan spent quite some effort to find this place. </p><p></p><p>Outside the cave dwelling, Li Fan could faintly sense the bursts of gloomy aura emanating from within.</p><p></p><p>There were also many faint whispers circling around his ears.</p><p></p><p>Just like the rumored vengeful spirits.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was very clear that in the Xuanhuang Realm, there was no such thing as ghost cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the vast majority of cases, when a cultivator perished, they would directly return to the Dao of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Only in extremely rare situations could some remnant souls be preserved.</p><p></p><p>It was already difficult to retain complete memories and clear consciousness from when they were alive, let alone cultivate with a remnant soul body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the bizarre beings of Yunshui Heavenly Palace who transformed their bodies were an exception.</p><p></p><p>They were not within the scope of ordinary discussion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, and the whispers by his ears instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Striding into Luo Suzhen's cave dwelling, he saw that the ground was littered with human skeletons lying in all directions.</p><p></p><p>They were all arranged in different poses, giving the feeling that they were still alive.</p><p></p><p>A dwarf cultivator, whose height only reached Li Fan's knees, was solemnly conversing with one of the skeletons: "Third Brother, don't worry, I know you're not satisfied with the new wife I found for you."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I have already selected a new one for you again. You should also persuade Fourth Brother. It's already embarrassing enough that he didn't find a Dao companion when he was alive. Could it be that he still wants to be lonely for eternity after death..."</p><p></p><p>He rambled on and on, with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>As if the dry bones in front of him were still alive.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched expressionlessly and lightly coughed, awakening the immersed dwarf cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Who are you?" The dwarf cultivator looked up, seeming to try hard to see Li Fan's appearance clearly.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had already changed his appearance while also concealing himself.</p><p></p><p>The dwarf cultivator couldn't see clearly at all.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the cultivator who can reconstruct the appearance of the deceased based on their skull?" Li Fan explained his purpose.</p><p></p><p>The dwarf cultivator finally came to his senses and nodded repeatedly: "Yes, yes, that's me."</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his hands: "I've been waiting for you for a long time. You said that as long as I complete the reconstruction task, the reward will be at least 10,000 contribution points?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly and nodded: "Don't worry, you won't be short-changed."</p><p></p><p>"However, are you really confident?" Li Fan lowered his head to size up the other party and asked again with a heavier tone.</p><p></p><p>Where Li Fan's gaze reached, the invisible pressure made the dwarf cultivator involuntarily shiver.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly patted his chest with a thump, guaranteeing: "I, Luo Suzhen, have been interacting with the dead since I was young. In my eyes, they are not just a bunch of skeletons at all! They are all living people! If I can't do it, I'm afraid there's no one else in this world who can!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan slowly say: "Then let's begin."</p><p></p><p>He set up a formation around to seal off Luo Suzhen's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>At first, Luo Suzhen was still a bit absent-minded, still glancing from time to time at the skeletons placed in his cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>But as the skull gradually took shape, Luo Suzhen's attention was slowly drawn in.</p><p></p><p>When the skull was completely formed, Luo Suzhen was completely stunned. He involuntarily approached the projection, with a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Too perfect..."</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a perfect skull structure in this world?" Luo Suzhen muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect?" Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that Li Fan was questioning him, Luo Suzhen immediately explained excitedly: "Isn't this considered perfect?"</p><p></p><p>"Look at this frontal bone, this parietal bone, and this occipital bone..."</p><p></p><p>"Exquisite beyond words..."</p><p></p><p>The proportions and combinations of each other were so perfect."</p><p></p><p>"Simply, simply..."</p><p></p><p>After holding back for a long time, Luo Suzhen finally uttered eight words: "A natural and flawless perfection."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan's urging, Luo Suzhen eagerly took the initiative to restore the skull's appearance before death.</p><p></p><p>His method was also very bizarre, not through any secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he nervously attempted to start a conversation with the skull.</p><p></p><p>It was only a projection, naturally unable to respond to Luo Suzhen.</p><p></p><p>But Luo Suzhen seemed to have truly received a response, becoming more and more excited.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was having doubts about this, he saw Luo Suzhen waving his right hand in the air, beginning to depict the skull's appearance before death.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan waited patiently again.</p><p></p><p>As the appearance was gradually restored, the expression on Li Fan's face also slowly turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>When the portrait finally appeared before Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>He tried hard to control the expression on his face, attempting to conceal the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the image in the air for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked in a low voice, "Are you... sure you haven't made a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>As expected, Luo Suzhen's reaction was very agitated: "A mistake? You can question my..."</p><p></p><p>Before the other party could finish speaking, Li Fan took a deep breath, waved his sleeve, and sealed Luo Suzhen along with everything in the cave into the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>He then completely erased all traces of this place.</p><p></p><p>"How could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>Standing in the air for a long time, Li Fan still couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>Unable to face this fact.</p><p></p><p>"The first cultivator infected with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma. The first cultivator infected with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a long time, then flew off towards the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>The target was naturally Yin Shangren, who was also conducting research on the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's perception, Yin Shangren's research still hadn't reached a final conclusion.</p><p></p><p>And Yin Shangren seemed to have sensed something, becoming a bit hesitant and apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of experiments had clearly decreased.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of reluctance to proceed with the final step of verification.</p><p></p><p>Speeding up to the fastest, Li Fan quickly arrived before Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was very surprised by Li Fan's sudden appearance.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Li Fan took the initiative to wave his hand, stopping him.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Yin, regarding the first cultivator infected with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma..."</p><p></p><p>"I've made a shocking discovery."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's whole body trembled violently as he looked at Li Fan in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"This result is too incredible. It simply can't be explained. You should have had some premonition too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was silent for a while, then nodded his head bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, "Then, please begin the final verification."</p><p></p><p>"I also want to ask you to confirm it for me."</p><p></p><p>Motionless, after a long time, Yin Shangren sighed in defeat and led Li Fan to the front of the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>Through the transparent outer wall, Li Fan could vaguely see the white rib that Yin Shangren possessed placed inside.</p><p></p><p>As thick white miasma continuously sprayed out from the surroundings, filling the entire area.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren continuously made hand seals, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>Under his manipulation, the fog slowly thinned.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, it seemed as if something in the air flowed into that white rib.</p><p></p><p>When the transparent area was completely emptied, Yin Shangren, who had confirmed his guess, turned pale and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"So it is like this, so it is like this."</p><p></p><p>He muttered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then slowly stated the answer.</p>

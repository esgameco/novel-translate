        <h1>Chapter 603</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Information is an opportunity, it is a possible breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>So he put in a lot of effort, carried out infiltrations, and tried to turn people.</p><p></p><p>He spent money without counting, but still couldn't get any cultivator to reveal even a bit.</p><p></p><p>They also vaguely indicated that this matter was of great importance and different from before.</p><p></p><p>If it were leaked, it would probably mean death.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't do anything, even though Jiao Xiuyuan felt unwilling, he could only reluctantly give up.</p><p></p><p>With no results, naturally, there was no talk of informing Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to forget about this matter, a turning point appeared.</p><p></p><p>Soon after the Tianlingzhou battle ended, a cultivator who was very tight-lipped and swore not to leak any information, secretly contacted him.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, that person frankly stated that the current situation was different from before.</p><p></p><p>The level of confidentiality had been lowered, so...</p><p></p><p>Of course, necessary rewards were still inevitable.</p><p></p><p>So Jiao Xiuyuan paid a price, even though it made him feel a bit distressed, and learned of this secret.</p><p></p><p>It did indeed shock him.</p><p></p><p>Such confidential information couldn't be shared for free with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And Jiao Xiuyuan didn't think Li Fan could afford the price to purchase this top-secret information.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he chose to actively forget about it.</p><p></p><p>Until today, when Li Fan came looking for him.</p><p></p><p>"The future of the ultimate product..."</p><p></p><p>"It's enough."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, various thoughts flashed through Jiao Xiuyuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, look at my memory, I almost forgot!" Jiao Xiuyuan patted his head.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, friend, the information you asked me to find out is truly a top-secret of the Immortal Alliance. Even if someone made great contributions, I wouldn't divulge a single bit of it."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan looked at Li Fan and said, "What kind of relationship do we have, friend? We've made money together. Plus, there's today's guidance." Jiao Xiuyuan emphasized.</p><p></p><p>"I can tell you for free. But, this matter is not convenient to discuss through communication symbols. If you are really interested, please come find me at the nearest Qianlitang."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like this matter was indeed significant. Even Jiao Xiuyuan was being cautious.</p><p></p><p>He nodded, hung up the communication, and then, through a transmission array, returned to the Misty Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qianlitang store in the Cloud Immortal City, he found Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many customers to begin with. After politely asking them all to leave, Jiao Xiuyuan closed the door. It seemed like he had set up some isolation restrictions around, and then began to explain to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Mysterious Heaven Sect?" Jiao Xiuyuan asked a bombshell question right away.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"An ancient cult that was eradicated by everyone."</p><p></p><p>Although the existence of the Mysterious Heaven Sect was no longer known by the public, as Li Fan was a cultivator from the ancient Tianji Sect, he naturally understood the existence of the Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan wasn't surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "The dormant ancient cultivator found by the Immortal Alliance this time is one of the twelve kings of the Mysterious Heaven Sect from the past."</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>A beam of light burst in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The king of the Mysterious Heaven Sect? Is he still alive?" He couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I was also surprised when I first found out. This guy actually managed to survive for so long. Spanning several eras..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, being the dominating figure of the Mysterious Heaven Realm back then, he surely has some tricks up his sleeve." Jiao Xiuyuan also sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, fell into contemplation in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He just couldn't figure out the other party's true identity.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed extremely crucial to the Five Elders' Association, wanting Li Fan to help investigate...</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan thought it might be someone related to Zhang Qianmo, but he didn't expect it to be a remnant of the ancient Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>How could the king of the Mysterious Heaven Sect hide in the Purple Cloud Sect?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled something and his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>In the Illusion Realm of the Ascended Immortal Area, he learned from Song Hesong, the steward of Ningyuan City, that around two hundred years ago, during the centennial celebration of the Purple Cloud Sect, special envoys from the Ten Dao Sects had arrived.</p><p></p><p>They were there to investigate the wanted criminals hidden within the Purple Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, it ended inconclusively, with only an internal disciple being apprehended.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the wanted criminal lurking within the Purple Cloud Sect at that time was this king of the Mysterious Heaven Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"And the Ten Dao Sects didn't find him, they just caught a scapegoat?"</p><p></p><p>After understanding this connection, Li Fan was shaken.</p><p></p><p>And as Jiao Xiuyuan observed the subtle changes in Li Fan's expression, he continued, "The reason why the Immortal Alliance has gone to such great lengths, even digging three feet into various ancient sites, to find this king of the Mysterious Heaven Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Is because he is related to the 'Mysterious Heaven Sealing Spirit Array.'"</p><p></p><p>"Apparently, details are not very clear."</p><p></p><p>"But it seems like this king of the Mysterious Heaven Sect is a crucial component to maintain the formation."</p><p></p><p>"At a time when the Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Association were on the verge of war, the Immortal Alliance pinned their hopes of defeating the Elders on the 'Mysterious Heaven Sealing Spirit Array.'"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, this king had to be closely monitored to prevent any mishaps."</p><p></p><p>"Strangely, even with such precautions, the news somehow leaked out."</p><p></p><p>"Such a formidable killing tool, and yet the Five Elders' Association managed to find a way to break it within a short time."</p><p></p><p>"It's completely illogical. Who would believe there wasn't a mole? Considering the complexity of the formation, it's unlikely even the Living Dao Master in the world could unravel it so quickly without any prior knowledge."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan sighed and said, "But this mole is really well hidden. The Immortal Alliance has been purging internally for a long time now, and they still haven't found him. Isn't it strange!"</p><p></p><p>"It is a bit unbelievable." Li Fan maintained a composed demeanor, but he expressed some astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"I feel, perhaps, it is possible that someone within the Immortal Alliance deliberately leaked the formation to prevent the war from being one-sided," Li Fan casually remarked.</p><p></p><p>"It's unlikely, a bit too..." Jiao Xiuyuan smiled, but his expression suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>"But that's not entirely impossible." After a long pause, his expression turned slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what is the name of this king of the Mysterious Heaven Sect? What does he look like?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"In the Purple Cloud Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"I know quite a few people from their sect back then." Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>While Jiao Xiuyuan was still lost in thought about the previous question, he absentmindedly said, "Right, you are somewhat related to him."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like his name is..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Chen?"</p>

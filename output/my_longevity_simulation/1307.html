            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This formation..."</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth is it?!" The Holy Emperor was both shocked and furious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter, the Heavenly Doctor, and even the Mysterious Immortal Boat from the other side of the starry sky, were clearly not the ones who set up the formation.</p><p></p><p>In this starry sea, who else could have such power to set up a grand formation that made even him tremble in fear?!</p><p></p><p>What exactly was that Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable, who had just descended not long ago but never showed himself, doing?!</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts appeared in the Holy Emperor's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The golden needles outside the starry space continued to fly in, as if endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Alternating between the real and the illusory, they were both dense and fast.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was already unable to block all these golden needles, and now he also sensed that the Mysterious Yellow Realm seemed to have inexplicably fallen into a crisis.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Heavenly Doctor seemed to be completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Doctor! Mysterious Yellow Realm!" Left with no choice, the Holy Emperor roared towards the outer starry space to warn them.</p><p></p><p>The continuous rain of golden needles seemed to pause slightly, but still did not end.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to before, there were some slight changes in the locations where the golden needles landed on the Mysterious Yellow Land.</p><p></p><p>It should be that the Heavenly Doctor had also perceived the hidden changes in the Mysterious Yellow Realm and was trying to reverse them through the formation as well.</p><p></p><p>"It's useless!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor could see that it only slightly delayed the speed at which the catastrophe descended.</p><p></p><p>That invisible, unknown formation was still in the process of preparing to descend.</p><p></p><p>The instinctive warning from his own spiritual perception made the Holy Emperor start to feel inexplicably frightened. Suppressing the uneasiness in his heart, the Holy Emperor's thoughts turned rapidly, and he finally decided to ignore the Heavenly Doctor's golden needles for now and reluctantly return to the Mysterious Yellow Realm first.</p><p></p><p>"Find the Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable!" The Holy Emperor's voice spread everywhere.</p><p></p><p>At present, the Mysterious Yellow Realm was filled with golden needles. The vast majority of living beings had fallen into slumber.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Yang, who had previously blocked the Dharma Transmitter, had a body that was already badly damaged.</p><p></p><p>But he had always firmly stood in front of the Dharma Transmitting Venerable.</p><p></p><p>However, the Dharma Transmitter had also slowly become aware of the impending crisis facing the Mysterious Yellow Realm, and his hand movements gradually stopped. Otherwise, the immortal puppet body of Sun Yang might have been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The vast divine sense swept over the Mysterious Yellow Realm again and again, but could not find any trace of that Grand Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Ruo Mu! Earth Veins! Stone Tablet!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor tried to communicate with these few through the connection of the Source Power Essence Web.</p><p></p><p>However, they all seemed to have collectively disappeared, and none of them responded.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Realm before his eyes was like a pot of water that was slowly being brought to a boil.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor could only watch helplessly as all this happened, but could not find the source of the heat that was boiling the water.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the phantom of the Dharma Transmitter suddenly appeared, dispelling all the clouds. With the Dharma Heavens and Earth, he looked down upon the Mysterious Yellow Realm. His gaze was like a torch, sweeping back and forth.</p><p></p><p>This strange scene was the result of the Dharma Transmitter and the Venerable joining forces to search the heavens and inspect the earth.</p><p></p><p>They sought to find the whereabouts of the mastermind behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>But an unbelievable scene occurred.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme cultivators of the starry sea joined hands, and after a full half-day passed, they still could not find any clues.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it did not exist at all.</p><p></p><p>While the three strongest experts of the starry sea gathered but were at a loss...</p><p></p><p>Beneath Tongyuan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The secret room that was originally only one zhang in size had now transformed into an endless void.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the void was where the original ritual to enter the Fallen Immortal Realm took place. It was now shrouded in an indescribably mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>It was the existence that drove all cultivators mad upon seeing it: the power of the Immortal Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Immortal Spirit, like a gentle stream or fine threads of light, surrounded the ritual in a circle.</p><p></p><p>It opened up an endless void.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable, whom the Dharma Transmitter, Holy Emperor, and Heavenly Doctor were desperately searching for, as well as the mastermind behind all the turmoil, was right here!</p><p></p><p>Let alone Li Fan here, who was merely a clone. Even if Li Fan himself were present, with his current strength, he would not be able to manipulate the power of the Immortal Spirit.</p><p></p><p>He could not even touch or comprehend it, at most he could only look at the plum blossom to quench his thirst.</p><p></p><p>As for why the power of the Immortal Spirit was able to be integrated into the Immortal Formation deduced by the Final Separation Disk...</p><p></p><p>In the void, Sun Tianci still maintained the posture he had before entering the Fallen Immortal Realm trial.</p><p></p><p>On his body, two completely opposite auras, one sacred and one filled with demonic energy, surged simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Although the intensity of the sacred aura far surpassed the gloomy demonic energy...</p><p></p><p>Faced with the relentless pursuit of the surging demonic energy, the sacred aura only kept retreating. Even if it could completely sweep away the entangled demonic energy with just a slight outburst, Sun Tianci never did so.</p><p></p><p>His brows were tightly knitted, and his face showed a sorrowful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I left a backup plan before..."</p><p></p><p>Sensing his released Wu Ninglu causing a commotion in Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, Li Fan coldly snorted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Countless demonic thoughts constantly gnawed at Sun Tianci. At the same time, they all let out vicious curses and roars.</p><p></p><p>"Not only did you snatch away the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth that I was supposed to merge with, but you also watched me die with your own eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"What a good son you are to your mother!"</p><p></p><p>"Everything you have now was snatched from me! You shouldn't have survived from the very beginning!"</p><p></p><p>"Come on! Continue to kill me! Let me completely disperse my soul!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with his mother's revenge, Sun Tianci chose to endure it silently.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could sense that his mother was devouring his power, but this was exactly what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>In Sun Tianci's perception, although Wu Ninglu had split into countless demonic thoughts, they were all just chaotic consciousnesses filled with madness and destructive intentions. If he, the main object supporting her desire for revenge, ceased to exist, it would not take long for these demonic thoughts to completely dissipate into the world.</p><p></p><p>And if that happened...</p><p></p><p>From now on, Sun Tianci would truly never see his mother again.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci, who had memories from a young age and personally witnessed how he "killed" his biological mother on the day of his birth, had always felt guilty. This time, he was prepared to save her.</p><p></p><p>In Sun Tianci's perception, as those demonic thoughts devoured more of his energy, the degree of chaos was slowly decreasing. As long as he continued to feed them more, he could eventually make his mother completely calm down.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was cutting his own flesh to feed his mother, but it was far from being that exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>After all, the power of a Grand Venerable was like a vast ocean, boundless and endless.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, the countless demonic thoughts of his mother were nothing more than a group of fish swimming in the sea.</p><p></p><p>However, it would take some time for Sun Tianci to complete this feeding process.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci was naturally aware of all the changes happening in the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>That Destined Holy Emperor, the Dharma Transmitting Venerable, and the countless golden needles that appeared last, made even Sun Tianci, the newly succeeded Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable, feel very troubled. However, it was his responsibility to save the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, it was a bit difficult for him to carry out alone.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately, he had the help of his master.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing one trial after another in the Fallen Immortal Realm, trials based on the stories he had heard since childhood...</p><p></p><p>And after seeing his master's true appearance before sending him into the Fallen Immortal Realm...</p><p></p><p>How could Sun Tianci not understand the true identity of his extremely mysterious master?</p><p></p><p>It was the remnant will left behind by the previous Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable, Su Bai, after his fall.</p><p></p><p>Attached to himself for the purpose of saving the Mysterious Yellow Realm in the unseen future.</p><p></p><p>Although his master did not explicitly say the above, Sun Tianci himself could deduce this conclusion based on many details when interacting with his master on a daily basis, as well as his experience of inheriting the Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable in the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from the previous Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable, who else could be so clear about the details and even the answers to the inheritance trial?</p><p></p><p>He had just succeeded, and a large amount of complex memories flooded his mind, which he had not yet sorted out.</p><p></p><p>But his master was already able to skillfully use the power of the Immortal Spirit to set up the formation...</p><p></p><p>The words his master had said to him just now involuntarily surfaced in Sun Tianci's mind.</p><p></p><p>That was when he had successfully inherited the position of Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable and awakened from the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>His master looked at him with a gratified expression: "You indeed did not disappoint your master, good child."</p><p></p><p>Then, he solemnly instructed: "After ten thousand years, the Mysterious Yellow Realm is no longer the Mysterious Yellow Realm it once was. Since the Immortal Path is severed and the Immortal Realm no longer exists, from now on, the Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable should only be the Grand Venerable of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, not the Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable of the Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Now, as the only pure land in the starry sea, everyone outside covets the Mysterious Yellow Realm. Since you have succeeded, you must shoulder the responsibility of the Grand Venerable and protect the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter, the Heavenly Doctor, the Mysterious Immortal Boat... I'm afraid only that Holy Emperor will stand with us."</p><p></p><p>"The time left for us is too short, and you have just succeeded after all. I'm afraid you won't be able to deal with the Dharma Transmitter even if you try your best..."</p><p></p><p>"The only chance to turn the tables lies in the ancient protective formation of the realm!"</p><p></p><p>Some vague memories suddenly surfaced in Sun Tianci's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you mean..."</p><p></p><p>"After succeeding as the Grand Venerable, one should simultaneously inherit the power of the Immortal Spirit left behind after detonating the Immortal Artifact?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Sun Tianci nodded.</p><p></p><p>His master was just a remnant soul, and so many years had passed. It was normal for his memory to be somewhat lacking. Being able to know about the Grand Venerable's legacy further proved his identity.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Sun Tianci's affirmative answer, Li Fan looked at the Mysterious Yellow Realm on the ground, his eyes flashing: "The protective formation of the realm has been abandoned for ten thousand years. During this period, it has also undergone repairs by the Mysterious Heaven Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"But even so, as long as it is activated, it can successfully keep these invaders at bay. It's even possible to kill them."</p><p></p><p>"We only need to use a small amount of that Immortal Spirit power, like this and that..."</p><p></p><p>The formation traces and images Sun Tianci obtained from Li Fan evoked some of the memories he inherited.</p><p></p><p>The formation traces and images almost completely matched, but just as his master said, with the passage of time, some slight changes had occurred.</p><p></p><p>The profundity of the Immortal Formation was boundless, and Sun Tianci, who had just successfully succeeded as the Mysterious Yellow Grand Venerable, was not yet fully proficient in it.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this Dharma Transmitting Venerable was no weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>If he did not use those few Immortal Artifacts...</p><p></p><p>But within the Mysterious Yellow Realm, the Immortal Artifacts could not be easily used.</p><p></p><p>Especially since he was not yet familiar with the use of the four Immortal Artifacts left behind by the previous Grand Venerable. If he was not careful and caused harm to the Mysterious Yellow Realm...</p><p></p><p>That would be the greatest sin.</p><p></p><p>The situation was urgent, and Sun Tianci listened to his master's suggestion, deciding to activate the ancient protective formation of the realm to deal with the Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>With almost complete trust in his master, and his own lack of proficiency in formations...</p><p></p><p>Whatever Li Fan said, Sun Tianci did.</p><p></p><p>Originally, everything progressed very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the formation was about to take initial shape, his mother, who had already fallen, suddenly appeared in Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness for some unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into countless demonic souls, burning with the fire of revenge, she instantly overwhelmed Sun Tianci's mind.</p><p></p><p>That familiar, extremely intimate aura, the face that only existed in memories and dreams, had now turned into a vengeful ghost seeking his life.</p><p></p><p>It instantly threw Sun Tianci's mind into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to have noticed Sun Tianci's abnormality and hurriedly transmitted a solemn warning: "This is where your own karma and defilements lie, and you still need to resolve them yourself with care."</p><p></p><p>"Although you were born merged with the Dao back then, you owed a blood debt because of it. The resulting inner uneasiness and fear cannot be quelled even with the Immortal Heart Mantra."</p><p></p><p>"It has always been hidden deep within your heart, accompanying you as you grew up. When you succeeded as the Grand Venerable and inherited the vast power, she also transformed because of it and finally manifested. However, for you, this is also a rare opportunity. As long as you can resolve this inner demon this time, from now on, there will be no more flaws..."</p><p></p><p>While quickly reminding Sun Tianci, Li Fan said, "As for the changes in the formation, just continue to do as I say. You focus on dealing with your own..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation of Body and Mind</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Sun Tianci, after all, was just a child not even ten years old. </p><p></p><p>Although a coincidental opportunity allowed him to successfully inherit the position of Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate,</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing his birth mother whom he had been thinking about day and night, he inevitably fell into great emotional turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's continuous teachings and training over the years also made Sun Tianci subconsciously obey his orders.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying celestial formation based on the Xuanhuang Realm Protecting Great Formation slowly took shape.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci, who provided the celestial power, was still unaware.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's attention was diverted, his eyes showing a look of infatuation as he gazed at the celestial formation that was about to take shape.</p><p></p><p>There were no dark thoughts of killing or destruction in his heart, only a sigh of admiration for seeing the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"This is a true formation."</p><p></p><p>"What is deduced is ultimately slightly different from what is actually seen."</p><p></p><p>"I want to see if the likes of Chuanfa Celestial Physician can survive in this celestial formation..."</p><p></p><p>The so-called spilled water is hard to retrieve.</p><p></p><p>Once the formation of this great array was completed, even if Sun Tianci, as the "power source", discovered it and wanted to stop it, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>Only he, as the one who set up the formation, could make some subtle adjustments to the formation during the activation process.</p><p></p><p>But he could not reverse this process either.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed that Chuanfa and the others were still searching for his whereabouts in the Xuanhuang Realm, and he sneered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was ready to activate the great formation at any time.</p><p></p><p>After several fruitless searches, the Holy Emperor released the Dao-One spiritual energy he had swallowed back into the heaven and earth of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Pondering a solution.</p><p></p><p>The unease in the Holy Emperor's heart had already reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>As did Chuanfa Celestial Venerate.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it seemed that he had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa's figure disappeared for a brief moment, and then reappeared.</p><p></p><p>His face was solemn, and he held an ancient bronze mirror in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's pupils shrank slightly, and he sensed a faint aura of celestial spirit from this mirror.</p><p></p><p>"The main body of the Tianxuan Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa threw the Tianxuan Mirror high into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The ancient bronze mirror grew long with the wind, and in an instant, the illusory mirror body had already enveloped the entire Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The sky was no more, but a mirror surface covering everyone's heads.</p><p></p><p>Under the Tianxuan Mirror, even the Holy Emperor felt a sense of being completely exposed.</p><p></p><p>One black and one white, two lines. They intertwined and emitted from the surface of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Infinitely extending, instantly encompassing the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Then there was a continuous sweep of black and white lines.</p><p></p><p>The sweeping black and white lines merged into the heaven and earth of Xuanhuang. The scene of the Xuanhuang Realm also slowly appeared on the Tianxuan Mirror surface above.</p><p></p><p>Not only mountains, rivers, lakes and seas, but also the myriad beings within.</p><p></p><p>Only the Holy Emperor, Chuanfa and the others were not included.</p><p></p><p>However, as the black and white lines continued to sweep, the figure of the Holy Emperor also eventually slowly appeared in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor looked up at his blurry image in the mirror, and for some reason, he felt that the figure was still subtly different from his real self.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm seemed to have fallen into a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the search results of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Only the golden needles of the Celestial Physician did not stop. They traversed the great land of Xuanhuang, as if to thoroughly restore the Xuanhuang Realm to its state before the great war.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Tianxuan Mirror became clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>Numerous locations were excluded.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa had already begun to search the remaining areas.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor did the same.</p><p></p><p>The previous enemies, at this moment, once again achieved cooperation with tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>After all, regardless of whether it evolved towards the Xuanhuang Realm or the Tianfa Realm, the existence of the world under their feet was the premise of everything.</p><p></p><p>Just as the underground of Tongyuan State, where Li Fan was hiding, was about to be exposed.</p><p></p><p>A figure, however, quietly appeared outside the Daqi Small World without anyone noticing.</p><p></p><p>In the void, the Holy Emperor had set up layers of formations.</p><p></p><p>Inside, carefully placed and sealed by the Holy Emperor, were...</p><p></p><p>The remnants of the First Sect, wrapped in the annihilating wind disaster and the remains of the Great Master.</p><p></p><p>And, a faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>That figure was none other than another avatar of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Silently waiting for the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally waited for the chance.</p><p></p><p>"After careful planning for a long time, how can we be disturbed at the last critical moment."</p><p></p><p>"You should come back to me..."</p><p></p><p>Facing the obstruction of layers of formations, Li Fan's avatar directly ignored them all.</p><p></p><p>He directly flashed into the interior of the formations.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, the Holy Emperor's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He had already sensed the figure that had quietly appeared outside the Daqi Small World.</p><p></p><p>The inexplicable familiarity made him tremble with fear in his heart!</p><p></p><p>No longer caring about anything else, starlight pierced through the sky and descended directly into the Daqi of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Then he flew rapidly towards the outside of the void.</p><p></p><p>But it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>In the previous moment, Li Fan's avatar had already instantly solved all the formations.</p><p></p><p>The items arranged on both sides also gathered together because of this.</p><p></p><p>The avatar detonated, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>Using the last force of the avatar's explosion, he fiercely swept the faceless stone statue towards the remnants of the First Sect.</p><p></p><p>Just as the stone statue was about to collide with the remnants of the First Sect, the remnant of the avatar turned into a sharp sword.</p><p></p><p>It directly chopped towards the head of the faceless stone statue!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Although it looked like just an ordinary stone statue.</p><p></p><p>But when the avatar's sword collided with the stone statue, it was as if some power had descended in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It did not stop the desecration of the stone statue, seemingly only taking a casual glance from afar.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because of this action that it alarmed the one lurking in the remnants of the First Sect...</p><p></p><p>The existence that descended into the stone statue disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, the terrifying annihilating wind disaster did not stop because of this.</p><p></p><p>A storm slowly emerged from the void outside the Daqi Small World.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Holy Emperor arrived a step too late.</p><p></p><p>The storm had already engulfed the entire remnants of the First Sect, and the terrifyingly extreme energy fluctuations, even when blowing from afar, made this Taishang-level powerhouse feel endless crisis.</p><p></p><p>Just like a weak mortal facing a world-destroying catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing he could do but watch helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Sweat dripped from his forehead, and the Holy Emperor quickly came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Without any reservation, he mobilized all the golden source power, trying to stop the spread of this annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, countless Void Whales also appeared from the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>They cut off the void where the wind disaster was located from the Daqi of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The essence of source power, infinitely close to the power of true immortals, was no match for this annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>It collapsed upon contact.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor could not retreat, and could only continue to try to block the wind disaster with the essence of source power as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>A white light also blocked the spreading annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>The one who came wore a tall crown and long beard, holding a bronze mirror. It was none other than Chuanfa Celestial Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa's face was also unprecedentedly gloomy, no longer calm.</p><p></p><p>And the Tianxuan Mirror in his hand also flashed warnings, as if it had seen some extremely terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor transmitted the image he had just sensed of the remnants of the First Sect being triggered to Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa did not say much, but operated the Tianxuan Mirror and emitted ancient green lights, trying to block the annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>The two Taishang-level powerhouses worked together, but still could not completely block the annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying wind disaster seemed to be able to devour everything.</p><p></p><p>Even the void was its target of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Along the gaps in Chuanfa's holy law defense line, the wind disaster engulfed all existences like rolling tides.</p><p></p><p>Once the wind disaster erupted in the Xuanhuang Realm, all the living beings inside, including the Xuanhuang Realm itself, would probably be destroyed by this calamity from the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, several golden needles suddenly came from afar.</p><p></p><p>Like divine needles stabilizing the sea, they formed an impregnable embankment, firmly blocking the annihilating wind disaster that had slipped through the net!</p><p></p><p>The wind disaster howled, and the golden needles' light dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Soon the great embankment collapsed, and the wind disaster continued to roll forward.</p><p></p><p>But countless golden needles arrived one after another in front.</p><p></p><p>Forming a continuous wind-blocking great embankment, obstructing the path of the terrifying wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>An old man with compassionate eyes appeared in the void along with the arrival of the golden needles.</p><p></p><p>As if treating some difficult and complicated symptoms, the old man's expression was solemn, and he kept dropping needles.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he kept emitting rays of light into the annihilating wind disaster ahead.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor saw from afar that those rays of light seemed to be some extremely old objects.</p><p></p><p>The aura attached to them was desolate and cold.</p><p></p><p>After they fell into the wind disaster, they seemed to cause the wind disaster to gather and surround them.</p><p></p><p>Thus, several small vortexes were formed.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the vortexes absorbed most of the energy of the annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this terrifying calamity that erupted from the void outside the Daqi Small World showed signs of gradually weakening.</p><p></p><p>The compassionate old man did not show a relaxed expression because of this, but became even more cautious.</p><p></p><p>The golden needles under his hands did not stop, and kept shooting out.</p><p></p><p>Completely sealing those vortexes.</p><p></p><p>With a slight force in his hand, the wind disaster vortexes were captured by the old man along the golden threads.</p><p></p><p>His mouth opened slightly, and he actually directly swallowed the golden needle seal containing the annihilating wind disaster into his belly!</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa seemed to be accustomed to this.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor, however, showed a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the strength of this Celestial Physician was even greater than his and Chuanfa's.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Chuanfa and the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>One golden needle after another fell, slowly sealing and swallowing all the annihilating wind disaster into his belly.</p><p></p><p>Such an act was by no means an easy task for the Celestial Physician.</p><p></p><p>Every once in a while, he had to rest for a bit.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the joint efforts of the three Taishang-level powerhouses, they finally managed to eliminate this world-destroying calamity in its infancy.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the void that had become calm again, the Holy Emperor, who was somewhat exhausted, still had lingering fears.</p><p></p><p>If this annihilating disaster had erupted directly in the Xuanhuang Realm instead of in the void, they might not have been able to save it in time.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Emperor was pondering this, he suddenly realized that Chuanfa and the Celestial Physician, who had resolved the calamity, were still standing in the void with heavy expressions.</p><p></p><p>The direction they were staring at was not the Xuanhuang Realm, not where the Holy Emperor was.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>A faint phantom of a Daoist boy that appeared at some unknown time!</p><p></p><p>The Daoist boy had his eyes closed and stood still.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be no one else present in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But Chuanfa and the Celestial Physician were on high alert, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Tiandu Great Master?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the remains of the Great Master in the remnants of the First Sect, which had now completely disappeared in the annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly...</p><p></p><p>It actually led to the appearance of this legendary Tiandu Great Master!</p><p></p><p>The realm of the Great Master had already transcended the limit of the current starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Transcended the so-called Taishang.</p><p></p><p>With just a phantom standing, the Holy Emperor could not distinguish whether it was real or fake.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the expressions on the faces of Chuanfa and the Celestial Physician, they were also extremely shaken by the sudden appearance of this Great Master.</p><p></p><p>The Great Master did not move, and the three of them did not dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, they were at a standstill.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Emperor sensed that in the Xuanhuang Realm not far away, the progress of the formation's completion was still continuing.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Emperor decided to ignore the Great Master in front of him and return to the Xuanhuang Realm to continue searching for the mastermind behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly came out from the phantom of the Great Master.</p><p></p><p>The three Taishang-level powerhouses all had a solemn look and listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>"Dao, ancient. Xin, extinct."</p><p></p><p>"Practicing thought and cultivation, understanding meaning, towards the divine."</p><p></p><p>At first hearing, it seemed inexplicable and completely incomprehensible.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 755</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Just like the Patriarch of Transmitting Dharma cultivated inversely, from then on, all cultivators in the world were destined to be unable to surpass him."  </p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of Reincarnation, inverting the principles of life and death."</p><p></p><p>"And once a cultivator was revived by him, from then on they could never again reach the long-life realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai seemed to have an epiphany. </p><p></p><p>"However, for the vast majority of cultivators in the world, the long-life realm was an existence they could never hope for. Even if they knew about this, they probably wouldn't care much."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Bai seemed to remember something and slightly furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>He calculated the situation that would appear in the Xuanhuang Realm years later.</p><p></p><p>"Originally in the Xuanhuang Realm, cultivators were born from nature and nurtured by heaven and earth, naturally being born and perishing. As time passed, although the probability was extremely small, a new long-life patriarch would be born every period of time, even if that period was thousands or tens of thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"But now with the existence of the Reincarnation Ministry, the revived cultivators are gradually occupying the quotas of the naturally born cultivators, causing the number of heaven-born, earth-nurtured cultivators to become fewer and fewer."</p><p></p><p>"And the probability of reaching the long-life realm, which was already extremely low, will become rarer and rarer."</p><p></p><p>"Until eventually..."</p><p>"There will be no more new long-life realm cultivators born in the world."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stroked his chin: "The Xuanhuang Realm's path to extinction. Walk your own path, and then let the people of the world have no path to walk."</p><p></p><p>"Such an overbearing way of doing things is quite in line with the style of the Patriarch of Transmitting Dharma."</p><p></p><p>"However, for the current long-life patriarchs, this is actually a good thing. This may also be the reason why those few elders of the Five Elders Assembly did not come forward to stop the Patriarch of Reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After all, not every small world would have a terrifying figure like the White-Browed Elder presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>The minor setbacks encountered by the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance during their expedition were quickly forgotten. Occasionally they met small worlds with frenzied resistance, but with the help of allies, they quickly suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>Fifty, one hundred, one hundred and thirty-six...</p><p>The number of small worlds explored increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai collected the scenes from the conquest process of these small worlds, as well as their current state, in the Celestial Profound Treasure Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the time was almost up, he made an appointment with Liu San to return to the Empire Small World together.</p><p></p><p>Shielding the perception of the Celestial Profound Treasure Mirror, the two entered one after another, converging in the dark void.</p><p></p><p>Having notified each other of the precautions in advance, Liu San had also changed his appearance, and the two kept flying through the void.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be a branch of the Beast Taming Sect, truly quite rare." Upon arriving outside the Empire, his divine sense scanned below.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the countless strange beasts, Liu San couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a branch of the Beast Taming Sect. The true teachings of the Beast Taming Sect seem to be hiding in the Spiritual Void Realm now. After thousands of years, who knows what it has become."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai casually transmitted his voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Void Realm, it seems I've heard of it somewhere before?" Liu San was slightly dazed.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Liu San shook his head slightly: "Strange, I can't seem to remember. Could it be that I've become so old?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter, since the Immortal Alliance is sweeping through all realms, they will eventually be exposed. Did you have any acquaintances from the Beast Taming Sect back in Liu Lao's day?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, however, Li Fan in the Long Life Valley suddenly felt a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>He hadn't felt this way for a long time.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This kind of incident had occurred, and Li Fan dared not be careless.</p><p>He stopped the act of feeding the separation disc with formation data, his expression grave, and his mind's eye turned the stone crystal to the extreme, pondering the source of this sense of crisis.</p><p>Not long after, he obtained a possible answer.</p><p>As a Dao Ancestor, Liu San should not have forgotten the events that had happened to him. Even if he could not recall it by chance, after a thorough spiritual consciousness examination, he should have been able to remember it.</p><p>But this was precisely what had happened.</p><p>"It's because the memories in his mind related to the Spirit Void Realm have been modified by someone."</p><p>"The only ones capable of silently modifying the spiritual consciousness of a Dao Ancestor are those at the Immortal Realm. Liu San had never encountered any Immortal Realm experts in his lifetime."</p><p>"So the problem lies in the [True Temptation Fruit] I used on him back then."</p><p>Pondering the content of the memory alteration he had done to Liu San, Li Fan suddenly realized: "The Spirit Void Realm must be the one that Liu Yihang, the true junior patriarch of the Medicinal King Sect, had mentioned in their conversation."</p><p>As a precaution, Li Fan had not killed Liu Yihang at the time.</p><p>Instead, he had hidden him in a nondescript room within the Medicinal King True Cauldron that only Li Fan himself could open.</p><p>Liu Yihang was still in a coma within the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation.</p><p>At this moment, the three Elders of the Medicinal King Sect were not present, and Li Fan had no worries about his actions.</p><p>He released Liu Yihang from the Medicinal King True Cauldron and absorbed him into his own Immortal Abode.</p><p>Without the effect of the formation, Liu Yihang slowly regained consciousness.</p><p>But in an instant, he realized that something was wrong with his situation.</p><p>He was not in control, and he could not even make a sound.</p><p>His expression changed drastically, and he struggled in vain.</p><p>Within his own Immortal Abode, Li Fan did not even need to show his true self to suppress him.</p><p>Using the Soul Searching Technique, Li Fan easily found the information about the Spirit Void Realm in his mind.</p><p>There was nothing special about it, just that Liu Yihang had occasionally seen the name of this realm while reading ancient texts.</p><p>This was because the Spirit Void Realm contained a plant called the Spirit Void Grass, which was an essential ingredient for refining the [Essence Spirit Pill].</p><p>The person involved might have long forgotten this, but it had led to an unexpected disaster thousands of years later.</p><p>Originally, Liu Yihang could have continued to sleep in the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation for several more decades.</p><p>Having understood the origin of the matter, Li Fan did not feel guilty about his actions.</p><p>He continued to suppress Liu Yihang in the Immortal Abode while his clone, Xu Bai, interrupted Liu San's thoughts: "I remember that I once saw a secret record that recorded the method of refining the Essence Spirit Pill."</p><p>"One of the main ingredients, the Spirit Void Grass, seems to be growing in the Spirit Void Realm. I even asked you about it back then, Elder Liu."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San's expression first became a bit confused, and then he suddenly slapped his forehead: "Oh, how could I have forgotten about that! I almost forgot!"</p><p>With the doubt in his heart resolved, Liu San then turned his attention back to the miniature world of the Empire below.</p><p>Together with Xu Bai, he flew to the front of the High Tower Palace.</p><p>The powerful spiritual consciousness of the Dao Ancestor had already alarmed the Little Blue.</p><p>She and the Imperial Princess, as well as another woman in red clothes, flew up to greet them.</p><p>"This is our Alliance's Elder Liu!" Xu Bai said solemnly.</p><p>The three of them paid their respects to Liu San.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 472</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But his lips moved slightly and he looked at the stern-faced Li Fan, ultimately still refraining from speaking.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Zhao Wen, who was inherently simple-minded, didn't overthink it. After the initial shock, his eyes were filled with pure admiration.</p><p></p><p>And so, the cultivation journey of the group of little kids was tentatively set.</p><p></p><p>Except for Su Xiaomei who was still in swaddling clothes.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Xiaomei was gifted, she was still too young at the moment.</p><p></p><p>In the stage of babbling language, there was no hope for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But with the many spiritual items purchased by Li Fan to protect them and the care provided by Xiao Heng and Su Changyu, there was no need to worry about her physical condition.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was growing even faster than in the previous lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, as the training journey of these little ones gradually began to move towards a more regular path, Li Fan once again gathered them together.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know where you are currently?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>After several days of familiarity, the children had become less reserved than before.</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivation world!" they eagerly answered.</p><p></p><p>"Correct," Li Fan nodded, "But do you know that your ancestors were originally people from this cultivation world?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, were our ancestors once immortals?" the little kids asked with wide eyes, speaking all at once.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan went on to tell them about the ancient times when their ancestors were forced to leave their homeland due to being burdened with a mix of immortal and mortal contamination.</p><p></p><p>"They were just more powerful humans, relying on their own strength to act willfully. They treated their former peers in such a cruel manner."</p><p></p><p>"Why should they be able to monopolize this vast and spiritually abundant world, while you, from generation to generation, have to stay in such a small world that not only lacks spiritual energy but also holds the danger of destruction?"</p><p></p><p>"It's because you are not strong enough!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned the crowd, using the power of the exquisite heart with seven apertures, and slowly enticed them.</p><p></p><p>"When you become strong enough, this world will respect and accept your opinions!"</p><p></p><p>"All the people from the small worlds should unite!"</p><p></p><p>"Regain everything that was lost by your own hands!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With each stirring slogan shouted out, the children present became indignant and eager to strike back at the cultivation world in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we also need to face the gap between us and the cultivation world. Not only is our overall strength too weak, but also the number of cultivators is far less."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>"Endure, bide your time!"</p><p></p><p>"Seek fresh blood to strengthen our organization!"</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, the conversation between Li Fan and the children had already transitioned from "you" to "us."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since we left home, and I know some of you are missing your parents," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay; I'm not an inconsiderate person."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed to Tian Yang who stood quietly on the side, saying, "As long as you succeed in your cultivation and can defeat him, I will allow you to return home."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, you will be granted the power to recruit personnel in your hometown and join our Multiverse Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, the children became excited one by one.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't want to master immortal arts and return to their hometown with great pomp?</p><p></p><p>Besides, this peculiar adult looked somewhat foolish and not particularly difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Seeing hope, their minds became more active, and their efforts in cultivation became even more diligent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly watched these future members of the Multiverse Alliance and couldn't help but nod.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't really expect to launch an attack on the cultivation world or overthrow the rule of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But the fruitful trade with the empire this time had inspired Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Through the name of the Multiverse Alliance, he could continue to contact those small worlds with unique power systems to profit from them.</p><p></p><p>The value of the same level of power in the small worlds and the cultivation world was unequal.</p><p></p><p>Take, for example, the one thousand Beast Soul Jewels - it required far more contributions to build a team with such combat power in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>But because the empire was detached from the cultivation world and urgently needed large contributions, this made it easy for Li Fan to gain a lot.</p><p></p><p>The empire was like this, and so were other small worlds.</p><p></p><p>However, since these sanctuaries and small worlds were all hidden and not visible in the world, it required a large number of people to establish contact with them.</p><p></p><p>So it was necessary to cultivate these children.</p><p></p><p>Quietly advising Tian Yang not to beat them too hard, as long as this group of kids had combat power equivalent to Golden Core cultivators, he let them win.</p><p></p><p>Leaving a traceless killing intent to monitor, Li Fan quietly returned to the Wandering Immortal Island.</p><p></p><p>During his absence, the Wandering Immortal Alliance appeared calm on the surface but was already seething with hidden currents.</p><p></p><p>After mobilizing a large number of cultivators, they also issued a call for talent.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator who had made a name for themselves in the field of formations could respond.</p><p></p><p>No need for a formal entrance examination, they could receive treatment equivalent to a Formation Master immediately.</p><p></p><p>And for those who performed exceptionally well, they could even receive rewards of top-tier cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the elites of the Wandering Immortal Alliance in the field of formations were eager to show off their skills.</p><p></p><p>Nearly all the Formation Masters in the world gathered at the headquarters of the Wandering Immortal Alliance, and such a massive display could not escape the Five Elders' notice.</p><p></p><p>On the borderlands, the Five Elders constantly launched provocations and probes.</p><p></p><p>Every now and then, there were reports of spies from the Five Elders exposed and executed.</p><p></p><p>Both sides were currently taking a cautious stance on the war. Under the eerie calm, it seemed like a huge storm was slowly brewing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>Setting up the Spirit Locking Formation ahead of time didn't need so many Formation Masters.</p><p></p><p>The deduction of the layout of the Spirit Locking Formation was not something a Formation Master at the Golden Core realm could participate in.</p><p></p><p>"Chief Lu, what are you planning again?" Li Fan's eyes flickered as he quickly browsed through recent events in the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, trying to find some clues.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, when he saw a seemingly ordinary piece of information, Li Fan's gaze suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Building cultivator Guo Yezhong unfortunately failed and died when attempting to break through to the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>"Guo Yezhong, how did this person die prematurely?"</p><p></p><p>For this cultivator who had earned first place in the construction of the Spirit Locking Formation in the previous life through points distribution, Li Fan had a deep impression of him.</p><p></p><p>Dying inexplicably in this life definitely meant something fishy behind it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan carefully investigated what Guo Yezhong had experienced before his death, to see if he could find any anomalies.</p><p></p><p>After days of effort, a huge amount of contributions poured out like money.</p>

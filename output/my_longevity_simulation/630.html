        <h1>Chapter 630</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Do you know, young master, if there is a similar stronghold for the Wanxian Alliance within the barrier of white mist?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly surprised, "Why do you say that, Lao Liu?"</p><p></p><p>Liu San stroked his beard and slowly said, "Previously, when I was controlling the Pu Xian Zhenzhou and shuttling through the vast white mist, I happened to glimpse some groups of strange practitioners from a distance."</p><p></p><p>"They had no protection, just exposed in the devouring white mist. They moved slowly, as if searching for something."</p><p></p><p>"What's even more bizarre is that from them, I couldn't feel any life force at all. I originally thought they had fallen and were just acting based on instinct. Just as I was about to approach for a closer look, one of them unexpectedly noticed my presence and turned around. At the same time, a divine sense also probed out."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, my main task was to find the Valley of Longevity. To avoid unnecessary trouble, I sent out a divine thought to show that I meant no harm, and then retreated voluntarily."</p><p></p><p>"The Valley of Longevity is hidden in the white mist. If we enter and exit from the Medicine King Sect in the future, we may still encounter that group of people. We need to plan ahead."</p><p></p><p>As Liu San narrated, Li Fan's expression gradually became serious.</p><p></p><p>"Practitioners in the white mist have no life force, yet they are not much different from normal practitioners?"</p><p></p><p>In almost an instant, Li Fan thought of the group of Wanxian Alliance practitioners who walked out of the white mist in the past life, living despite death.</p><p></p><p>"Is the theory of reversing life and death already successful now?" Li Fan immediately questioned Liu San in detail about the situation of those practitioners.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan's mind eased slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hazy and surreal, as if walking corpses. Despite showing signs of reborn life from the body, the actual reversal of life and death is still far off. But indeed, there are clear signs of life reborn from the corpses."</p><p></p><p>This profound saint, who subtly demonstrated the reversal of life and death under the world's radar, had an extremely mysterious identity.</p><p></p><p>Even in the previous life, up to the era of the resurgence of the Xuanyellow Union and the Tianmeng Reign, He never revealed himself.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, He had intentionally concealed His identity. For whatever purpose, He must not want to be disturbed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is indeed very bizarre. However, it has nothing to do with our Medicine King Sect as the Wanxian Alliance holds up the sky. If we encounter them again in the future, we'll just walk around them," Li Fan pondered for a while before instructing.</p><p></p><p>Finding Li Fan's words logical, Liu San nodded in agreement and did not dwell further.</p><p></p><p>"The current location of the Valley of Longevity is within the barrier of white mist at the border of Luoyan Province and Lieuying Province." Liu San took out a map and marked the location.</p><p></p><p>"About here. In the white mist, the sense of distance seems to be slightly off. But the general direction is unmistakable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at it and made a mental note.</p><p></p><p>"It's not too far from the Cloud Sea. We can transfer there at any time. Moreover, compared to the Cloud Sea, Luoyan Province is much more prosperous and better suited as the initial stepping stone for the rise of our Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>"However, to avoid arousing Zhuo Qing'ang's suspicion, the matters on the Cloud Sea side need to be handled slowly and cautiously," Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>"You make the decisions, young master. It's been so many years, a moment or two more doesn't matter. Besides, I have resealed the entrance to the Valley of Longevity with a secret technique, and outsiders will never notice it," Liu San nodded.</p><p></p><p>With this matter settled, Li Fan returned to the main topic and suggested having a spar.</p><p></p><p>Liu San became interested, "It seems the young master has gained something from practicing a new technique?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Lao Liu, you may not know, the Tianxuan Mirror of the Wanxian Alliance is truly an extraordinary artifact. It has various unimaginable powers, even helping me derive divine abilities. It's a pity that your cultivation is too high to conceal your origins; otherwise, you could experience it firsthand," Li Fan lamented with a tinge of regret.</p><p></p><p>"Even if there are many benefits, my life is already nearing its end. As long as you, the young master, can enjoy them, that's what matters!" Liu San replied nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Next, the two went to the Martial Hall of the Medicine King Sect and engaged in a sparring session.</p><p></p><p>Although it was called a spar, it was mainly Liu San accompanying Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even the extraordinary 'Breaking Heaven Heart Sword' would have a bit of a hard time harming Liu San, who had surpassed two major realms in the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, Liu San was full of praises for this divine skill.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you truly deserve to be the designated successor of our sect. The comprehension of such a profound divine skill is remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"One palm breaking the heavens, sword moving as desired. The lethality is astonishing and makes it difficult to guard against. If you break through to the Nascent Transformation Realm and face this divine skill, I might actually have a hard time dealing with it," Liu San remarked as he looked at a faint bloodstain on his left index finger.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, looking at his own "achievements," finally had a rough idea of the power of 'Breaking Heaven Heart Sword.'</p><p></p><p>He did not exert his full strength, only using the power of a Heaven Domain Realm.</p><p></p><p>If all the power of the Five Elements Heaven Domain were unleashed, the sudden burst of killing power would probably be more than ten times stronger.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it wouldn't be as simple as just leaving a scar.</p><p></p><p>"It's difficult to harm without causing death. After all, the strength gap between the Nascent Transformation and Foundation Establishment realms is not as small as that between Foundation Establishment and Core Formation," Li Fan comprehended.</p><p></p><p>For the following period, Li Fan had Liu San select some trustworthy individuals from the dormant practitioners of the Medicine King Sect and awaken them first.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Crimson Flame Burning Sea and the Great Calamity would arrive, and Li Fan's foundation in this place would be buried along with it.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to white-wash his identity again would not be so easy.</p><p></p><p>So, taking advantage of this last opportunity, he needed to quickly advance the progress of the induction of the Medicine King Sect's practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Liu San also understood that in the current environment where practicing together was prohibited, cultivating techniques, especially advanced ones, were hard to come by. Therefore, he was especially cautious in selecting personnel. However, he had never indulged in power struggles in his early years but focused on cultivation and alchemy under the guidance of Lao Li.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he did not have many close associates, and regarding the disciples of the Medicine King Sect, he only knew about their general conduct.</p><p></p><p>After some careful consideration, he even secretly approached Li Fan and proposed the idea of "forceful control."</p><p></p><p>Even though this idea was in Li Fan's favor, the groundwork still needed to be done.</p><p></p><p>He pretended to hesitate, keeping quiet.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Liu San couldn't help but advise, "Young master, remember that those with compassion should not control troops. The current situation is unique and does not allow any mistakes. Human hearts are diverse and hard to fathom. We can't expect everyone to be as dedicated as us, willing to give their all for the revival of the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>As if recalling something, Liu San sneered, "There are many rebellious individuals in the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Back thenâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>Liu San paused, "Now that the Wanxian Alliance is powerful, even more than the Ten Immortal Sects, who knows, upon waking up and witnessing the scene of the Wanxian Alliance, they might consider switching sides."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

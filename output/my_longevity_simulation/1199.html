            <p>Chapter 1197: A Thought Overturns Heaven and Earth</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai felt slightly relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to teach such a disciple, I suppose that mysterious Saint Emperor's actions won't be too unpredictable."</p><p></p><p>[Extreme Variables] are a special type among [Focus Variables].</p><p></p><p>Once they appear, they will have a subversive impact on the existing world.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they can completely overturn the future world deduced by the Huadao Shimu.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerate belonged to the [Extreme Variables].</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's memory seemed to return to the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Taiyan Sect's Grand Hall.</p><p></p><p>"I have already given a reply to the Dadao Sect. A mere Hedao cultivator is nothing to fear," said the previous generation's Taiyan Sect Master, who was also Chen Tianhai's master, Xingji Daoren, in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's expression was a bit anxious: "How can we hastily conclude like this? I feel that Dharma Transmission fellow has some indescribable strangeness about him. Why not observe a bit more?"</p><p></p><p>Xingji Daoren was a bit displeased: "The Huadao Shimu has already deduced over tens of millions of times, what problem could there be?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that so many Changsheng realm cultivators joining hands still can't capture him?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>The power difference between each major realm of cultivation was as vast as the heavens and earth, and the higher the realm, the more apparent this gap became.</p><p></p><p>A Golden Core might kill a Nascent Soul, but for a Hedao to slay a Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>It was rare since ancient times in the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this operation to capture the Dharma Transmitter was personally led by the Dadao Sect's Sect Master Fang Dingge.</p><p></p><p>It's said that when the time comes, there will be as many as six Changsheng realm experts making a move together.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Fang was extremely cautious in his actions. Even with such a vast difference between the two sides, he did not underestimate the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he strictly maintain secrecy, within the Ten Immortal Sects, only the sect masters and a few direct disciples were aware of this matter.</p><p></p><p>He even sent a message to Taiyan Sect, wanting to use the Huadao Shimu to calculate the possible variables that might appear in this operation.</p><p></p><p>With such prudence, Xingji Daoren found it really hard to understand.</p><p></p><p>But after all, he was the leader of Dadao Sect, so it wasn't good to not give him face. Xingji Daoren still used the Huadao Shimu to meticulously deduce all sorts of possibilities.</p><p></p><p>The results of over tens of millions of deductions all ended with the Dharma Transmitter being smoothly captured alive.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, the operation by the Ten Immortal Sects this time had almost no possibility of failure.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, Chen Tianhai still had a lingering, heavy unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had once disguised his identity and secretly approached to observe that Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerate.</p><p></p><p>This was before the Wanxian Alliance had drawn the attention of the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter himself seemed to be just a kind and benevolent old man.</p><p></p><p>But after personally witnessing the fanaticism in the eyes of those cultivators of the new method surrounding the Dharma Transmitter, Chen Tianhai felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What made his heart palpitate even more was that the Dharma Transmitter seemed to have noticed his secret peeping at that time, and glanced slightly in the direction where he was.</p><p></p><p>A simple, calm gaze, but like a nightmare, it would appear from time to time in Chen Tianhai's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was only after a long time had passed that the negative emotions caused by that one glance slowly faded for Chen Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>But it was awakened again by this sudden plan.</p><p></p><p>As the number one direct disciple of Taiyan Sect, Chen Tianhai had already stepped half a foot into the Hedao realm at a young age. He didn't believe that an ordinary Hedao cultivator could have such a terrifying impact on him.</p><p></p><p>Out of personal shame, Chen Tianhai did not clearly tell his master about the abnormality that happened to him. But he repeatedly emphasized the extraordinariness of that Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerate in front of his master.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, he was unable to change his master's attitude.</p><p></p><p>After leaving his master's place, the unease in Chen Tianhai's heart seemed to intensify.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had the idea to reactivate the Huadao Shimu (Stone Mother of Dao Transformation) and perform another deduction.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai was frightened by his own thought.</p><p></p><p>The Huadao Shimu was the supreme treasure of the Taiyan Sect, the foundation of the sect's establishment. It concerned the Dao paths of all current and even future Taiyan Sect cultivators. Only the Taiyan Sect's leader had the qualifications to use it.</p><p></p><p>Even though Chen Tianhai was the first true disciple, he could only observe from afar and not approach it without authorization.</p><p></p><p>Once the thought arose, it was difficult to suppress.</p><p></p><p>It even made Chen Tianhai somewhat absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he finally waited for an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>One of the Ten Sects, the "Wuding Prison," seemed to have encountered some trouble. They sent out a distress signal to the other immortal sects.</p><p></p><p>The Taishang, Tianjian, Yushou, and other sects were unable to spare any manpower due to their plans to capture the Dharma transmission.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this matter was handed over to Xingji Daoren to handle.</p><p></p><p>From Xingji's expression before his departure, it was clear that the changes occurring in Wuding Prison were not minor.</p><p></p><p>He handed over the sect affairs to Chen Tianhai and the various elders.</p><p></p><p>This gave Chen Tianhai an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After an intense mental struggle, Chen Tianhai ultimately failed to suppress the impulse in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without anyone's knowledge, he came before the Huadao Shimu.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed as his master said, and his master had even held back.</p><p></p><p>He deduced ten billion times, and the results were completely consistent.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, even after personally witnessing the deduction results, Chen Tianhai still felt a bit unconvinced.</p><p></p><p>He activated the Huadao Shimu once again.</p><p></p><p>The azure light flashed incessantly, and endless possibilities played out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ugh." A groan interrupted Chen Tianhai's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The connection with the Huadao Shimu was severed, and Sun Erlang had returned from the simulation to reality.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were tightly closed, seemingly still adapting.</p><p></p><p>The aura on his body was also undergoing drastic changes at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had instantly transformed from a sharp and outstanding young man into a calm and experienced master who had gone through hundreds of tribulations.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to Senior for the opportunity!" After a long time, Sun Erlang opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was tranquil and profound.</p><p></p><p>"What did Little Lang experience?" Chen Tianhai asked, feigning ignorance.</p><p></p><p>"In the era of the Ten Great Immortal Sects of ancient times, before the calamity descended, I was originally a mortal from a rural village. By a coincidence, I witnessed two Golden Core cultivators fighting and perishing together. Mustering my courage, I collected the resources from their corpses."</p><p></p><p>"After spending three years, I finally managed to open the storage rings left behind by the two Golden Core cultivators. From then on, I officially embarked on the path of cultivation..." Sun Erlang said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai knew that although Sun Erlang glossed over it in one sentence, in that simulated world, just the process of opening the two storage rings was quite thrilling.</p><p></p><p>The old friends of the two Golden Core cultivators came one after another to search for the whereabouts of their legacy.</p><p></p><p>Having a treasure trove but unable to enter. Taking a desperate gamble, exhausting all family wealth, he finally obtained a cultivation method that couldn't be more rudimentary. Stumbling along, he finally entered the Qi Refining realm and was able to use the resources in the storage rings.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang recounted his experiences in the simulated world, ultimately ending with reaching the peak of the Harmonious Dao realm and having no hope of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Tianhai had already witnessed the other party's experiences, he still listened with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for my momentary lapse back then, perhaps the current Xuanhuang Realm would still be like this," Chen Tianhai thought to himself.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 349</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao turned his head, glanced at Li Fan, and smiled: "It's useless to tell you now. You'll know when we get there."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit dangerous, you don't need to worry too much."</p><p></p><p>"With us old fellows around, nothing major will happen."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao was obviously very confident in himself and didn't take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>Since Ji Hongdao had said so, Li Fan naturally couldn't continue asking. He retreated to the side with Xue Mu.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the thin man Shangguan Shi, whom they had met once in the Huanyu Villa, also arrived on the boat with five others.</p><p></p><p>These five were not members of the previous group training. They wore the standard long robes of the Wanxian Alliance, had mature faces, and acted in a capable manner.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have been on this flying boat before and were very familiar with its structure.</p><p></p><p>After paying respects to Ji Hongdao, they walked straight into the cabin.</p><p></p><p>When they brushed past Li Fan and Xue Mu, they slightly nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu didn't react to their identities for a moment and stood there blankly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, greeted them in an equally familiar manner.</p><p></p><p>After their figures disappeared from sight, Xue Mu's serious inquiring voice transmission reached Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Li Fan, you seem to know them? May I ask what their identities are?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hurriedly shook his head: "I don't know them. But we are all members of the Wanxian Alliance, close like family. It's normal to greet each other when we meet, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu was instantly at a loss for words, not knowing how to refute for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the fat man Huangfu Song came to his rescue.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, don't just stand there. Almost everyone has arrived, and we'll probably set off soon." Huangfu Song glanced at Li Fan and snorted as he instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan acted like he was following the lead of his senior, trailing behind Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the cabin corridor, Li Fan discovered that many people had already gathered on this flying boat before.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that it wasn't just the formation masters from the Strategy Hall.</p><p></p><p>The faint bloody and murderous aura emanating from some cultivators in certain rooms let Li Fan know that this mission might not be as easy as Ji Hongdao had said.</p><p></p><p>The two followed Huangfu Song and sat down in an unoccupied guest cabin.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked Huangfu Song with a smile on his face: "Senior Huangfu, can you reveal what the objective of our mission is this time?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song looked at Li Fan with a half-smile: "You little guy, you know to be afraid now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan admitted frankly: "Junior's courage certainly can't compare to Senior's. After all, Senior even Dantai Tao and the others..."</p><p></p><p>"Stop! Stop!" Huangfu Song's expression changed slightly, "You little guy, how come you can't go three sentences without mentioning Dantai Tao."</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed, flashing a dangerous light, carefully examining Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Huangfu Song retracted the murderous intent in his heart, and a smile reappeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's fine to tell you. Dean Ji didn't tell you just because it's a long story and troublesome to explain."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song tapped the table in front of him casually, took a sip of the suddenly appearing, steaming spiritual tea, and then said with a solemn expression: "This trip, we are heading into the depths of the White Fog."</p><p></p><p>"The depths of the White Fog?" Li Fan and Xue Mu looked at each other, slightly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't show it. Imitating Huangfu Song, they lightly tapped the table, finished the piping hot spiritual tea in one gulp, and patiently listened to Huangfu Song's narration.</p><p></p><p>"You also know that there is the [White Fog Barrier] spanning across the world, dividing each state. Traveling in the white fog will consume one's lifespan. Even passing through transmission formations can't avoid it."</p><p></p><p>"So even for us cultivators, we are reluctant to move around frequently unless necessary."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, indicating agreement.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because of this reason that our understanding of the white fog is extremely limited."</p><p></p><p>"Most people think that the White Fog Barrier only exists on the original land, serving as a dividing line."</p><p></p><p>"But in fact..."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song chuckled: "The white fog is far more vast than we imagined."</p><p></p><p>"So if there's no urgent matter, don't get the urge to recklessly attempt to cross it with your physical body. Otherwise, you might get lost in the boundless white fog, and even Celestial Venerables can't save you."</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Xue Mu had heard of such a thing, and his expression became a bit tense and solemn.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a moment and wasn't fooled by Huangfu Song. He spoke up: "Although the number of cultivators who physically cross the White Fog Barrier each year is not large, it's definitely not small either."</p><p></p><p>"I suppose the vast areas within the White Fog Barrier that Senior mentioned are only a rare few."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if it were really as dangerous as Senior described, it would have been discovered long ago."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's words suddenly stopped, exposed by Li Fan, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>But he immediately retorted with a cold laugh: "Who knows how many cultivators have gone into the white fog and never returned, holding the same thoughts as you."</p><p></p><p>"If you're not afraid of death, you're welcome to boldly try."</p><p></p><p>"The number of currently identified lost domains, I can't disclose for now. But it definitely far exceeds your imagination, little guy."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan nod in agreement and no longer being stubborn, Huangfu Song felt refreshed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He then continued: "Our destination this time, [Chizha Abyss], is a lost domain discovered long ago."</p><p></p><p>"As the name suggests, it is an area that infinitely extends downward in space, unfathomably deep, with no end."</p><p></p><p>"Every once in a while, inexplicable cries of surprise, desperate howls, and dazed murmurs, among other sounds, are transmitted from the bottom of the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary cultivators and those with unstable minds, once lured by the sounds, at the very least will have their cultivation deviate and regress."</p><p></p><p>"At worst, they completely lose their minds and transform into monsters that only know how to kill."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song seemed to recall something, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Because this lost domain is too bizarre, once discovered, it was placed under key surveillance by the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"So the alliance was able to discover that the sounds coming from Chizha Abyss are getting louder and louder."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xue Mu couldn't help but exclaim: "Getting louder and louder?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song nodded: "Affected by this, the eternal immortal fortress established by the Wanxian Alliance outside Chizha Abyss has been forced to constantly relocate upward over the years."</p><p></p><p>"But in order to suppress the influence of the demonic sounds within the scope of Chizha Abyss, that eternal immortal fortress has nowhere to retreat to."</p><p></p><p>"So starting a hundred years ago, the alliance began attempting to use some special means to counter the demonic sounds coming from the bottom of the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"Special means? Could it be..." Li Fan suddenly thought of something and his heart stirred.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 911</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face was gloomy and he remained silent. </p><p></p><p>He immediately circulated the "Infinite Void Replenishing Technique", trying to repair the damage to his soul.</p><p></p><p>But to his great surprise, the Infinite Void Replenishing Technique, which was said to have "inexhaustible power and an indestructible soul", lost its restorative effect in the face of this withered and decayed soul!</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the hint of blackness in his soul seemed to be spreading, Li Fan's heart sank. He decisively chose to cut off this decayed part.</p><p></p><p>His head felt like it had been fiercely struck by a large hammer, and Li Fan was instantly seeing stars and feeling dizzy.</p><p></p><p>His face turned a little pale. In just that instant, at least half a year's worth of soul nourishing effects from the Infinite Void Replenishing Technique were erased!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood what had happened to him.</p><p></p><p>If the strength of the soul was quantified into specific values, then all the soul damage Li Fan had suffered before was just temporarily reducing this value. After circulating the Infinite Void Replenishing Technique, the value would return to its peak again.</p><p></p><p>But this soul decay of unknown origin was actually directly acting on the upper limit of the soul strength value!</p><p></p><p>Even if the Infinite Void Replenishing Technique could still patch things up, with the upper limit being cut down for no reason, it was helpless!</p><p></p><p>A hint of dangerous light flashed in Li Fan's eyes. His figure flickered as he instinctively distanced himself from the dead drunk Han Zhong in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This drunkard seemed to be completely unaware of what had happened, and was still talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly suppressing the murderous intent in his heart, Li Fan's eyes flashed and a waterfall suddenly appeared above Han Zhong's head.</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>Then it continuously poured down on Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Huh!" </p><p></p><p>Han Zhong was really very drunk. Only after being washed by the water for a long time did he slowly wake up.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the water column in the sky with some confusion, his face full of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Awake?" Then Li Fan's cold voice reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Han Zhong discover that an uninvited guest had appeared in his room at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>While reaching out to try to block the water flow, he slowly got up.</p><p></p><p>"You are..."</p><p></p><p>"Who I am is not important. What's important is that I'm very interested in what happened to you." Li Fan's gaze kept sweeping back and forth over Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong's heart instantly rose with a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the visitor did not seem to be a good person, Han Zhong did not dare to neglect him.</p><p></p><p>Cupping his hands very respectfully, he said, "Senior, just ask. I will definitely not hide anything I know and will speak without reservation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, "I just heard you say in your drunken dream that no one believes you..."</p><p></p><p>"What does this refer to?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Zhong's expression became a little strange.</p><p></p><p>"Actually it's a period of time for this junior..." </p><p></p><p>Han Zhong said somewhat uneasily.</p><p></p><p>After getting Li Fan's approval, he fell silent for a moment, seeming to be organizing his words.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he slowly say, "I don't know how many years ago, I did a stupid thing..."</p><p></p><p>With just the first sentence, he was interrupted by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, you don't know how many years ago?" Li Fan looked at the golden core cultivator in front of him who couldn't be more than a hundred years old at most, and frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong smiled bitterly, "Because, this junior really doesn't know how long it has been since I left the Xuanhuang Realm and then returned again. The people I knew have died, and even my original identity in the immortal alliance was erased because too much time had passed."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Heavenly Profound Mirror couldn't recognize me anymore. All the contribution points I had accumulated back then were gone."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan heard the other party mention "leaving the Xuanhuang Realm," his heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>And the "return" that followed made him certain that the culprit behind the abnormal spatial fluctuation was none other than Han Zhong, who was standing right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan curious about what had happened to the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Go on," he said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan didn't mock him, Han Zhong's spirits were lifted.</p><p></p><p>He casually picked up the wine jug beside him and took a swig.</p><p></p><p>Then he continued, "Back then, I was young and impetuous. I was skeptical of all authority."</p><p></p><p>"When I traveled to the Nine Mountains Prefecture, I was shocked by the sight of the nine mountains stretching across the land, preventing cultivators from flying. I also heard that using teleportation arrays in the Nine Mountains Prefecture carried great risks..."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I don't know what I was thinking. I just had to tempt fate and try it out."</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed as he suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>When he had looked up information about the Nine Mountains Prefecture before, Li Fan had come across a lost tale.</p><p></p><p>It was said that there was once an unlucky cultivator who, harboring a fluke mentality, insisted on trying to use a teleportation array in the Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he was directly teleported outside the Xuanhuang Realm and never returned.</p><p></p><p>"Are you that unlucky fellow who was said to have been teleported outside the Xuanhuang Realm?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong didn't expect that this senior had heard about his past deeds, and his old face instantly turned red.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed this junior. Back then, I was ignorant and arrogant, and I did do something foolish."</p><p></p><p>A hint of fear and confusion flashed in Han Zhong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Actually..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too sure about my location after leaving the Xuanhuang Realm either. It was as if I was enveloped by an invisible bubble, drifting and floating in the endless darkness."</p><p></p><p>"Most of the time, the outside world was an unchanging black. But occasionally, some distorted scenes would flash by quickly."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong shuddered, "At that time, I was on the verge of going insane. So I'm not sure if what I saw was really an illusion or not."</p><p></p><p>"So what exactly did you see?" Li Fan's tone was already a little impatient.</p><p></p><p>"I saw..." Han Zhong fell silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The expression on his face seemed to indicate that he was engaged in an intense mental struggle.</p><p></p><p>Then he lowered his voice and said tremblingly, "I think I saw the Venerable Transmitter of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>With that, he used the Water Mirror Technique to display the scene he had seen.</p><p></p><p>On the circular light screen was a boundless darkness.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light flashed.</p><p></p><p>It was so eye-catching in this darkness.</p><p></p><p>As it got closer, the golden light vaguely revealed a figure.</p><p></p><p>A head full of white hair, a long beard flowing. A solemn expression, imposing without anger.</p><p></p><p>And this person's appearance should be known to everyone in the Xuanhuang Realm and the Myriad Immortals Alliance!</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same as the stone statue of the Venerable Transmitter of the Dao that stood in every floating celestial city!</p><p></p><p>"He..."</p><p></p><p>"Should be the Transmitter, right?" Han Zhong asked somewhat uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the scene on the light screen and slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't surprised that the Transmitter would appear outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>What he was really concerned about...</p><p></p><p>was what was behind the Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>The Transmitter was flying through the endless void, and several golden chains extended from his body.</p>

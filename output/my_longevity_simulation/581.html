        <div class="content">
            <p>When Li Fan arrived near these five glowing clusters, the suction force from the outside world suddenly decreased significantly.</p><p></p><p>This also prevented him from completely disintegrating in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although Li Fan's body was reduced to half its original size, he still had all his limbs intact. It's just that his body shrank overall, making him look like a seven or eight-year-old child.</p><p></p><p>It was funny and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it did not affect his specific movements.</p><p></p><p>Quietly gazing at the flickering five-color clusters not far away, Li Fan did not rush to use his secret techniques to devour them.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>The roots of heaven and earth continuously wove energy and laws of the same attribute in the flashing lights below, separating and "weaving" on the five caves of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.</p><p></p><p>The newborn and weak caves also became increasingly perfect and resilient because of this.</p><p></p><p>"If this space is seen as a womb nurturing life, then the Five Elements Caves at this moment are like embryos that have just taken shape."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, now existing in a linear form, was much more sensitive to the fluctuations of the laws around him as compared to when he was in human form.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the initial formation process of the caves, a burst of insight flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, when the "Five Elements Great Cave" that had been moved out eventually perished due to the imbalance of the five elements, Li Fan had witnessed the terrifying scene of near-destruction in the black and white vortex.</p><p></p><p>Now witnessing the birth of the five elements, he found some similarities between the two circumstances.</p><p></p><p>"The cycle of creation and destruction..."</p><p></p><p>"Birth is the beginning of destruction, and destruction is the source of birth," Li Fan muttered to himself as if he had realized something.</p><p></p><p>"With the principle of the continuous generation of the five elements, I created a technique called [Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword] by utilizing the Mo Kill, and the Heaven's Execution methods."</p><p></p><p>"And this cycle of creation and destruction..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his thoughts reached their peak.</p><p></p><p>Without any external help, Li Fan seemed to have entered a state of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Standing motionless next to the five elemental clusters like a statue, made only of lines, he suddenly avoided the attack of particles flying towards the Five Elements Caves as if anticipating it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he instantly returned to his original state.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, he was still immersed in contemplation, unaware of all his actions.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the five-color clusters started to reveal more detailed and rich scenes within them â€“ the sea, molten lava, trees...</p><p></p><p>Various creations of the artificial five elements began to take shape within the caves.</p><p></p><p>Just like an embryo growing over ten months, turning from an indistinct mass into a recognizable form resembling a baby.</p><p></p><p>Various scenes began to unfold within the caves.</p><p></p><p>The glorious light covering the periphery of the caves also began to retract, converging back into the caves. After being absorbed like a natural supplement, the scenes within the caves began to change rapidly hundreds of times faster.</p><p></p><p>A rumbling sound grew faintly audible.</p><p></p><p>The caves themselves also began to "grow," expanding towards their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Continuously swelling until they touched other caves, they slowly came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>However, the force that caused them to grow still remained.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of compression rang out as the five caves merged with each other, forming a natural formation that was not easily distinguished.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Caves were about to take shape officially.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" At that moment, Li Fan finally came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>With a face purely made of lines, it was hard to discern any expression of joy. But evidently, he had gained a lot from this experience.</p><p></p><p>"That technique is not suitable to use here. I'll wait until I'm out!" he said to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's focus on getting the task done!"</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the scenes he missed due to his realization from the stone, Li Fan nodded to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I guessed it right. The Five Elements Caves have not completely separated from the [Roots of Heaven and Earth] yet."</p><p></p><p>"Just like a mother's natural instinct to protect her cub, as soon as I try to devour it, it will definitely trigger the full force of the Roots of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>"So, my only opportunity is for the Five Elements Caves to leave the mother's body but not arrive in the present world of the Spirit State and Void at that moment!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan understood this clearly in his mind, neither happy nor sad, waiting for that precise moment to arrive.</p><p></p><p>For another cultivator, facing an opportunity that would be regretted for a lifetime if missed would surely make them a little anxious no matter how outstanding their mental strength is.</p><p></p><p>However, for Li Fan with the [True Recognizing], it was just a routine attempt in the infinite attempts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there was no turmoil in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Like an excellent hunter, he patiently waited quietly for his prey.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>The various scenes within the distant caves seemed to be slowly becoming transparent.</p><p></p><p>In the [Roots of Heaven and Earth], there were only five interconnected circular outlines of the caves left, spanning across the space.</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Caves began to violently shake.</p><p></p><p>And along with it, the internal space of the [Roots of Heaven and Earth] was also shaking incessantly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the Five Elements Caves were about to break free from the mother's body and emerge.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's view, the crisscrossing lines became somewhat twisted.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>A sound like a broken string suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw that around the Five Elements Caves, it seemed like a line that was torn appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was fleeting, he was very sure it wasn't an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, a chain reaction ensued, and the sound of the fractures continued to echo.</p><p></p><p>Above the Five Elements Caves, numerous broken lines swayed in the wind, dissolving in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The shaking of the caves became even more intense.</p><p></p><p>"It's now!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan's body completely disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>The twisted, creeping lines, like numerous venomous snakes, surrounded the golden pill in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>And they rushed towards the position of the Five Elements Caves.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have alerted the [Roots of Heaven and Earth], as the dissolution speed of the fine lines in his body increased as he flew.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't stop Li Fan from getting closer step by step.</p><p></p><p>When the Five Elements Caves were finally about to completely leave the space of the [Roots of Heaven and Earth],</p><p></p><p>Cracks appeared on the golden pill in Li Fan's dantian.</p><p></p><p>It looked as if the pill was on the verge of breaking at any moment, but it remained condensed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, from the cracks, fierce "tentacles" emerged.</p><p></p><p>Like seeing delicious food, they eagerly rushed towards the Five Elements Caves that were close by.</p><p></p><p>These tentacles were also the "Roots of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Not referring to the beginning of creation at this place.</p><p></p><p>But the "Roots of Heaven and Earth" condensing inside cultivators' bodies according to the new laws of the Heavenly Deity.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

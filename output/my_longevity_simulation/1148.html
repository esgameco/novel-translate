            <p>Chapter 1146: Young Master Qing Xuan Shang</p><p></p><p>The First Emperor Beast had long led the demon beast tribes to flee the Xuan Huang Realm, while the Third Emperor Mo was deeply hidden within the Immortal Alliance headquarters, rarely seen by ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>However, they both appeared in the Fallen Immortal Realm's "Beast Taming Sect Incident", so one could go find them and ask for clarification.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Sun?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhang Xu's voice transmission interrupted Li Fan's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Attention returned to the Derivation Orb's guardian space, where the little loli was handling an urgent derivation task.</p><p></p><p>For no reason, she had an extra task, and she looked angry with a face full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>The task only required a joint Dao technique, but it had already taken three days and three nights and still hadn't been derived.</p><p></p><p>There was a high possibility that this little miss was using the opportunity to slack off.</p><p></p><p>In the derivation space, besides the three joint Dao guardians, there was also a young man dressed in blue.</p><p></p><p>Although his body was straight and motionless, one could still see the anxiety in his demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Considering that the level of this derivation task was quite high, if it was truly delayed it might cause some trouble. Guardian Zhang Xu then secretly voice transmitted, telling Li Fan to be the bad guy.</p><p></p><p>In any case, during this period of time, Li Fan's image in Derivation Orb's heart had already been classified as one of the most despicable people in the world.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to transform into a gong to remind her.</p><p></p><p>When that hourglass silently appeared above Derivation Orb's head, the little loli's face greatly changed, and the speed of the character light orbs' rotation instantly multiplied several times.</p><p></p><p>Before long, she derived the technique needed by the blue-clothed youth.</p><p></p><p>The youth expressed his endless gratitude and then hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"In such a hurry, it seems the Qing Xuan Army has encountered trouble." Zhang Xu sighed.</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly taking action to stop Derivation Orb's slacking off behavior many times, Li Fan also gradually became familiar with the other two joint Dao guardians.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu had entered over a hundred years earlier than Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As for the other one, named Hua Yue Ye, his name sounded a bit feminine, but he was an undoubtedly manly man.</p><p></p><p>Hating evil like an enemy, because he couldn't stand a Dharma transmitter's conduct, he actually fought with them on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The consequences were imaginable.</p><p></p><p>Although with the help of relatives and friends, he ultimately avoided death, he was still punished to guard Derivation Orb here for five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Now not even half that time had passed.</p><p></p><p>Originally when Li Fan first came, Hua Yue Ye was too lazy to even greet him. Now that they were familiar, he actually talked more than Zhang Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Although I really dislike Young Master Shang's bearing, guarding the demon abyss for hundreds of years without leaving a step, one can't help but admire him..."</p><p></p><p>"The Qing Xuan Army..."</p><p></p><p>In the two's casual chat, Li Fan also recalled the identity of that blue-clothed cultivator just now.</p><p></p><p>They had met once before, his name was Yan Huan.</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master's temper is even more stubborn than mine. Once he decides on something, I'm afraid even a Celestial Venerate couldn't pull him back. The abolished case that was rejected by both the Dharma transmitters and mirror holders, even after so many years he still shows no intention of giving up."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, watch your words!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Based on the bits and pieces in the two's chat, plus some secrets he had browsed before, Li Fan put the pieces together and restored a concealed past event of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Immortal Alliance had a popular proposition of "deeply entering the White Fog Labyrinth and expanding exploration".</p><p></p><p>It was a bit different from the Great Exploration Era Li Fan had experienced.</p><p></p><p>In that lifetime, the exploration the Heavenly Profound Mirror conducted for its sublimation was more like a challenge to</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Scanning the entire map within the white fog.</p><p></p><p>Identifying all the hidden domains and secret realms concealed within the white fog.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no in-depth exploration of the domains themselves.</p><p></p><p>The proposal that was rejected by the Dharma transmitters was to thoroughly clear out the domains.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the white fog barrier in the Xuanhuang Realm was too strange.</p><p></p><p>The domains within the white fog were even more bizarre, hiding who knows how many secrets.</p><p></p><p>Just from what Li Fan had encountered, there were world fragments destroyed by the Chaos Character Technique, the ice-sealed grand formation that reversed life and death, and the giant composed of countless corpses...</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the dangerous factors, Li Fan did not believe that the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance were not curious about the domains.</p><p></p><p>But this curiosity was very decisively suppressed by the high-level members of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"With the Dharma Transmitter dismembering and recreating the Xuanhuang Realm, coupled with the consistent behavior of the Immortal Alliance's high-level members, it is clear that the domains within this white fog are inextricably linked to Him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled that when he was in the white fog back then, he could always hear wailing and murmuring sounds similar to those of the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>And following the sense of the sounds, he would always discover unknown domains.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly had a guess.</p><p></p><p>"These domains, like the Congyu Sea and Luoyan Province, should also be remnants of the ancient Heavenly Dharma Realm. However, perhaps due to the influence of disasters such as the Chaos Character Technique, the surviving laws within them are even more distorted and chaotic. They are not suitable for direct integration with the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"So they were first hidden within the white fog. Hmm... perhaps there are also remnants of other cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter is waiting. Waiting for the moment when the Heavenly Dharma Realm successfully resurrects by borrowing a corpse."</p><p></p><p>After all, his attainments had not yet reached the level of the Dharma Transmitter, so Li Fan could not yet guess the specific use of these world fragments.</p><p></p><p>"However, this does give me some inspiration. Although the Dharma Transmitting Venerable seems to cover the sky with one hand, the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm still have doubts about the various upheavals brought about by His remaking of the world. Perhaps they can be induced to uncover the truth within."</p><p></p><p>Once this group of cultivators discovers the huge conspiracy that may involve the Dharma Transmitting Venerable behind this, whether they are willing or not, they have already become Li Fan's allied forces.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Shang, let's start with him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, hiding the faint light in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The ruins of the Heavenly Sword Sect, the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was sitting cross-legged beside the black sword, comprehending the myriad sword principles swirling around him.</p><p></p><p>Although he had once established his Dao foundation with the Heavenly Wonder Black Sword, at this moment, surrounded by countless swords inside the Sword Tomb, the Holy Fetus Li Fan still had new insights constantly emerging in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Wonder is the manifestation of the laws of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"The world changes, and the laws flow. They are not unchanging. The sword principles triggered by my collecting the black sword at different time points are also subtly different."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of the operation of the world had progressed further.</p><p></p><p>Feeling inspired, he let out a long whistle, and the thousands of swords on the ground also trembled incessantly.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of the myriad swords, the wooden sword left by Mr. Bai actually bent slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have a slight resonance with the Holy Fetus Li Fan's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's mouth opened slightly, and the black sword rose into the air, entering his abdomen and transforming into his own Dao foundation.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>There was another chapter I wanted to make up for around 1 o'clock, but my body had a problem, and my brain was rusty and turning very slowly.</p><p></p><p>Orz</p>

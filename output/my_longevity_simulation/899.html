        <h1>Chapter 899</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Although Li Taishi's mindset can be fickle at times, he has a good point - he doesn't care too much about saving face and knows how to correct his mistakes when he realizes them.</p><p></p><p>Since the foundation of the Xuantian Sect was somewhat beyond imagination, he decided to change his plan for now and not provoke them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan was about to use the Seven-Colored Divine Light to reseal this faceless deity statue.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was about to do this, his movements suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Because in that instant, it was as if this statue had come to life.</p><p></p><p>Even though this stone statue had no eyes, Li Fan very clearly felt that it "looked" at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but retreat a great distance, while at the same time preparing himself mentally.</p><p></p><p>After several moments passed and seeing that everything remained calm with no abnormalities occurring, Li Fan slowly approached again.</p><p></p><p>The faceless stone statue was the same as when he had placed it before. </p><p></p><p>It seemed the glance just now was only his illusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even reviewed the footage recorded by the Huadao Stone in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In it, the stone statue stood silently, like an ordinary object, with nothing special about it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I really saw wrong?" Li Fan was a bit doubtful.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he still ultimately decided not to keep this potential calamity around.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing the Seven-Colored Divine Light, he was about to seal and collect the faceless deity statue.</p><p></p><p>However, what happened next caused Li Fan's expression to greatly change.</p><p></p><p>Because, even though this stone statue was clearly right in front of his eyes, it was as if it didn't exist at all!</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Divine Light sealed nothing, returning empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He tried to touch the stone statue with his hand. </p><p></p><p>The cold sensation felt extremely real.</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan's mind moved slightly, wanting to lock onto it with his spiritual sense and store it in his storage space, </p><p></p><p>In his spiritual sense's perception, the space where the stone statue was located was empty, with nothing there.</p><p></p><p>He simply could not do it.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre scene had already somewhat exceeded Li Fan's understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Xuantian Wang's resentful spirit lingers on?" Li Fan's expression shifted between gloomy and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could be certain that before this, the stone statue had not undergone this kind of change,</p><p></p><p>Causing the statue to enter this special state of being there yet not there.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, it wasn't my misconception. Even the Huadao Stone cannot record it..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face instantly turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he finally understood what it meant for inviting a god in being easy but sending a god off being difficult.</p><p></p><p>This stone statue actually remained here, refusing to leave.</p><p></p><p>It truly seemed to have made its home in this Lingmu Realm at the headquarters of the Myriad Realms United Assembly.</p><p></p><p>The base he had painstakingly built now had an unremovable bomb planted in it. And to make matters worse, this bomb was one that Li Fan had personally placed down on a whim...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking about whether he should abandon this Lingmu Realm and start anew elsewhere,</p><p></p><p>"May the Benevolent Immortal of the Secular World bless our Dali Sect's exploration trip to the Fire Realm this time, praying that everything goes smoothly..."</p><p></p><p>A pleasant female voice suddenly appeared within this grand hall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart couldn't help but jump.</p><p></p><p>Looking all around, he did not discover the source of the voice.</p><p></p><p>But this prayer did not disappear, instead continuing on and on.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the voice of Su Yuqing who had left the realm, followed by the appearance of He Zhenghao, Kou Hong, Dao Xuanzi and others.</p><p></p><p>They came one after another in succession.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining for a while, Li Fan discovered that these voices actually appeared directly in his mind!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as long as he focused his attention on a certain voice,</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, the scene corresponding to that voice would...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The faces also appeared along with it.</p><p></p><p>As if he were there in person, Li Fan could feel the state of the supplicants.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a faint feeling in his heart that if he was willing, he could also respond to these supplicants.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>He never knew that he also had this ability that was almost completely consistent with the legendary gods.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked at the faceless statue standing quietly in the great hall, knowing in his heart that all of this must be its doing.</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning, I fabricated the story of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, using the faceless stone statue as a conduit to establish a connection between myself and the members of the Myriad Realms Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Thus, I was able to receive the feedback cultivation from their cultivation progress..."</p><p></p><p>"But that was the effect of the 'Sitting Immortal Technique', and it was limited to that."</p><p></p><p>"Now..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed, his expression extremely heavy.</p><p></p><p>Although there seemed to be no immediate crisis at the moment, he was already considering in his heart whether he should use the "Return to Reality" ability.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the principles behind it, it was very obvious that hidden behind this faceless statue, there must be a power far beyond Li Fan's understanding.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently recited "Return to Reality" in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The prompt for "Return to Reality" immediately popped up.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to virtualize the current scene and return to the anchor point?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene also became blurred.</p><p></p><p>"The use of 'Return to Reality' was not affected..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I'm willing, I can restart at any time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, but in the end, he chose no.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was influenced by some mysterious power and unable to make the decision to "Return to Reality".</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was because now, no danger had occurred, and he hadn't even figured out the source that led to all these abnormalities...</p><p></p><p>If he got scared and directly used "Return to Reality" just like that, it would be a bit too embarrassing!</p><p></p><p>"Even the true immortals in the Immortal Ruins, I have faced them before."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a stone statue..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly in his heart, forcing himself to calm down.</p><p></p><p>He focused his mind on the statue and the many voices that appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan discovered that the owners of these voices, without exception, were all those people in the Alliance who had sworn to the faceless statue in the name of the "Red Dust Compassionate Immortal".</p><p></p><p>It had nothing to do with the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal.</p><p></p><p>So, whether they were willing or not.</p><p></p><p>From now on, the faceless statue would appear in their minds from time to time.</p><p></p><p>And the more times they visualized it, the deeper the connection between them and the statue.</p><p></p><p>So, after breaking through a certain threshold, they would appear in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Xuantian Sect is called the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the Xuantian Sect disciples were all over the world. Could it be that the Xuantian King was also able to sense and know the status of his believers at any time, just like me?"</p><p></p><p>"That would truly be no different from a god."</p><p></p><p>"God..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred as he sensed the believer with the deepest connection in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Su Yuqing from the Separated Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although her talent was extraordinary, being the incarnation of the Separated Realm's Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>But limited by the environment and resources, she was now only at the early Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>In the resource-scarce Great Separation, all spiritual energy was produced by the "Immortal Spirit Tower".</p><p></p><p>For her to cultivate to this realm in a short period of time, she was definitely a heaven-defying genius.</p><p></p><p>Through the connection of the faceless stone statue, Li Fan sensed the state of Su Yuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was personally observing with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Every detail was clearly visible, nothing could hide.</p><p></p><p>"Even..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a feeling.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a small wisp of refined spiritual power that was enormous for Su Yuqing, but only a small amount for him.</p><p></p><p>Disappeared from Li Fan's body.</p>

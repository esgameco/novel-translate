        <h1>Chapter 486</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On the second day of practicing the cultivation method, he successfully broke through to the middle stage of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the pills fed to him by the immortal master, he also stirred a strand of hidden power within his body.</p><p></p><p>After strengthening his physical body, even Sun Erlang, who was in the later stage of Qi refining, was not a match for him in actual combat.</p><p></p><p>Having stabilized his position as the "Child King" on the island, Ye Feipeng finally felt a bit relieved.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also understood a truth: in order to progress faster in cultivation, besides one's own aptitude and effort, it's more important to please that immortal master.</p><p></p><p>From the immortal master's casual words, Ye Feipeng learned that the master seemed to value the progress of a certain cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, while cultivating, Ye Feipeng always carried the Beast God Pearl with him and diligently pondered over its mysteries.</p><p></p><p>One day, after falling asleep with the Beast God Pearl in his arms, he seemed to have a dream.</p><p></p><p>In his dream, he saw a fierce and terrifying nine-headed bird looming in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Its massive body almost occupied the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>Each of its nine heads was devouring something.</p><p></p><p>With Ye Feipeng's current experience, he recognized the struggling and twisted limbs of a dragon, a whole mountain range, and the branches of a deep gray giant tree...</p><p></p><p>All around was filled with the sounds of despair and agony, the world shrouded in blood.</p><p></p><p>The young mind of Ye Feipeng was deeply shocked by this apocalyptic scene.</p><p></p><p>Standing motionless and stunned, he suddenly felt as if he was about to be devoured by the monstrous bird.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he heard a clear and distant cry in his ears.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to come from the deep sea, yet also from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The cry was full of defiance and anger.</p><p></p><p>His eyes turned bloodshot, and Ye Feipeng, who was frozen in place, suddenly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Attracted by this mysterious cry, the nine heads of the bird in the sky all turned towards him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng woke up from the nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Breathing heavily, he wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and recalled the scene he had just seen in his dream.</p><p></p><p>"That nine-headed bird should be the exotic beast sealed in the Beast God Pearl."</p><p></p><p>"But what was the cry I heard later?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng's young face was filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>However, he was well aware that anything that could attract the attention of the nine-headed bird must be extremely unusual.</p><p></p><p>Not mentioning it to anyone else, Ye Feipeng simply stored this matter in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Ye Feipeng found that he became more proficient in practicing the "Creation Stove Technique." </p><p></p><p>The internal power hidden in his body that previously required cautious manipulation was now accessed effortlessly by him.</p><p></p><p>Even the side effects such as dizziness and sudden surges of energy were easily ignored by him.</p><p></p><p>As his physical strength rapidly improved at a rate that even scared himself, while Ye Feipeng was pleased, he also couldn't help but feel a bit of fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, during sparring with his companions, he did not exert his full strength.</p><p></p><p>Like a celestial puppet, he just defeated his opponents each time with just the right amount of force.</p><p></p><p>And so, some time passed.</p><p></p><p>One day, the immortal master visited the Island of the Corporeal Transformation again.</p><p></p><p>After checking everyone's progress with the cultivation as usual, the master singled out Xiaoheng, who was particularly negligent, and scolded and punished him severely.</p><p></p><p>The master then took Ye Feipeng alone to a secret chamber for inspection.</p><p></p><p>During the long silence, Ye Feipeng felt a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>In the end, unable to hold back, he told the immortal master about the sight he saw in his dream and the recent changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the immortal master decided to conduct a comprehensive examination on him.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Feipeng fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up, he found himself feeling a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>The immortal master handed him a pill, and after swallowing it, Ye Feipeng immediately felt more energized.</p><p></p><p>"You acted too hastily and inadvertently got tainted by the hostility of the nine-headed bird," said the immortal master in his extremely cold voice.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, I have expelled it from your body."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master," Ye Feipeng expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>The master waved his hand, "Although you were a bit reckless, you inadvertently awakened a trace of the thin ancestral bloodline within you."</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral bloodline?" Ye Feipeng was both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. Have you ever heard of the ancient exotic beast, Kunpeng?" pointing forward, the immortal master made a giant monster that alternated between bird and fish form appear in the air.</p><p></p><p>After narrating the strength of this Kunpeng exotic beast to Ye Feipeng, the master expressed some emotion, "I didn't expect that the power of such an ancient and fierce beast would exist inside you."</p><p></p><p>"If you can harness this power, your cultivation speed might exceed those so-called geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expression on Ye Feipeng's face, the master added, "However, everything has its pros and cons. A rapid increase in power can also have a significant impact on your character. If you cannot control it, it could be a curse rather than a blessing."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng quickly assured, "Master, rest assured, I will surely remember your teachings, not be arrogant, proceed systematically, and strive diligently in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Nodding slowly, the master seemed quite satisfied with his response.</p><p></p><p>After receiving a storage ring with spiritual stones and artifacts as a reward, Ye Feipeng left excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Watching Ye Feipeng's elated figure leaving, Li Fan showed a somewhat ambiguous expression.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the awakening speed of this kid's Kunpeng bloodline in this world to be even faster than I expected."</p><p></p><p>"The Nine-Headed Divine Bird..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out his right hand.</p><p></p><p>A strand of blood-red aura coiled around his fingertips, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Listening carefully, faint cries and wails seemed to be coming from it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan absorbed this red aura, closing his eyes to sense.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he abruptly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, a strange red color appeared on his pupil.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards the stone stool in the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>But in an instant, the once sturdy stone surface turned completely charred under Li Fan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the separation of the Nine-Headed Bird's beast soul was triggered by the aura of the Kunpeng bloodline within you."</p><p></p><p>"It appears to originate from the innate magical power of this Nine-Headed Bird. It's a pity that the aura is too weak, and I can only glean this much."</p><p></p><p>As the eerie red glow in his eyes disappeared, Li Fan felt a slight sense of regret.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have the legacy of Senior Zhang's Avatamsaka Body, I cannot utilize the power of monsters."</p><p></p><p>"But there are advantages to it. Perhaps the magical power of monsters can be used by cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The source of the Great Dao is the same, but the paths to cultivation are different."</p><p></p><p>"Just like Han Yi's method of controlling fortune seems to come from the Exalted Destiny Blackbird."</p>

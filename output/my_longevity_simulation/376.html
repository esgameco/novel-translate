        <div class="content">
            <p>Huang Fu Song didn't plan to let him off so easily, even though the two of them didn't actually have much interaction.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't stop him from acting like he was very familiar with Li Fan, being enthusiastic and cordial.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Huang Fu, how often do you usually see Chief Lu?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded in a few words, seeing that Huang Fu Song was going on and on, he interrupted and asked.</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song couldn't help but pause.</p><p></p><p>Awkwardly, he replied, "Chief Lu's status is extraordinary..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Li Fan meaningfully said, "In that case, a great opportunity is right in front of you. Senior Huang Fu, why not take the chance to make a good impression?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song was momentarily stunned, then he quickly came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed joyfully, "You're right, young friend. If I'm fortunate enough to catch Chief Lu's attention, the road to success will be right before my eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you can say that to me. But in front of others, it's better to be cautious," Li Fan reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, understood," Huang Fu Song nodded quickly.</p><p></p><p>After that, he hastily left the place to find opportunities to "perform."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan find some peace.</p><p></p><p>The news of Chief Lu's whereabouts in advance was naturally through secret communication from Lu Xuejing.</p><p></p><p>But that was all.</p><p></p><p>He didn't ask her to do more..RowStyles like 69ùò¥ùò©ùò∂ùòπ.ùò§ùò∞ùòÆ</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Li Fan was suddenly feeling generous, but he deeply understood that in front of a top powerhouse like Chief Lu, any slight abnormality in behavior could be detected.</p><p></p><p>The Fisherman's methods were indeed mysterious, but whether they could elude the scrutiny of the top forces of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Involving his own safety, Li Fan naturally had to be extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>The so-called arrangement was not even a consideration.</p><p></p><p>With his Golden Core cultivation, trying to scheme against a Dao Saint like He Hua Immortal was simply seeking death. Li Fan wouldn't be foolish to that extent.</p><p></p><p>What he did was merely creating an opportunity to "accidentally" meet Chief Lu.</p><p></p><p>As for what would happen after their meeting, as Li Fan had said before.</p><p></p><p>Whether it succeeds or not, it's all up to fate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Since learning of Chief Lu's upcoming inspection, the atmosphere in the entire Hua Ling Gorge had suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Not a single person could be seen idling around.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator was in a hurry, with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>Even Huang Fu Song, who had always been a bit lazy, was unprecedentedly busy.</p><p></p><p>Not being dull-witted, the various cultivators who had come with Huang Fu Song immediately guessed that a big shot might be coming to inspect. Join us at new 69ùò¥ùò©ùò∂ùòπ.ùò§ùò∞ùòÆ</p><p></p><p>As a result, they volunteered to help out.</p><p></p><p>Having gained a group of elite helpers for no reason, the thin and elite man named Dongfang naturally did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Hua Ling Gorge, without a specific way to deal with it, even cultivators found it difficult to move an inch.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Dongfang urgently requested a batch of "Spirit Pearls" to allow Li Fan and the others to move freely.</p><p></p><p>"These were brought by Senior Dongfang Yao and are allocated to all of you," said a seven or eight-year-old child in a black and white Daoist robe, looking bright and clear.</p><p></p><p>He took out a white jade bottle from his bosom and distributed colorful and chaotic round beads from it to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Swallow them and place them in your Dantian. You will be able to feel the flow of spiritual energy again." Although the child looked very young, he was quite experienced in explaining the use of Spirit Pearls and the precautions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held the colorful Spirit Pearl in his hand, observed it for a moment, but couldn't see any peculiarities.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>As the Spirit Pearl entered his abdomen, various colored lights surged from it, spreading throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>Like a catalyst, it activated the dormant spiritual energy in his body.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy that had been suppressed by the Hua Ling Gorge also recovered its vitality in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Though there was still a gap compared to the external environment, it was barely enough to support their daily work.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than saying it releases the suppressed state, it's more like a catalyst that enhances the efficacy of spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"Thus partially offsetting the deadening effect of the Hua Ling Gorge."</p><p></p><p>"In this case, if we were to use these 'Spirit Pearls' in a regular area outside, wouldn't it..." Just as he was thinking, he heard the child in front of him say, "The effect of the Spirit Pearls will last for thirty days. Everyone must pay attention to its expiration date."</p><p></p><p>"There was once a cultivator who was too immersed in his work, forgot about the duration. After the effect expired, his spiritual power depleted, and he fell from the sky and died directly."</p><p></p><p>"If you no longer want to use it halfway, you can circulate your spiritual power and spit out the remaining Spirit Pearls from your body."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, all the cultivators nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Also, one more thing. Before leaving the Hua Ling Gorge, either wait for the complete expiration of the Spirit Pearls' effect, or directly spit them out."</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget. Otherwise, there is a risk of spiritual energy explosion. Of course, if you have a robust constitution like Senior Dongfang Yao, you won't fear the disturbance of spiritual energy. Then, consider my words unsaid."</p><p></p><p>The child explained every detail, leaving no stone unturned.</p><p></p><p>After bowing to everyone, he transformed into a one-legged white bird and flew away in front of everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Spirit Pearls, the rejuvenated cultivators immediately immersed themselves in the construction of the formation support.</p><p></p><p>Being familiar with the process, they quickly integrated into the atmosphere of the Hua Ling Gorge.</p><p></p><p>Thus, a day passed.</p><p></p><p>While checking the formation units, Li Fan suddenly felt something, stopped his work, and looked up.</p><p></p><p>He saw a rainbow light spanning the sky, tearing through the dark red of the burning plain for thousands of miles, heading straight for the Hua Ling Gorge below.</p><p></p><p>The calm blue river seemed to sense something, and without wind, it kept churning and surging.</p><p></p><p>The suppressing force suddenly rose to another level, and the cultivators who could only move freely with the help of the Spirit Pearls were caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual energies were unbalanced, nearly falling from the air.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan saw countless transparent patterns emanating from the rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>Expanding outward like a vast curtain, it instantly enveloped the entire Hua Ling Gorge.</p><p></p><p>"Formation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up, his eyes flashing.</p><p></p><p>As the lines flickered, a large formation formed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The tranquil blue river, which was surging, seemed to be heavily pressed, instantly calming down. Even the surface of the river lowered slightly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators within the formation felt relieved both physically and mentally.</p><p></p><p>The suppressive effect of the Hua Ling Gorge seemed to disappear instantly.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by more than a dozen black-robed cultivators, Lu Xichan in white robes stepped onto the scene, stepping on the rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>She descended before everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Chief!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao and Huang Fu Song hurriedly approached, bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan's gaze swept over the two, her expression stern.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, show me the progress of the formation construction."</p><p></p><p></p>

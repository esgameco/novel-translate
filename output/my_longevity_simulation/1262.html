        <h1>Chapter 1262</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the sky above the Hongze Realm, a vision suddenly appeared showing the demise of the Wanxian Alliance group.</p><p></p><p>"Core Formation cultivator Lin Bai, who cultivated for 165 years..."</p><p></p><p>"While fighting for Kongming Flowing Crystals in the Hongze Realm, was surrounded and attacked by Qian Sheng, Qian Ming, and Qian Su, dying from serious injuries."</p><p></p><p>"Body perished, Dao extinguished, returning to the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>They were clearly killed by the advance team of the Holy Dynasty, but the cause of death shown in the sky was a conflict with the "Qian family".</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Sun Erlang used the [Usurping Heaven Talisman], and the effect seemed quite good. </p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang carefully recorded the scene in the sky with a projection stone, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, following Zhang Ming's posthumous message, he found the Kongming Flowing Crystal vein at this location.</p><p></p><p>Carefully gathering it up by the roots, he deliberately scattered some remnant fragments that fell from the main vein towards various parts of the Hongze Realm, and finally erased the traces of the battle.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Sun Erlang quietly left.</p><p></p><p>A long time later, the obscured and tampered heavenly secrets of the Hongze Realm slowly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Wanxian Alliance, Yueyang Prefecture, Qian Family.</p><p></p><p>Qian Wanling, the Qian family patriarch at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, had a gloomy expression. Below him stood Qian Sheng, Qian Ming, Qian Su and others, still somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me about the good deeds you've done."</p><p></p><p>"What good deeds?" Qian Sheng was stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, suddenly calling us over with this look. What exactly happened?" Qian Su was also a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Qian Wanling slammed the table: "Still concealing it! The Lin family has already come knocking! That Lin Bai was the successor the Lin family had high hopes for. You killed him just like that, how can they let it go?! Although Kongming Flowing Crystals are good things, you need to be alive to use them!"</p><p></p><p>"Blinded by greed! Utterly foolish!"</p><p></p><p>The Qian family patriarch looked at his few brothers, his eyes nearly spitting fire. If not for blood being thicker than water, he wished he could slay them all with one palm strike on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" Qian Ming suddenly realized, his expression changed and he hurriedly asked, "What Lin Bai, what Kongming Flowing Crystals, big brother, could you be mistaken? We killed Lin Bai? What kind of joke is this?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they still refused to admit it, Qian Wanling's heart was disappointed to the extreme: "For the sake of Kongming Flowing Crystals, even deceiving me? Fine, fine, fine!"</p><p></p><p>Qian Wanling was furious. He immediately took out a recording stone and displayed the vision of their demise in the Hongze Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the heavenly vision before their eyes, the three Qian brothers were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"No, big brother! We really didn't do this!"</p><p></p><p>"Someone is framing us! Big brother, you have to believe us!"</p><p></p><p>After a brief daze, the three brothers cried out in unison, protesting their innocence.</p><p></p><p>Qian Wanling stared at them intently, surprisingly unable to find any cracks in their expressions that would indicate pretense.</p><p></p><p>"These few fools' acting skills shouldn't be this good. Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, even Qian Wanling became a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qian Sheng and the others were a bit hesitant. </p><p></p><p>However, under their big brother's murderous gaze, they had no choice but to tell the truth.</p><p></p><p>"That day, we were absorbing solar energy and cultivating in a small building by Yueyang Lake. Suddenly, we sensed an anomaly in the earth veins not far away, as if some treasure was about to emerge. So we went to investigate. Unexpectedly, as soon as we arrived, the power of the earth veins suddenly went out of control. We were swept into the earth veins, losing control and unable to resist..."</p><p></p><p>"Until recently when we finally escaped." Qian Sheng explained everything.</p><p></p><p>Seeing big brother Qian Wanling's increasingly gloomy gaze, he hurriedly added: "Really. If you don't believe me, look, due to being immersed in the earth veins for a long time, the spiritual energy in our bodies has inevitably been tainted with a strong breath of the earth veins."</p><p></p><p>Qian Wanling swept through the three's bodies upon hearing this, and indeed discovered the very obvious traces of earth vein power contamination.</p><p></p><p>Then he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The three Qian brothers thought their big brother still didn't believe them and wanted to continue arguing their case.</p><p></p><p>But then they heard Qian Wanling let out a long sigh: "What if I believe you? Will the Lin family believe it, will the world believe it?"</p><p></p><p>"The scene recorded on this projection stone has been authenticated and is not a forgery."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it involves the treasure of [Kongming Flowing Crystals]..."</p><p></p><p>"Our Qian family is in trouble."</p><p></p><p>Qian Sheng also slowly came to his senses, his eyes bloodshot with rage: "Who is so scheming as to frame us!"</p><p></p><p>Qian Ming's eyes were even redder: "Big brother, don't worry, we won't implicate the family."</p><p></p><p>With that, he was about to turn and leave.</p><p></p><p>"Bastard! If you go out now, are you seeking death?!"</p><p></p><p>Qian Wanling's angry rebuke stopped him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his three brothers looking aggrieved and angry, Qian Wanling sighed again.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he made a decision as the family patriarch: "At this point, being misunderstood is already unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>"The only option is to first report this matter to Lord Fan Li..."</p><p></p><p>Fan Li was a Harmonious Dao cultivator guarding Yueyang Prefecture. He usually didn't like to stay in Yueyang Heavenly City, so he built a small building by Yueyang Lake to reside in.</p><p></p><p>"I will personally make a trip. You all remember, hide at home and don't go out."</p><p></p><p>Qian Wanling solemnly instructed, then changed his appearance and left the house through a secret passage.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Qian Sheng trio at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Yufei, the Lin family patriarch, also came looking for them.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Fan, you must uphold justice for our Lin family in this matter!"</p><p></p><p>The Lin family's informants stationed outside the Yueyang building immediately notified Lin Yufei when they saw Qian Wanling appear.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yufei rushed over. Seeing Qian Wanling sitting solemnly in the building, he made no attempt to conceal the murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Your Qian family is truly too presumptuous! Simply treating the laws of the Immortal Alliance as nothing!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, calm your anger. This matter is someone framing us." Qian Wanling gave a bitter laugh and apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Framing?! Is the heavenly proclamation vision false? Is the scene recorded on the projection stone false?!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yufei was already enraged, but hearing Qian Wanling's words, which sounded more like evasion and sophistry in his view, he flew into a rage.</p><p></p><p>He was about to make a move on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Quiet."</p><p></p><p>Fan Li snorted coldly, suppressing the two's hostile actions.</p><p></p><p>He also carefully examined the scene in the projection stone, his brows tightly knitted.</p><p></p><p>This scene was not fabricated.</p><p></p><p>But he had indeed sensed the anomaly in the earth veins some time ago.</p><p></p><p>The Qian family wouldn't dare to use such a somewhat ridiculous excuse to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>What exactly was going on?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Fan Li felt a headache coming on.</p><p></p><p>He knew that if this matter was not handled well, it was very likely to become known to the entire world.</p><p></p><p>"You two, come with me to this Hongze Realm."</p><p></p><p>Fan Li said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>However, even with Fan Li personally investigating, he ultimately failed to determine the truth of the matter from the remaining clues in the Hongze Realm.</p><p></p><p>Though there was indeed a large amount of Kongming Flowing Crystal remnant aura there.</p><p></p><p>"Old thief Qian, Lord Fan personally used a technique to recreate the heavenly vision of your demise. Seeing it with our own eyes, what else do you have to say?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cut your dog fart! From this day forward, our Lin family and your Qian family will fight to the death!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the hatred between the two families not only remained unresolved but deepened further, Fan Li felt a headache coming on. </p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky above the Hong Ze realm. </p><p></p><p>"Has the Dao of Heaven... changed again?"</p><p></p><p>Returning to Yueyang Prefecture, after several trials and verifications from multiple parties, Fan Li confirmed that the phenomenon of Daoist immortals falling was still in effect.</p><p></p><p>However, he still had some doubts in his heart. Moreover, Qian Wanling always insisted that the three sons of the Qian family were wrongfully accused. </p><p></p><p>After personally interrogating the three men's souls, Fan Li was convinced they were not the murderers.</p><p></p><p>Left with no choice, Fan Li could only report the matter to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that this was already the second similar report received by the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the inherent reasons in the operation of the Immortal Alliance system, such matters had not yet drawn the attention of the true higher-ups in the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Quietly, the seeds of chaos had already been sown.</p><p></p><p>Great Qi.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was very satisfied with the effect of the Heaven Usurping Talisman based on the information gathered by the Holy Dynasty's secret agents from all sides.</p><p></p><p>Because over the past few thousand years, the accuracy of the phenomenon of the Dao of Heaven's demise had been precisely verified. The Myriad Immortal Alliance cultivators, who had already formed a fixed mindset, naturally would not suddenly become suspicious of it.</p><p></p><p>"But it can only be used sparingly. If used too much, it will lose its efficacy."</p><p></p><p>"It must be used at critical junctures."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He had truthfully reported the heroic sacrifice of Zhang Ming's squad to the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor, in a rare move, announced the matter to the world and used his great power to create a floating divine temple above the Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>The temple shone with golden light, suspended high in the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>From any corner of Great Qi, one could see the temple's dazzling radiance like the great sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor declared that any officer who sacrificed for the Holy Dynasty would form their own statue in the temple after death.</p><p></p><p>Although they lost their physical bodies, they could exist eternally in the state of heroic spirits.</p><p></p><p>The ethereal images of Zhang Ming and others, overflowing with golden light, flying out from the floating divine temple, confirmed the Holy Emperor's words.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang knew that the so-called heroic spirits should be a wisp of preserved remnant thoughts given form by his master using divine power.</p><p></p><p>Although there was still a big gap from true immortality and imperishability, it was nonetheless a way to save something after death.</p><p></p><p>Rather than having the soul scatter and utterly vanish, leaving a final trace in the world was good.</p><p></p><p>But for Sun Erlang, minimizing the sacrifice of officers was the right path.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at the secret location where the Holy Dynasty forged weapons of conquest.</p><p></p><p>The Annihilating Army Arrow and Heaven Usurping Talisman were both produced here.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ingenious Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang said to the busy Ingenious Monk.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk did not respond, only focusing intently on the rapidly flashing black puppet in the space ahead.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang didn't mind and also looked towards the puppet.</p><p></p><p>"Such fast speed."</p><p></p><p>The black puppet kept teleporting, its figure floating, even escaping the lock of Sun Erlang's divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"Slow! Still too slow!"</p><p></p><p>"The supply of Source Power is limited. Wanting to bring out the imagined capabilities of the mass-produced models is still a bit of a stretch."</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk said with regret.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sun, go up and spar with it a bit."</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang nodded and instantly arrived at the testing grounds.</p><p></p><p>The black puppet stopped its rapid movement and instead launched an all-out fierce attack on Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>There were two main attack methods. One was the black deathly light shot out, carrying a sense of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The other was detonating formation modules to trap and injure enemies with standard formations.</p><p></p><p>It could almost fight evenly with an ordinary peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, but obviously, it couldn't hurt Sun Erlang at all.</p><p></p><p>While easily dodging the black puppet's attacks, Sun Erlang flicked out several blue light spheres with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>A faint light flashed on the puppet's body as it actually absorbed Sun Erlang's techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, you didn't see this last time you came."</p><p></p><p>"This move is called using one's own methods against them."</p><p></p><p>As the Ingenious Monk said this, threads of blue light lit up on the black puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>Those blue light spheres were actually reflected back by it.</p><p></p><p>"This is just one puppet. The advantage of this mass-produced model is reflected in quantity."</p><p></p><p>With the Ingenious Monk's words, dozens more puppets suddenly appeared in the testing space.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with them, Sun Erlang found that these puppets seemed to be one entity.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they coordinate well, they vaguely formed battle formations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, any single puppet could concentrate and reflect back the attacks absorbed by the whole group.</p><p></p><p>Even with Sun Erlang's outstanding strength, when facing over thirty puppets without using killing moves, he found it a bit difficult to cope.</p><p></p><p>Calling a stop to the test, Sun Erlang returned to the Ingenious Monk's side.</p><p></p><p>"Ingenious Ancestor, how many of these mass-produced puppets can be deployed at once?"</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk shrugged, "Little one, this is a secret of the Holy Dynasty. Even if you are the Holy Emperor's personal disciple, I can't tell you too much."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang couldn't help but be speechless.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk laughed loudly, "Just kidding with you."</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Army Puppets, fifty make up one unit, requiring special cultivators to control them to bring out their maximum combat power."</p><p></p><p>"Surrounding and killing Primordial Spirit realm experts shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a glint flashed through Sun Erlang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is there an upper limit to the number of Holy Army Puppets that can be controlled?"</p><p></p><p>"Upper limit?" The Ingenious Monk was slightly startled, then understood.</p><p></p><p>"You want to try it?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk pondered for a moment, then passed over a black jade disk.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Sun Erlang took the disk, the image of over a thousand black puppets, neatly standing in unison, appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts seemed to connect all these puppets like a thread.</p><p></p><p>Each puppet seemed to have its own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After the connection, Sun Erlang's own soul seemed to be tied down by something heavy, becoming a bit weighed down.</p><p></p><p>But this also allowed him to manipulate the puppets as easily as his own arms.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang got used to the puppet bodies. With a thought, one of the puppets flew into the testing grounds.</p><p></p><p>It began flying and attack experiments.</p><p></p><p>After a period of adaptation, Sun Erlang felt the burden on his soul had become negligible.</p><p></p><p>So he began connecting more puppets.</p><p></p><p>Next, the third, the tenth, the fiftieth...</p><p></p><p>Under the Ingenious Monk's increasingly shocked gaze, the total number of puppets controlled by Sun Erlang actually exceeded one hundred.</p><p></p><p>And judging from his expression, he still seemed at ease.</p><p></p><p>"You little..."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk suddenly had a strange idea, "If you alone control the Holy Army Puppets, would the effect be even better?"</p>

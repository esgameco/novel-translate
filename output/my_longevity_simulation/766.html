        <h1>Chapter 766</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recognized the inner sea, a terminal disk blooming with a dim glow, constructing a circle of disguise outside his true mind and soul. ɯoɔ˙xnɥs69 book 69 new Preventing the Celestial Mirror from possibly prying.</p><p></p><p>And on the towering tree before him, Li Fan saw many completely different yet seemingly related scenes. </p><p>They all stemmed from the derivations of the "Inverse Five Phases Life and Death Sword".</p><p>Some strengthened the "death" attribute, pushing the killing force to the extreme.</p><p>Others emphasized the "life" attribute more, not only able to heal wounds in the blink of an eye, but also create objects and life from emptiness.</p><p>There were also those that focused the derived powers on the "Five Phases" themselves. Unifying the five phases, or having them promote and resist each other, evolving into countless possibilities.</p><p>The sudden simultaneous appearance of these power data was so vast.</p><p>Even with Li Fan's current strength of divine awareness, when he wanted to survey the "Power Tree", he felt slightly overwhelmed.</p><p>Every specific power his thoughts touched upon would manifest a corresponding concrete feedback in his mind.</p><p>After gaining a general overall understanding, Li Fan looked up at the flickering countdown in his vision.</p><p>He was startled to realize that, unknowingly, half the time had already passed!</p><p>With less than five hours left, Li Fan pondered briefly before making his choice.</p><p>It was one of the possible branches after the fusion of the Five Phases, whose essence could be summed up in sixteen words: "Five Phases unified, ultimate yin and yang; its force unceasing, divine soul undying."</p><p>Correct, the power Li Fan wanted was an exquisite secret method to protect the divine soul!</p><p>The life-promoting force of the Five Phases could greatly enhance a cultivator's bodily circulation and recovery abilities, almost achieving perpetual motion of spiritual energy without external aid. Ordinary bodily injuries could also be healed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In the Celestial Mirror's derivations, similar to the life-promoting Five Phases force, there was a possibility of entering a wondrous state of "ultimate yin and yang" when the Five Phases unified.</p><p>In the waxing and waning of yin and yang, it was like the inhalations and exhalations that bring the source of life, generating an endless force that could nourish and empower the divine soul.</p><p>With this force's blessing, even if the divine soul suffered severe damage, one could slowly recover on one's own.</p><p>...</p><p>"Ordinary killing powers have no real use for me," Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p>"For those weaker than me, I can directly subdue them with the 'Insect Binding' power. For those slightly stronger, 'Heaven-Rending Heart Sword' and 'Life-Draining Threads' are enough to match them."</p><p>"And if I truly encounter an opponent too powerful to resist, I can just revert to my original form."</p><p>"For me, the more life-preserving secrets the better, especially those related to the divine soul."</p><p>The inexplicable effect the Mister Bai's clone had on his spiritual sense gave Li Fan a great sense of crisis, forcing him to take it seriously.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Li Fan, firm in his needs, made his choice in his mind.</p><p>In an instant, the immensely lush Power Tree before him began to fade from the branch tips.</p><p>All other demonstrated powers vanished in a moment, leaving only a bare lone branch standing between heaven and earth.</p><p>It then transformed into a beam of light, shooting straight towards Li Fan's inner sea.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Accompanied by an indescribable...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The intense and piercing light, along with countless intricate details of the divine techniques, all surfaced at once. </p><p>It was as if someone was using a wooden stick to stir the sea of consciousness relentlessly.</p><p>Li Fan felt like his head was about to explode from the unimaginable pain, and he couldn't help but let out a muffled groan.</p><p>But this was the world of the Heavenly Mirror, where only countless black and white lines representing the rules existed, without the physical presence of sound.</p><p>So to the outsiders, Li Fan's line figure seemed to be violently shaking and swaying, as if receiving a tremendous impact.</p><p>Li Fan also noticed that a few black lines were detaching from his body from time to time, dissolving and dissipating in this space.</p><p>Consequently, Li Fan felt a mysterious weakening within himself.</p><p>Alarmed, Li Fan focused his mind and tried his best to absorb and process the data that the Heavenly Mirror had infused into his consciousness.</p><p>But the complexity of this divine technique exceeded his imagination. </p><p>Despite his efforts for a long time, there was no sign of the redundant data decreasing.</p><p>"The data volume contained in this divine technique is too massive. If this continues..." Li Fan's heart sank.</p><p>With just this little effort, his line figure had already dissolved by nearly half.</p><p>"Should I abandon this divine technique and try again next time?"</p><p>In a flash, Li Fan suppressed this spontaneous thought.</p><p>Though shaken, he contemplated and found a better way to handle this.</p><p>Under Li Fan's control, the crystal of the Dao Stone at the bottom of the Primal Disc suddenly erupted with a powerful azure glow.</p><p>Similar to the white light that had previously infused the divine technique, it instantly swept across Li Fan's entire sea of consciousness.</p><p>Within the azure light, the data of the divine technique was completely absorbed.</p><p>Just like the endless waves continuously washing away the messy footprints on the shore.</p><p>As the azure light flickered on and off, the divine technique data filling Li Fan's sea of consciousness was gradually absorbed by the Dao Stone.</p><p>"With the Dao Stone, I don't need to rush. I can store the data first and study it slowly later."</p><p>The crisis gradually subsided, and Li Fan's thoughts returned to normal as he let out a silent sigh of relief.</p><p>Observing the Dao Stone, which seemed to have reached a certain limit in its load, Li Fan was startled.</p><p>The originally crystal-clear azure Dao Stone had now become less transparent. The azure color was about to overflow, and its constant trembling could even be seen.</p><p>Faint cracks were also vaguely visible on the surface of the crystal.</p><p>"This... Isn't it said that the divine techniques are at most at the Dao Divinity Realm? How could the data volume be so terrifying?"</p><p>Li Fan was momentarily filled with doubt and uncertainty.</p><p>Although he was not sure about the divine techniques of other Dao Divinity cultivators, he could confirm that his [Infinite Yin-Yang Art] was definitely not something ordinary Dao Divinity divine techniques could compare to.</p><p>"Could it be that the Heavenly Mirror has discovered something and left a hidden door?"</p><p>Li Fan was alarmed by this thought, but it was just his speculation. It was also possible that he was simply scaring himself.</p><p>After some contemplation, Li Fan decided to remain inactive for the time being. </p><p>He neither started learning the [Infinite Yin-Yang Art] nor deleted the stored divine technique data.</p><p>Returning from his contemplation, Li Fan first observed the two cultivators around him.</p><p>Deng Mingzhi seemed to still be selecting which divine technique to cultivate.</p>

            <p>As he spoke, he looked at Zhou Qing'ang again.</p><p></p><p>"Confirming this matter is very important for our Five Elders Association. Although it is a trade, we still need to thank our fellow Daoists. As for the contribution that needs to be whitewashed..."</p><p></p><p>He paused slightly and said, "Within a month, there will be more than ten cultivators with different identities coming to your door carrying safe standardized spirit stones. Fellow Daoists just need to transfer the contributions to them."</p><p></p><p>As if worried that Zhou Qing'ang would be concerned, he added, "These cultivators are all using the long-standing empty identity shells created by our Five Elders Association. Shortly after completing the transaction, they will fall for various reasons. There is no need to worry about being investigated or leaking secrets."</p><p></p><p>After carefully explaining the secret codes, the transaction between the two parties was considered basically completed.</p><p></p><p>"I look forward to our future cooperation," the black-robed cultivator from the Five Elders Association said slowly as they parted ways, looking at Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>"Likewise," Zhou Qing'ang clasped his hands and replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Only after Zhou Qing'ang's figure disappeared into the horizon did the cultivator from the Five Elders Association furrow his brows and whispered, "Zhou Qing'ang, Li Fan..."</p><p></p><p>"What are their true identities? After searching for so long, we couldn't find any useful information at all. New 69 novel site â†’ 69shuxi.com"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Revive Heaven Sect a real existence? Or are they simply some cultivators within the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance trying to exchange the information they possess for resources?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, he smiled in resignation.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, as long as they can provide us with information, it's fine. The more chaos within the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, the better!"</p><p></p><p>The figure of the cultivator from the Five Elders Association gradually faded and disappeared into the air.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zhou Qing'ang, who had completed the transaction, returned to the Congyun Immortal City as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>By making such a significant contribution, he had long been prepared for the exposure of information. However, it didn't matter. On the side of the Five Elders Association, at most, they could infer that "Cultivator Li Fan of the Heavenly Machine Sect" was also a member of the Revive Heaven Sect, and they might even guess that the identities of the ancient cultivators were also disguised.</p><p></p><p>But the true identity of Li Fan was something they would never be able to guess.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that the true identity of the cultivator who caused a stir in the Profound Yellow Realm was a "mortal" from a small world?</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the truths would be buried in the catastrophe of the end of the world. Even if someone wanted to investigate, there would be no way to do so.</p><p></p><p>The river of time flowed forward, everything proceeded steadily as usual.</p><p></p><p>The number of awakened cultivators from the Medicine King Sect, counting Liusan, had reached three hundred and forty-six.</p><p></p><p>Although the vast majority were at the Foundation Building and Golden Core stages, there were only five Nascent Soul cultivators. Together, they formed a considerable force. More importantly, with the passage of time, the effect of the Bloodline Crossing became increasingly prominent. Their admiration for Li Fan also grew day by day.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan often used the goal of "reviving the Medicine King Sect" to strengthen their indoctrination. Gradually, their gazes towards Li Fan even became filled with a certain fanaticism. Li Fan believed that soon, even if he asked them to sacrifice their lives for the Medicine King Sect, they would do so without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"The Bloodline Crossing Technique is truly remarkable," Li Fan was very satisfied with the effect of this technique.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the excellent effect of the Bloodline Crossing Technique was based on Li Fan's absolute strength suppression.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had tried it on Nascent Soul cultivators before, but it ended in failure. Even with the five Nascent Soul cultivators, the crossing was extremely strenuous. It wasn't until with Liusan's help that they barely managed to complete it.</p><p></p><p>With enough manpower, Li Fan gradually stopped waking up cultivators from the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance monitored the number of cultivators in each state. Suddenly adding over three hundred more seemed within reasonable limits considering the large number of overall cultivators in the Congyun Sea region. However, adding more might arouse suspicion and lead to an investigation. So, he decided to pause for now.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring about the detailed information of the still sleeping Senior He Dao from Liusan, Li Fan used the second True Temptation Fruit.</p><p></p><p>He awakened a Senior He Dao cultivator named "Fang Zaiji."</p><p></p><p>This person was actually not a cultivator of the Medicine King Sect. However, many years ago, when he was chased and his life was in danger, he was saved by Liusan. To repay the favor and avoid his enemies, he stayed in the Medicine King Sect as a senior elder.</p><p></p><p>This person didn't have much emotional attachment to the Medicine King Sect. However, he was very interested in the crafting method of the sect's main treasure, the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Liusan had promised to lend him the Medicine King True Cauldron for research, which had won him over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan modified Fang Zaiji's thoughts with the True Temptation Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Now, in Fang Zaiji's cognition, his time in the Medicine King Sect was relatively unfamiliar compared to the other disciples.</p><p></p><p>Only Liusan, or Li Fan, had been around him every day. Almost watching Li Fan grow up, Fang Zaiji already regarded him as half of his own son.</p><p></p><p>Following Li Fan's instructions, when the True Temptation Fruit disappeared and Fang Zaiji woke up.</p><p></p><p>After listening to Li Fan's explanation, he quickly understood the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is treacherous, even more so than the original Ten Sects of Immortal Dao." A trace of haze flashed in Fang Zaiji's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you should have awakened me earlier," he said with a hint of reproach in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, explaining, "Initially, I wanted to find the Changsheng Valley as a base, so I woke up Lao Liu first."</p><p></p><p>"When I thought of waking you up later, I heard that the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance monitored the number of cultivators in each state. At that time, I didn't understand what was going on, so for safety reasons, I kept delaying. Now that I've figured it out, it's likely related to the new method of cultivation practiced by cultivators now. Since you were unaffected, that's why I woke you up."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji nodded slightly, accepting Li Fan's explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Monitoring the number of cultivators may be related to the Immortal Land." After a while, he seemed to remember something and suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan was somewhat surprised and looked at him curiously.</p><p></p><p>"When I traveled back then, I heard by chance that the Ten Sects of Immortal Dao had once laid down an array that covered the entire Profound Yellow Realm," Fang Zaiji seemed lost in reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>"It's like a sword hanging over all living beings. Since the day all living beings were born, regardless of their cultivation level or race, they were all encompassed by the array."</p><p></p><p>"This array can not only easily deal with cultivators from across the world but also gather the power of all living beings, traverse the boundless void, lock onto other directions of the Immortal Realm, and establish channels between the realms for conquest."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji spoke slowly.</p>

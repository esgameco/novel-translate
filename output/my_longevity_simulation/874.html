        <h1>Chapter 874</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then placed another layer of seven-colored divine light seal outside the storage ring. Under the triple restrictions, the lingering sense of crisis that had been haunting his heart finally slowly subsided.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that perhaps it's not only the Xuanhuang realm that has encountered a calamity."</p><p></p><p>"After the path of immortality was severed, the great tribulation has become universal."</p><p></p><p>He casually took this dangerous sealed object and suppressed it within his own grotto-heaven.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then turned his head and asked Tian Yang, "How is it? How do you feel now?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang flew over to Li Fan's side, sensed for a moment, and nodded, "That gnawing feeling has indeed weakened. But it doesn't seem to have completely disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then stooped down and touched the gray soil on the ground with his hand again.</p><p></p><p>The burning, stinging sensation still came, and in just a moment, his palm turned charred black.</p><p></p><p>Before the black spots could spread, Li Fan skillfully cut off his palm.</p><p></p><p>Falling to the ground, it turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Even though the culprit had already been suppressed by Li Fan, the bizarre situation in the Yin Soul Realm still hadn't changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the world's laws has been completely altered?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan was shocked and terrified.</p><p></p><p>"If the immortal miasma is completely targeted at cultivators, then these gray mold spots are specifically used to infect the world."</p><p></p><p>"The current state of this Yin Soul Realm is the corpse of the world."</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of person would be so deranged to develop this kind of thing?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of interest flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In the 115th era, from this point in time to when the Immortal Alliance expedition team arrived, it was only a little over twenty years. Just what happened during this period that birthed ghost-like souls in this land of death?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, no, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>The previous investigation team concluded that it was the nourishment of countless souls in the Yin Soul Realm that gave rise to the vast number of rift whales outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, no souls have appeared, so where did all those rift whales seen before come from?</p><p></p><p>Figuring out this question was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tian Yang stayed in this Yin Soul Realm for another three months.</p><p></p><p>They kept concealing their auras and secretly waited.</p><p></p><p>It was to figure out if the rift whale groups had the habit of coming to the Yin Soul Realm to "forage".</p><p></p><p>Their efforts paid off.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen rift whales broke through the void and arrived above the Yin Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to ordinary rift whales, they were generally more robust.</p><p></p><p>They also seemed to sense the crisis here. The rift whales were not as wanton as they were in the void outside the realm. They swam cautiously in the air according to some pattern, heading towards a certain place in the Yin Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tian Yang quietly followed.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Yin Soul Realm, a place the two had previously investigated and found nothing unusual, the rift whales stopped.</p><p></p><p>Led by a rift whale that seemed experienced, it aimed at a certain spot on the gray soil and directly charged head-on into it.</p><p></p><p>The leading rift whale vanished in an instant, and the rest followed suit.</p><p></p><p>However, the area that could be traversed didn't seem to be particularly wide. Out of ten, as many as three failed to grasp the exact location and directly collided with the gray soil.</p><p></p><p>There was no violent collision sound.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>The black spots quickly devoured them, turning them into pieces of gray dust scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arrived at the spot where the Rift Whale had disappeared, feeling somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, I'll go first," Tian Yang volunteered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, and without any hesitation, Tian Yang flew into it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, did not rush in and waited patiently outside the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Tian Yang returned.</p><p></p><p>On his usually wooden face, a rare expression of shock appeared.</p><p></p><p>Through the images transmitted by his companion, Li Fan finally understood what was hidden inside.</p><p></p><p>It was a vast, winding yellow river, flowing in a circular loop.</p><p></p><p>Countless souls floated on the yellow river, both old and young.</p><p></p><p>They wore different clothes, but all had their eyes tightly closed, as if they had fallen into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how long they had been soaking in this yellow river, but the souls themselves had undergone a strange transformation.</p><p></p><p>Their lower bodies no longer resembled ordinary humans; instead of legs, they had numerous tentacle-like roots.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that by doing so, they could avoid the fate of being washed away by the flowing river.</p><p></p><p>As for the few Rift Whales that had snuck into this place, it was as if they had arrived at a land of plenty.</p><p></p><p>Excited, they feasted ravenously.</p><p></p><p>With a single inhale, they devoured thousands of souls.</p><p></p><p>After consuming these souls that had been soaked in the yellow river, the Rift Whales underwent a remarkable change in appearance.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, they swelled up, and it seemed that something was gestating inside their bellies.</p><p></p><p>In the yellow river, countless billions of souls floated densely.</p><p></p><p>The seven Rift Whales had all eaten their fill, yet the souls they consumed were only an insignificant fraction of the total.</p><p></p><p>After they left, satisfied, Li Fan entered the yellow river, his body protected by a seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had seen countless frozen corpses floating in the Reverse Life and Death Formation before,</p><p></p><p>facing the billions of souls in the river that were neither human nor non-human, Li Fan still felt a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Especially the "roots" on the lower bodies of these souls, some of which were layered and intertwined.</p><p></p><p>This caused a large cluster of closed-eyed faces to be squeezed together at an angle,</p><p></p><p>like a sphere composed of countless faces, grotesque and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this place..." Tian Yang's voice transmission also sounded a bit frightened.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swam in the yellow river, brushing past countless souls. Under the protection of the seven-colored divine light, apart from a bit of disgust, he didn't feel any discomfort.</p><p></p><p>This yellow river was much larger than the entire Yin Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>After searching through it, Li Fan had a vague understanding of the reason behind the anomaly here.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Heaven in the Yin Soul Realm has mutated due to the erosion of the gray mold."</p><p></p><p>"Fire is like cold ice, life is like dead ashes."</p><p></p><p>"But here, there is a glimmer of life. Only because this place was originally the [Death] of the Yin Soul Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed that as the yellow river flowed in a circle,</p><p></p><p>slowly, some mysterious elements in the water were washed together, gradually forming a vague human shape.</p><p></p><p>As the water continued to flow, the souls became clearer and clearer,</p><p></p><p>eventually forming a complete human appearance.</p><p></p><p>"If the world's Dao was operating normally, this newly born soul might have been sent to the human world."</p><p></p><p>"But the Yin Soul Realm itself has already died, and the cycle of life and death no longer exists."</p><p></p><p>"Over the years, these newly born souls have been continuously produced and accumulated here."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 980</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Unable to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>The clone Li Qing was refined using the essence blood of Su Yuqing, the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao of the Separated Realm, and further established her Dao foundation with the Heaven's Extraordinary Black Sword. It was impossible for her to have insufficient innate talent to enter the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the limitation lay within the "Cangshengling Yuan Gong" itself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his gaze towards the Lingyuan Sect disciple who was lying limply in the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Even though he knows the contents of the cultivation method, there are no memories related to Lingyuan Gong in his soul. It can only be extracted through torture and interrogation. Is the cultivation method stored within the physical body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spiritual consciousness swept over the unconscious disciple, carefully examining him.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current level of familiarity with the human body, he quickly discovered the clue.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Lingyuan Sect disciple's body, there existed a layer of imprint, engraved within his flesh and blood, forming a unique mark. This mark seemed to have no impact on the physical body, but Li Fan keenly sensed the traces of the cultivation method's operation remaining on it.</p><p></p><p>Even though this Lingyuan Sect disciple had already switched to a new method, the imprint left by years of practicing the cultivation method had not faded at all.</p><p></p><p>"The imprint stores the cultivation method and also serves as a form of authentication. Only those who match the authentication can cultivate the 'Cangshengling Yuan Gong'..."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Li Fan's spiritual consciousness moved away from the Lingyuan Sect disciple who had been reduced to a puddle of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was ruthless and wanted to kill to silence him.</p><p></p><p>Rather, when he was peering into the Lingyuan Gong imprint, it triggered its built-in protection. The imprint self-destructed, tearing apart the disciple's body in the process.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had already fully recorded the entire imprint before this happened.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was extremely complex, with just one glance, the Huadao Stone could perfectly replicate it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and used his hand as a brush, dancing in the void.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Gong imprint gradually took shape.</p><p></p><p>It was human-shaped, composed of a total of 128,000 different "components" interlocking with each other.</p><p></p><p>The moment the imprint was recreated, it seemed to have its own spirit and actually started moving.</p><p></p><p>First, it confusedly distinguished the directions around it, and then slowly floated towards the puddle of mud on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not stop it and just quietly observed the changes.</p><p></p><p>After the human-shaped imprint attached to the flesh and blood, the lump of flesh that had already lost its vitality actually began to squirm. Using the imprint as a skeleton and the flesh and blood as an outer garment.</p><p></p><p>It put it on again.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was quite creepy, but what surprised Li Fan even more was what followed.</p><p></p><p>Although the cultivation method imprint reconstructed the body, it did not bring that believer back to life. It was just a walking corpse, and even its appearance was not restored.</p><p></p><p>It was purely a creature made of flesh and blood tissues fused together. The first thing it did after appearing in this world, and its only mission, was to sit cross-legged and then start practicing the "Cangshengling Yuan Gong".</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy slowly gathered inside the flesh and blood creature's body. Before long, Li Fan sensed the fluctuations of the cultivation method's operation from it.</p><p></p><p>Just like a machine made of flesh and blood, even without the believer's life as a "carrier", it could tirelessly cultivate the "Cangshengling Yuan Gong".</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood machine had no intelligence or awareness. It ignored Li Fan and Li Qing, and only followed the predetermined instructions to carry out its task.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder that mysterious and unfathomable Lingyuan Sect leader was initially able to find enough cultivators to practice, allowing the cultivation method's amplification to directly reach the threshold of offsetting the side effects of the law that cultivation methods cannot be practiced together."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A look of interest flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The ability to operate the cultivation technique with flesh and blood instincts after death should rely on that kind of imprint. However, I have never heard of it before. It seems that this Lingyuan Sect Leader also has secrets on his body."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, even with the power of the Heavenly Venerate Dharma, there is little difference from ants, and it is difficult to escape death."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the possibility that the Lingyuan Sect Leader was not in Jiushan Prefecture at that time and narrowly escaped cannot be ruled out.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is verified now...</p><p></p><p>At Li Fan's indication, his avatar Li Qing immediately sat cross-legged and began to engrave the Lingyuan cultivation imprint within his own body.</p><p></p><p>The original body carefully sensed the subtle changes occurring in the body after the imprint continuously increased.</p><p></p><p>Only after the imprint was completely reproduced and connected into one could Li Fan vaguely perceive its influence on the flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>To put it in more colloquial terms, it was like stamping a seal on the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate the Cangshen Lingyuan Technique." Li Fan said with narrowed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded slightly and tried to operate the Lingyuan technique again.</p><p></p><p>This time there was no obstruction, and she quickly entered the beginner stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from our side, there is no one else in the entire Xuanhuang Realm cultivating this technique anymore."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Lingyuan Sect Leader is really dead."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple. Although the Lingyuan Sect Leader himself may not have cultivated the Lingyuan technique, this technique must have been of great use to him. Otherwise, he would not have gone to great lengths to establish the Lingyuan Sect and spread the technique everywhere.</p><p></p><p>If he were still alive, he would definitely reorganize his forces. With the method of controlling flesh puppets with imprints, it would not be difficult to rise again.</p><p></p><p>However, a long time has passed since the destruction of Jiushan Prefecture, and no new cultivators have begun to cultivate the Lingyuan technique. Even those who had previously cultivated it have all given up.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how many schemes you have, in the face of absolute power disparity, they are ultimately useless."</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect Leader died unjustly, but the legacy he left behind benefited Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although there must still be secrets in this Cangshen Lingyuan technique, it does not prevent Li Fan from using it first.</p><p></p><p>And then slowly crack it.</p><p></p><p>"Go and create some flesh puppets to operate the Lingyuan technique first." Li Fan ordered.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing immediately followed the order and left.</p><p></p><p>"I don't expect them to be able to directly confront the Five Elders, they just need to help me with 【Mending the Heavens】."</p><p></p><p>"The river of blood is almost endless, spanning too long a time. However, the vast majority of history is irrelevant, the most critical few nodes..."</p><p></p><p>"From when the Xuantian King returned from the immortal realm passage and founded the Xuantian Sect, to his mysterious disappearance."</p><p></p><p>"At the end of the rule of the Ten Immortal Sects, the Dharma Heavenly Venerate Yijun emerged, and Mr. Bai achieved the status of Ancient-Modern Dual Dharma Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"First, let's clarify what happened during these two periods."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew well that relying on these small world cultivators to obtain historical fragments from the Book of Genesis was like fishing in a pond.</p><p></p><p>It was full of randomness, and what could be obtained all depended on luck.</p><p></p><p>However, when the number of attempts was large enough, some valuable things could always be obtained.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's work efficiency was very high.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation techniques still had to consider the influence of the immortal miasma. Under the urgency of the matter, he ultimately took materials from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In just over ten days, he created enough flesh puppets.</p><p></p><p>As for the many Foundation Establishment cultivators who disappeared inexplicably within the Wanxian Alliance, it did not cause much of a stir.</p>

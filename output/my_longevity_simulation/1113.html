            <p>Chapter 1111: Quietly Setting Up the Prisoner's Net</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, at the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>All the floating celestial cities simultaneously rang out with urgent bell sounds at the same moment.</p><p></p><p>The immortal alliance cultivators stopped their actions and stood stunned in place.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of being dumbfounded, they finally recalled the meaning represented by these bell sounds.</p><p></p><p>This was the highest level of warning from the Myriad Immortals Alliance. </p><p></p><p>It would only be activated when the immortal alliance faced a life-or-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, a chaotic uproar suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>People were panic-stricken and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan, who was in the Lingmu Realm, also heard the bell sounds the instant they rang out.</p><p></p><p>At first, he thought his world-destroying arrangements had been discovered.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan quickly realized that these abruptly ringing bells were likely related to what happened inside the Life and Death Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>This was confirmed when the recorded images from the formation left behind by the True Immortal's Remnant Shell arrived.</p><p></p><p>The images finally stopped at the scene of the Dharma Transmitters disappearing into the white mist.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the recording formation was similarly destroyed by that surging, endless white mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan repeatedly reviewed the images, a hint of solemnity flashing through his eyes: "The Myriad Immortals Alliance's reaction is so intense, could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"Those three Dharma Transmitters died?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was instantly filled with startled doubts.</p><p></p><p>He knew that each Dharma Transmitter was protected by the "Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerate".</p><p></p><p>As long as this protective power did not disappear, they could be said to be immortal and indestructible existences in this Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although they were restricted because of this and unable to advance to the Eternal Life realm,</p><p></p><p>They were almost no different from having eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Yet unexpectedly, in front of this newly ascended Eternal Life Celestial Venerate, Wangsheng, they were so vulnerable.</p><p></p><p>"Actually able to instantly kill Dharma Transmitters?"</p><p></p><p>"If these three Dharma Transmitters really died just like that, then Wangsheng's strength..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes couldn't help but narrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, a hint of doubt flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"If he's really this powerful, what reason would he have for killing the three Dharma Transmitters?"</p><p></p><p>"It was clearly just an accidental intrusion, and there were no destructive or disrespectful actions during this time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again slowly reviewed the images recorded by the formation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that right before their departure, Wangsheng had no intention of appearing."</p><p></p><p>"But Dharma Transmitter Wei seemed to have discovered something, which led to Wangsheng's appearance."</p><p></p><p>"So, it was to silence them?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression couldn't help but become strange.</p><p></p><p>Killing to silence someone, such a thing appearing on an Eternal Life Celestial Venerate seemed a bit beneath his status.</p><p></p><p>But he actually did just that.</p><p></p><p>There was only one explanation. If what Dharma Transmitter Wei discovered was leaked, it would have an immeasurable impact on him.</p><p></p><p>To avoid the occurrence of variables, Wangsheng chose to annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>"Before his death, Dharma Transmitter Wei should have been pondering reversing the Life and Death Grand Formation."</p><p></p><p>Following this train of thought, Li Fan put himself in that position. With his current attainments in formations, he naturally quickly understood the key points in this.</p><p></p><p>"As I previously intuited, reversing life and death, the ultimate goal is not to reverse the life and death of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The resurrection of cultivators is merely an incidental change in the laws of heaven and earth brought about during this process."</p><p></p><p>"The true target this Celestial Venerate wants to reverse life and death for is the [world]."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes suddenly erupted with a brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>"To cover up this goal, the group from the Myriad Immortals Alliance had to be annihilated."</p><p></p><p>"This shows that the target he wants to resurrect is not the [Xuanhuang Realm], but in these years, it has already been..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"One of the many cultivation worlds devoured by the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Is this a case of never forgetting one's homeland?"</p><p></p><p>After sorting through the context again, Li Fan nodded slightly: "No wonder this person has been keeping a low profile and never exposing himself to the public eye over the years. This move can be called borrowing a corpse to resurrect the soul. If successful, his homeland world may indeed have a chance to come back to life."</p><p></p><p>"But the fate of the Xuanhuang Realm itself is uncertain."</p><p></p><p>"If this leaks out, it will surely face fierce resistance from the native cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out he's doing shady things, just like me."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared at the corner of Li Fan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"But all the plans are bound to come to nothing."</p><p></p><p>The smile disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it had already returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the direct culprit behind the fall of the three Dharma Transmitters, it was immediately pursued by the Wanxian Alliance upon appearing.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Wanxian Alliance was serious.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the previous Moruo Bin's possession incident, no Dharma Transmitters had perished.</p><p></p><p>Now, with three of them falling at once, the shock to the Dharma Transmitter Council was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>More than ten Dharma Transmitters appeared together, locking onto the True Immortal Remnant Body in the center.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, Li Fan even discovered the figure of the curator of the Divine Tibetan Museum, the beast clan emperor Disanmo.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his appearance in the Fallen Immortal Realm, he looked even older.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't seem to care much about the pursuit of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Expressionless, with his eyes slightly closed.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, his attendance this time was just going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Li Fan finally saw the Zhangjing Ren lineage.</p><p></p><p>They all wore ink-green Daoist robes, with mirror-like marks engraved on their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>The three forces that truly controlled the Wanxian Alliance gathered here, showing the great impact of the three Dharma Transmitters' demise.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of various forces, Li Fan felt his control over the True Immortal Remnant Body weakening.</p><p></p><p>He was about to detonate the remnant body, opening up the passage between the Xuanhuang Realm and the Netherworld, creating a wave of the Netherworld Sea.</p><p></p><p>Something that surprised him a little happened.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Wanxian Alliance, originally poised to strike, seemed to suddenly receive some message.</p><p></p><p>At first, they were a bit puzzled and in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But soon, without hesitation, they took action in unison.</p><p></p><p>Their figures became blurred, ignoring the culprit and preparing to leave this place!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even saw that Emperor Disanmo, who originally had his eyes closed, suddenly opened them, as if something had arrived and attracted his attention.</p><p></p><p>Far away in the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan immediately felt a sense of unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Years of experience made him make a decision immediately.</p><p></p><p>He severed the connection with the True Immortal Remnant Body and detonated it at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Just as the True Immortal Remnant Body shattered inch by inch, a white mist figure quietly appeared beside him.</p><p></p><p>It appeared without any sign and was so swift.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, it was a step too late.</p><p></p><p>Endless darkness surged out from the cracks of the True Immortal Remnant Body.</p><p></p><p>It collided with the white mist surging from the white mist figure.</p><p></p><p>The dark tide that Li Fan had expected did not descend.</p><p></p><p>The white mist was like bags of waterproof sandbags, or the dam that always stood firm by the sea.</p><p></p><p>It firmly blocked the dark tide that could have caused a catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm, a trace of coldness flashed across Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>"The two sides have cooperated?"</p><p></p><p>"In order to find me, even the fall of the Dharma Transmitters can be ignored?"</p>

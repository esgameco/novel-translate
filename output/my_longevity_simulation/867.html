        <h1>Chapter 867</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that Zhong Shentong, a small Foundation Establishment cultivator, was able to take possession of the Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light treasure without it being snatched away by others. It must be because he handed over the Fishing Pond and obtained its protection."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a little emotional in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Originally, he shouldn't have overlooked this point.</p><p></p><p>But first he was delighted to obtain the treasure, and then he successfully broke through. This caused his state of mind to become a bit complacent.</p><p></p><p>So he neglected this strange point.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's not a bad thing either. At the very least, I know that this Seven-Colored Divine Light cannot be used lightly. And it also drew out this elder."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the stone tablet scholar behind him without revealing anything.</p><p></p><p>In the surging earth veins, the scholar walked like an ordinary person, neither fast nor slow. </p><p></p><p>And the ancient earth vein trees that would normally attack cultivators who broke into them, did not show any abnormal movements at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It was very calm.</p><p></p><p>Even when Lin Ling called out, they refused to respond at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently cursed and urged Lin Ling to continue hurrying along the way.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>At the previous meeting place. </p><p></p><p>Not long after Li Fan and the scholar left together.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator dressed as a member of the Five Elders Association arrived belatedly.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time without seeing anyone appear.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but be confused.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yongyun State.</p><p></p><p>In a small mountain temple, outside the Fishing Pond.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please look." Li Fan respectfully pointed to the small pond in front and said.</p><p></p><p>Because Jishao Li had informed him in advance before coming, Zhong Shentong already knew that someone would be coming.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the stone tablet scholar and Li Fan, not daring to breathe.</p><p></p><p>He protected Liuli behind him, firmly pressing down on her head as she wanted to stick it out and see what was going on.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar observed with great interest for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"It's just an ordinary small pond..."</p><p></p><p>"Could there be some profound mystery?"</p><p></p><p>The scholar became interested.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan signaled with his eyes for Zhong Shentong to step forward and demonstrate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan had no choice but to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>He sat by the pond, solemn and dignified.</p><p></p><p>He cast out his fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a strange light erupted in the stone tablet scholar's eyes.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan retracted the rod and returned, allowing him to examine the white glowing object in his hands, only then did he realize.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't wait to step forward, wanting to also give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was about to speak up to remind him of the correct way to use the Fishing Pond.</p><p></p><p>But he saw the stone tablet scholar ponder for a moment, and then his figure blurred as he directly transformed his appearance!</p><p></p><p>The owner of that appearance was also very familiar to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the crazy fisherman!</p><p></p><p>It's just that the fish basket on his back was replaced with a heavy blue stone tablet!</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, I forgot to tell you. This scholar is not my original appearance."</p><p></p><p>"But rather one I imitated from that member of the Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>The "fisherman" smiled, humming something, and cast out his rod.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his expression and posture, there was almost no difference from the real fisherman.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had inevitably looked down a bit on this Longevity Realm expert due to their encounters.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Creation Stone Tablet's monitoring function only worked in certain areas.</p><p></p><p>And this person was unable to discern his background, and was overjoyed upon seeing the treasure Fishing Pond like an ordinary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptibly, this lowered his "aura" quite a bit in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems...</p><p></p><p>This person is also hiding his depths very well.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not attain the Dao through Heaven-Defying Principles, he definitely cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong was completely frozen like a revered statue, with his facial expression and body stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, only Lin Ling and Liuli, the two brave ones, were secretly staring at the Stone Plate Fisherman.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman's first fishing process was exceptionally long.</p><p></p><p>And he seemed to be deeply immersed in this fishing process.</p><p></p><p>Even after most of the day had passed, he still sat motionless. This made Li Fan suspect that he might have already failed but was still pretending.</p><p></p><p>However, with a dazzling golden light appearing once again in the mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's doubts quickly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the golden light sphere in the Stone Plate Fisherman's hand, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit skeptical about life.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong was also dumbfounded, not daring to believe his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman stared at the light sphere for a while: "The Heavenly Emperor's Qi Canon?"</p><p></p><p>"Achieving the status of an emperor in the world, gathering the qi fortune of all living beings and dynasties. Without cultivation, one can become as powerful as a long-lived realm expert..."</p><p></p><p>"Always thinking about fighting and killing, how boring."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman was bored: "You can have it."</p><p></p><p>With that said, he casually threw the golden light sphere towards Li Fan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhong Shentong also wanted to reach out and catch it, under Li Fan's threatening gaze, he didn't dare to be presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>After catching the golden light sphere, Li Fan quickly examined it.</p><p></p><p>The contents inside were consistent with what the Stone Plate Fisherman had said.</p><p></p><p>It was a unique cultivation method circulating in a world without spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed ingeniously unique."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, to condense the qi fortune to the scale described in the canon, it would require the joint efforts of hundreds of years and more than ten generations of people."</p><p></p><p>"A chicken rib."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan commented with some regret, but still solemnly stored it in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Stone Plate Fisherman, seeing that he was still in the posture of fishing, Li Fan couldn't help but say: "Senior, this fishing pool only has one opportunity per day."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman yawned: "I know."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman seemed to truly enjoy the process of fishing.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't care whether he could fish up a treasure light sphere.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Zhong Shentong and Li Fan, he was like a true fisherman.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I'll stay here."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be nervous, just pretend I don't exist."</p><p></p><p>"The things I fish up, I don't want them. They're all yours."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already anticipated this in his heart, but even if the other party said so, how could he possibly ignore such a long-lived realm expert?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, could it be that you want to find something useful from this fishing pool?"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman didn't seem to have any malicious intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan mustered up the courage to ask.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman's answer was also very straightforward: "Yes. In the Xuanhuang Realm, there's nothing that can remove the stone plate from my back."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it might exist in this fishing pool."</p><p></p><p>This answer caught Li Fan off guard, and he fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhong Shentong and Liuli, they were full of curiosity as they looked at the ancient stone plate on his back.</p><p></p><p>"Too tiring. Too painful."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman sighed while fishing.</p><p></p><p>"The things happening in the Xuanhuang Realm, every moment."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you don't want to know, they still uncontrollably appear in your mind."</p><p></p><p>"You think it's a good thing?"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning, I tried to directly split open my own head."</p><p></p><p>"But the stone plate is indestructible, so I can't die."</p>

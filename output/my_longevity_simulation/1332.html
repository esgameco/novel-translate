        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1321 Feigning Madness to See the High Wall</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, my friend, don't joke around! Beyond the high wall..." Zhong Daogang's eyes flickered. Faced with Li Fan's insistent questioning, he firmly denied it. </p><p></p><p>"Do I look like I'm joking?" Li Fan rudely interrupted him. His eyes flashed with ferocity, his aura surging, as if he would explode at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Xianzhou recognized the fluctuations around Li Fan all too well. It was the aura of a true immortal talisman!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan seemed serious, the Xianzhou elders' expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, don't be rash, let's talk this through!" They tried to dissuade him while distancing themselves from Li Fan and activating the Xianzhou's layers of defenses.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face darkened: "I'm perfectly calm right now! I just want to find an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>"It's precisely because you tried to unravel the source shaking the high wall that you were struck back, with your life nearing its end...There is absolutely no such terrifying existence within this Darkest Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>"It was clearly the work of an unknown civilization beyond the high wall, yet you of the Xianzhou pretend it was your own achievement. Stealing heaven's credit, utterly shameless! It doesn't matter if you seek fame, but you've harmed me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan grew more and more agitated, the fluctuations of the true immortal talisman around him intensifying. He looked at the Xianzhou people as if they were his father's murderers, ready to fight to the death at any moment.</p><p></p><p>His words were nearly incoherent ramblings without reason.</p><p></p><p>But don't forget, Li Fan now only had twenty years of life left on the surface. For a cultivator, twenty years was but the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the Xianzhou elders would not argue with an emotionally unstable dying man.</p><p></p><p>They could only console him helplessly: "Friend, you are mistaken about us!"</p><p></p><p>"We did not lie. The source that caused the high wall's disturbance originated from beyond the high wall, yet is also closely related to our Xianzhou...they are of the same origin..."</p><p></p><p>"You? Beyond the high wall?" Hearing this, Li Fan calmed down slightly. But his eyes still held thick suspicion.</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders privately discussed it. Although the Xianzhou's departure beyond the high wall was an absolute secret, this was a dying man before them.</p><p></p><p>This place was too close to the Xuanxian Xianzhou. If he went mad and wildly unleashed his true immortal talisman power, it could cause irreparable damage to the Xianzhou.</p><p></p><p>It was permissible to temporarily placate him with this secret.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, this matter is not easy to explain in a few words. Friend, please listen as I slowly recount it..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang began telling Li Fan about the split of the Xuanshang Xianzhou, and the story of how the Shangxianzhou eventually crashed through the high wall and roamed freely.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the other Xianzhou elders joined forces to cast a spell, quietly isolating the space. On one hand, it was to prevent this absolute Xianzhou secret from leaking out. On the other, it was to confine Li Fan within.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed oblivious to the Xianzhou elders' tricks. The viciousness around him gradually dissipated, leaving him somewhat dazed and regretful: "So I was rash? I never imagined the former Xuanshang Xianzhou had such an extraordinary story."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan gradually calm down, Zhong Daogang breathed a sigh of relief. He then asked, "I wonder what Daqizhou's attitude is towards cooperating with us? Even if unwilling, why have they delayed their response for so long?"</p><p></p><p>"In fact, Daqizhou is quite conflicted about this matter. After I recklessly suffered the backlash, my master reluctantly told me that while Daqizhou is interested in being able to traverse beyond the high wall, the key issue involves the great dangers from the things beyond the high wall..."</p><p></p><p>After speaking so seriously, Li Fan looked around, seeming to finally notice the confinement spell the Xianzhou elders had cast together.</p><p></p><p>A hint of displeasure flashed across his eyes. But he only let out a cold snort, without erupting.</p><p></p><p>His black and white hair swayed without wind, fluttering unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>Strands of silver threads flew out from the myriad strands of hair.</p><p></p><p>Before the Xianzhou elders could react, these silver threads had already formed a formation in the void, similarly confining and sealing them.</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders' attention was drawn by Li Fan's voice.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, take a look! This is the scene related to beyond the high wall that I glimpsed through the Realm Protection Spirit Artifact!"</p><p></p><p>The keywords "Realm Protection Spirit Artifact" and "beyond the high wall" immediately shook the Xianzhou elders' minds, drawing their gazes.</p><p></p><p>The perspective zoomed out infinitely, the entire Darkest Star Sea appearing before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The cold, lifeless star sea seemed to boil over. An indistinct, bone-chilling aura lingered endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a tremendous rumbling came from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Then the Darkest Star Sea looked like it had been struck by a massive boulder, sending towering waves crashing!</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>Though only a short segment, the Xianzhou elders could see the scene it depicted.</p><p></p><p>The high wall crumbling, some unknown existence descending upon the star sea!</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed almost real.</p><p></p><p>It was practically like a true recorded image!</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders were dazed, taking a long time to recover from the shock of the star sea's upheaval.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Even Zhong Daogang was stunned, looking towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Now you know why I suffered such a backlash," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"The high wall crumbling, the star sea in turmoil. If it truly reaches that point, even with Daqizhou's current strength, we may not be able to preserve ourselves. This is also why we have not made a decision."</p><p></p><p>"Freedom is good, but it requires safety as a prerequisite..." Li Fan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>The scene fell into dead silence. </p><p></p><p>On the surface the Xianzhou elders said nothing, but internally they had fallen into intense debate.</p><p></p><p>"This...is it true or false?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a scene could never be fabricated by cultivators like us. Even in our most horrific nightmares, it would be difficult to envision."</p><p></p><p>"In my view, it doesn't seem false. Those fluctuations felt too real. To be honest, I almost couldn't help but try to flee just now. It's just that it seems the other party has set up a formation around us, and I couldn't escape."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about our plan? To gather the power of true immortal talismans, triggering the remnant spiritual forces of the star sea. Form a tsunami to strike at the weakest point, ultimately allowing us to traverse the high wall. We schemed for a long time, hoping to recreate the Shangxianzhou's feat. Who could have foreseen this as the final result? In the divination, is this high wall the one we were going to crash through?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't let this kid scare you. The divined scene is not necessarily the true future. We absolutely cannot abandon the plan because of this..."</p><p></p><p>"I say, this seems a bit ominous. The three of us joined forces but still couldn't break this formation."</p><p></p><p>A subtle atmosphere gradually spread among the Xianzhou elders.</p><p></p><p>Partly because they were deeply shaken by the upheaval of the star sea.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The shocking scene, on the other hand, made them realize in horror that they had been silently confined here by Li Fan's formation.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this?" Zhong Daogang squinted his eyes and questioned. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan avoided answering, instead appearing somewhat deranged as he muttered to himself: "My master and senior fellows, for the sake of Dakai's safety, have given up cooperating with you and are probing the weak points of the high wall. I can actually understand..."</p><p></p><p>"But if that's the case, wouldn't my death in twenty years be in vain?"</p><p></p><p>"Dakai is planning to give up. What about your celestial ship?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently at the celestial ship's elders and asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang was momentarily unsure how to handle Li Fan's mentality and hesitated without answering.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no response, Li Fan's emotions suddenly became agitated again: "What about you all!"</p><p></p><p>"If you give up too, then let's just act like none of this ever happened. Then wouldn't my unauthorized use of celestial artifacts, deductions about the future that ultimately reduced my lifespan, be completely meaningless?"</p><p></p><p>"I originally had a bright future ahead of me. Among all the young disciples of Dakai, my talents were unmatched. In the future, if not becoming a great literary master whose name would be passed down for generations, at the very least I could become a renowned teacher like my master, instructing others..."</p><p></p><p>"All of this went up in smoke because of a single word from your celestial ship." Li Fan's tone became increasingly frenzied. Strange black colors even emerged on his face, making one's hair stand on end just looking at it.</p><p></p><p>"Death is death."</p><p></p><p>"But to become a laughingstock even after death..."</p><p></p><p>"I refuse!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed at Zhong Daogang.</p><p></p><p>"Give me an answer!"</p><p></p><p>"Is your celestial ship planning to continue or not!"</p><p></p><p>"If you're afraid and cancel the plan..."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's be destroyed together!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanying Li Fan's words, countless silver lines suddenly lit up in the surrounding void.</p><p></p><p>As if thousands upon thousands of suns had simultaneously risen on the horizon, illuminating the space the celestial ship occupied.</p><p></p><p>A silver wind began blowing in the void.</p><p></p><p>Just a light brush against everyone's faces left gashes.</p><p></p><p>Forcing the celestial ship members to employ various techniques to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, as the formless wind in the void grew increasingly fierce, their expressions changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of formation is this?!"</p><p></p><p>"Danger! Everyone be careful, I've never seen such a vicious formation in my life!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, use talisman scripts to break the formation!"</p><p></p><p>The elders reacted swiftly. As the words left their mouths, the celestial pivot academy's eldest elder Jiandao Sheng had already written a talisman script.</p><p></p><p>Under the power of the celestial calligraphy script, the silver-white formation lines crumbled instantly.</p><p></p><p>However, before the celestial ship members could rejoice, they were left dumbfounded by what happened next.</p><p></p><p>From the surrounding darkness, even more circles of brilliant light arose, like the rising of suns. More silver lines than before regenerated, weaving into a new formation.</p><p></p><p>The talisman script dissolved the formation, but at the same time, even more was frozen into ice!</p><p></p><p>As such, the formation confining them not only failed to dissipate,</p><p></p><p>But grew even more massive and complex.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, whoever else knows talisman scripts, follow up!"</p><p></p><p>"Stay calm! The celestial ship hasn't left yet, we're all trapped here. If we unleash too much power from celestial calligraphy scripts at once, the consequences are unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>"This kid has gone mad! What is he trying to do?!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the constant flashing of countless silver threads, Li Fan's voice continued.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Zhong! Answer me!"</p><p></p><p>"What is your celestial ship's answer?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang's expression was unsightly.</p><p></p><p>In all these years, this was the first time he had been so pressured by a junior.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang looked at the various celestial calligraphy scripts constantly floating out from Li Fan's body and felt a headache coming on.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang finally understood just how troublesome a cultivator wielding the power of celestial calligraphy scripts could be when they were fearless of death.</p><p></p><p>"Answer me!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's near-deranged voice echoed within the great formation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan was on the verge of breaking down, with celestial scripts densely flying out of his body to an alarming degree,</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang had no choice but to answer: "Rest assured, fellow Daoist, our celestial ship will absolutely not give up on exploring beyond the high wall."</p><p></p><p>"Just words, no proof!"</p><p></p><p>"Then what does the Daoist wish to do?" Faced with a stronger situation, Zhong Daogang patiently asked.</p><p></p><p>"First take me to that weak point of the high wall to investigate! If you give up, I'll charge forward alone, even at the cost of my life!" Li Fan resolutely stated.</p><p></p><p>The celestial ship elders exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>"Well, can this formation be broken?"</p><p></p><p>"You know our formation skills. Even if we study it, it would take at least 180 years to figure it out, let alone break it in a short time."</p><p></p><p>"I told you before not to rely too heavily on celestial calligraphy scripts. You should have developed other techniques and divine abilities, but you didn't listen. Now you're firmly in his grip." The celestial pivot academy elder named Meng Xiaomeng wore a look of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>"So what's the plan now? Are we really going to take him to that weak point of the high wall?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>"This person's great limit is approaching, his mind has already gone insane. It's useless to reason with him normally. He very well might actually charge headfirst into the high wall to his death."</p><p></p><p>"And don't forget, his mastery of celestial calligraphy scripts runs quite deep. Perhaps we can make use of him for preliminary experimental plans."</p><p></p><p>"Right, first pacify him. As long as we ensure he doesn't leak any secrets to the outside world."</p><p></p><p>Partly due to Li Fan threatening with his life, and partly out of some ulterior motive,</p><p></p><p>The celestial ship elders ultimately agreed to Li Fan's request.</p><p></p><p>To first take him to witness the so-called weak point of the high wall.</p><p></p><p>The celestial ship, along with the elders, moved through the void accompanied by a returning-to-void grand formation.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the sea of relics, they drew ever closer to the foot of the high wall.</p><p></p><p>"Up ahead are the connected fragments of remnant worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Past that is the location of the formless high wall," Zhong Daogang said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gave a cold snort: "I've been there before. How do we proceed next?"</p><p></p><p>"The remnant realm's long wall connects as one. If the celestial ship also goes over, we may be captured by that mighty force and find it difficult to escape. Moreover, you must have sensed it too - the closer we get to the high wall, the stronger the reverberating starforce becomes. With our cultivation levels, we can barely stabilize our bodies. But the vast celestial ship cannot..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, since we've come this far, we naturally won't go back on our word to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned everyone with his gaze, pondered for a moment, and finally nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Thus, six elders remained behind to guard the celestial ship.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 718</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After pondering for a moment, he showed a look of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter, young friend? Do you have something hard to say?" asked Nangong Shirong.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest with Nangong senior, I am not actually a member of the Immortal Alliance. I am a pre-ancient hibernating cultivator..." Immediately, Xu Bai confessed in detail about using the Sky Spirit Flower to exchange for the identity of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong laughed heartily, "Young friend, do not worry. I have already thoroughly investigated these matters. Including the token of the Dao level which fell into your hands, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>But Nangong Shirong waved his hand, indicating him not to be nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Although it does deviate a bit from the usual procedure, no matter what, your current status in the Immortal Alliance is recognized by the Heavenly Enchantment Mirror. So, there's no problem!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Old Members of the Association can reform and join the Immortal Alliance. What more for ancient cultivators like you?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, the incident with Wang Qiu Po has unequivocally confirmed your loyalty to the Immortal Alliance! If it weren't for your vigilance, I don't know how many nails he would have still been able to plant within our Immortal Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong snorted coldly, then looked towards Xu Bai with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xu young friend, I am currently short-handed here. Why not lend me a hand?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with me around, no one will be able to accuse you of your past!"</p><p></p><p>With things getting to this point, if Xu Bai didn't agree, he might not be able to leave the room.@</p><p></p><p>So after Xu Bai pretended to hesitate for a moment, he gratefully said to Nangong Shirong, "In that case, I thank the senior for nurturing me!"</p><p></p><p>After getting Xu Bai's affirmative answer, Nangong Shirong laughed a few times.</p><p></p><p>Under his approval, Xu Bai's internal recruitment process went exceptionally smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Even the test at the White Jade Questioning Heart Platform was just a formality.</p><p></p><p>He passed it quickly after answering a few inconsequential questions.</p><p></p><p>The position Xu Bai was assigned was the "Linker of Tianliang Province."</p><p></p><p>Responsible directly to the ruler of a province, the position was neither big nor small.</p><p></p><p>Everything depended on the decision of the Tianliang City Lord.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan's previous role as the "Secret Envoy" was about handling the provincial affairs for the city lord, then this Linker was responsible for communication between Tianliang Province and other provinces, as well as the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Due to various factors, those in power in the provinces would arrange positions for the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>But in order to avoid drawing attention, the appointments were usually not directly within their own jurisdiction but in other more familiar provinces. After accumulating enough experience over a dozen or so years, they would return these individuals. This way, it would gain public acceptance.</p><p></p><p>Even if the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance investigated, it would still fully comply with regulations, making it impossible to find any fault.</p><p></p><p>In the duties of the Linker, this arrangement took up a large portion of the responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Fan assumed office, he was immediately faced with this task.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was widely known that there were many key positions vacant in Tianliang Province.</p><p></p><p>With numerous factions vying for a share, balancing everyone's interests to ensure satisfaction was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>If things went well, it was all part of the job. But if mistakes occurred, Nangong Shirong could easily push Xu Bai out to take the blame, appeasing everyone's anger.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed a well-thought-out plan.</p><p></p><p>Faced with a multitude of incoming invitations, Xu Bai simply ignored them all.</p><p></p><p>After feigning illness, concealing his whereabouts, he went straight back to Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong sent a message inquiring, and Xu Bai just smiled faintly in response, saying, "Let's leave them hanging for now. Any problems, let the city lord handle it all for me!"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Nangong Shirong replied with a "clever" and then went silent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, who returned smoothly, took out the "True Temptation Fruit" and entered the Medicine King Ding.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan's sleeping room was next to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai entered smoothly.</p><p></p><p>With minimal alteration of his thoughts, he changed the image of Liu Yihang in Jiang Yushan's memory to that of Li Fan. He then implanted the suggestion of trusting "Liu Yihang" deeply.</p><p></p><p>He called Liu San in and woke Jiang Yushan up in his presence.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan's eyelashes trembled slightly, and Liu San's face was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai quietly moved away a bit.</p><p></p><p>Surely enough, when Jiang Yushan woke up, her eyes initially showed confusion.</p><p></p><p>There was a black light like a sword, full of hostility.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai faintly felt an atmosphere similar to the Longevity Qingli flowing from her. It was indeed a bit unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Yushan, it's me!" Liu San hurriedly blocked the black death light and called out.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan was momentarily stunned, then closed her eyes tightly, concealing the killing intent in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, she opened her eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Did we return to the Qianyi Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Her voice was not as soft and gentle as that of an ordinary female cultivator but rather hoarse and grating, like metal rubbing against metal.</p><p></p><p>However, Liu San paid no attention, explaining the ins and outs of the matter to Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>"Back to the Xuanhuang Realm again?"</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years have passed?"</p><p></p><p>Even though this female cultivator had spent a long time in the cruel Indefinite Hell.</p><p></p><p>Having heard this extraordinary news suddenly, she became a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go out and take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Obviously, she did not fully trust Liu San.</p><p></p><p>At Liu San's signal, Xu Bai released her from the Medicine King Ding.</p><p></p><p>Then, led by Liu San, she took a walk around the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, she returned somewhat disoriented.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, your subconscious attack against me was due to the karma of the catastrophic Calamity." Liu San took the initiative to find a reason for Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>Frowning slightly, Jiang Yushan said, "To prevent myself from killing you, I better switch back to my original cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Liu San waved his hand repeatedly, "No need, no need. Right now, the sect urgently needs the Longevity Pill, and you happen to have the Longevity Qingli to help me refine together."</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Yushan decisively refused, "I'm afraid that the Longevity Qingli I cultivate may be somewhat different from the one used by your Medicine King Sect. The pills produced might lead to violent tendencies if ingested."</p><p></p><p>"You'd better find someone else!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San's face froze.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, besides me, you are the only one who still possesses the Doctrine of Saving Lives and Longevity," he stuttered.</p><p></p><p>"The karma of the incompatible cultivation methods' Calamity is truly terrifying. If there are more than three people involved, it might become uncontrollable."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan's eyes flashed with a hint of coldness, causing Liu San's words to come to a halt.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiang, rest assured in refining the pills, even if there are some side effects, the current Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance cultivators won't mind.@</p><p></p><p>At a critical moment, Xu Bai resolved the situation for Liu San.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 661</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Shuofeng seemed to be savoring the feeling of the wooden sword protecting himself just now, and it took a long time before he snapped out of it.</p><p></p><p>"The sword of counter-attack..." he shook his head, "I think it is the sword of stopping conflict, the sword of non-battle."</p><p></p><p>Without much explanation, Shuofeng continued, "With the normal power of the Nascent Soul's Cave, one can counter-attack without pressure. If it's a full force from the Nascent Soul, it would be somewhat strained. Above the Dao of Harmony..."</p><p></p><p>"Friend Daoist, you are only at the Foundation Establishment realm now, yet you can achieve such an astonishing level. If you advance to the Nascent Soul stage, would you not be able to contend with the Dao of Harmony?" Lifan showed a very shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple. Even between those attuned to the Dao of Harmony, they cannot be mentioned in the same breath. The essence of heaven and earth is divided into..."</p><p></p><p>Lifan was inclined to focus and listen, but he saw Shuofeng just opening his mouth without any sound coming out.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Shuofeng also realized this and promptly closed his mouth without saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Lifan, thoughtful, refrained from further inquiry.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, although I possess the wonders of heaven, if I want to defeat Mother, I still have a long way to go," Shuofeng bitterly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, although building the Foundation with the wonders of heaven is strong, it also has its drawbacks. For example, wanting to advance in realms is much more difficult and slow compared to ordinary cultivators. Even with sufficient resources and new methods, it remains the same."</p><p></p><p>Lifan was hearing this for the first time and immediately inquired, "Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng straightforwardly replied, "The wonders of heaven are actually the laws of heaven. Building the Foundation with the wonders of heaven makes it difficult to accommodate other things."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary cultivators need to peek at the laws of heaven and earth, seize the essence of heaven and earth, extract the marrow of heaven and earth, and consecrate the soul of heaven and earth step by step. But for wonders of heaven cultivators, it is different. They establish the Foundation with the wonders of heaven as law, with the wonders of heaven as the Nascent Soul's Cave, as the change of heaven and earth, as the soul of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Just by continuously comprehending one's own wonders of heaven to the utmost, one can smoothly progress without hindrance, aiming straight for the realm of the Dao of Harmony."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lifan couldn't help but ask, "Isn't this a good thing? Why do you say it's more difficult to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng countered, "Friend Daoist, don't you think, compared to forcefully obtaining external objects, this method of cultivation reliant on one's own comprehension has a greater advantage in terms of cultivation speed?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally..." Lifan seemed to grasp something but suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shuo, are you suggesting that building the Foundation with the wonders of heaven is more like cultivating with ancient methods?" Lifan involuntarily changed his address and hastily asked.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, it's like practicing with a yoke, using ancient methods," Shuofeng sighed lightly. "This is where the advantages and disadvantages lie. Nonetheless, I have no regrets, although the journey is more arduous, the upper limit is higher!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Lifan suddenly asked, "If achieving the Dao of Harmony with the wonders of heaven means the next step is to go against the concept of the wonders of heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng's eyes flashed with approval, "That's right! Where is the difficulty in reaching the Immortality Realm? The logic of heaven and earth, ethereal and elusive, is just an abstract concept, difficult for ordinary people to grasp. Trying to reverse it, how easy can that be?"</p><p></p><p>"Finding the logic of heaven and earth, becoming familiar with it, mastering it, and reversing it..."</p><p></p><p>"These all need to be accomplished in the realm of the Dao of Harmony. Although the lifespan of a Daoist is long, every step forward requires extremely arduous efforts. Throughout history, how many talented individuals ended up falling at the final step?"</p><p></p><p>"And by building the Foundation with the wonders of heaven, one directly crosses the first step. In the process of self-cultivation that starts with the Foundation, one is already accomplishing the second and third steps. It is as if one has saved half the effort."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng tried to explain to Lifan in plain and intelligible language.</p><p></p><p>Lifan was subtly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>"Finding, becoming familiar, mastering, reversing, perhaps correspond to the relevant realms in the Dao of Harmony."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lifan remembered that Ji Hongdao had once said when facing Zhao Shijie, "After attaining the 'Dao Principle,' one should no longer engage in worldly disputes."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Dao Principle' is about reversing the logic of heaven and earth, eventually replacing it and transforming oneself into a part of heaven and earth, truly entering the realm of immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Before that, Daoists still have four steps to take in the Dao of Harmony."</p><p></p><p>Observing Lifan lost in thought, Shuofeng couldn't help but advise, "Today's discussion is just to repay a favor by giving a hint. Friend Daoist must not aim too high and lose sight of oneself because of it. If so, I would have done a disservice."</p><p></p><p>Lifan snapped back to reality and replied with a smile, "Brother Shuo, you are overthinking it. I am not someone who doesn't know what's good for me. It's just that in the past, I believed that the gap between immortality and us cultivators was just a few major realms. It's not necessarily something unattainable for me."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems, there are several insurmountable chasms between us, each one enough to make one despair."</p><p></p><p>"But hope must be given." Shuofeng nodded in agreement and suddenly blurted out.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I don't even know your name. Judging by Friend Daoist's temperament and aptitude, you should not be an ordinary nobody," Shuofeng looked at Lifan, somewhat curious, and asked.</p><p></p><p>Lifan replied by bowing slightly, "I am Lifan!"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng narrowed his eyes, carefully examining Lifan.</p><p></p><p>"It's just the same name and surname! I've also been misunderstood by many in the past!" Lifan explained.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>"I am good at observing qi. Passing by here, I sensed something amiss, so I descended to investigate. Who would have known that before I could find any results, I almost lost my life due to Friend Daoist." Lifan took the initiative to explain the cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I also feel something is amiss around here." Shuofeng suddenly realized, looking towards a nearby direction.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, he seemed not to have noticed the statue of Han Yishi's presence, simply relying on instincts to perceive the abnormality in that area.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>"How about joining me to explore further, Friend Daoist?" Lifan proposed.</p><p></p><p>"That's my intention." Shuofeng evidently was someone unafraid of trouble and readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to set off, the sky suddenly turned pink.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng's expression changed suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Crimson snowflakes began to drift down slowly.</p><p></p><p>A melodious female voice suddenly sounded, "Feng'er, it has been a long time away from home, it is time to return."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng's face slightly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>However, he dared not resist his mother's will, just showing a apologetic expression to Lifan.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Mother." He responded.</p><p></p><p>Grasping a snowflake, the crimson color dissolved in Shuofeng's palm.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his figure became blurry.</p><p></p><p>Gradually disappearing into the air.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a communication talisman fell from the sky and flew towards Lifan.</p><p></p><p>"If you need help in the future, feel free to contact me, Brother Li."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng's voice faintly echoed.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

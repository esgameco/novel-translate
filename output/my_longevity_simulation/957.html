        <h1>Chapter 957</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>One after another, the two Heavenly Doctors' appearances and auras were no different from what Li Fan had seen in this world. </p><p></p><p>However, the previous Heavenly Doctor who personally created the endless tragedy of Yunshui Heavenly Palace had a very indifferent expression throughout the entire process.</p><p></p><p>There was even a sense of enjoyment deep in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The degree of perversion made Li Fan feel ashamed of himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the later Heavenly Doctor, the shock, pain and regret in his eyes could not be concealed no matter what.</p><p></p><p>The slight trembling of his body could also explain his current mood very well.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor slightly opened his mouth, seeming to say something.</p><p></p><p>But the restored scene ended there.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Someone disguised as the Heavenly Doctor and massacred the entire Yunshui Heavenly Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Doctor arrived too late and was powerless to turn the tide?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling what the Heavenly Doctor had said to Tianyu and Tianjue before, "What you see may not be real".</p><p></p><p>As well as the Heavenly Doctor's actions of treating Tianjue and sealing Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but come to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"But simple framing can't explain why the misunderstanding was never cleared up, but instead deepened over thousands of years of torment for the people of Yunshui Heavenly Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the answer to this question can be found from Hanhai."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>It was another nightmare cycle. When the fake Heavenly Doctor used darkness to obscure Hanhai's perception,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, like a beam of light, slightly illuminated the darkness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he kept replaying the scenes he had previously restored, trying to awaken Hanhai's sleeping consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Wake up! Wake up!"</p><p></p><p>"The killer is not the Heavenly Doctor!"</p><p></p><p>"The real killer is someone else! Someone impersonated the Heavenly Doctor to sow discord!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The mental fluctuations kept echoing in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, as if stirring up huge waves, the surrounding space and images became shaky and unstable.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up! Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't even think about fooling me!"</p><p></p><p>"Appearance and aura can be faked, but how can the Dao Authority they wield be forged!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Fan's nagging provoked Hanhai's rage.</p><p></p><p>The azure face appeared in the surrounding spherical space.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai looked at Li Fan, the kind man trying to wake him up, with resentment as if looking at a mortal enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Scoundrel! Still trying to delude me!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not the Heavenly Doctor! It must be some other Venerated!"</p><p></p><p>"They all deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>"You deserve to die too!"</p><p></p><p>The voice thundered, and streams of black light surged from Hanhai's illusory giant face.</p><p></p><p>Then thousands of azure giant palms slapped out together, directly crushing Li Fan's surrounded divine sense!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Humph."</p><p></p><p>In the real Yunshui Heavenly Palace, Li Fan, who had lost contact with his split divine sense, let out a muffled groan.</p><p></p><p>However, this minor injury was quickly repaired under the natural operation of the [Infinite Void Dharma].</p><p></p><p>"Dao Authority, Venerated..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, recalling what Hanhai had said in his rage.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Hanhai and the others, tormented by memories to the point of madness, have always firmly believed they didn't mistake the killer."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that besides appearance, what can better represent their identities is the Dao Authority."</p><p></p><p>"Tianjue should be the Dao of Killing."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyu should be the Dao of Preaching."</p><p></p><p>The Way of Transformation." </p><p></p><p>"The Way of the Heavenly Physician is obviously the way of practicing medicine."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but recall the scene when he first met Tian Yu.</p><p></p><p>The green ox pulled the cart, with the two guardians, Bu Yu Guai and Li Luan Shen, standing at the door.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu, like a master, taught all the disciples who entered the cottage.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Law is solemn, respect the rules and keep the discipline."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have obtained the Dharma, I will spread it to all living beings."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Law cannot be violated."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the sound of reading books that he vaguely heard outside the cottage back then.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Heavenly Law Realm is the name of the small world where Tian Yi and the others live."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the Xuanhuang Realm, where everyone wants to replace the Heavens, in the Heavenly Law Realm, the status of the Heavenly Dao seems to be extremely high."</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jue, Tian Yu, and Tian Yi, rather than being powerful immortal cultivators, are more like representatives of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm stole the power of longevity from the Ruomu Fruit. However, in the Heavenly Law Realm, perhaps due to the absence of Ruomu, the only way for cultivators to achieve longevity is to become the executors of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Connecting the past clues, Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>By piecing together the information, the past secrets of Tian Yi gradually surfaced.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also recalled that Zhang Haibo had once enlightened on the sword hilt that trapped Qing Feng. After his death, the information revealed in the falling heavenly curtain of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was to establish the Dao foundation with [Heavenly Killing Sword Intent].</p><p></p><p>However, after encountering Tian Jue, all the people in the Yunshui Heavenly Palace referred to the sword used by Tian Jue as [Heavenly Killing].</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan had vaguely guessed that this might be the different evolution of that sword in different worlds.</p><p></p><p>Now it was indeed confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Killing, like Tian Jue and Tian Yu, may also be a kind of Heavenly Authority."</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jue possesses two kinds of Heavenly Authority, which may be the reason why he was able to preserve his life and didn't turn into a monster, but only became a bit crazy."</p><p></p><p>"Only Tian Yi, who went out for some reason, escaped the disaster."</p><p></p><p>"When he returned, it was already too late, and the Heavenly Law Realm had long become a land of death..."</p><p></p><p>Although some puzzles were solved, the unknown did not diminish at all. Instead, hidden in the fog, it became even more confusing. </p><p></p><p>Who exactly was the one who impersonated Tian Yi and committed the crime?</p><p></p><p>According to Hanhai, he was definitely not as simple as just changing his appearance.</p><p></p><p>He truly grasped the Heavenly Authority of the Heavenly Law Realm, which was why the people of Yunshui Heavenly Palace regarded him as [Venerable].</p><p></p><p>He could even freely switch between Tian Yi and Tian Jue...</p><p></p><p>This person's strength was truly unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>What was even more puzzling was what grudge this person, with such strength, had against the Heavenly Law Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he want to slaughter the entire sect, but he also wanted the Heavenly Law Realm to fall into endless self-slaughter even after its destruction.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Outside Hanhai's residence, Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Did Tian Yi send me here to guide me to know the truth of what happened back then?"</p><p></p><p>"The black resentment entangling Hanhai has accumulated over thousands of years. I'm afraid that with my current level of medical attainment, I may not be able to resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"However, I can see that this seems to be the result after being purified more than once. Apparently, over these years, Tian Yi has not abandoned the people of Yunshui Heavenly Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they have already turned into monsters."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>Judging by the actions and not the intentions, such behavior made Li Fan's alertness towards Tian Yi slightly decrease.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>And that massive, monstrous beast seemed to have lost all power to resist, unable to even struggle.</p><p></p><p>It could only allow the raging purple flames to devour and incinerate its body.</p><p></p><p>The sound of wailing spread throughout the Sea of Clouds, striking fear into the hearts of all who heard it.</p><p></p><p>The Kun Peng fell from the ninth heaven like a falling meteor, plummeting straight down to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>It drew a vertical purple line between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As it descended, its body continuously shrank.</p><p></p><p>By the time it was about to hit the sea surface, it had been completely consumed by the purple flames.</p><p></p><p>Not even ashes were left behind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng, dead!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the demon beast vanquished, the purple figure in the sky gave another indifferent glance.</p><p></p><p>Then, just as it had arrived, the sky full of rosy clouds quickly dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The purple figure also gradually dimmed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Wuchi'er? No, that's not right..." </p><p></p><p>The voice of the Black Crow Immortal Master rang out from the sky, full of surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>With that said, the one-eyed crow spread its wings slightly and turned into a black line, chasing after the direction in which the purple qi had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Sea of Clouds had not yet recovered from the shock brought about by this strange event, all standing there as if petrified.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, on Wanxian Island, there was an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"What was that just now?"</p><p></p><p>"Which great power manifested? Such a terrifying Kun Peng monster was directly struck dead by a bolt of lightning?"</p><p></p><p>"A Immortal Master at the Unification Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"I think an ordinary cultivator at the Unification Realm might not necessarily be able to do this."</p><p></p><p>"Above the Unification Realm? Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Like everyone else, Li Fan was also extremely shocked at this moment.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not shocked by how terrifying the strength of this purple figure was.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he was shaken by its identity.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother... Zhang?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at the sky where the purple qi had dissipated, his heart filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He had heard that cold, indifferent voice many times before and was extremely familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the familiar four words "evil demons and heretics" and that bolt of Purple Heaven Divine Lightning that easily slayed Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was almost certain that the purple figure sitting high in the sky just now was none other than Senior Brother Zhang, whom he had met in the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>An inner disciple of the Purple Heaven Sect, suspected to be the reincarnation of a great power;</p><p></p><p>Possessing extraordinary strength, mastering the mysterious Purple Heaven Nirvana Technique, killing Golden Core cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage as easily as slaughtering chickens.</p><p></p><p>Proud and aloof, he once made three great vows.</p><p></p><p>The first great vow was to "kill all the demons in the world and restore a bright and clear universe."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that not only has Senior Brother Zhang survived from ancient times to the present, he may have even accomplished his first great vow."</p><p></p><p>Recalling Zhang Qianmo's words "evil demons and heretics, still dare to come out and court death", combined with the memories Ye Feipeng had obtained - the demon beasts in the world fleeing in panic back then, and the current state of the cultivation world where demon beasts have disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could infer that the demon beasts and evil demons in this cultivation world had probably all been frightened out of their wits by Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were not completely extinct, they could only hide somewhere, never daring to set foot in the cultivation world again.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Feipeng had extraordinary luck, awakening his own Kun Peng bloodline and using it to forcibly devour Chi Yan.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining the qualifications to ascend in one step and reach the Unification Realm of the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Misfortune lurks where fortune rests, and fortune perches where misfortune crouches.</p><p></p><p>It was also because of this demonic Kun Peng bloodline that he attracted the attention of Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>In order to be able to swallow Chi Yan and Zhang Zhiliang in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Little Fatty Ye Feipeng must have circulated the power of the Kun Peng bloodline within his body to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>There must have also been the help of the Canhai Pearl, making him look almost exactly like the ancient demon beast Kun Peng.</p><p></p><p>That's why he suffered Senior Brother Zhang's merciless execution.</p><p></p><p>Another question arose in Li Fan's mind - what exactly was Senior Brother Zhang's cultivation level now?</p><p></p><p>Unification Realm, or Eternal Life Venerable?</p><p></p><p>When the Kun Peng appeared, Zhang Qianmo's figure did not manifest in time.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the monster completed the act of devouring Chi Yan and was about to flee far away that Zhang Qianmo arrived belatedly at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Feipeng had fled far away directly after swallowing Chi Yan, instead of crowing proudly and emitting bursts of cries.</p><p></p><p>Would he have been able to avoid Zhang Qianmo's attack?</p><p></p><p>And thus survived?</p><p></p><p>The face of Little Fatty Ye Feipeng appeared before his eyes, and Li Fan couldn't help but shake his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing that there exists such a god of slaughter targeting demon beasts in the world, the ancestor of the Ye family still chose to pass on his essence blood to a mortal back then when he saved that Kun Peng..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it seems he didn't have any good intentions."</p><p></p><p>"Those who are not of our kind, their hearts must be different."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhang, you did well!"</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan sighed in his heart, he also frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that Zhang Qianmo's voice just now seemed to be a superposition of two voices.</p><p></p><p>One was his original voice.</p><p></p><p>And the other was a childish voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wuchi'er, reincarnation of a great power, purple lightning..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes as a past event surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>When he first annihilated Si Kong Yi, the inheritor of the Stealing Heaven Swapping Sun Sect.</p><p></p><p>He learned through the two remnant souls in the Stealing Heaven Swapping Sun Token how Si Kong Yi's cheap master, Si Kong Bo, had escaped to the Sea of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Si Kong Bo wanted to refine a clone, and by chance, he encountered a little baby with unparalleled talent and even more extraordinary luck in a desolate mountain village.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to steal the baby's essence blood, but was a bit depressed to find that a Nascent Soul cultivator also had his eye on this baby.</p><p></p><p>Si Kong Bo had a big battle with this Nascent Soul cultivator, and when both were badly injured.</p><p></p><p>The little baby suddenly appeared and, without a second word, directly refined the Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Si Kong Bo ran for his life, but the little baby was very familiar with the techniques of the Stealing Heaven Swapping Sun Sect.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he couldn't shake him off.</p><p></p><p>Left with no choice, in order to survive, Si Kong Bo had no choice but to release all the remnant souls in the Stealing Heaven Swapping Sun Token.</p><p></p><p>Although he successfully escaped with his life, the souls of the sect's past patriarchs were all struck to ashes by a purple lightning bolt that descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Was the little baby Si Kong Bo encountered back then Senior Brother Zhang?"</p><p></p><p>"Also Wuchi'er?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had previously seen information about this Wuchi'er in Tianyu Province.</p><p></p><p>He was a six or seven-year-old child who was obsessed with martial prowess and especially liked to challenge others.</p><p></p><p>But he had a shockingly high combat power. It was said that he was only at the Nascent Soul realm, but was almost invincible at the same level.</p><p></p><p>He could even fight evenly with Primordial Spirit cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan did not associate him with the little baby in Si Kong Bo's memory.</p><p></p><p>He certainly didn't expect him to be the reincarnation of Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>"No, the might of a single divine lightning bolt killing the Kun Peng just now is not something a Nascent Soul cultivator could achieve."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine ability is Senior Brother Zhang cultivating?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering, the exclamations of the cultivators beside him interrupted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look! Zhang Zhiliang is still alive."</p><p></p><p>"Chi Yan! Chi Yan is there too!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan abruptly raised his head and saw that where the Kun Peng's corpse had been burned to ashes in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang's somewhat disheveled figure had reappeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Chi Yan stood facing him, his fiery shadow flickering.</p>

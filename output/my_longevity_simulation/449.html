        <h1>Chapter 449</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After all, your ability to double your capital every two years at will, yet you always stay inside the Tianxuan Mirror like an ordinary cultivator, which is a bit unacceptable. Although it can be explained by being unsociable by nature, considering the possible publicity effect of "joining the Wuxian Alliance shortly after and buying a cave mansion on Wuxian Island," Li Fan really had the idea of buying a cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>After a search, he had to give up helplessly. There must be contributions, not just the requirement of permission levels within the Wuxian Alliance system, but also the need to obtain the "Residence Permit" issued by the Prefectural Hall of Wuxian Island to qualify for purchasing a cave mansion on Wuxian Island. This residency permit is usually only granted to cultivators who have made special contributions to the local Wuxian Alliance. However, it is said that there may be alternative ways to purchase privately, which is hard to verify.</p><p></p><p>"Let's just stay honestly in the Tianxuan Mirror." Li Fan abandoned the thought.</p><p></p><p>Taking out the "Enlightenment Pill" that Chen Ying had just given him, he swallowed it in one gulp, carefully feeling the changes happening within himself.</p><p></p><p>It resembled the effect of the Enlightenment Pill, but the Enlightenment Pill was more comprehensive, providing assistance in studying martial arts, deducing secret methods, and advancing cultivation levels. As for this Enlightenment Pill, its effect could only be felt when Li Fan wanted to make a breakthrough in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Equivalent to a basic, specialized version of the Enlightenment Pill. Check out the new chapters on novel69.com."</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightenment Pill is hard to come across in the Wuxian Alliance, this Enlightenment Pill is not bad."</p><p></p><p>To avoid wasting it, Li Fan held onto the duration of the pill's effect and began practicing.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Li Fan was suddenly awakened by an inexplicable feeling within his heart. It turned out that the restrictions on entering the Meteor Immortal Realm had disappeared, allowing him to go there again.</p><p></p><p>"It seems more immersed than previous seclusions. I just feel a bit drowsy, and time passes so quickly."</p><p></p><p>"It's really awe-inspiring."</p><p></p><p>"Such talent, I hope he can survive this calamity."</p><p></p><p>Having this thought, Li Fan set up a ceremony around him.</p><p></p><p>"May the Supreme Grand Yellow Heaven bestow blessings!"</p><p></p><p>Uttering these words, the next moment, amidst spinning heavens and earth, Li Fan landed back in the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>As expected, he was enveloped in an unknown liquid and surrounded by darkness.</p><p></p><p>Once again, he became the Celestial Fate Mystery Bird still inside its egg.</p><p></p><p>Feeling tired and weak everywhere, Li Fan tried to absorb the liquid around him to stay conscious, contemplating strategies at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the experience of Ye Feipeng in the previous life, the 'Creation Baking Furnace Art' is also useful for creatures like demonic beasts. Although my body is currently too fragile, forcefully utilizing the Hidden Treasure Power might have repercussions that I can't bear."</p><p></p><p>"However, with Xu Ke by my side, it should be fine."</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try. If it doesn't work, I can always start over. Check out the new chapters on novel69.com."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Focusing his mind, like a giant hammer, he fiercely launched an attack within his body.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>A scorching power suddenly burst out from within, as if wanting to incinerate everything.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was on the brink of dissolution, and in a daze, Li Fan seemed to hear Xu Ke's faint cries of shock.</p><p></p><p>Then, he fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown time, Li Fan gradually regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously checking his own situation, Li Fan realized that he was much stronger than before he fell into a coma.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Treasure Power that had been initially activated kept emerging from all over his body, transforming the body of the Celestial Fate Mystery Bird.</p><p></p><p>In the surrounding dark liquid, there seemed to be another kind of energy present, shimmering with a fiery red light like stars.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, Xu Ke."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan greedily devoured a few of them and instantly felt much more energetic.</p><p></p><p>"This... is..."</p><p></p><p>"A great supplement. Indeed, Xu Ke, you are quite capable. You truly are favored by fate."</p><p></p><p>With his worries eased, Li Fan completely absorbed the consumed items and felt his body restored to its optimal state.</p><p></p><p>Once again, Li Fan focused his mind and launched an attack with his Hidden Treasure Power.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening now?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xu Ke's pained cries before he passed out, Li Fan chuckled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke did not let him down and, after painstaking efforts, managed to rescue the dying Celestial Fate Mystery Bird.</p><p></p><p>This led Li Fan to boldly and recklessly operate the "Creation Baking Furnace Art."</p><p></p><p>Whenever he couldn't bear it, he could rely on Xu Ke's incredible luck to find a corresponding solution.</p><p></p><p>After repeating this seven times, the liquid around him was completely absorbed, and Li Fan felt that it was time.</p><p></p><p>With a loud cry, Li Fan clawed at the eggshell.</p><p></p><p>Cracks spread, followed by a bright light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan broke through the shell directly.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing the shattered eggshell, Li Fan stared at the dumbfounded Xu Ke and playfully patted him on the head.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's not yet completed the spiritual bonding of the 'Spiritual Taming Decision.' How did it come out?"</p><p></p><p>"Has this ended in vain?"</p><p></p><p>With a lamenting face, Xu Ke kept muttering.</p><p></p><p>Not holding back, Li Fan gave him a claw, conveying that he was "hungry."</p><p></p><p>With a cry of surprise, Xu Ke had no choice but to take Li Fan into the mountains to search for food.</p><p></p><p>While practicing the "Creation Baking Furnace Art," Li Fan also sensed the connection between himself and Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Subtly, a cold breath of energy circulated throughout his body, seemingly responding to Xu Ke below him.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Li Fan's practice of the "Creation Baking Furnace Art" and his initial control over his body, it would have been hard to discover.</p><p></p><p>Since in this life, Li Fan autonomously broke out of the shell, that unbreakable connection had not yet fully formed.</p><p></p><p>"So, this is the 'Spirit Taming Decision'?"</p><p></p><p>Deep in his thoughts, Li Fan fiercely gave Xu Ke a claw, causing him to howl in pain.</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Fan resumed practicing the mystic arts of "The Fate is Mine."</p><p></p><p>By absorbing Xu Ke's overflowing luck, Li Fan suddenly felt a surge of energy.</p><p></p><p>Under the dual influence of the "Creation Baking Furnace Art" and "The Fate is Mine," although still in its infancy, Li Fan's strength grew by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to his cultivation in the past life, strengthening his own soul and willpower, Li Fan's influence from the characteristics of the Celestial Fate Mystery Bird had also diminished significantly.</p><p></p><p>At least he wouldn't exhibit the uncontrolled behavior from before.</p><p></p><p>After over a month, when Xu Ke was distracted, Li Fan tried his hand against wild demonic beasts in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Normal Qi Refinement stage demonic beasts were no longer a match for him.</p><p></p><p>One day, as usual, Xu Ke was foraging with Li Fan when they were suddenly blocked by an unexpected visitor.</p><p></p><p>It was Song Yang, who had been coveting the Celestial Fate Mystery Bird.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan noticed the gaze of the black two-headed snake coiled around Song Yang's neck and coldly smirked.</p><p></p><p>A vague aura of killing intent materialized and attacked it.</p><p></p><p>The black two-headed snake immediately shivered all over, coiling into a ball.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1324</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1313: Transaction Under the High Wall</p><p></p><p>"Exchange insights..." Li Fan pondered for a long time without agreeing. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhong Daoqing let out a long sigh. Black and white ink flowed and formed symbols in the void. </p><p></p><p>"Friend, please observe," said Zhong Daoqing solemnly. Even in this uninhabited cosmic ocean, he still set up restrictions around them to prevent the symbols from leaking out.</p><p></p><p>The symbols flickered bright and dim, moving about like living spirits.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at them and casually said, "So it's the character 'zeng'..."</p><p></p><p>"However, your understanding of 'zeng' seems to have some misconceptions."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhong Daoqing's expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to speak, he heard Li Fan say arrogantly, "Let me show you my version of the 'zeng' character."</p><p></p><p>With a few strokes, another symbol that looked completely identical suddenly appeared. </p><p></p><p>The two 'zeng' characters stood side by side.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing stared at the true celestial script written by Li Fan and was stunned at first. Then his body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>As the great elder of the Duan Xian Lou and the deepest researcher of true celestial script on the Xuan Xian Zhou, Zhong Daoqing could clearly discern the subtle differences between these two characters.</p><p></p><p>From the faint fluctuations emanating from the two characters, the completeness of the one written by the other party was clearly superior to his own!</p><p></p><p>The degree to which it surpassed even exceeded the previous 'li' character!</p><p></p><p>"This, this..." Zhong Daoqing, struck repeatedly, had difficulty accepting it for a moment. However, years of research instinct made him temporarily put aside all distractions and ponder the 'zeng' character written by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Every subtle modification brought it closer to the original true meaning. If he had to explore it himself, it might take ten or twenty years to catch up.</p><p></p><p>But now, with just a glance, it was equivalent to countless days and nights of painstaking research.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhong Daoqing did not know that the 'zeng' character before him actually originated from himself decades into the future. At this moment, there was only one thought in his mind:</p><p></p><p>He must "invite" this cultivator back to the Xuan Xian Zhou, by any means necessary!</p><p></p><p>The true celestial script was far too important for the Xuan Xian Zhou. Understanding each additional character would undoubtedly greatly enhance the sect's strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that crucial plan they envisioned also required collecting as many different types of true celestial scripts as possible.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, after deeply imprinting the new 'zeng' character in his memory, Zhong Daoqing turned to Li Fan and sighed in admiration, "Friend's level is profoundly high, I am far inferior!"</p><p></p><p>"However...in my homeland, there are more than ten scholars studying the true celestial script like me. They have cultivated for many years, and in terms of understanding the true celestial script, they are all not inferior to me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, a hint of disdain flashing in his eyes, interrupting Zhong Daoqing's words: "To be honest, in our Great Qi..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused briefly, "Everyone is united with one heart for the goal of surviving in the apocalyptic cosmic ocean. The research on the true celestial script is fully shared. In contrast, on your side..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhong Daoqing became even more delighted and explained seriously, "Actually, we also have a similar sharing system. But after all, these are the research results of others, so it is inconvenient for me to demonstrate them without review. However, if you are willing to share and exchange, I dare guarantee that there will definitely be new gains."</p><p></p><p>"Friend must also know the difficulty of studying the true celestial script. If we can complement each other's strengths and weaknesses..."</p><p></p><p>After some persuasion, Zhong Daoqing finally made Li Fan waver.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Zhong Daoqing even gave him a strong incentive: "In my homeland, there is also an authentic true celestial script transcription. If our exchange goes well, I may be able to let you take a look."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing was well aware of the immense temptation a true celestial script transcription held for people like them. After saying this, he stared intently at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Zhong Daoqing's affirmative answer, Li Fan finally nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"However, for the first exchange, let's do it here in this void," Li Fan suddenly added.</p><p></p><p>With a casual point towards the distance, silver-white lines connected and unfolded, gradually forming a grand formation.</p><p></p><p>Within the formation, pavilions and towers rose from the ground, with small bridges and flowing streams in between. Under the bridges, clear streams flowed, the rippling waves reflecting light, and even fish could be seen frolicking within.</p><p></p><p>The interplay of light and shadow made it seem illusory yet real.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene before him, Zhong Daoqing's pupils constricted sharply.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew into the formation first and sat down in a pavilion by the water, looking back and saying, "Let's do it here."</p><p></p><p>"The saying 'one can never be too cautious' holds true. On this trip to the edge of the cosmic ocean, I am alone, so I must be careful," Li Fan said with an air of self-evidence.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing pondered for a moment, then also flew into the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of birds chirping reached his ears, and as he walked across the bridge, the flowing water passed beneath him. Zhong Daoqing could even feel the moist warmth in the air.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine that this illusory scene of pavilions, flowing water, and bridges was instantly created by a formation technique!</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that besides the true celestial script, you are also skilled in formation techniques," Zhong Daoqing observed his surroundings, vaguely realizing that this seemed to be merely a formation for constructing pavilions in the cosmic ocean. However, to produce such an illusion that even he could hardly distinguish from reality undoubtedly demonstrated the extraordinary nature of this formation.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a trivial skill," Li Fan said nonchalantly. "Studying the true celestial script has already consumed all my efforts. Where would I have the energy to delve into formation techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>After observing the formation for a while and finding nothing amiss, Zhong Daoqing cupped his hands and said, "Then let it be settled. Friend, please wait here. Before this incense burns out, I will definitely arrive with others."</p><p></p><p>As Zhong Daoqing spoke, he waved his wide sleeve, and a stick of yellowish-brown incense flew out, standing upright in the air.</p><p></p><p>The flame had already been lit, and the fragrant smoke wafted about. Zhong Daoqing bid farewell and left, his figure disappearing into the dark cosmic ocean.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze lingered for a long while before finally returning to Yin Shengren and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Master..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had suddenly left and been gone for a long time, so Yin Shengren and the others naturally knew he must have encountered some trouble. Now that Li Fan had reappeared, they inquired with concern.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, there are still surviving civilizations at the edge of this cosmic ocean. It seems that when I set up the formation to connect to the Xuan Huang Realm earlier, it alerted them," Li Fan said gravely.</p><p></p><p>His words were earth-shattering. Everyone was stunned: "Here? Where there is only deathly stillness, where could they be living?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm still not clear on that. I've only had an initial encounter. However, to have survived in the apocalyptic cosmic ocean until now, these people are definitely no ordinary beings. For now, don't reveal yourselves. Wait until I have investigated further."</p><p></p><p>Cosmic Ocean...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The unknown in this world is an enemy, not a friend. No matter how careful and cautious, it is not too much.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the gap before the Xianzhou crowd arrived, Li Fan continued to lecture Yin Shangren and others. </p><p></p><p>"Relics contain the remnant power of true immortals, and world fragments are even more so. If the world fragments permeated with the remnant power of true immortals are absorbed by the Xuanhuang realm..."</p><p></p><p>"It may cause turmoil in the world and devastation to all living beings."</p><p></p><p>"However, it has been so many years since the great catastrophe in the star sea. There must be some remnant realms where the power of true immortals has already dissipated. Only those can serve as the catalyst medicine."  Li Fan spoke fluently.</p><p></p><p>"With so many of us acting separately, it shouldn't be too difficult to find a suitable catalyst medicine, right?" Qiaogong said, looking at the winding remnant realm wall in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly. </p><p></p><p>With a point of his fingertip forward, the illusory wooden sword flashed to the edge of the remnant realm wall.</p><p></p><p>"You might as well give it a try out there," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong was the first to leave the area covered by the illusory wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>The moment he reached the outside, Qiaogong's expression changed drastically. He seemed to be subjected to a tremendous suction force and flew uncontrollably towards the remnant realm wall!</p><p></p><p>"Stabilize!"</p><p></p><p>A layer of golden armor appeared on his body. Qiaogong struggled and expended quite some effort before finally managing to stabilize his form in the void.</p><p></p><p>However, he still could not stop the trend of moving towards the remnant realm wall. The light of the armor on his body kept flickering, as if about to reach its limit.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan manipulated the illusory wooden sword to cover Qiaogong again.</p><p></p><p>Free from the terrifying suction force, Qiaogong looked at the remnant realm wall ahead with utter fear.</p><p></p><p>"There's also a celestial ruin here?!" Everyone was shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>"Not a celestial ruin, but a high wall," Li Fan said slowly, his tone vague and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"The suction force from the celestial ruins was blocked by the high wall at the edge of the star sea. Then, in a way we cannot yet comprehend, it accumulated under the wall. Over time, it formed this unique celestial ruin."</p><p></p><p>"The reason the world fragments are connected is also to resist this rebounding star force..."</p><p></p><p>The scene depicted by Li Fan deeply shook everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Even though they could not see the invisible high wall, the fact that it could firmly imprison the suction force that could destroy the entire star sea was enough to prove its power and mystery.</p><p></p><p>"Acting in the remnant realm wall would not be much less than the suction force we experienced at the edge of the Xuanhuang realm. If we are not careful, we might lose control and collide with those remnant realms. If there is still remnant power of true immortals remaining..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stretched out his hand, and a rainbow-colored crystal as smooth as silk appeared in it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Void Clarity Flow Crystal. Combined with the Spectrum Refraction technique, it can resist this ubiquitous suction force to a certain extent."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, do not be reckless. When the rainbow light is only one-third left, you can leave in advance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan imparted the Void Clarity Flow Crystal and the Spectrum Refraction technique from the Dharma transmission to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you can reach the state of 'no sword, no self' like me, you may be able to ignore this rebounding star force to some extent." The illusory wooden sword flickered, bringing everyone back to the safe area.</p><p></p><p>"The remnant realm wall has countless world fragments. With just my strength alone, it would be extremely difficult to find a suitable catalyst medicine. So I need your assistance," Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Baixiang could not help but ask: "Master, what is your ultimate goal after all these efforts? Is it merely to help the Xuanhuang realm ascend and benefit from it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan laughed: "The Xuanhuang realm ascending and escaping the danger of annihilation. We are nourished by Heaven and Earth, so we may have a chance to break through the mortal limits. Isn't it a win-win situation?"</p><p></p><p>As others were about to ask further, they saw a flicker in Li Fan's eyes: "There are more people coming from over there. I'll go and come right back."</p><p></p><p>"You all stay here first and get familiar with the use of the Spectrum Refraction technique."</p><p></p><p>Before the words were finished, Li Fan's figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>On the illusory wooden sword, everyone remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Xu Ke broke the silence: "In fact, with the Master's strength alone, he could probably facilitate the ascension of the Xuanhuang realm. It would just take a bit more time."</p><p></p><p>"Yet he still brought us, these burdens... It reminds me of Mr. Bai back then."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke sighed, his eyes revealing infinite nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the others fell silent as well.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, from their perspective, they did not possess anything worth the Master's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Outside the grand formation of pavilions and towers.</p><p></p><p>The elderly from the Xianzhou gathered, not entering, but observing from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Their divine senses communicated: "What do you think, is it a trap?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems we were overly cautious. Indeed, there doesn't seem to be any offensive means, it should just be an illusory formation."</p><p></p><p>"But what can a mere formation do, no matter how powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, with so many of us, would we be afraid of just one person?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget, the other side also understands the true immortal glyphs, and may even have deeper knowledge than us..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Li Fan they had been waiting for slowly walked out of the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he held the incense stick left by Zhong Daogang.</p><p></p><p>The incense was one-third left. Li Fan looked around at everyone and nodded: "Indeed, a man of his word."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang introduced the others to Li Fan: "This is Gan Jingda. This is Nan Gonglie..."</p><p></p><p>After some pleasantries, Li Fan invited everyone to enter the formation for a detailed discussion.</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou crowd looked at each other, and eventually reached a consensus, following Li Fan into the formation.</p><p></p><p>They settled in a pavilion, and everyone present got straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, friend, how many true immortal glyphs have you fully analyzed so far?" Zhong Daogang asked directly.</p><p></p><p>This was a crucial question, and all the Xianzhou elders looked at Li Fan, waiting for his answer.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteen," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders looked at each other, most of them showing doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's a bit less. But only those with a completion rate of over ninety percent are counted," Li Fan added another sentence.</p><p></p><p>At this, the Xianzhou elders could no longer hold back and hastily asked: "Is this friend speaking the truth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled lightly, looking arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang waved his hand, and the Xianzhou elders gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that we don't believe you. It's just that thirteen true immortal glyphs, and ninety percent complete..."</p><p></p><p>"It's really quite hard to believe," Zhong Daogang looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said straightforwardly: "One glyph for one glyph."</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders communicated again and reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>"I have previously shown the 'leave' and 'hate' glyphs. Your turn this time," Li Fan said loudly, looking at the Xianzhou crowd.</p>

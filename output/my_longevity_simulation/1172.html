        <h1>Chapter 1172</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the 119th life, the Heavenly Doctor had told Li Fan, who was disguised as the successor of Tian Jue, that after reaching the realm of merging with the Dao, cultivation techniques become less important.</p><p></p><p>What's more crucial is the comprehension of the essence of the world and the operation of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, without the innate talent of Mr. Bai and those who pass down the teachings, how easy is it for an ordinary person to comprehend such a profound and mysterious Dao?</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan can indirectly gain insights through continuous reincarnation, relying on the geniuses of the Xuanhuang Realm and various opportunities, the effect is ultimately not as good as actual personal experience and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The discovery that the world can also be "insectified" opened up a new line of thought for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense that after the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven is insectified, my dominant consciousness within it is truly like how I previously dominated the Lingmu Realm. Using one's own body to transform the Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"What could be easier than comprehending oneself through oneself?"</p><p></p><p>"Although after insectification, perhaps the laws of the world will also have some deviations, but after all, it can still serve as a reference. And with the help of Huan Zhen, I can constantly start over and have enough opportunities for trial and error."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent."</p><p></p><p>The main body's thoughts turned, slowly planning for the future.</p><p></p><p>The perspective returns to Holy Emperor Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly subduing the insectified Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, Li Ping looked at the huge creature under his feet and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the plan was to use this Grotto-Heaven as a breeding ground for mutated spiritual energy, and release it all in the future battle against the Myriad Immortals Alliance, thoroughly changing the battlefield environment and catching the enemy off guard.</p><p></p><p>But now, this insectified Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven seems to have other greater uses.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's heart stirred, and outside the Grotto-Heaven, the mutated spiritual energy once again evolved into nine thick black tentacles, reaching towards the Great Qi Small World.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, the Great Qi Small World was simply like an ant under the feet of a giant.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Ping's deliberate guidance, the Heavenly Earth Myriad Spirits Formation and the Holy Dynasty's fortune collectively opened up their defenses, and the nine tentacles easily took deep root in the small world.</p><p></p><p>Then, they coiled around the world a few times from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>The giant formed by the Holy Dynasty's fortune, standing on the insectified Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, shouted in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Grotto-Heaven rumbled, instantly coming to life, slowly moving towards the depths of the void, away from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The nine tentacles were like iron chains, tethering the Great Qi Small World, slowly moving forward together.</p><p></p><p>"Using the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven as a reference, moving through the void is relatively slow now. But from the perspective of cultivators, it's quite fast. Almost a few times faster than a Hua Shen cultivator flying at full power."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sensed the growing distance from the Xuanhuang Realm and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, even though Li Ping had already made the Holy Dynasty's Great Qi impregnable, with the Patrolling Heaven Arrow, Heavenly Earth Myriad Spirits Formation, and many other defenses, there was always one problem that couldn't be avoided.</p><p></p><p>That is, the Great Qi Small World was too close to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without strategic depth, once the Myriad Immortals Alliance discovered its specific location, it could be caught in a desperate situation of being surrounded after a surprise attack.</p><p></p><p>But if it was hidden a little deeper...</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, the Rift Whale group has been opening up the void without stopping.</p><p></p><p>They have already created a perfect hiding environment.</p><p></p><p>"However, when they lock onto the location and want to attack, they will discover that the small world from back then has turned into a void. I imagine they will be quite bewildered."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"In the original location of the Great Enlightenment Small World, numerous deadly formations can be set up, waiting for the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals to walk right into the trap. Haha..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless schemes surged into Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>The slow overall movement of the Small World did not draw the attention of the citizens within the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Even the nine black tentacles deeply embedded into the world were only noticed by a handful of people including Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>However, upon learning that this was the handiwork of the Holy Emperor Li Ping, they could only sigh in admiration of the Holy Emperor's divine power.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, where are you planning to drag this world to..."</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, in the void.</p><p></p><p>Having received some help from Li Ping and recovered slightly, Hundred Flowers Daoist, upon sensing the world's unusual movement, hurriedly flew out to investigate.</p><p></p><p>What she saw, however, was the scene of the Insect-transformed Five Elements Grotto Heaven, with its nine tentacles pulling the Small World and rapidly advancing.</p><p></p><p>Even though she prided herself on being knowledgeable and experienced, she was still stunned by the scene before her eyes at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Why must there be a destination?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping dispersed his giant transformation, returning to his normal form, and calmly said.</p><p></p><p>Although the previous actions consumed a certain amount of the dynasty's fortune, with the Holy Dynasty's current prosperity and rapid growth, it could be fully restored in less than half a year.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, between a fixed-position fortress and a ship drifting in the river, which do you think is more difficult to breach?" Li Ping asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers Daoist instantly understood Li Ping's meaning and nodded, "Indeed. Constantly shifting positions in the void, not only is it impossible to lock onto the specific location, let alone launch a siege. Fellow Daoist's move is truly brilliant."</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers praised.</p><p></p><p>"However, there is currently still a flaw."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"With only one Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven pulling, the speed of advancement in the void is really a bit too slow."</p><p></p><p>An ominous thought suddenly arose in Hundred Flowers Daoist's mind.</p><p></p><p>"So I'm afraid I'll have to trouble Fellow Daoist Hundred Flowers to make a few more trips."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping turned his head and spoke earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"I still have a few suitable targets here. Although their scale can't compare to the Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven, they are barely usable. Once Fellow Daoist transports them all here, I will then connect them using formations, and by then the forward momentum will be multiplied several times more."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the miserable experience of transporting the Five Elements Grotto Heaven before, and looking at the specific information of more than a dozen grotto heavens sent by Li Ping, Hundred Flowers Daoist instantly felt a wave of dizziness and a bleak future.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, rest assured, Fellow Daoist. You have been so dedicated to the Holy Dynasty, I naturally won't mistreat you." Li Ping smiled and pointed his finger in the air.</p><p></p><p>A golden swimming dragon instantly appeared in front of Hundred Flowers.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... Myriad Spirits Jade Nectar?" Hundred Flowers Daoist exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, that's not right. It's just some condensed cultivation base." In a flash, Hundred Flowers felt a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, only true immortals can condense Source Power Essence, how could I possibly possess it? However, this refined source power should make up for some of the damage Fellow Daoist suffered in transporting the grotto heavens." Li Ping said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The source power forming the golden dragon was naturally gathered from the Great Enlightenment citizens cultivating the "Enlightening Wisdom Spiritual Source Art".</p><p></p><p>An existence one level lower than Source Power Essence, pure cultivation base without attributes.</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers Daoist held back for a moment, but still opened her mouth and swallowed the golden swimming dragon into her belly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly refining it, not only were her old injuries healed, even her dark golden colored glaze body became a few degrees more solid.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks for Fellow Daoist's assistance."</p>

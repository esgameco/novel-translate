            <p>After a moment, another beam of light shot out from the other end of the square box. ¤ (¯´☆✭.¸_)¤ ➅９şℍย𝓧.ςσΜ ¤(_¸.✭☆´¯) ¤</p><p></p><p>The small box shook violently, as if consuming a great deal of energy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Ping infused it with some more golden source power.</p><p></p><p>Having received nourishment, the square box slowly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the light from both ends disappeared, and an item identical to the one previously enveloped by the light sphere appeared in the Sacred Dynasty's treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping took the two light spheres in his hands, carefully comparing and observing them.</p><p></p><p>Inside the two light spheres were two identical swords.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be forged from ten-thousand-year-old frost, with the blades emitting an icy blue glow.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Years Frost Sword is forged from the Chill Core, an anomaly that caused the complete freezing of a realm."</p><p></p><p>"If its cold energy is fully released, it is enough to instantly freeze a state in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I believe that even in today's Myriad Immortals Alliance, this sword is a treasure of considerable value."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping looked at the other Ten Thousand Years Frost Sword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>There was no discernible difference.</p><p></p><p>"It was easily duplicated by this square box." Li Ping's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>While Li Ping was pondering, the square box squirmed and transformed back into the form of a small kitten.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have consumed a great deal of energy and looked a bit listless.</p><p></p><p>Opening its mouth to yawn, it refused to leave and lay directly on Li Ping's shoulder, falling into a deep sleep. 🎁☟❻❾s𝕙υ𝕏.Ⓒ๏𝐌♟😾</p><p></p><p>It was clearly not pretending, as it had no interest in devouring even the golden source power sent by Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not drive it away.</p><p></p><p>Such a treasure was good to keep close to his body.</p><p></p><p>"At present, it seems that when this treasure transforms into a square box, its function is to duplicate."</p><p></p><p>"It can achieve complete duplication of items. This treasure appears to still be in its growth stage, and there are some things it cannot duplicate yet. Moreover, each duplication consumes a great deal of energy and requires a certain amount of time to recuperate and adjust."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, this treasure does not only have the two forms of a square treasure box and a cat. It should have other transformations..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stroked the sleeping kitten, and it responded with an unconscious meow.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"My painstaking arrangement of the fishing pool has finally given me a surprise."</p><p></p><p>"Since its form in the present world is a cat statue, let's call it [Cat Treasure]."</p><p></p><p>When the Cat Treasure was fished up, it was merely an ordinary white light sphere.</p><p></p><p>However, it was clear that the Cat Treasure with the ability to [duplicate] could not possibly be of only white quality.</p><p></p><p>"The origin of this [Cat Treasure] is very unusual."</p><p></p><p>"It may even come from beyond the high walls..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's figure flashed as he returned to the Sacred Emperor's seat. ☺💙➅９s𝓗υＸ.ｃσ𝓶🍮🍪</p><p></p><p>"This [Cat Treasure] is a great help in my contention with the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true body and other avatars had long been aware of the existence of the Cat Treasure.</p><p></p><p>However, in this life, the Cat Treasure could exert its greatest value in the hands of the Sacred Emperor, so there was no rush to use the anchor point to replace it.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it is still in its infancy. Its specific upper limit still needs further observation."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from artificially created magic treasures, can it duplicate the wonders of heaven and earth in the Xuanhuang Realm, and even existences like the Final Dissociation Disk?"</p><p></p><p>"If it can..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a moment, at most it would only speed up his search a little.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of progress.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't each of his returns equivalent to a replication of the entire world?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's previously somewhat turbulent state of mind instantly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts returned to the Sun family's side.</p><p></p><p>The blockade on the Wanxian Alliance headquarters had been lifted, and Sun Luyao was summoned by the Mirror Holder for careful questioning.</p><p></p><p>But the seven-colored rainbow light that was able to escape from Xuanhuang remained at the strictest level of secrecy.</p><p></p><p>The combined probing of the Tianxuan Mirror's origin and the Wuliang Mirror still revealed nothing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>There are no walls that don't let the wind through. No matter how strong the protective measures are, they will all become ineffective one day as time passes.</p><p></p><p>What he did was to wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was not the only one in the Wanxian Alliance who was interested in the seven-colored rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Tianxuan Mirror, he could supervise the Wanxian Alliance at all times.</p><p></p><p>As long as they learned the secret through some method, it also meant that Li Fan would know.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao, who had always been extremely afraid of Li Fan, suddenly spoke up at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this." Before Li Fan could answer, Sun Luyao hurriedly explained first.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, for some reason, some strange scenes often flash in my mind. They are all things I have never experienced before. Thinking about it, it is most likely left by that annihilating wind disaster..."</p><p></p><p>At Li Fan's indication of distraction, Sun Luyao projected the scenes he saw.</p><p></p><p>The images were blurry and the flashing changes were extremely rapid.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only see that seemingly countless living beings turned into flying ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>And the means those creatures displayed on the verge of life and death, in their struggles...</p><p></p><p>seemed to be not what ordinary cultivators could perform.</p><p></p><p>"Scenes of the great calamity in the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered in his heart, but did not show any heaviness on his face.</p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly: "Don't scare yourself. Do you think what you received was the real annihilating wind tribulation? It's just remnants after being passed down who knows how many times."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, as long as your brother can find relevant information about the Youzu people, I have a 90% chance of helping you expel it."</p><p></p><p>Such a certain tone made Sun Luyao feel relieved.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the various means displayed by this mysterious senior were probably not much inferior to the legendary true immortals.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan did not keep them waiting for long.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, he quietly returned to the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous heaviness, this time when he came back, there was uncontrollable joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, did you find any clues about the Youzu people?" Sun Luyao asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shook his head: "This is still being inquired about, but I believe there will be clues soon."</p><p></p><p>"Then you..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan lowered his voice, but could hardly hide his excitement: "The Dharma Heavenly Venerate not only communicated with the Wanxian Alliance this time, but also carried out a round of inspections on the Immortal Alliance headquarters. He made relevant instructions and made some personnel adjustments."</p><p></p><p>"That old thing Futu, because his strength has not improved much in recent years, seems to have been criticized by name by the Dharma Venerable. He was extremely apprehensive and will be in closed-door cultivation for a long time recently, temporarily unable to manage us."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao was also delighted upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, did the Heavenly Venerate discover the matter of the Tianxuan Mirror's human avatar during his inspection of the Immortal Alliance?" Sun Luyao asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's not clear. However, from the current situation, it seems that it has not been discovered."</p><p></p><p>"I have also been monitoring the Tianxuan Mirror's human avatar, and there are no abnormalities for the time being."</p>

            <p>The beautiful appearance of the other party did not cause any psychological fluctuations for her.</p><p></p><p>However, the face of "Liu Yihang" flashed in her mind, causing her to hesitate for a moment.</p><p></p><p>From Liu San's mouth, she knew that "Xu Bai" was a clone refined by Liu Yihang. When Liu Ruchen fell, Liu Yihang became the current master of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>With a slightly relaxed expression, after hesitating for a while, Jiang Yushan finally nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since the master said so, let's give it a try first."</p><p></p><p>"But I lived in the Undetermined Purgatory in my early years, and I was contaminated with an unremovable monstrous aura. Is it really not a problem?" she furrowed her brows, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"According to the current desire of Wanxian League cultivators for the Longevity Pill, even if it has some side effects, it should still be acceptable. After all, one is death due to old age, and the other is just some damage to the body. They can distinguish between the severity," Xu Bai confidently said.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he briefly introduced to Jiang Yushan the background of the Devouring Elemental White Mist and the current policy of Wanxian League encouraging cultivators to explore the White Mist.</p><p></p><p>"When flying outside just now, I noticed those white mist walls that penetrated the heavens and earth. Devouring life essence, dividing the heavens and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"After a thousand years, such great changes." Jiang Yushan sighed almost imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>"Now is the best time for the sales of Longevity Pills, with demand surpassing supply. With just the effort of Elder Liu, it's not enough to meet the demand. I hope Elder Jiang could lend a hand," Xu Bai said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Alchemy... Let's give it a try first," Jiang Yushan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A hint of joy appeared on Liu San's face.</p><p></p><p>In the alchemy room of Changsheng Valley, ninety-nine Golden Core disciples were gathered, and the Great Salvation Longevity Formation was set up.</p><p></p><p>Liu San and Jiang Yushan sat cross-legged in the center of the formation and infused the longevity essence into the Medicine King Cauldron at the core of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Once the two forces emerged, Xu Bai keenly sensed their differences.</p><p></p><p>If Liu San's longevity essence was as vibrant as spring, then Jiang Yushan's had a touch of solemn killing intent in her vitality.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai faintly felt this murderous aura was somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>With his eyes slightly narrowed, Xu Bai remained calm and waited for the completion of the Longevity Pill refinement.</p><p></p><p>With Jiang Yushan's help, the formation rotated almost three times faster than before. Coupled with Liu San's skillful management of the formation, not long after, the first batch of Longevity Pills were refined.</p><p></p><p>Three pills were created, with a blue and glossy appearance tainted with an untimely black cloud. It looked extremely ominous.</p><p></p><p>Even the natural fragrance of the longevity medicine was suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Even holding the pills in hand, there was no urgent desire to swallow them.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are these pills usable?" Jiang Yushan furrowed her brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't answer immediately. Instead, he threw one of the pills into his mouth, closed his eyes, and pondered.</p><p></p><p>Not concerned about increased lifespan, but feeling the aura of destruction that emerged along with the longevity essence when the pill melted in his body.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed..."</p><p></p><p>"The aura of doom..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai felt a bit heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiang, can you explain in detail what this aura is all about?" With spiritual energy flowing, repairing the damage caused by the aura, Xu Bai opened his eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan was momentarily stunned but then proceeded to explain for Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, cultivators transcended heavenly tribulations to ascend. This heavenly tribulation is both a test and an opportunity. Although there is a risk of death, if one successfully transcends it, they would be infused with immortal spiritual energy, transforming into immortals."</p><p></p><p>"However, the path to immortality was severed later on, and the heavenly tribulations ceased to appear. Yet, the killing intent of the heaven and earth still needed an outlet, so the aura descended to the world."</p><p></p><p>"This is the original source of the aura in the Undetermined Purgatory. However, later on, many extremely wicked people were imprisoned in the Undetermined Purgatory, mixing with endless murderous intent."</p><p></p><p>"The interaction between heaven and human created the aura more elusive and troublesome. Even though I have been away for dozens of years, continuously cleansing myself with the will to save the world, it's still difficult to eliminate it," Jiang Yushan said slowly. "Over time, the damage caused by the aura to a cultivator's body is irreversible. My unique voice is a result of this."</p><p></p><p>"However, with such a huge change in the Xuanhuang Realm, I wonder what the situation inside the Undetermined Purgatory will be." Jiang Yushan had a somewhat absent look on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Doom, killing intent..." Xu Bai showed a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiang, have you ever seen this person or a sword full of murderous intent?" Xu Bai then conjured up an image of the Fisherman and the Sword of Doom in the empty space.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan stared at it for a while and shook her head. "I have never seen them."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's leave it at that."</p><p></p><p>This result was also within Xu Bai's expectations. He dispersed the image of the Fisherman with a wave of his hand and told Jiang Yushan and Liu San, "You two don't need to worry. Although the Longevity Pills you jointly refined will indeed cause harm to the cultivator's physical body, imperfections aside, if the longevity effect remains unchanged, I believe there will still be a large number of people eager to buy it. We can just lower the price a bit."</p><p></p><p>Dispelling their concerns, Xu Bai let them focus on refining the pills.</p><p></p><p>"How many should be refined? I'm very interested in this world that has passed a thousand years, and I want to go out for a stroll," Jiang Yushan straightforwardly asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Liu San, he saw him staring foolishly at Jiang Yushan, evidently not opposing her decision.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xu Bai said, "Consume half of the original materials for the Longevity Pills in Changsheng Valley. Constantly piling them up would be a waste."</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Jiang Yushan agreed readily, not having a clear quantitative understanding of the amount of medicinal materials in Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>With a nod from Jiang Yushan, Xu Bai smiled faintly and gracefully left Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>"At least she won't be able to come out for a year and a half."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Once again, the figure of the Elder 【Tian Jue】 Fisherman appeared in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>The murderous aura on Jiang Yushan's body stunningly resembled the aura on Tian Jue's body.</p><p></p><p>But it was subtly different.</p><p></p><p>The difference was difficult to express in words. However, for Li Fan, who had contact with both, it was easy to distinguish between the two.</p><p></p><p>If we have to use an appropriate analogy to explain, then "two different sea waters with different salt concentrations" might be a more vivid description of the difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly the same, but...</p><p></p><p>"From two different worlds."</p><p></p><p>A gleam of light flashed in Xu Bai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan came from the Undetermined Purgatory, the Medicine King Sect. In today's Xuanhuang Realm, records of them can still be found.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the result was already clear.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, he had vaguely suspected this.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Healer, the Elder Tian Jue, the Divine Command, and the Yunshui Tiangong group of people were likely not native cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead...</p><p></p><p>They were outsiders.</p>

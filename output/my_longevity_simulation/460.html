        <h1>Chapter 460</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the chaos of cultivators scrambling to escape, the price of Puxian Zhenye plummeted to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Just after surpassing a thousand points, it plummeted like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>This spectacular scene made Jiao Xiuyuan couldn't help but exclaim repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Daoist's deduction skills are truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for your reminder, I might have ended up like them too."</p><p></p><p>"I can already imagine the scene of countless cultivators' hearts breaking!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan gloated.</p><p></p><p>Tianshu State.</p><p></p><p>Having just completed a transaction and secretly celebrating their good luck, Dan Tai Can and others heard the announcement from Tianxuan Mirror, and their faces suddenly became very exciting.</p><p></p><p>And then witnessing the avalanche in the price of Puxian Zhenye they had just repurchased at a price of 1300 Tian, their expressions changed drastically within moments.</p><p></p><p>Many people couldn't bear this blow directly, spitting out blood and passing out directly.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Dan Tai!"</p><p></p><p>The still sober cultivators all looked at Dan Tai Can with grief and indignation, hoping that this leader of the Dan Tai family could come up with a solution.</p><p></p><p>Dan Tai Can's face also turned iron-blue at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This incident seemed as if there were invisible hands manipulating it from the beginning, and he was caught off guard by the developments.</p><p></p><p>He subconsciously thought that perhaps this matter was a conspiracy targeting the Dan Tai family from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Both Jiao Xiuyuan and the cultivator from Tianji Sect, Li Fan, could be distractions by the other party.</p><p></p><p>Various possible targets flashed through his mind, and Dan Tai Can was also actively considering remedial measures.</p><p></p><p>The losses this time were indeed too great.</p><p></p><p>Even though his position in the family had become increasingly stable over the years, he probably would still face punishment.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, this could even be used as an excuse by those brothers to accuse him.</p><p></p><p>"No, at least we have to recoup some losses."</p><p></p><p>Dan Tai Can gritted his teeth, an idea emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Spread our recent discoveries!"</p><p></p><p>He said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"No! Brother Dan Tai, calm down!"</p><p></p><p>"We haven't reported this to the Immortal Alliance yet..."</p><p></p><p>The others were shocked and flustered, trying to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>However, Dan Tai Can had made up his mind, and he had the majority credit for this secretive discovery.</p><p></p><p>They had no choice but to cooperate.</p><p></p><p>By various means, the news spread to the market.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan and Jiao Xiuyuan, who were inventorying their gains on Wuxian Island, suddenly saw the downward trend of Puxian Zhenye slowing down.</p><p></p><p>Although it was still slowly falling in price, the state of collapse was gradually passing.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's going on? The price of Puxian Zhenye is stronger than I expected." Li Fan glanced at Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was stunned for a moment, then said mysteriously, "I heard that a large number of Puxian Zhenye can be used to make artifacts that can reduce the amount of life essence consumed by the 'Devouring Elemental Mist'... And also, it can indicate direction in the vast misty realm."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan squinted his eyes, clearly the first time he knew about this.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled, "Is it true?"</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the market's reaction, it should not be a lie." Jiao Xiuyuan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Dan Tai Can released this secret to reduce his losses. It is unexpected that Puxian Zhenye has such uses. Being able to resist the 'Devouring Elemental Mist' is something that can change the balance in the Xuanhuang Realm." He muttered softly, apparently secretly buying back Puxian Zhenye.</p><p></p><p>"So that's why its price kept steadily rising in the previous life." Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>Having spent several years in the Horrible Abyss, Li Fan was naturally aware of the terror of the Devouring Elemental Mist.</p><p></p><p>If he had known the wonderful use of Puxian Zhenye at that time, the construction of the Tianxuan Sealing Array in the mist would not have been so laborious.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, with this item, one can explore deeper into the misty realm..."</p><p></p><p>"And in the previous life, until I had completely transformed my body and the Tianxuan Sealing Array was built, Dan Tai Can did not reveal any information about this..." </p><p></p><p>This news was quite shocking.</p><p></p><p>For a while, Li Fan and Jiao Xiuyuan were lost in thought, and there was silence in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Dan Tai family is quite interesting. They discovered such important information but didn't report it in time." It was Jiao Xiuyuan who broke the silence shortly after.</p><p></p><p>"The head of the family, Dan Tai Li Qu, the Honorable Dao Ancestor, is one of the three giants in charge of the Wanxian Union's Political Hall headquarters."</p><p></p><p>"Because he acts quietly, the Dan Tai family has always been a mystery to outsiders."</p><p></p><p>"Only when reaching a certain level, do they realize how terrifying the Dan Tai family is."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan explained to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Political Hall is not a one-man show for the Dan Tai family. Having made such a big mistake this time, he probably has to explain it."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's tone suddenly became a bit strange, "I think Dan Tai Can is not a fool, why did he make such a blunder this time?"</p><p></p><p>"According to reason, the level of danger in this matter could help the Dan Tai family stand more stable."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect him to just throw it away for a small benefit."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan analyzed, "Perhaps, this person is not really that foolish."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Dan Tai family is the Dan Tai family, and Dan Tai Can is Dan Tai Can."</p><p></p><p>Although his words seemed a bit roundabout, Jiao Xiuyuan seemed thoughtful after hearing them.</p><p></p><p>After that, the two chatted for a while and agreed to cooperate next time they had the chance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan bypassed the crowded group of cultivators outside, who were clamoring to find an explanation, and quietly returned to the Tianxuan Mirror through the secret passage inside the Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>Calming his thoughts, Li Fan began to take stock of his gains this time.</p><p></p><p>He had acquired three to four hundred points of Puxian Zhenye, most of which were sold to Dan Tai Can at around 1300 points.</p><p></p><p>There was a small part sold midway.</p><p></p><p>Overall, he made about four times the amount.</p><p></p><p>After subtracting the unexpected loss from buying the Lingwu Grass before.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's wealth had grown from over five million contribution points to a staggering figure of 18.6 million.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was no longer the naive newcomer to the cultivation world before.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a large sum of contribution points, he remained calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>He skillfully opened the shopping list of the Tianxuan Mirror, continuously purchasing items needed for cultivation and transactions with the Imperial Exchange, while also selecting items that might be useful for his future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his current authorization level was not enough, leaving Li Fan sighing over the inability to spend his treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>The carefree days of extravagance didn't last long.</p><p></p><p>Soon, just as Li Fan had anticipated, a voice sounded in the Tianxuan Mirror, instructing him to immediately go to the Martial Hall for an investigation.</p><p></p><p>It was about whether he had maliciously manipulated the market and disrupted the stability of the Wanxian Union.</p>

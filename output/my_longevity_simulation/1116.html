            <p>Chapter 1114: The Battle of Lingmu Begins</p><p></p><p>In the dark prison, time seemed to lose its meaning.</p><p></p><p>Every day, one faced only the unchanging gloom, and the seemingly endless cries of agony echoing in one's ears.</p><p></p><p>The intelligence level of those black mist prison guards didn't seem to be very high. For Li Fan, this suddenly added prisoner, they only let out strange laughter, and then mechanically activated the formations in the prison pillars, trying to torture Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan easily resolved them all.</p><p></p><p>However, he still cooperatively simulated his own screams of misery, fooling these black mist prison guards into leaving with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>In the prison, besides these frequently appearing low-level guards, one could occasionally see the patrolling cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>There were three in total, taking turns to come. For the task of inspecting the prison, they often just went through the motions. After all, the prison had been peaceful for thousands of years and had never had any trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, after a period of observation, Li Fan also realized that the place he was currently hiding in was just the outermost layer of the prison. The Wanxian Alliance didn't really pay much attention to the prisoners held here. Li Fan even personally saw one of his neighbors unable to endure the torture of the formations and his soul scattered. For a long time after that, no one came to check.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the black mist prison guards came for their routine patrol that they discovered it. They then activated the purification formation, cleaned the black pillar, and waited for the arrival of the next prisoner.</p><p></p><p>This situation in the prison made Li Fan very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The probability of being discovered was very small, and no one usually came to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>While enjoying the peace and quiet, Li Fan made preparations for the final plan of world destruction on one hand, and observed the situation in the Lingmu Realm through the Holy Infant on the other.</p><p></p><p>For quite a long time after Li Fan issued the order for full battle readiness and escaped himself, everything was calm and peaceful outside. There was no sign that the Wanxian Alliance was about to launch a war.</p><p></p><p>So much so that everyone started to have doubts about Li Fan's judgment in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, in awe of the power of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, they dared not show it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan knew that this was just the calm before the storm.</p><p></p><p>Facts proved that Li Fan's prediction was correct.</p><p></p><p>On this day, at the entrance of the Lingmu Realm, traces of subtle fluctuations suddenly appeared in the sealing formation.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Infant Li Fan discovered the anomaly the first moment.</p><p></p><p>After observing intently for a while, Li Fan snorted coldly: "They do have some skills. It seems that the formations I gave to the Wanxian Alliance have been thoroughly studied by them. Compared with before, their formation level has improved by at least a hundred years. It's just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"It's still more than a generation behind me!"</p><p></p><p>"At their turtle speed, I'm afraid it will take no less than three months to crack the formation. And that's assuming I won't repair the formation. However, on the flip side, the Wanxian Alliance may not have the patience. If they can't break the formation, they should launch a strong attack..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't believe that the Wanxian Alliance's army could be stopped by just a mere formation.</p><p></p><p>"Why not sell them a loophole and let a batch of them in first, then catch them all in one go!" Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly and he already had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Although for safety's sake, his true body had already escaped. But in the face of the Wanxian Alliance's coercion, Li Fan had no intention of completely giving up resistance.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the foundation he had accumulated in the Lingmu Realm in this life was quite a...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was an arduous task that consumed a great deal of effort and energy.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Wanxian Alliance has attacked, they will definitely put up some resistance.</p><p></p><p>"This is a good opportunity to test the mettle of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if they truly deserve the title of one of the two dominant organizations in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>It appeared as if the formation had truly been cracked.</p><p></p><p>The gaps grew larger and larger, until a small fissure appeared at the entrance passageway to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>The first wave of the Wanxian Alliance's assault troops instantly passed through these fissures and arrived in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>The moment they came face to face, both sides were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>On the Wanxian Alliance's side, they were surprised that the people of the Lingmu Realm seemed to have already discovered their little trick and were fully prepared for battle.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan's side, they were astonished that the so-called vanguard of the Wanxian Alliance was not composed of elite warriors.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was over a hundred arrows radiating a cold light.</p><p></p><p>"Xuntian Arrows?!" Li Fan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Xuntian Arrows were a powerful weapon developed by the Wanxian Alliance in this world. They were extremely fast, capable of traversing an entire state within a few breaths. Their power was also quite astonishing, almost equivalent to the strength of an ordinary Hedao cultivator's single strike.</p><p></p><p>But that wasn't the most terrifying part. What truly made the Xuntian Arrows formidable was their ability to form a special formation with each other, creating a massive net that could even distort and influence the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the previous great battle between the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Society, the Wanxian Alliance had used the Xuntian Arrows to interfere with the laws of heaven and earth over a wide area, preventing the Five Elders Society's Changsheng Tianzun from intervening in the battle.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Wanxian Alliance intends to employ a decapitation tactic. With one hundred and sixty-eight Xuntian Arrows, an ordinary small world would likely have its living forces completely annihilated by this move. However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let out a cold laugh, reacting very swiftly.</p><p></p><p>First, he used the grand formation enveloping the Lingmu Realm to interfere with these Xuntian Arrows, preventing them from completing their formation. Then, he dispatched Tianyang to use his absolute overwhelming power to collect and suppress the Xuntian Arrows one by one before they had a chance to scatter and cause destruction.</p><p></p><p>Although the Xuntian Arrows were fast, Tianyang was even faster!</p><p></p><p>Tianyang transformed into a beam of azure light, crisscrossing back and forth across the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had already brought all of them under control.</p><p></p><p>"Take a few of them for research and see if we can make use of them for ourselves," the Sage Fetus Li Fan said to Qiaogong Jushi.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong excitedly took the Xuntian Arrows and hurried off to dismantle and study them without delay.</p><p></p><p>On the Wanxian Alliance's side, the inexplicable loss of over a hundred Xuntian Arrows seemed to have caught them off guard.</p><p></p><p>They were dumbfounded for a long time and hesitated to launch the next wave of attacks.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan's eyes flickered as he pretended to repair the seal formation at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Just as the fissures in the formation that had been "painstakingly" opened showed signs of slowly healing, the Wanxian Alliance, as expected, couldn't hold back any longer and quickly launched another attack.</p><p></p><p>This time, passing through the fissures at the entrance and appearing before the people of the Lingmu Realm was a team of cultivators all clad in golden battle armor.</p><p></p><p>Shrouded in a golden light, their faces were indiscernible. Even their exact locations seemed impossible to pinpoint. Upon arriving in the Lingmu Realm, the golden-armored cultivators quickly dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Their speed was extraordinarily fast, even a few times faster than the Xuntian Arrows.</p><p></p><p>The most troublesome part was that they left behind a series of afterimages along their flight paths.</p>

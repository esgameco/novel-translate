        <h1>Chapter 301</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to return to the desolate island, they unexpectedly encountered the mysterious Zhao Erbao.</p><p></p><p>Yin Yuzhen felt an inexplicable sensation in her heart that this person was involved in a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The two sisters, who had both reached the Foundation Establishment stage, were no longer comparable to the mortals they once were.</p><p></p><p>So they chose to secretly follow him. After arriving at Zhao Erbao's lair, they caught him off guard and subdued him.</p><p></p><p>Then they chose to interrogate him.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhao Erbao remained tight-lipped, claiming that he himself didn't know and was just an ordinary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, under the sisters' methods, it didn't take long before he was crying for his parents and confessing everything clearly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Overturning Sea Palm, Dao Resonance Artifact?" </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xiao Heng also revealed a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>If Zhao Erbao wasn't lying, then it was truly a heaven-sent opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, the crisis hinted at by Senior White Bones was imminent and could not be delayed.</p><p></p><p>"How many more pieces are needed?" Xiao Heng asked coldly, releasing the oppressive aura of a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Erbao shuddered, cold sweat pouring down, and immediately replied, "Over a hundred pieces. With over a hundred more pieces, the resonance formed will be enough for us to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng pondered for a moment and promptly decided, "I will notify Changyu and the others to come and help, to complete the collection as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Once the quantity is sufficient, we will leave the Congyun Sea immediately.

Daoist Lin Fan?"</p><p></p><p>The communication talisman, which had been silent for a long time, suddenly received a message.</p><p></p><p>The avatar, awakening from cultivation, sensed it slightly, a smile appearing on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Is Daoist Lin Fan there?"</p><p></p><p>"I recently received information that there may be changes happening in the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"If Daoist is still in the Congyun Sea, it's best to leave quickly."</p><p></p><p>"The sales of the Small Medicine King Cauldron have been very stable in recent years. I have sold most of them."</p><p></p><p>"The landing site of that meteor has vaguely taken shape, seemingly within the Cangwu Abyss. Some cultivators have already gone to explore. The Cangwu Abyss is unfathomably deep, so it will likely take some years to find its traces."</p><p></p><p>"However, I also plan to speed up the process. When the true face of the meteor is revealed to the world, it will be the moment when the bubble we jointly created bursts. At that time, the price of the Small Medicine King Cauldron will definitely plummet, and it will be unsellable even if we want to.

For every Small Medicine King Cauldron sold, he would give Li Fan a portion of the profit.</p><p></p><p>Back and forth, a total of 260,000 contribution points were transferred to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>They were all exchanged by the avatar into standard spirit stones and stored in the White Bone Vanguard Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Jiao is indeed a meticulous businessman."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the next life, we can still cooperate."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replied to Jiao Xiuyuan, indicating that he was already aware and thanked him for his concern.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few more pleasantries, he ended the communication.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally coming..."</p><p></p><p>The avatar felt a surge of emotions, seizing the last moments to comprehend and extrapolate the "Creation Furnace Technique".</p><p></p><p>Anchored 28 years ago, in Tianyu Province.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had made up for his shortcomings, had completed the second stage of closed training.</p><p></p><p>His soul contract imprint recognition rate was 100%, and he always scored top marks in the formation structure knowledge assessment.</p><p></p><p>Now, among the many outstanding talents in the Formation Dao, Li Fan was also a leading figure.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who tried to get close to him also gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>They all sent him friend requests.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't put on airs and haughtily refused. He accepted all the requests with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Li Fan's image of being kind, welcoming, gentle, and scholarly began to take shape in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Now was the relaxation time after completing the stage training.</p><p></p><p>Learning from the previous lesson, Ji Hongdao didn't let the students go out this time.</p><p></p><p>He only let them rest in the Huanyu Villa.</p><p></p><p>It was also taking advantage of this rare moment when everyone was very free that Li Fan's connections rapidly expanded.</p><p></p><p>After another month of recuperation, adjusting his body and mind to the optimal state, the final training of the "Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation" was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also very much looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Because, according to Ji Hongdao, the final stage of training was likely related to the Wanxian Alliance's supreme treasure, the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Ji Hongdao gathered everyone, his face solemn.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Shi also appeared by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Next, you will witness the manufacturing scene of the "Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation" core. I suppose you have already guessed that the reason this formation is named Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking is naturally due to the indispensable role played by the Heavenly Profound Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the core component of each formation core is a newly born mirror surface of the Heavenly Profound Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Even though they were mentally prepared, when Ji Hongdao personally said it, the crowd couldn't help but reveal shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao ignored everyone's expressions and continued, "Although the Heavenly Profound Mirror has countless avatars, the value of this newly born mirror surface cannot be compared to ordinary mirror images."</p><p></p><p>"As everyone knows, the Heavenly Profound Mirror has its own spiritual intelligence."</p><p></p><p>"Over the thousands of years, it has been constantly changing and growing, just like a cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"The later the mirror image is born, the stronger its efficacy."</p><p></p><p>"This batch of newly born mirror surfaces was just produced three years ago. Originally, the plan was to use them for..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, anyway, their value cannot be simply measured by contribution points or spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Observing the production process of the formation cores this time was also something our Formation Strategy Hall had a hard time applying for."</p><p></p><p>"You need to re-sign a confidentiality contract."</p><p></p><p>The motionless Shangguan Shi finally made a move at this time. With a light point of his finger, golden light scattered and flew in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, everyone neatly wrote their names on it.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Ji Hongdao continue, "As the core of the "Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation", the newly born mirror surface plays a crucial role in the overall control of the formation."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to construct the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation, you must achieve a 100% match between the formation structure and the newly born mirror surface."</p><p></p><p>"Before being encapsulated inside the formation core, it is in its most original and pure form."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, only by seizing this rare opportunity can you gain an understanding of it."</p><p></p><p>"This will greatly improve your accuracy and success rate when constructing the formation."</p><p></p><p>"Without this step, constructing a qualified Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation would be extremely difficult."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 592</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"I said, how could Li Fan suddenly be so kind! After halting the fundraising plan for a long time, he restarted it without any warning signs! He not only restarted it, but also removed the fundraising cap! It turns out he was waiting for us for this!"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, this person's deductive ability has reached an advanced realm, being able to foresee even the cessation of hostilities between the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Association. With the release of the techniques this time, how could he not anticipate it? I think he wants to take advantage of this opportunity to deceive his brothers!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple. With Mister Mi's current status and wealth, would he bother with our small amount of money?"</p><p></p><p>"For one person or even ten people, maybe he wouldn't be interested. But this time, there are more than tens of thousands of cultivators participating in the fundraising! With so much contribution, even if he is just a minor regional confidential officer, even a Transcendent Immortal would probably be envious! Just watch, when we ask He Zhenghao to return our contributions, he will definitely come up with all sorts of excuses!"</p><p></p><p>Under the instigation of many cultivators, the mood became restless and excited.</p><p></p><p>They gathered at the door of the magistrate's office and were unwilling to leave for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In principle, it was not allowed for unrelated people to gather in the central core area of the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>However, this fundraising event involved too many people, and even many cultivators within the system had contributed all their wealth.</p><p></p><p>Now that the techniques were half-price, these people couldn't produce enough contributions for a while.</p><p></p><p>Due to their special status, they didn't dare to seek trouble from their superiors.</p><p></p><p>But turning a blind eye and allowing these people in to "protect their rights" required some courage, and thus, it led to the chaotic scene.</p><p></p><p>Outside was boiling with commotion, but inside the magistrate's office, Gao Yuan and He Zhenghao were relaxed and not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of troublemakers!"</p><p></p><p>"It was agreed upon as five years at the beginning. Five years means five years! How long has it been, and they are already clamoring to redeem their contributions?"</p><p></p><p>"Did they think the business contracts I signed with them were fake? Did they think I would back down on it?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao spoke disdainfully, his gaze constantly sliding over the mirror surface of the Tianxuan Small Mirror in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"'Dragon Soaring Nine Transformations,' a transformative technique with a contribution requirement of 950,000. Like a dragon shedding its skin, it can reverse fate, reshape oneself..."</p><p></p><p>"'Sleeves Holding Mountains and Rivers,' a transformative technique with a contribution requirement of 1 million. When mastered, one can easily control the mountains and rivers with a flick of the wrist..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He could casually select techniques that were once unthinkable, and in just a few years following Li Fan, he was no longer the person who once meticulously calculated even a hundred contribution points as a Guardian of Liuli Island.</p><p></p><p>"Although these transformative techniques are good, they are still somewhat lacking. It's better to exchange directly for Harmony Way techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Opportunities like this are rare."</p><p></p><p>As He Zhenghao's eyes wandered, a thought suddenly came to him which he couldn't suppress.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining the explanations of several Harmony Way techniques, the transformative techniques he had previously been interested in suddenly seemed dull.</p><p></p><p>"Well... these are all exceptional, requiring at least 2 million contributions. I don't have enough contributions on hand."</p><p></p><p>"If I choose those more suitable for me, the shortfall would be even greater."</p><p></p><p>"However, there might be a way..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao began to calculate in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Gao Yuan, sitting next to him, remained silent throughout. But his excited expression in his eyes was hard to conceal.</p><p></p><p>Similar to He Zhenghao, he was also selecting techniques he liked.</p><p></p><p>However, sitting in the middle of the two, Zhou Qing'ang was different.</p><p></p><p>He just closed his eyes and contemplated, unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang's restraint is becoming increasingly astonishing. He can even resist such temptations. It's no wonder Mister Mi is paying more attention to him." He Zhenghao thought between the gaps when he looked at Zhou Qing'ang casually.</p><p></p><p>Since not long ago, several cultivators had come knocking on their doors, wanting to redeem their contributions early, and they were annoyed by the harassment.</p><p></p><p>So, the three of them hid here, behind closed doors, turning a blind eye to everything.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Zhou Qing'ang, who had been silent all along, suddenly spoke up, "It's not feasible to let them continue causing trouble like this."</p><p></p><p>"We don't care, let them think what they want. But we fear that under their anger and embarrassment, they might speak recklessly and tarnish Mister Mi's reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Rumors are dreadful! If it spreads, outsiders who are unaware might actually think that Mister Mi is a despicable person who covets others' possessions!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan quickly responded, and after Zhou Qing'ang finished speaking, he agreed, "Indeed, Mister Mi also intends to win people's hearts through this matter. If it drags on, it may delay his plans!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Zhenghao raised his head and asked perplexedly, "What's your proposal, gentlemen?"</p><p></p><p>"Mister Mi had given instructions earlier, and it's clearly stated on the business contracts. If they want to redeem their contributions early, it's possible but with a deduction of some penalty fees, and they will be permanently banned from participating in future fundraising plans."</p><p></p><p>"You go out and explain to them. If they still persist, give back their contributions."</p><p></p><p>"Keep a record of the list, and I'll report it to Mister Mi. That should resolve the issue, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang said calmly and methodically.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, He Zhenghao couldn't help but lament, "It's easy for you to say. That's a hefty penalty, one-third of it! That money was hard-earned, how many people would be willing? If I put it this way, wouldn't they tear me apart alive?"</p><p></p><p>Looking for help, he glanced at Gao Yuan, but saw him maintaining a detached stance, focusing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenghao?"</p><p></p><p>As he stepped out of the magistrate's office, the group of cultivators who were previously clamoring suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were fixed on He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The large door behind him swiftly closed, and He Zhenghao revealed a smile uglier than crying, "Please, everyone, let me explain!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While He Zhenghao racked his brains and tried to reason with the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was still unable to recover from extreme regret.</p><p></p><p>After the news of the discounted techniques was announced, although he was penniless now, he curiously studied the list of techniques released this time, with a mentality of joining in the fun.</p><p></p><p>But once he looked at it, he felt a bit off-balanced.</p><p></p><p>Among them was a technique called 'Void Cataclysm Primordial Scripture,' which had the miraculous function of avoiding calamities and misfortunes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, being just a transformative technique, with the discount, it only required a mere 1.1 million contributions to obtain.</p><p></p><p>"If combined with my Heavenly Destiny Scripture, it can significantly reduce the consequences of my Heavenly Destiny backlash."</p><p></p><p>"I would no longer have to worry about inexplicable calamities as before."</p><p></p><p>"It's just too perfect for me..."</p><p></p><p>The more Han Yi thought about it, the more regretful he felt.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! How could I have not controlled myself back then!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling depressed, Han Yi almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

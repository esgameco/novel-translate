        <h1>Chapter 670</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>That is, with the increasing number of exotic beasts, the six skulls that were originally used as cultivation vessels have slowly been depleted.</p><p></p><p>While the Chi Nine-Headed Beast is a single entity, each of the nine heads has a different personality.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it is because of this unique biological feature that the cultivated exotic beasts evolve in myriad directions.</p><p></p><p>If the cultivation material were changed to other equivalent demon beasts, such as the brown giant peng, it may not necessarily have the same effect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it can be said that the Chi Nine-Headed Beast arrived at the right time.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Ke's calculations, when the number of existing exotic beast species reaches a certain threshold, even without using the Chi Nine-Headed Beast's flesh and blood, with the massive base number of exotic beasts themselves, they are enough to sustain self-propagation and evolution.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xu Ke shifted his focus to how to manipulate these exotic beasts next.</p><p></p><p>Because the exotic beasts in this world were mostly cultivated from the flesh and blood of the Chi Nine-Headed Beast and the research on the "Wheel of Myriad Beasts," after going through several generations of mortals, Xu Ke finally created the "Convergence Art" that could communicate with and control exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Ke imparted the Convergence Art to the mortals in this world, humans, through controlling the countless exotic beasts between heaven and earth, completed the total domination of this small world and established a human empire.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was revered by the mortals as the "Holy Emperor," while Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong, who had always accompanied Xu Ke, were called the "Holy Masters."</p><p></p><p>Even though being hailed as an emperor by the people, Xu Ke clearly showed no interest in the trivial matters of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>He simply delegated his power and let the humans manage themselves. He secluded himself daily, mysterious and enigmatic, even Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong did not know what he was up to.</p><p></p><p>Until one day, Xu Ke suddenly brought a young boy in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke claimed that this was his descendant.</p><p></p><p>Using the "Holy Blood Embryonic Transformation Art" he invented through the study of the gift of "Emperor One," Xu Ke transformed his own blood into an embryo that could inherit the majority of his memories.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Blood Embryonic Transformation Art is a method where a portion of one's own blood is transformed into an embryo that can inherit the vast majority of one's memories. Without the need for a mother's pregnancy, with sufficient nutrition, the embryo can grow into a human child's appearance within just seven days.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, their physical and intellectual abilities also grow to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the familiar yet unfamiliar boy, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong felt a hint of astonishment. At the same time, a sense of unease arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Xu Ke instructed Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong not to overly intervene in the affairs of the human empire, only to help when the empire faced extinction. The descendant carrying his bloodline only needed to be a puppet emperor.</p><p></p><p>After explaining all this, Xu Ke resolutely left.</p><p></p><p>He did not reveal his whereabouts to anyone and disappeared without a trace from then on.</p><p></p><p>Years later, Xiao Hei came knocking on the door.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Xu Ke's aura disappearing, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong, in the face of Xiao Hei's angry accusations, could endure it in silence.</p><p></p><p>But after venting out, Xiao Hei also came to his senses. He understood Xu Ke's temper; it exuded a stubbornness. Once Xu Ke decided on something, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong could not defy it.</p><p></p><p>After meeting Xu Ke's descendants and realizing that they had been self-inheriting for dozens of generations, Xiao Hei was greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Although he could faintly see Xu Ke's shadow, even his aura was somewhat similar.</p><p></p><p>He was the first to recognize Xiao Hei.</p><p></p><p>But... it was not Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Without even saying hello, Xiao Hei directly left the empire and never returned.</p><p></p><p>For years to come, Xiao Hei traveled through various small worlds, never giving up on finding out Xu Ke's true cause of death.</p><p></p><p>However, he never found the answer.</p><p></p><p>Wandering outside the source world for years also led to Xiao Hei's lifespan rapidly declining.</p><p></p><p>As his final moments approached, Xiao Hei returned to the place where he last met Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>He quietly waited for death to come in his memories.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hei's body turned into dust, dissipating into the air.</p><p></p><p>But the little black figure on the phoenix feather inside Li Fan's body became more lively.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei once merged with the world of beast species. Although his life has ended, through my reuniting with the wandering destiny, and with this feather from him..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps a kind of rebirth in some sense can be achieved."</p><p></p><p>"However, even if successful, this Xiao Hei is not the same Xiao Hei."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the cabin, he arrived at the edge of the clear pool on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>Extending his right hand, the next moment, a brown jade bottle containing Xu Ke's essence blood flew out from under the water and into Li Fan's palm.</p><p></p><p>The bottle was sealed with several restrictions and prohibitions of Xiao Hei, ensuring that even after thousands of years, the essence blood still remained active.</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush. Let's first unravel the mystery of Han Yi's statue." After pondering for a moment, Li Fan put away the jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step, he returned to the black three-footed tower.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, disciples of the Medicine King Sect were busy in various corners of the world of beast species.</p><p></p><p>Observing their actions, it seemed like they were inscribing some kind of formation on the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Lao Liu, what are you all busy with?" After carefully observing for a while and failing to recognize the origin of the formation, Li Fan couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this was my idea." Before Lao Liu spoke, Fang Zaiji rushed to take credit.</p><p></p><p>"Although this world is vast enough for disciples to relax and move around, the spiritual energy is too thin, making it unfavorable for cultivation in the long run. However, the Longevity Valley is extremely rich in spiritual energy. So, we plan to transfer some of the spiritual energy from the Longevity Valley here. Of course, this is under the premise that it does not affect the herbs in the Longevity Valley." Fang Zaiji added.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lao Liu also explained, "To be on the safe side, I have ordered disciples to inspect if there are any other passages. Once found, Lao Fang and I will join forces to seal the space channel here."</p><p></p><p>"This way, outsiders can only enter from the Longevity Valley to here. And if the Longevity Valley is attacked, we won't be able to resist. At that time, we can reopen the channel and retreat calmly."</p><p></p><p>"In this way, the safety of our Medicine King Sect will be guaranteed!"</p><p></p><p>Looking pleased with himself, Lao Liu explained.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both for your hard work." On hearing this, Li Fan also showed a very satisfied expression, nodding.</p><p></p><p>After handing over the matters of the Longevity Valley and the connection with the beast world to Lao Liu and the others, Li Fan, carrying a phoenix feather full of a small world's destiny, once again approached Han Yi's statue.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a huge suction force, Li Fan's mind moved, continuously releasing the air fortune from the phoenix feather to counteract the suction force.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he speeded up to the extreme, flying rapidly towards Han Yi.</p>

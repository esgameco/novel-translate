        <h1>Chapter 1283</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a summary of the excerpt you provided, translated into English:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt discusses the complex situation and conflicts in the Xuanhuang Realm between native cultivators and those from other realms that were devoured. The key to resolving this lies with two figures - Chuanfa and Tianyi. </p><p></p><p>Li Ping, who seems to be the protagonist, ponders the threat posed by the powerful Xuantian Sect patriarchs. He believes any battle with Chuanfa must take place outside the Xuanhuang Realm to avoid devastating it. Li Ping studies two powerful formations - the Congregation of Spirits Ascension Formation and the All Living Beings Spirit Refinement Formation. By combining them, he believes an energy on par with Primordial Essence can be produced.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Wanxian Alliance discusses messages received from a rainbow light that left the realm carrying many of their Dao Attainment experts. Some mock the unremarkable scenery, while others ponder the implications. </p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun and the First Strategist discuss a mysterious white-robed sword immortal who can traverse the perilous void and sent a critical message from afar. They are amazed no one has heard of this peerless genius before. The First Strategist demonstrates the Xuanhuang Sword Art used by this figure.</p><p></p><p>In summary, it depicts a complex cultivation world rife with conflicts, powerful formations and arts, and mysterious experts. The protagonist seems to be preparing for an inevitable clash while trying to unravel certain mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Realm, those who cultivate the Sword Dao are not few in number. Among them, there is no lack of heavenly prodigies. So naturally, they can discern the essence of the sword techniques displayed by this white-robed Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>In the image, every sword strike unleashed by the Holy Fetus Li Fan was accompanied by the First Weaver's waving of his feather fan.</p><p></p><p>The same miniature sword lights resonated with those in the image.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Weaver, what exactly is your intention?" Shao Jun frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Does Shao Jun know of the Heavenly Observatory?" The First Weaver avoided the question and instead asked in return. </p><p></p><p>"Of course I know. The Immortal Alliance monitors the laws of heaven and earth through the Heavenly Observatory. In addition to being able to observe the Nascent Soul of Heaven and Earth, most importantly, it can sense traces of law reversal in advance." Shao Jun answered quickly.</p><p></p><p>"But what does this have to do with the Sword of Xuanhuang you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>"This sword is a marvel of the heavens. It directly points to the laws of heaven and earth." The First Weaver said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Shao Jun seemed to understand something, a glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Observatory had previously observed anomalies in the Sword Dao. However, it lasted for an extremely short time, less than half a month before returning to normal. It did not involve the Heavenly Venerate's law reversal phenomenon, so the Heavenly Observatory only routinely reported and filed it away. I also saw this record at the time, but did not take it to heart. Until you brought up this white-robed Sword Immortal, I connected them together." The First Weaver slowly explained.</p><p></p><p>"Half a month?" Shao Jun found it a bit unbelievable. </p><p></p><p>At this point, if Shao Jun still didn't understand the other party's meaning, then he was not fit to continue guarding this Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao was not completely reversed, indicating that the previous anomaly was a manifestation of accordance with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>And from the occurrence of the anomaly, it only lasted for half a month, meaning that the white-robed Sword Immortal he encountered...</p><p></p><p>Was not some expert who had long been in accordance with the Dao. Rather, he was a lucky one who had just stepped into this realm.</p><p></p><p>But how was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Cultivation realm could be broken through in a short time under fortuitous circumstances, but the comprehension of the Sword Dao, as well as the unrestrained elegance when wielding the sword, required accumulation over time.</p><p></p><p>The scenes of the Holy Fetus Li Fan traveling together with him surfaced in Shao Jun's mind once again.</p><p></p><p>The First Weaver said undeniably: "Perhaps there is such a possibility. But what I'm more willing to believe is that an outsider, lurking in our Xuanhuang Realm, relied on the marvelous Sword Dao to break through to the realm of accordance with the Dao. And then lured us to the depths of the starry sea..."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun raised his hand to interrupt the First Weaver's words.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Weaver, isn't this a bit too absurd?"</p><p></p><p>The First Weaver smiled: "It's just the most reasonable explanation after eliminating many impossibilities."</p><p></p><p>"This person has no foundation at all, appearing out of nowhere."</p><p></p><p>"After reaching accordance with the Dao, one can thoroughly comprehend... and it's still one of the most complex sword arts within the laws of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"If this person really accomplished all this entirely on his own, without any foundation, I'm willing to call him the number one innate talent in history, below the Dharma transmission."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, from your description of him, this person easily won over the hearts of the military above and below Duanzhang Immortal City with just a few words..."</p><p></p><p>The First Weaver coldly laughed again.</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun thought of even more.</p><p></p><p>There were people with ill intentions within the Immortal Alliance. Wanting to set things right.</p><p></p><p>This was his repeated appeal.</p><p></p><p>After being guided, he indeed developed such suspicions. He even planned to unite with his good friends to uncover the truth.</p><p></p><p>But what if that person had malicious intentions from the start?</p><p></p><p>If he caused internal strife within the Immortal Alliance because of this, giving others a chance to take advantage, wouldn't he become a traitor to the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Shao Jun couldn't help breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the First Weaver also said: "When you came to me before, I was indeed somewhat persuaded."</p><p></p><p>"But after some investigation, I discovered something amiss."</p><p></p><p>"Shao Jun, you are a high minister of the Immortal Alliance. Your every word and action must be prudent."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun nodded slightly, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Before figuring out the truth, don't act rashly. If that person contacts you again, report it immediately. I will handle it."</p><p></p><p>After giving instructions, the First Weaver's graceful figure left the white mist of the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was only after a long while that Shao Jun reacted.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he wanted to win over the First Weaver, but unexpectedly, he was easily swayed by the other party instead.</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of person are you?" Shao Jun gazed at the starry sky, as if that white-robed figure, like a celestial immortal, appeared before his eyes once more.</p><p></p><p>Let's put aside the Profound Immortal Boat on the other side of the starry sea for now.</p><p></p><p>Let's talk about the rainbow light speeding through the starry sea, heading towards the Profound Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>After Blue Feather transmitted the recorded images from the rainbow light to the Myriad Immortal Alliance, he concentrated on observing ahead.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were pitch black, seemingly tranquil.</p><p></p><p>But in his perception, killing intent lurked everywhere, all treacherous grounds.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Blue Feather, we've been out for so long, any gains?" </p><p></p><p>Golden Sun's voice came from behind.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather never had a good impression of this Harmonized Dao cultivator who liked to join in the excitement everywhere.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he only responded indifferently: "It can be considered a small achievement."</p><p></p><p>Golden Sun chuckled sinisterly and secretly transmitted: "Brother Blue Feather, now that we're in this starry sea, we're no longer bound by the Heavenly Venerate's power. Isn't it easier to break through?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard your cultivation technique is the orthodox transmission of the ancient Grand Magus, perhaps originating from the Immortal Realm. And I see you seem to have become much younger in a short time..."</p><p></p><p>"Golden Sun, you've overstepped." Blue Feather said sternly, interrupting Golden Sun's words.</p><p></p><p>Golden Sun wasn't embarrassed either. He cupped his hands and left with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather turned around and continued monitoring the dark void ahead of the rainbow light's path.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere on this flying boat, internally named "Toward the Venerate", was a bit subtle.</p><p></p><p>The protective rainbow light was nearly exhausted when escaping the Immortal Ruins, but the flying boat's speed did not decrease as it sped towards the other side of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>But in just a few short months, three Harmonized Dao experts on the boat had already died mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>If they died from the bizarre disasters outside the starry sea, so be it. The key was that these three Harmonized Dao experts all died inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Everyone personally examined them, but no one could figure out the truth behind their deaths.</p><p></p><p>Those three corpses were still lying quietly in the flying boat, their faces ruddy, as if they were just asleep.</p><p></p><p>But their insides, their entire souls, had been scooped out unknowingly.</p><p></p><p>"These are Harmonized Dao experts." Blue Feather felt very heavy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Yet they still died just like that, cause unknown.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather even somewhat missed the fallen phenomena in the Xuanhuang Realm. At the very least, even if one fell, the cause of death could be determined.</p><p></p><p>"However, I heard that before we set off, those phenomena also showed abnormalities? It's truly a time of troubles."</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather, who had survived since the descent of the great calamity, instinctively sighed at the extraordinary situation.</p><p></p><p>Just as his thoughts were wandering, a shrill scream suddenly woke him up.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather's expression changed. Realizing something was wrong, he immediately rushed towards the source of the sound.</p><p></p><p>By the time he arrived, four Harmonized Dao experts had already gathered.</p><p></p><p>But the focus of everyone's horrified gazes was on another corpse lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather's pupils contracted violently, because the one who died this time was none other than Golden Sun, who had just tried to get close to him!</p><p></p><p>Looking at Golden Sun's ruddy face and his body that had lost its life, a chill couldn't help but rise in Blue Feather's heart.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the survivors on the flying boat had all gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Old Guan, you do it." </p><p></p><p>From the crowd, Guan Xingxiu stepped out with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining Golden Sun's corpse, he made a judgment: "The same cause of death."</p><p></p><p>The crowd erupted in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Who the hell is it?"</p><p></p><p>"So aggrieved, too aggrieved! Each of us is a Harmonized Dao great cultivator who shook a region, yet we're being slaughtered inexplicably on this small boat!"</p><p></p><p>"We... might as well go back. It's not that I, Old Xu, am afraid of death. If we saw the legendary Profound Immortal Boat and heard the Dao before dying, so be it. But what is this now? If word gets out, we'll lose all face."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Quiet!" Guan Xingxiu impatiently interrupted everyone's discussion.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, we act together. No splitting up."</p><p></p><p>"It's not the void disasters, but someone comprehending the Dao and committing murder."</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu's words stirred up a thousand waves.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu waved his hand, suppressing everyone's voices.</p><p></p><p>"I say this, naturally I have my reasons."</p><p></p><p>Behind Guan Xingxiu, a small golden sword rose into the air.</p><p></p><p>After circling in the air, it instantly aimed at Golden Sun's corpse lying on the ground and flew over.</p><p></p><p>A faint black thread was cut off from the corpse by the small golden sword.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu pinched this thread, and it seemed to have a life of its own, still struggling frantically.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Blue Feather also said in disbelief: "Xingxiu, you mean the murderer easily killed those people by relying on this thread?"</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu respected Blue Feather quite a bit and nodded: "Based on the current situation, that's right."</p><p></p><p>"If any of you don't believe it, you can try the power of this black thread yourself."</p><p></p><p>"I'll do it!" Sun Luchang volunteered.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, the experiment ended with several holes being poked in his body.</p><p></p><p>This was the result even with the black thread being suppressed by the golden Falling Star Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? A mere thread is actually this powerful?" Sun Luchang was a bit dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The other Harmonized Dao experts also had unbelieving expressions.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu's gaze swept over the crowd as he declared: "Everyone, I know in the Immortal Alliance, you all hold important positions and have revered statuses. But don't forget, we are now in the starry sea!"</p><p></p><p>"I believe you've all felt that the upper limit of the laws in this starry sea far surpasses the Xuanhuang Realm. Plus, without the Heavenly Venerate's shackles, having a sudden enlightenment after being suppressed for so long, causing one's cultivation to soar... is not impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luchang said a bit unwillingly: "But even so, how can the gap be this huge? Not being a match is one thing, but not even being able to make a sound of struggle... If he really has such power, why not just kill us all?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luchang's words garnered agreement from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, Blue Feather spoke up: "Perhaps it's because this person's cultivation technique is a bit special. It's not an overwhelming difference in strength, but the battle occurs within the soul and sea of consciousness, not causing any energy fluctuations."</p><p></p><p>"As for this black thread, it's the medium for launching attacks."</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather had the most seniority among the group. With him speaking, the crowd gradually became convinced.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's follow the clues and find this bastard!"</p><p></p><p>At everyone's suggestion, Guan Xingxiu had the black thread come into contact with each surviving Harmonized Dao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>No one was found to have a connection with it.</p><p></p><p>"This murderer is cautious and cunning, definitely won't leave such an obvious flaw. In my opinion, this seems more like deliberately leaving misleading clues for us." The Harmonized Dao expert named Zimu said.</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily. He definitely didn't expect Brother Guan to also progress rapidly and actually discover the traces he left behind." There were immediately differing opinions among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Guan, how exactly did you comprehend the Dao? In this vast dark starry space, I don't have any insights at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Old Guan, tell everyone. Now with this hidden murderer lurking and eyeing us covetously, only if each of us comprehends the Dao and adds a bit of strength can we avoid being picked off one by one."</p><p></p><p>Everyone chattered, and Guan Xingxiu had no choice but to recount the process of his sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share our website on Facebook.

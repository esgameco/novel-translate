        <h1>Chapter 986</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed fraught with danger. Back then, we survivors from various realms had conflicts with the Xuanhuang Realm. Now that I'm here alone, revisiting old places, I naturally need to be more cautious," explained the Baihua Daoist.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? There were conflicts back then? How so? When the calamity struck, shouldn't we cultivators have worked together to overcome the crisis?" Li Fan pondered briefly and understood the possible reasons for the conflict.</p><p></p><p>A group of homeless people, encountering the prosperous cultivation realm of Xuanhuang, would inevitably give rise to various greedy thoughts. At that time, the Xuantian King was probably still around and would have definitely kept these ill-intentioned people out.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan asked knowingly.</p><p></p><p>The answer given by the Baihua Daoist was basically consistent with Li Fan's speculation: "That half-immortal was indeed very domineering. He directly rejected our proposal to unite and face the calamity together. And he wanted to expel us on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, naturally some of us were unhappy about that. So we had a little exchange..."</p><p></p><p>The golden light flickered around the Baihua Daoist's figure, obviously the "exchange" she mentioned was not as simple as a friendly competition.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a half-immortal who has been baptized by the aura of immortals, even if the ascension is incomplete, his strength is enough to crush ordinary cultivators. We knew we were no match and had to retreat. But that half-immortal truly had some immortal demeanor, bearing no grudges. Before we left, we were even given a lot of supplies..." The Baihua Daoist sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that although the Xuantian King cared about the people of Xuanhuang, he was not a foolishly kind person. He was very wary of outsiders, especially outsiders under the ravaging calamity. However, he was still a bit too merciful. If it were me, I would have slaughtered this group of people and plundered all their resources. In the end times, the more resources you have, the more hope you have of surviving. Letting the tiger return to the mountain may bring more troubles in the future..." In an instant, many thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The faint killing intent was hidden very well, but it still did not escape the perception of the Baihua Daoist's Liuli body.</p><p></p><p>The Baihua Daoist paused slightly in her speech, not knowing where the other party's killing intent came from out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this person in front of me has some connection with that half-immortal from back then?" The Baihua Daoist was suddenly shocked.</p><p></p><p>After pondering, the Baihua Daoist took the initiative to change the topic, shifting from past events to the disappearance at the fishing pond: "After coming to the Xuanhuang Realm, I still attached myself to Little Liuli's body. One reason is that I sensed the Xuanhuang Realm seemed much more dangerous than before, and secondly, Liuli's wisdom fruit was very beneficial to my cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, life was quite peaceful, until the arrival of you and that stone tablet cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"If it was just fishing for treasures from the pond, so be it. But he wanted to comprehend some Dao of Fishing..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Baihua Daoist glanced at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the stone tablet's decision had a lot to do with Li Fan's instigation.</p><p></p><p>"This supreme treasure fishing pond was obviously created by an [Nameless True Immortal] who had already established his own Dao. How could he allow others to interfere with his own Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"For the stone tablet to comprehend the Dao of Fishing, he would inevitably have to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"There will be retaliation. As for the stone slab and where this fishing pool ultimately leads to, I'm afraid it's not something you and I can discover," the Hundred Flowers Daoist shook his head and sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist's explanation had no flaws. Li Fan asked himself, if someone wanted to understand how to transform the illusory into reality and reverse time and space through Huan Zhen, then he would have to fight them to the death.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Li Fan thought of something else and frowned slightly, "Since the true immortal's path does not allow others to interfere, then why did that 'Inscription Daoist' leave behind several true immortal seal characters? The immortals of the Immortal Ruins have been enlightened for thousands of years, so why didn't they attract the attention of the Inscription Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist pondered for a moment, as if organizing his words, "Fellow Daoist, I'm afraid you have misunderstood. The Dao that the immortals of the Immortal Ruins have realized has nothing to do with the Inscription Daoist's path."</p><p></p><p>"The Inscription Daoist's path can be inscribed as characters. The immortals of the Immortal Ruins borrowed the character 'hunger' to realize the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"The path he pursued may be 'hunger' itself, or it may be related to 'hunger'. But it will definitely not be 'inscription'..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if Fellow Daoist can understand what I'm saying?" The Hundred Flowers Daoist looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was too stupid to figure out such a simple point, but rather that an idea suddenly popped into his mind and he wanted to confirm it with the Hundred Flowers Daoist.</p><p></p><p>"I once saw that the immortals of the Immortal Ruins had chains locked around their bodies, and originally thought it was a suppression imposed by outsiders."</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. The path he cultivates may be related to 'resisting the instinct of hunger'."</p><p></p><p>From himself to others, Li Fan had a set of reasoning, and in an instant, he deduced many things.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan lost in thought, the Hundred Flowers Daoist also remained silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan spoke again, "Although Fellow Daoist has explained a lot, there is no concrete evidence after all. Those who are not of our kind cannot be trusted. For the sake of the living beings of the Mysterious and Yellow realms, I'm afraid I still have to trouble Fellow Daoist..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's reaction seemed to be within the Hundred Flowers Daoist's expectations. She was not agitated in the slightest, but said in a deep voice, "What if I am also a cultivator of the Mysterious and Yellow realms now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was stunned, "What does Fellow Daoist mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>"I borrowed Liuli's body and reconstructed Liuli's form. Liuli took shape in the Mysterious and Yellow realms by borrowing the power of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"In a sense, I am now also nurtured by the heaven and earth of the Mysterious and Yellow realms," the Hundred Flowers Daoist said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"If Fellow Daoist doesn't believe me, you can return to the Mysterious and Yellow realms with me and sense the will of heaven and earth. With my cultivation level, if I were an outsider, heaven and earth would naturally produce an instinctive aversion. Cultivators in the mortal realm can see it at a glance, and it cannot be concealed at all."</p><p></p><p>In order to verify the other party's words, Li Fan brought the Hundred Flowers Daoist to the Mysterious and Yellow realms.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he switched to the perspective of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Li Fan saw that heaven and earth had no ill will towards the Hundred Flowers Daoist.</p><p></p><p>There was even a hint of intimacy and attraction within it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel strange.</p><p></p><p>"What is Fellow Daoist's current cultivation level?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Um, if it were in the Wansheng Realm, after my cultivation technique was perfected and my body transformed into Liuli, the next step would be to accept the baptism of heavenly tribulation and ascend to immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Although the immortal path is severed and I cannot ascend to immortality, my cultivation level has stagnated. But over the years, my strength has still been constantly increasing, especially after absorbing the Liuli Wisdom Fruit..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 950</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"I see that your cultivation is only at the Nascent Soul stage, so how powerful could your secret technique be?" Xin Hongzhang shook his head slightly, "I'm telling you this secret without seeking anything in return. As for that so-called 'Divine Possession' of yours, you can keep it to yourself."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's face instantly turned somewhat unsightly. </p><p></p><p>He seemed about to lash out, but ultimately restrained himself and patiently explained in a low voice, "Brother Xin, although I'm only at the Nascent Soul stage, the Divine Possession I can summon has even greater combat power than me. It can even withstand one or two Primordial Spirit cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Hearing this, Xin Hongzhang's expression became much more serious.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, Brother, we can test it out," Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang, now slightly sobered up, observed Li Fan carefully again. </p><p></p><p>"He indeed only has Nascent Soul cultivation. Even if he harbors ill intentions, I can easily kill him. Fine, let's see what trick he's trying to sell."</p><p></p><p>Sensing no malice from Li Fan, only pure sincerity, Xin Hongzhang pondered for a moment before agreeing to Li Fan's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>The two, one in front and one behind, left the defensive fortress.</p><p></p><p>They flew to a desolate, uninhabited area in Jiushan Province. </p><p></p><p>"Brother Fan, I think this place will do. Let me witness this so-called Divine Possession of yours," Xin Hongzhang said abruptly as he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan surveyed the surroundings and nodded, "Alright, Brother Xin, please stand further back. I'm afraid of accidentally injuring you..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang sneered inwardly but still complied. </p><p></p><p>He watched with interest as Li Fan, with a solemn expression, chanted, "Compassion in the mortal world, bless the people. As I pray, the divine body descends..."</p><p></p><p>"Decree!"</p><p></p><p>"How very ostentatious," Xin Hongzhang thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, sensing the emergence of a strange and powerful aura, the initial ridicule in Xin Hongzhang's heart vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Replaced by utmost gravity. </p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>A goat-headed, human-bodied monster appeared before Xin Hongzhang, summoned by the fellow named Fan Li.</p><p></p><p>The monster had its eyes tightly shut, but Xin Hongzhang felt a sense of being locked onto.</p><p></p><p>Shadow and light appeared simultaneously on the goat-headed, human-bodied monster.</p><p></p><p>It looked bizarre yet sacred.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xin, how is it?" Li Fan's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Xin Hongzhang awaken from his shock.</p><p></p><p>He didn't respond, but assessed the strength of the monster before him.</p><p></p><p>The other party also seemed to see through his thoughts and said slowly, "Just looking is futile. Brother Xin, are you interested in sparring with my Divine Possession?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang narrowed his eyes and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Then be careful, Brother Xin!" Li Fan called out.</p><p></p><p>"This speed..." Before he could even be shocked, Xin Hongzhang felt the monster's huge hands tightly gripping his neck from behind.</p><p></p><p>Unable to break free, the scene before Xin Hongzhang's eyes suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>As if falling into a boundless ghostly realm, five blood moons intertwined in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding him were thousands upon thousands of terrifying demon gods, all casting their gazes towards him.</p><p></p><p>Under the horrifying and oppressive atmosphere, Xin Hongzhang's thoughts seemed to freeze in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He completely gave up resistance, letting himself be slaughtered like a fish!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xin?"</p><p></p><p>Only Li Fan's shout awakened him from the nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Xin Hongzhang looked left and right</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he discovered that the ram-headed monster from earlier had disappeared without a trace. He looked at Li Fan with a mixture of shock and suspicion, wanting to say something but stopping himself.</p><p></p><p>"How is the power of this Divine Possession?" Li Fan asked smugly.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang remained silent for a moment before finally uttering four words: "I am no match..."</p><p></p><p>"No worries, this secret technique has no restrictions against being practiced together. If you are willing, I can pass it on to you," Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Having personally experienced the terrifying power of the Divine Possession, Xin Hongzhang instinctively wanted to agree.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking back to the sinister ghostly spirits he had seen, Xin Hongzhang couldn't help but feel some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique seemed a bit unorthodox.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, such a divine and mystical art, yet the other party was willing to pass it on for free?</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang's heart was filled with doubts.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Xin Hongzhang's reservations, Li Fan smiled and pulled him down to the ground to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I have a bit of an ulterior motive in being willing to teach you the Divine Possession."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Xin Hongzhang's interest was piqued as he looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"This all goes back to the origins of this secret art. It is said that in ancient times, gods and demons ran rampant in the world. We humans were merely food for the gods and demons, our fate miserable. A sage with a compassionate heart emerged, making a great vow to suppress all the gods and demons in the world and return the world to brightness..."</p><p></p><p>"You mean, the ram-headed monster you summoned just now was an ancient god or demon that had been suppressed?" Xin Hongzhang's expression was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded: "Although the sage suppressed all the gods and demons in the world, they cannot be completely destroyed. In order to prevent their escape, the sage used his own body as a prison to suppress them for eternity."</p><p></p><p>"Also, to prevent his own power from waning after countless years, he left behind a secret art. Anyone who cultivates the Divine Possession can use their body to suppress endless gods and demons. In return, they can summon projections of the imprisoned gods and demons to fight for them..."</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of any compassionate sages or myriad gods and demons before.</p><p></p><p>It completely contradicted his previous worldview and was hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued: "Originally, I was just like you, thinking this matter was too absurd. But after truly cultivating this secret art and successfully summoning a projection of a god or demon, I understood..."</p><p></p><p>"This secret art is not native to the Xuanhuang Realm. The events it records did not take place in the Xuanhuang Realm either. However, the power of the secret art is indeed real and effective."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xin Hongzhang suddenly had a great realization.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this secret art has a unique characteristic. Each person's cultivation of the art has a unique mark. After passing on the art to someone else, this mark does not disappear. Instead, it gains benefits from the next person cultivating the art, summoning more and stronger projections of gods and demons..."</p><p></p><p>This explanation was a bit abstruse, and Xin Hongzhang didn't fully understand what it meant at first.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, Li Fan demonstrated with actual results.</p><p></p><p>"For example..."</p><p></p><p>Three demon gods with raging evil auras instantly appeared around Xin Hongzhang.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding him completely.</p><p></p><p>Tainted by the endless demonic energy, Xin Hongzhang swallowed and stood nervously, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"I have already passed on this secret art to over a dozen destined individuals, so the number of gods and demons I can summon has increased to three."</p><p></p><p>"The more cultivators the art is passed to, the greater the number of gods and demons that can be summoned. This is why I don't mind, and am even very willing, to pass on the Divine Possession art to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with a smile.</p>

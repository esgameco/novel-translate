            <p>A more appropriate term would be "small world" or "cave heaven," existences on a lower level.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the newly born Five Elements Grand Cave Heaven was formed here.</p><p></p><p>"The gate of the profound feminine, is the root of heaven and earth," Li Fan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Similar words were also passed down in the classics of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth nurture all beings.</p><p></p><p>But where do heaven and earth come from?</p><p></p><p>Among the group of cultivators, there were no lack of individuals full of exploratory spirit.</p><p></p><p>Apart from those who were previously mentioned, who were constantly trying to reestablish contact with other cultivation realms beyond the Xuanhuang Realm,</p><p></p><p>there was also a group of cultivators specializing in researching the birth of heaven and earth and the origin of living beings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had read some related books before.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators believed that, just like people, heaven and earth also constantly grow and evolve.</p><p></p><p>The original Xuanhuang Realm was highly likely to be just a small existance resembling a miniature cave heaven.</p><p></p><p>After unimaginably long ages, it eventually evolved into its current state.</p><p></p><p>And those miniature cave heavens could possibly have been created by powerful cultivators or ancient true immortals out of thin air, or they could be born from self-evolution in the void.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were still not very clear about how vast their entire "time-space" existence was.</p><p></p><p>But without a doubt, the Xuanhuang Realm was just a negligible part in the vast and boundless expanse of time and space.</p><p></p><p>Even though there weren't many cultivators who truly cared about this fact, they could not change its nature.</p><p></p><p>Derived from the endless time and space, what cultivators called the "root of heaven and earth" was forming the embryonic structure of the world.</p><p></p><p>That was the origin of the world, the gathering of laws, and the beginning of creation.</p><p></p><p>Existing only in theory, no one had truly been fortunate enough to witness it.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, today, through cycles of information collection over several lifetimes and with his unwavering will, Li Fan finally entered this place.</p><p></p><p>Even though the various primary laws contained here were too profound for Li Fan to currently comprehend, he couldn't help but feel a touch of "hearing the Tao in the morning, dying in the evening" in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Colorful particles collided sideways and vertically, giving rise to different scenes.</p><p></p><p>And the horizontal and vertical lines that permeated the entire space, like a giant weaving machine, were weaving the birth of the "world."</p><p></p><p>Enthralled by the magnificent scenery here for a long time, Li Fan finally reluctantly snapped out of it.</p><p></p><p>Although upon deeper reflection, it seemed like he hadn't realized anything worthwhile, but his entire soul felt as if it was soaking in hot water, extremely comfortable and even experiencing an inexplicable elevation.</p><p></p><p>Amidst his joy, Li Fan didn't forget the purpose of his journey.</p><p></p><p>"Seize the essence of heaven and earth to form the elemental infant."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes glittered.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he truly acted and plundered the "root of heaven and earth" present here in the form of his own infant cave heaven.</p><p></p><p>If he could truly accomplish this, along with his half-built "True Foundation," he should be able to freely evolve his own infant cave heaven domain akin to shaping a miraculous object from changes in will.</p><p></p><p>Hidden dragons, volcanoes, Dharma eyes...</p><p></p><p>As long as there was concrete information available, they could evolve in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>"The foundation is too shallow. It's not just a case of biting off more than one can chew, it's more like an ant trying to swallow an elephant," Li Fan self-deprecatingly remarked.</p><p></p><p>Just after observing for a while, Li Fan rejected his suicidal idea.</p><p></p><p>An ant trying to swallow an elephant would only lead to a dead end.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after a long time, Li Fan, who had achieved harmony realm cultivation, would have a profound enough understanding of the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Returning here with the cultivation of Golden Pill realm, there might be some certainty in plundering it.</p><p></p><p>For now...</p><p></p><p>It was more pragmatic to focus first on the "Five Elements Grand Cave Heaven."</p><p></p><p>After staying here for a while, Li Fan started to notice some clues.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the original Five Elements Cave Heaven being forcibly relocated, it had been stimulated.</p><p></p><p>In the intertwining of the "root of heaven and earth," new cave heavens were being rewoven.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, all I need to do is patiently wait."</p><p></p><p>"Newly born cave heavens are weak and easier to control."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a plan in mind, and he couldn't help but relax a bit.</p><p></p><p>He did not care about what might happen outside, just immersed himself in the observation of the birth process of the cave heavens.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally thought that a person's birth required ten months of pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>The birth of a cave heaven should have been many times more difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, it was evident that trying to use human reasoning to speculate on heaven and earth would inevitably lead to mistakes.</p><p></p><p>The speed of formation of the new Five Elements Grand Cave Heaven far exceeded Li Fan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of collisions between particles was becoming increasingly frequent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like fireworks exploding one after another in front of Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gold, wood, water, fire, earth...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan began to perceive the energy fluctuations of the five attributes being born in this space.</p><p></p><p>But they were all bound by their respective restraints and not running wild.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes couldn't directly see the actual scene of the cave heaven's birth.</p><p></p><p>He could only indirectly sense it through the changes in energy within the "root of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>As the embryonic form of the Five Elements Cave Heaven was about to appear, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, he noticed that the lines composing his body began to collapse outward.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that perhaps the "weaving" of the Five Elements Cave Heaven had caused a loss of energy in the "root of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Hence, it was attempting to absorb everything it could from the outside to make up for its own needs.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan, this invading foreign object, became the primary target.</p><p></p><p>Should he directly devour the Five Elements Cave Heaven here, ascending to the Infant realm?</p><p></p><p>Or should he first leave the "root of heaven and earth," wait until the Five Elements Cave Heaven fully formed and manifested in the Heavenly Spirit Zho...</p><p></p><p>Would a buddha struggle to reach enlightenment?</p><p></p><p>或許在許久之後，成就合道境界的李凡，對於天地之理有了足夠深刻的了解。</p><p></p><p>以金丹境界重新回到這裡。才有那麼一絲將其掠奪的把握。</p><p></p><p>Even though it might result in disintegration here, at least no one would interfere.</p><p></p><p>Near the external Heavenly Spirit Zho, there were cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance patrolling.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were negligent, the upheaval caused by the Golden Pill's ascension to the Infant realm would surely not escape their notice.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if Li Fan was persuasive, he would probably not be able to deceive them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>"If I really fail by accident, I can always try next time."</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan stopped resisting and let this space absorb his lines.</p><p></p><p>Like a thread being continuously drawn out into a fine line, Li Fan's body was visibly shrinking at a rapid pace.</p><p></p><p>However, he was unafraid and even took advantage of this absorbing force to fly towards the position of the nascent Five Elements Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The 'upper part' of the 'root of heaven and earth.'"</p><p></p><p>Five distinct colored globes of light were gathering.</p><p></p><p>Explosions of nodes kept occurring in the horizontal and vertical threads below, making the five-element light globes more clear and stable.</p>

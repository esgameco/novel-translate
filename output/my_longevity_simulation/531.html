        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan changed his serious expression and became extremely amiable. </p><p></p><p>"It seems like the flowers modern cultivators play with are a bit too fancy for me, a bit old-fashioned." </p><p></p><p>He patted Zhou Kebao on the shoulder, overflowing with words of praise. </p><p></p><p>"If you guys can really create this thing, all past grievances will be settled with a stroke of the pen! Even deep cooperation in the future is not impossible. You guys have strong backgrounds, and I, Li Fan, am not lacking in that department too." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed a proud expression and painted a bright picture for Zhou Kebao. </p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Kebao had no choice but to believe it to be true. </p><p></p><p>After all, being able to obtain so many strategic resources in a short period of time was something ordinary cultivators couldn't achieve. </p><p></p><p>As a beneficiary of power and interests, Zhou Kebao knew very well that in the Wanxian Alliance, sometimes background and connections were even more important than cultivation level. </p><p></p><p>"Come, let's talk more about the details." Li Fan pulled Zhou Kebao, showing keen interest in the mobile fairy city cave dwelling. </p><p></p><p>Seeing the negotiation going so smoothly, Zhou Kebao was also overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>Without delay, he pointed to the images in the air. </p><p></p><p>He enlarged each area one by one and explained it in detail. </p><p></p><p>After a while, Zhou Kebao had already talked until his mouth was dry. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally nodded in satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>"If it is discovered, will there be any blame from above?" After a moment of silence, Li Fan spoke again. </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Daoist Li, rest assured, where there is no prohibition, there is freedom. In the Wanxian Alliance, there is no rule that prohibits cultivators from imitating the structure of the fairy city to build cave dwellings." Zhou Kebao assured repeatedly. </p><p></p><p>"As long as the Daoist keeps a low profile and doesn't show off all over the world, who would have nothing better to do than cause trouble for you?" </p><p></p><p>"Of course, if it is really reported and causes a big commotion, we can simply destroy it. After the storm has passed, we can rebuild a new one for the Daoist." </p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao's face was full of triumphant self-satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>"Very well! I increasingly feel that Daoist Zhou, you and I are of the same kind!" Li Fan smiled faintly. </p><p></p><p>Taking out a blank jade slip, Li Fan held it in his hand. </p><p></p><p>After a while, he handed it to Zhou Kebao: "This is my additional request for the fairy city cave dwelling. Go back and calculate it, and quickly give me a quotation." </p><p></p><p>"If there are no major issues, we will finalize this matter like this." </p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you still think I, Li Fan, am easy to bully, then we might have to take it to the end." A flash of fierceness passed through Li Fan's eyes. </p><p></p><p>"Daoist Li, rest assured, we know better!" Zhou Kebao's face showed joy, taking the jade slip and hastily glancing at it. </p><p></p><p>He then hurriedly bid farewell and left. </p><p></p><p>"What a bunch of parasites..." </p><p></p><p>Watching Zhou Kebao's figure disappear in the distance, Li Fan snorted coldly, saying under his breath, "But what does it have to do with me? I should thank them. Without these parasites, how could I benefit from the strict rules of the Wanxian Alliance." </p><p></p><p>After a cold laugh, Li Fan gently pointed forward. </p><p></p><p>The miniature view of the fairy city cave dwelling suddenly reappeared. </p><p></p><p>"This is a floating city of my own..." </p><p></p><p>"This is a good thing. Plus, it doesn't cost me any effort." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, marking the miniature view of the floating city according to his thoughts continuously. </p><p></p><p>Time passed. </p><p></p><p>Three days later, Zhou Kebao hurriedly brought the prepared quotation. </p><p></p><p>"Eighteen million six hundred and thirty thousand contribution points..." Li Fan pondered. </p><p></p><p>Seemingly afraid that Li Fan would find it expensive, Zhou Kebao quickly explained, "This amount is only for the additional requirements of the Daoist, as well as some labor costs. All the materials needed to build the fairy city were provided by us." </p><p></p><p>"To reconcile with the Daoist, we have really invested heavily this time." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan said indifferently, "Don't say such things in front of me. Now, in the entire Wanxian Alliance, besides me, Li Fan, who dares to turn the fairy city into a cave dwelling?" </p><p></p><p>"If I don't act, these materials of yours will just be stored inventory in the warehouse." </p><p></p><p>"Now, they can be directly converted into contribution points..." </p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao dared not argue and could only reluctantly agree. </p><p></p><p>He then took out a shining golden deed and made some modifications before handing it over. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a look at it. Besides Zhou Kebao's name, the names of nine other cultivators, such as Gou Zihao and Qu Dailong, were written on it. </p><p></p><p>After carefully checking to ensure no mistakes, Li Fan also signed his name on it. </p><p></p><p>As two golden lights shot into their bodies, Zhou Kebao finally relaxed. </p><p></p><p>According to the agreement, Li Fan transferred five million contribution points to Zhou Kebao. </p><p></p><p>"When will the fairy city cave dwelling be completed?" Looking at Zhou Kebao's delighted expression, Li Fan inquired. </p><p></p><p>"The day the fairy city is completed is the day the fairy city cave dwelling is completed." Zhou Kebao assured. </p><p></p><p>"So soon?" This time, Li Fan was somewhat surprised. </p><p></p><p>After all, he had gathered all the available cultivators in the Cloud Realm, working overtime day and night, just to barely catch up with the deadline set by the first council. </p><p></p><p>And now, there were less than two months left until the completion of the Cloud Realm City. </p><p></p><p>To complete the construction of the cave dwelling in such a short time, it seemed that Zhou Kebao still had some spare energy. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's rare expression of surprise, Zhou Kebao also felt quite pleased and smiled without saying a word. </p><p></p><p>"Alright, I will wait for the day of double happiness." </p><p></p><p>"You may go now!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan issued the order for Zhou Kebao to depart again.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, with each day slipping away.</p><p></p><p>The faces of all the busy cultivators couldn't help but reveal expressions of anticipation. </p><p></p><p>All their struggles and efforts were for the reconstruction of the Cloud City, for Lord Li Fan to reward them based on merit, and for the allocation of various positions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also did not forget the task entrusted by the first council. He had fully integrated the diagram of the "Mysterious Heaven Locking the Hidden Formation" into the foundation of the fairy city. </p><p></p><p>Without drawing any attention.</p><p></p><p>As the foundation-laying ceremony of the fairy city approached, one day, Li Fan was alone in a secret room when he suddenly sensed something. </p><p></p><p>It turned out that the Meteorite Immortal Realm, which he hadn't entered for a long time, could finally be accessed again. </p><p></p><p>"Fortune bestows Xuan Yellow Celestial Venerable!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan performed the ritual and returned to the Meteorite Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The story continued from the last time; he and Xu Ke were entrusted by Lu Ya to go to the Southern Dark Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei, why do you think Senior Lu Ya would entrust such an important task to me?" </p><p></p><p>"The Southern Dark Demon Mountain is not a good place. According to what other senior brothers said, it is filled with many terrifying demons..."</p><p></p><p>"If it were a cultivator with a slightly higher level of strength, would they have a greater chance of success?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Ke tilted his head, his big eyes filled with doubt. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually scratched him. </p><p></p><p>"Can you be quiet? This is the tenth time you've asked this question on the way." </p><p></p><p>"I really don't understand why you don't just ask your Senior Lu Ya? Why bother me for no reason?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Ke felt a bit wronged: "You're talking nonsense, where did ten times come from, it's clearly the ninth time..." </p><p></p><p>Just as the two were teasing each other, a clear dragon's roar suddenly came from the distant sky, interrupting them.</p>

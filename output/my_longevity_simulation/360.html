            <p>Li Fan paused for a moment, then held his breath and slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>Until he reached the broken stone, he did not feel any changes in himself.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's vigilance in his heart still did not diminish.</p><p></p><p>This enchanting area was filled with various strange phenomena, so he could not be careless.</p><p></p><p>Without touching the broken stone, he observed it carefully from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The broken stone was partially buried in the soil, roughly forming a square shape about an arm's length wide.</p><p></p><p>Its edges showed clear signs of being broken.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if it was deliberately cut from a complete stone.</p><p></p><p>The word "chaos" seemed to have some other characters carved in front and behind it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, precisely the standalone character "chaos" was separated, and no trace of the strokes of the preceding and following characters could be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at the appearance of this broken stone, it doesn't seem like a natural break. Instead, it looks like it was deliberately cut apart."</p><p></p><p>"Chaos."</p><p></p><p>"Is the area centered around this circular giant pit, filled with distorted directions and even bizarre phenomena like human body transformation, related to this word?"</p><p></p><p>"If one word can trigger so many strange phenomena..."</p><p></p><p>"What relationship does this 'chaos character stone' have with the Tianyi?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan decided to temporarily ignore it and check if there were any signs of an "exit" around.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, at the bottom of the circular giant pit, besides the sticky, unknown substances everywhere, there was only this chaotic character stone.</p><p></p><p>"The reverse-folded monster now acts solely on instinct; it shouldn't be deceiving me."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of thought, Li Fan returned to the side of the broken stone, activated his spiritual power, and lifted it from the ground.</p><p></p><p>It was not like any celestial treasure; it was as heavy as an ordinary stone.</p><p></p><p>And after it was pulled out, there was still no expected exit revealed beneath the broken stone.</p><p></p><p>No abnormal situation occurred.</p><p></p><p>"It's strange."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan set down the chaotic character stone and rubbed his chin.</p><p></p><p>Time was running out, and Li Fan didn't waste time searching for other possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he focused intently on the stone in front of him, pondering where the exit might be.</p><p></p><p>With little time to waste, after a moment, Li Fan extended his finger and shot a black light towards it.</p><p></p><p>As he retreated, he observed the changes that occurred when the Extinction Sword and the chaotic character stone collided.</p><p></p><p>The black sword light flew in an instant to the front of the broken stone.</p><p></p><p>Right before the collision, the black light suddenly distorted.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's gaze, three extremely familiar energies were resolved from the black light.</p><p></p><p>Madness, darkness, swirling... </p><p></p><p>It was the three forces that made up the Grand Extinction Sword: Sky Devil, Ink Kill, and the power of the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the chaotic character stone, the black light gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>Then, these energies that were supposed to be under Li Fan's control started to struggle against each other, each fighting on its own.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an inexplicable ripple burst forth from the chaotic character stone.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping towards the outside of the circular giant pit.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, Li Fan was unable to avoid it and was struck through.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed suddenly, thinking he had been ambushed.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, the ripple was more bark than bite.</p><p></p><p>He only felt a tingling sensation as if ants were crawling all over his body, but after a quick circulation of spiritual energy, it was soon suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused, staring at the chaotic character stone thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"The chaos character has dissipated, only the form remains."</p><p></p><p>"But even so, it can still affect my Extinction Sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced towards where the three forces had been tangled together.</p><p></p><p>In the recent disturbance, they had already destroyed each other in the struggle.</p><p></p><p>The last piece of the Black Death talisman he wore had dimmed to the point of almost disappearing.</p><p></p><p>For anyone else experiencing this situation, they would have been overwhelmed by the chaos and unable to think clearly.</p><p></p><p>However, with "Huan Zhen" as his underlying foundation, Li Fan remained unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Without having to consider his own crisis, Li Fan's thoughts raced as he continued to ponder.</p><p></p><p>After trying various methods, when the Black Death talisman completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>The white mist that had been omnipresent around him, with no constraints, began to consume Li Fan's lifespan.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, Li Fan's physical age had jumped from 51 to 52.</p><p></p><p>Although half the reason for the passage of 51 years had already passed, the terrifying speed at which the white mist devoured his lifespan was evident.</p><p></p><p>His life was rapidly slipping away before his eyes, yet it didn't make Li Fan panic. Instead, it made his mind even calmer.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan's lifespan had reached a hundred years, suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He leaped towards the broken stone, using his hand as a pen to trace the character "chaos" on the stone's surface.</p><p></p><p>Each stroke quickly formed.</p><p></p><p>A faint golden light flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic character on the broken stone seemed to regain some luster.</p><p></p><p>What astonished Li Fan was that the moment the character chaos reappeared, his spiritual energy was instantly depleted.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Nine Laws Golden Pill sensing the danger and quickly replenishing his body with spiritual energy from the Five Elements, he would have been drained instantly.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Fan felt a blackout and almost fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>By absorbing his entire spiritual energy, the chaotic character stone also underwent an inexplicable change.</p><p></p><p>The characters seemed to come alive, exuding a terrifying aura naturally.</p><p></p><p>The entire stone became ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Emitting a dream-like light.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan quickly hid inside to avoid further loss of lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the chaotic character stone this time was absorbing the spiritual energy within Li Fan, he did not sense its influence when he approached the broken stone.</p><p></p><p>However, he continuously heard creaking sounds from the surroundings. The sticky substances underground, as if imbued with life, started to twist and move mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly noticed that the motionless mutated corpses standing in the circular stone pit were trembling slightly, as if they would come back to life at any moment.</p><p></p><p>As the instigator of all these happenings, Li Fan couldn't help but feel his hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a place to linger."</p><p></p><p>Observing the flashing light and the chaotic character stone between reality and illusion, Li Fan had a vague feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It felt like a door, and he could enter it at any time.</p><p></p><p>There was no sense of danger ahead, only the sole chance of survival inside.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Li Fan flew towards it.</p><p></p><p>As he expected, the stone felt as if it didn't exist.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan passed straight through it.</p><p></p><p>His vision blurred, and an endless white mist filled his sight.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Li Fan left that eerie realm and returned to the normal white mist barrier.</p>

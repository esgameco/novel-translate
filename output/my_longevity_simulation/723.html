            <p>Xu Bai stood behind him and smiled, saying, "No need to worry, my lord. Who would have thought that a Longevity Celestial Venerable capable of reversing the laws of heaven and earth would suddenly appear without any signs."</p><p></p><p>"It's extremely mysterious, not a single clue can be traced. It's truly unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Even a Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't just appear out of thin air like this," Xu Bai said in a deep tone.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong nodded slightly, "That's why speculations outside now suggest that this 'Longevity Celestial Venerable' is very likely an ancient cultivator who has survived from the great calamity until now."</p><p></p><p>"Just like you," Nan Gong Shirong glanced at Xu Bai and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai lowered his head in contemplation, "Ancient cultivator…."</p><p></p><p>All cultivators around the world were extremely curious about the true identity of this 'Longevity Celestial Venerable.' However, despite digging for so long, not a single piece of information about him was leaked.</p><p></p><p>After all, the number of cultivators in the Immortal Alliance was limited, and after excluding them one by one, no suitable candidates could be found. Therefore, there was a high possibility that this newly emerged Celestial Venerable came from the ancient era, hidden in the mist, comprehending the laws of heaven and earth. Only recently did he attain enlightenment and succeeded in achieving Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the 'Longevity Celestial Venerable' was a cultivator from the Five Elders Council...</p><p></p><p>The recent frequent actions of the Five Elders Council have denied this assumption.</p><p></p><p>First, an official announcement congratulated the birth of the new Celestial Venerable. Then, they quickly recalled all the cultivators who were visiting in the Immortal Alliance's territory for friendly exchanges. On the border areas, all living forces completely retreated...</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the Five Elders Council harbored great apprehension towards the birth of this new powerful practitioner in the Longevity Realm.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, do you think that under the protection of the power of the 'Longevity Celestial Venerable,' cultivators who fall can truly be resurrected?" Xu Bai suddenly asked after remaining silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I personally have doubts about it. Although the Celestial Venerable's power is formidable and awe-inspiring, the matter of 'resurrection' is still too miraculous," Nan Gong Shirong shook his head, "Even if it were possible, it probably requires certain conditions to be fulfilled. If a cultivator is already dead without a complete body and scattered soul, wanting to be resurrected in such a situation…"</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong snorted coldly, "Let alone the Longevity Celestial Venerable, even the legendary Da Luo Golden Immortal, I'm afraid would be powerless."</p><p></p><p>"However, the truth will be revealed in fourteen days. We just need to wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Bai focused his gaze on the visible numbers in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The font, alternating between black and white, was flowing freely and floating quietly in the sky. According to the official explanation of the Immortal Alliance, the countdown represents the progress of the Longevity Celestial Venerable defying the laws.</p><p></p><p>When the countdown reaches zero, the laws of life and death in the Xuan Huang Realm will be completely reversed. An era where everyone can be resurrected will also arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see the methods of this 'Longevity Celestial Venerable,'" Xu Bai squinted his eyes and lightly waved a folding fan.</p><p></p><p>As the countdown in the sky of Xuan Huang Realm continued to decrease.</p><p></p><p>The loser of the struggle against the reversed laws, Lan Yu, seemed unwilling to accept his fate.</p><p></p><p>Instead of stopping the bounty for life-extending treasures, he increased the stakes.</p><p></p><p>He even used his cultivation technique, the 'Sky Transforming Feather Art,' as a reward.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Lan Yu was desperately trying to delay the arrival of his end.</p><p></p><p>However, the Longevity Celestial Venerable didn't overlook his intentions.</p><p></p><p>On the day the countdown turned to “one,” silently, the phenomenon of the fall of cultivators in the Immortal Alliance appeared abruptly in the sky above the Source Dao Province.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator Lan Yu of the Immortal Alliance, for cultivating…"</p><p></p><p>Unlike the shared grief of heaven and earth seen by Li Fan in previous lifetimes, perhaps it was because Lan Yu in this life made movements against the principles of heaven and earth. A downfall phenomenon similar to that of the new Taoist practitioners appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, shortly after this sight emerged, before the cultivators in the Source Dao Province could react,</p><p></p><p>the countdown numbers on the sky curtain of the Xuan Huang Realm turned into black and white interweaving duoqi, rushing straight towards the Source Dao Province.</p><p></p><p>At the moment when the phenomenon of Lan Yu's downfall was shielded by the numbers, the digits instantly returned to “one.”</p><p></p><p>The entire Xuan Huang Realm trembled slightly, as if some marvelous change was happening.</p><p></p><p>After the sky cleared again, all cultivators could vaguely see, a solemn and ancient mansion, floating in the sky curtain of the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Resurrection Mansion."</p><p></p><p>The three large characters on the plaque of the mansion were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators who saw the Resurrection Mansion naturally recalled information about the resurrection of the 'Longevity Celestial Venerable.'</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of the Resurrection Mansion, when a cultivator fell, a part of their true spirit would enter the Resurrection Mansion.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for eighteen cycles of reincarnation, accompanied by the memories of the cultivators, the true spirit could return to the world through the Resurrection Mansion.</p><p></p><p>If one had prepared their physical body in advance, they could directly enter it.</p><p></p><p>If someone died unexpectedly and didn't have time to prepare, they would randomly be born on the new bodies of living beings in the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>When the detailed rules of the Resurrection Mansion were seen, the cultivators of the Xuan Huang Realm were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>They never expected that the so-called "resurrection" was actually real.</p><p></p><p>However, this method of resurrection was somewhat beyond what they could accept.</p><p></p><p>Survival and reproduction are human instincts.</p><p></p><p>If the path seemed hopeless, the future could be entrusted to the next generation.</p><p></p><p>But according to the rules of the Resurrection Mansion, the newborn babies treasured by their families might be occupied by cultivators who fell eighteen years ago…</p><p></p><p>What's the difference between this and taking over someone's body?</p><p></p><p>Who can guarantee that the cultivator who died years ago and now resurrected has no grudge against oneself?</p><p></p><p>If after painstakingly raising a newborn, they grow up only to betray oneself, how would that be fair?</p><p></p><p>Everything one has accumulated might end up benefiting a "stranger," how absurd is that?</p><p></p><p>The operation of the Resurrection Mansion seemed contradictory to the ethical values of the current practitioners. The cultivators of the Xuan Huang Realm were initially unable to accept it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a more detailed explanation from the Immortal Alliance arrived soon.</p><p></p><p>In the Resurrection Mansion, the true spirit would only retain memories of the previous life. Emotions like love, hatred, and resentment from the past life would be cleansed. Looking back at the experiences of the past life would be like recalling a dream, without excessive identification.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the return of the true spirit would not directly take over a body but merge with it. The essence of life itself would not change, only adding memories of the "previous life."</p><p></p><p>After this explanation, although the cultivators of the Xuan Huang Realm still felt conflicted, the momentum was unstoppable, and the logic of the Celestial Venerable had to be obeyed.</p><p></p><p>Whether they liked it or not, they could only choose to silently accept it.</p>

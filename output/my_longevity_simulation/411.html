            <p>The voice of commentator Bing Yin's inquiry came into Li Fan's ears, and he nodded slightly. The 69 novel 28shuxi.com.</p><p></p><p>"In the beautiful era, it lives up to its name."</p><p></p><p>This statement was half an obligatory response to avoid revealing any flaws.</p><p></p><p>And half was sincere.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if we only consider "living", the cultivators under the rule of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Association today have it much easier compared to most periods in history.</p><p></p><p>Even in terms of the ease of acquiring a suitable cultivation technique, it is not much more difficult than it was for independent cultivators in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that once you join the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, you are like a beast of burden for life.</p><p></p><p>At least, as long as the domesticated beast of burden does not act foolishly, living a bit longer would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>In other periods in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm, short-lived cultivators did not even have the qualification to be domesticated beasts of burden.</p><p></p><p>As to whether life is precious or if so-called freedom is of higher value.</p><p></p><p>It is another eternal and serious topic altogether.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention to dwell on this.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about was the moment when the one hundred pieces of consciousness fragments that had been washed by the "Era" were about to dissipate in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But instead, they were absorbed by the Dao Stone condensed by his cultivation technique, the "Divine Transformation One".</p><p></p><p>The things that had experienced in the "Era," but rapidly became obscure in detail after the experience ended, were slowly becoming clear again.</p><p></p><p>Within the blue Dao Stone, faintly visible were independent scenes slowly taking shape.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, they seemed somewhat similar to the "Era."</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"After the experience in the 'Era' ended, the figure I vaguely saw should not have been an illusion."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if a method was implanted in the minds of all observing cultivators to brainwash them."</p><p></p><p>"However, I have the Dao Stone myself, not only immune to this brainwashing this time, but also..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan continued to visit the Divine Treasures Museum under Bing Yin's guidance, he divided his mind and began examining the changes in his own Dao Stone.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because all Dao Stones in the world originated from the same "Dao Stone Mother" initially.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Stone crystal in Li Fan's sea of consciousness took the initiative to absorb all the scattered consciousness.</p><p></p><p>And based on the "Era" imprints contained in the consciousness memories, it was trying to reverse and reconstruct the worlds deduced from Li Fan's memory.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, perhaps due to the insufficient quality of Li Fan's Dao Stone, and its limited calculating power.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan wanted to carefully browse through these worlds, he realized that currently, these worlds were simply empty shells.</p><p></p><p>The scenes were not continuous but developed in chunks, jumping from one to the next.</p><p></p><p>The scope was limited to a corner in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that lay distorted and fragmented mirror-like appearances.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Li Fan discovered that these worlds were gradually expanding in time and space at a slow pace.</p><p></p><p>Due to the limited deduction ability, the progress was almost imperceptible.</p><p></p><p>If the Dao Stone was only capable of this, Li Fan feared that even after reincarnating a hundred times, there may not be substantial progress.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had not forgotten that there was a fixed Dao Stone in Yin Yin's tomb.</p><p></p><p>Every reincarnation, he could absorb it.</p><p></p><p>His own Dao Stone crystal in his mind would also be strengthened by this.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, when the quality of my Dao Stone is sufficient, I can reconstruct the 'Era' by myself?"</p><p></p><p>"And what use would this have?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan thought of something, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Bing Yin, I suddenly thought of a question. You just mentioned that there were a million blank spiritual souls poured into the 'Era' for testing."</p><p></p><p>"So, are there actually real spiritual souls present in the current running 'Era'?"</p><p></p><p>He asked the commentator.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, naturally, there are."</p><p></p><p>Regarding this matter, Bing Yin seemed unwilling to divulge more, simply responding briefly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and then suddenly asked, "Regarding the millions of spiritual souls continuously undergoing the 'Era' experience, have any of them ever been able to realize that the world they were in was illusory, and not truly existent?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, no matter how 'realistic' it is, it will eventually differ from the real world, right?"</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin suddenly glanced at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"About thirty-nine years ago, the 'Era' stopped running for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>"The entire Museum of Divine Treasures was closed during that time, and no one was allowed in or out."</p><p></p><p>No one understood why at that time, but later there were rumors that the million spiritual souls in the 'Era' inexplicably disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Even after searching the entire Museum of Divine Treasures, they were never found.</p><p></p><p>This matter eventually faded away.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it truly escaped or disappeared due to a malfunction..."</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin concluded there and said no more.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>If something was possible, as long as the sample size was large enough, it could be considered inevitable.</p><p></p><p>A million spiritual souls, going through endless cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>There would always be at least one lucky person who would discover the truth of the world they were in.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not find it surprising.</p><p></p><p>He only confirmed one thing from Bing Yin.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the true purpose of the 'Era' was not for brainwashing.</p><p></p><p>But to select and cultivate true geniuses.</p><p></p><p>A person's ultimate achievement cannot be solely judged by talent.</p><p></p><p>Factors such as luck, temperament, and willpower among others all have an impact.</p><p></p><p>Often, some so-called geniuses may perish before they mature.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, some inconspicuous individuals may go much further.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, cultivating cultivators involves a significant cost.</p><p></p><p>And the risks of accidental death and upfront investment are always present.</p><p></p><p>However, in the 'Era,' there was no need to worry about this anymore.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the selection through the 'Era' might even be more effective.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Dark Ages, Waste Ages, and other extreme dark periods in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm were extremely dangerous with very high mortality rates.</p><p></p><p>All of this was enough to attest to his extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that during the long years of the 'Era' operation, such beings should not be few in number.</p><p></p><p>By selecting them and endowing them with physical bodies again, applying brainwashing and absolute loyalty prohibitions spells.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating them to become absolute hounds loyal to the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and enforcers.</p><p></p><p>The strength of these cultivators was enough to instill fear in people.</p><p></p><p>During the construction of the Headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan would often see some black-robed cultivators, unsure which organization of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance they belonged to.</p><p></p><p>They often had expressionless faces.</p><p></p><p>But the dangerous aura unintentionally emitted from them and the unable-to-hide bloodthirstiness always made Li Fan's heart slightly cold.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that these individuals were likely cultivated through the 'Era.'</p><p></p><p>"This method is quite ingenious."</p><p></p><p>"And for me, perhaps when the quality of my Dao Stone is sufficient, with the historical experience, I can hone myself."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, heroes create the times.</p><p></p><p>But the times also create heroes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not consider himself particularly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>He was just an ordinary person struggling to survive in the perilous Xuanhuang Realm solely relying on his unique ability, the "Still True."</p><p></p><p>Based on his experiences as a Grand Tutor in Daxuan for several lifetimes and the experiences he had summarized.</p><p></p><p>He might still be able to deal with Yuanying and below cultivators comfortably.</p><p></p><p>However, when facing the ancient monsters who had survived from the calamities of ancient times to the present.</p><p></p><p>It might be a bit awkward and he might seem immature.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, in the face of these real powerhouses, he might not even have the chance to use the "Still True."</p><p></p><p>Apart from cultivation level, mental fortitude, experience were also crucial when contending with these true powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Through continuously experiencing historical fragments deduced from his mind that resembled the 'Era,' Li Fan thought that he might be able to make up for this deficiency.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under Bing Yin's guidance, Li Fan indulged in viewing the various cherished items in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the "Beautiful Era" area.</p><p></p><p>There were multiple other areas within the Divine Treasures Museum.</p><p></p><p>"The Arrogance of Heroes," mainly collected items related to cultivators who left a mark in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Mountains of Corpses and Seas of Blood": Initially just an ordinary iron blade. After the great change arrived, its master wielded this weapon and slaughtered countless cultivators. The blade was dyed dark-red with fresh blood, and the murderous aura, even after thousands of years, remained condensed. After endless slaughter, its master managed to survive. But ironically, this ferocious weapon was found inside the belly of an underground beast. Its owner had only skeletal hands left, clinging onto the "Mountains of Corpses and Seas of Blood" with unwillingness to die.</p><p></p><p>"The Banner of Ten Thousand Heads": A stinking magical tool crafted using over ten thousand skulls. These skulls all came from the same sect: the Soul-Sealing Sect. And the maker of the Banner of Ten Thousand Heads also hailed from the Soul-Sealing Sect. When the disaster struck, he massacred all his sect members, refining them into the magical tool. It was extremely vicious. However, characters like these ultimately did not survive the Dark Ages. The magical tool became someone else's spoils of war. Passing down for thousands of years, it eventually ended up with the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Frankly speaking, I have been reading books and updating using Yeguo App recently, changing sources and reading aloud with many voices, available on both Android and Apple."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Changes of the Vast Sea and the Sands of Time" area: Displayed various geographical changes that had occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm over thousands of years, astonishing Li Fan. The transformation of mountains and seas was truly extraordinary. The fall of the celestial rivers to the earth, mountains splitting into deep valleys. Even two provinces merging together, all happened overnight. It made Li Fan sigh about the numerous unusual sights he had rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Fight of Ten Thousand Laws" area: Showcased various cultivation techniques that had appeared in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm. Of course, only brief introductions were provided, without the concrete content of the techniques. Nonetheless, Li Fan was still fascinated and couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was immersed and couldn't extricate himself. He forgot the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>When these items, spanning thousands of astronomical numbers of years, appeared in front of Li Fan, the image of the Xuanhuang Realm gradually became vivid in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was no longer just a hollow concept, but was imbued with historical depth.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, he finally arrived at the central area of the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>The most striking thing was that a large space in the center was empty.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a human skull, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin pointed to the skull and said, "This is the skull of the first cultivator rumored to be infected with the Immortal Mortal Miasma. It is unknown what its true value is, but the curator designated it to be placed..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin looked somewhat surprised as he looked at Li Fan by his side.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly closed his eyes as if he was in great pain, trembling violently all over.</p><p></p><p>Even sweat drops kept rolling down uncontrollably from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's condition becoming increasingly severe, Bing Yin couldn't help but feel worried.</p><p></p><p>With a forced smile, Li Fan nodded slightly, shaking his head to indicate that he was fine.</p><p></p><p>But he still did not dare to open his already reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Discovery of absorbable item: 'Eternal Remnant.'"</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to absorb?"</p><p></p><p>"Discovery of absorbable item: 'Eternal Remnant.'"</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to absorb?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to absorb?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to absorb?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The prompt sound of the "Still True" seemed to run wild, continually echoing in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And the voice grew louder and louder, almost taking over all of his mental energy.</p><p></p><p>He felt an indescribable hunger, destroying his rationality.</p><p></p><p>This hunger had reappeared when he first saw the Eternal Remnant of the Sun True Person.</p>

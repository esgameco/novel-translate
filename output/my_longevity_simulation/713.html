        <h1>Chapter 713</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After all, the Transcendent of Eternal Life does not reveal himself, and the practitioners who achieve harmony with the Dao are the top layer of power in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, despite Li Fan experiencing countless secrets of the Wanxian Alliance through his reincarnations, he still does not know if the Wanxian Alliance has any items that can match the "True Fruit of Temptation".</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in order to solve Jiang Yushan's worries, he had to find the Council of Five Elders!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had already figured out the bargaining chip for trading with the Council of Five Elders this time.</p><p></p><p>As for how to contact the Council of Five Elders...</p><p></p><p>During this time, disciples of the Medicine King Sect were scattered across the Wanxian Alliance collecting information.</p><p></p><p>As per Li Fan's request and based on the previous knowledge of the spy contact methods of the Council of Five Elders, they were able to identify a group of suspicious individuals.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully reviewed the list of these practitioners one by one and, combined with what he had seen and heard in previous lives, ultimately identified the spy's identity.</p><p></p><p>In Tianliang Prefecture was Wang Qiupo.</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Qiupo was only at the Golden Dan realm, he was already eight hundred years old.</p><p></p><p>With a lifespan far exceeding that of ordinary Golden Dan practitioners, he was now white-haired and aged, yet still full of vigor and not showing any signs of aging.</p><p></p><p>Since he had lived for too long, everyone from his time period who was still alive had already ascended to godhood or achieved harmony with the Dao. They held important positions throughout the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, judge the Buddha by his disciples. Even though Wang Qiupo didn't have any outstanding abilities, his network was extensive.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even the lord of Tianliang City was very polite to Wang Qiupo.</p><p></p><p>This person, whom no one had expected, turned out to be a spy for the Council of Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>This nail had been buried too deep and for too long.</p><p></p><p>So deep that in the previous life when Wang Qiupo fell, the Council of Five Elders took the initiative to announce his identity and mock him.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of its own reputation, the Wanxian Alliance actually directly ordered the matter to be blocked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had also heard rumors about a deeply hidden spy that had caused great embarrassment to the Wanxian Alliance but did not know the specific name.</p><p></p><p>It was only in this life, combined with the abnormal behavior of Wang Qiupo gathered from the disciples of the Medicine King Sect, that his identity was deduced when compared with the knowledge from the past life.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Wang Qiupo's end is not far off," Xu Bai thought and then gracefully left Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Entering into the white mist, not long after, he encountered a ship named Pu Xian Zhen.</p><p></p><p>The other party did not notice Xu Bai and flew straight into the depths of the white mist.</p><p></p><p>"The passersby are getting more and more, I wonder how long this place can remain hidden."</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, Xu Bai emerged from the white mist and headed straight to Tianliang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Tianliang Prefecture was located northwest of Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It was famous for being in a constant autumnal season throughout the year. It was said that the lingering killing intent from an ancient great battle remained for countless years, causing everything to wither and preventing normal growth, thus creating this unique phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo did not live in Tianliang City but resided in a hut under the Liangshan Mountains outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Although his residence was remote, those who coveted his network and those who came to visit him with flattery were still constantly coming and going.</p><p></p><p>However, most of them were sent away disappointed.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Bai arrived, there was already a long line in front of Wang Qiupo's door.</p><p></p><p>More than ten practitioners were waiting there.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's arrival immediately attracted their attention, and some practitioners even offered to switch places in line with him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai politely declined and smiled before turning them down.</p><p></p><p>This gesture of his immediately earned the goodwill of the other practitioners, who then proceeded to inform Xu Bai about the situation there.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Wang Lao's mood has been quite bad recently. He has already turned down the visits of a hundred senior practitioners in a row."</p><p></p><p>"Wang Lao has a quirky temperament, and one can never guess what he's thinking. But everyone here is not easily discouraged, as there have been precedents when his mood suddenly improved when one's turn came to visit him."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. There was a young Foundation Establishment practitioner who was originally unknown. After receiving a recommendation from Wang Lao, he rose rapidly and secured a position within the Wanxian Alliance's system."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The crowd continued to discuss.</p><p></p><p>And amid Wang Qiupo's continuous rejections and angry shouts, the line of people waiting gradually grew shorter.</p><p></p><p>The practitioners who were turned away had some downtrodden, some angry, but none dared to speak ill.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, without Wang Qiupo having to lift a finger, the other practitioners waiting at the door would step forward to please him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai remained calm and waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Bai's cultivation level was higher than Wang Qiupo's, he still called out respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The other practitioners present were not surprised either.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai paid no heed and instead bowed slightly, smiling as he said, "I have come to accompany the senior..."</p><p></p><p>"To see him to his end!"</p><p></p><p>The words resounded like a bell, echoing beneath the Liangshan Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The practitioners present were all stunned, staring blankly at Xu Bai, disbelief evident in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly unable to believe that such a good-looking person would utter such disrespectful words.</p><p></p><p>There were even many practitioners who looked distressed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, this might thoroughly anger Wang Lao. He might not meet anyone for several months now!"</p><p></p><p>But the unfolding of events went far beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The hut fell into a silence like death.</p><p></p><p>Then the sound of Wang Qiupo's hearty laughter rang out. The door burst open as Wang Qiupo abruptly stopped laughing, saying, "Interesting, come in, kid. I want to see what gives you such audacity!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai remained composed and walked into the house slowly.</p><p></p><p>The door closed again, completely isolating the events inside from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"You do have a good looking appearance. Kid, youâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>Before Wang Qiupo could finish his sentence, Xu Bai interrupted, "Are you aware that your time is short?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo narrowed his eyes, "You..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to die away from home or return to your roots?" Xu Bai disregarded the other's reaction and asked again.</p><p></p><p>"!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo suddenly stood up from the wooden reclining chair, his movements swift without any signs of aging.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what do you mean?" He firmly grasped a wooden cane with his right hand, pressing it against the ground, his eyes gleaming dangerously.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your home? At the Carefree Land, True Realm, or Human Dao Territory?" Xu Bai remained fearless, looking directly at the other, speaking slowly and deliberately.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a violent spirit aura gathered around him, and the wooden cane in Wang Qiupo's hand emitted a blue light.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if he was prepared to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a single sentence from Xu Bai made him instantly change his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to go home?"</p><p></p><p>"We at the Futing Club can help you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai showed a sincere smile.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 588</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Tea named "Warm Spring Sun", offered at eight hundred contributions per cup.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this tea tree needs to be cultivated in a paradise with no rain all year round, planted facing the sun.</p><p></p><p>It sprouts once every three years, with a scarce yield.</p><p></p><p>After drinking it, a warm flow will emerge within the body, making one feel as if bathing in sunlight, with effects lasting for several days.</p><p></p><p>However, even with this widely popular good tea, it still couldn't drive away the chill in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Fan stepped into the cycle of reincarnation in the Xuanhuang realm, this was the third time his true self had faced a real powerhouse directly.</p><p></p><p>The first time was when his avatar was exposed by the Tianyi Divine Physician, who followed the connection and directly intruded into his Tianxuan Mirror private space.</p><p></p><p>The second time was when he was comprehending the "Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword" in Tianti State, and the old fisherman was attracted by the ominous aura contained in it and suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>And this contact this time, compared to the previous two times, was more astonishing and unexpected.</p><p></p><p>And more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>At least the old fisherman was crazy and unclear in his mind and had no ill intent towards Li Fan. On the contrary, he even gave him a chance.</p><p></p><p>In that incident with the Tianyi Divine Physician, Li Fan was coveting the task reward of a hundred thousand contributions and actively provoked the other party. Although he did not yet understand the principle of restraining his mind in front of powerhouses, which led the other party to notice something unusual, at least Li Fan's true self-awareness was clear, and with his true protection, he was actually safe by a narrow margin.</p><p></p><p>But this time...</p><p></p><p>The sudden arrival of the Decaying Wood Taoist was extremely unexpected and unpreventable.</p><p></p><p>His methods were also frightening, and looking back now, Li Fan still felt genuinely shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Different from the mind-reading ability of the Tianyi Divine Physician, the Decaying Wood Taoist, or rather 'Ruo Mu,' can directly distort and change a cultivator's thoughts and cognition."</p><p></p><p>"However, the cultivator himself will not feel abnormal..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Decaying Wood Taoist previously said that the cultivators whose golden cores were taken were all 'voluntary.'"</p><p></p><p>Recalling his thoughts and reactions at that time, Li Fan felt a chill in his heart once again.</p><p></p><p>He drank another cup of "Warm Spring Sun" to calm his nerves.</p><p></p><p>"Injuring others of the same kind is a natural law."</p><p></p><p>"But following him and seeing the scene called 'Brewing Life' did not make me feel danger or sorrow, but rather I felt it was entirely reasonable."</p><p></p><p>"I even wished to sacrifice myself in exchange..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, and in his mind, the scenes before encountering 'Ruo Mu' kept replaying.</p><p></p><p>By this time, the influence of 'Ruo Mu' had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan viewed all living beings as tools, when he saw the cultivators hanging on the branches like fruits, he still instinctively felt a wave of sympathy.</p><p></p><p>This was the normal response he should have.</p><p></p><p>"In the Decaying Wood Taoist's presence, my ideas were twisted and seemed to be guided to become extreme."</p><p></p><p>It could be said that it was slightly crazy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't deny that deep down, he might indeed have similar thoughts. However, humans are complex psychological entities, and sometimes even contradict themselves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, occasional passing thoughts in the mind should not be considered one's worldview.</p><p></p><p>"This Decaying Wood Taoist is really out of line."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that she harbors extreme hatred towards the cultivator community."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally didn't think that with 'Ruo Mu's' cultivation, selling golden cores was merely to gain contributions.</p><p></p><p>Kidnapping cultivators to enter the 'Brewing Life,' becoming part of the production line was a secondary matter.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the main purpose was to spread her idea that "cultivators can also achieve immortality."</p><p></p><p>Such heresy was certainly unacceptable to the cultivator community. The Ten Immortal Sects should also supervise and restrain accordingly, so the Decaying Wood Taoist couldn't make a big fuss.</p><p></p><p>"Revenge, huh..." Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The heavens bestow life, and 'Ruo Mu' shortens it. Extracting life and extending longevity, consuming it can offer immortality.</p><p></p><p>At that moment when controlled by 'Ruo Mu's' thoughts, many scenes kept appearing in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>There was a towering tree, entirely different from the withered tree today.</p><p></p><p>Standing tall and verdant, full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>There were no cultivators hanging from it.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the tree, there hung several shining, translucent, and golden-purple fruits.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of the fruits, faint patterns of trees, mountains, exotic beasts could be seen.</p><p></p><p>The patterns on the golden-purple fruits were all unique and non-repeating.</p><p></p><p>In those fleeting scenes, Li Fan saw that occasionally, humans visited.</p><p></p><p>Only a very few lucky ones could climb up to the treetop and successfully take the golden-purple fruits.</p><p></p><p>But later on, humans started visiting more frequently.</p><p></p><p>Their strength grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Some even climbed the towering giant tree effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>The number of golden-purple fruits being picked naturally increased.</p><p></p><p>Then, the 'Ruo Mu' that had allowed external forces to take freely changed.</p><p></p><p>Many monsters were bred on the tree to defend against those who wanted to take the fruits.</p><p></p><p>After that, 'Ruo Mu' remained quiet for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But good times never lasted.</p><p></p><p>When humans returned, their strength had changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>They occupied 'Ruo Mu' and made it their own.</p><p></p><p>They stationed guards and periodically came to pick a certain number of fruits.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The clothing style of the humans in the scene was unique and easily identifiable.</p><p></p><p>It was very similar to what Li Fan had seen on the remains of Xuantian Sect's Great Law King in Zhao Shijie's dreamland before.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Sect had ruled this place for a long time.</p><p></p><p>When the scene changed again, the cultivators from the Ten Immortal Sects appeared on 'Ruo Mu.'</p><p></p><p>"The Fruit of Longevity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze shifted from the dry wood on the table, his mind in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>During the period of the Ten Immortal Sects' occupation of 'Ruo Mu,' the yield of the golden-purple fruits at the treetop of 'Ruo Mu' gradually decreased for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the cultivators who came to pick the fruits were from different sects each time.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed...</p><p></p><p>One day, dozens of powerful cultivators brazenly stormed in.</p><p></p><p>After effortlessly killing the guarding cultivators, they did not directly plunder the golden-purple fruits.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were discussing something as they looked at 'Ruo Mu' in front of them.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the discussion was heated.</p><p></p><p>But eventually, they reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>The following scene made Li Fan's eyes widen suddenly.</p><p></p><p>They laid out a massive array, trapping 'Ruo Mu' within it.</p><p></p><p>Black chains, like long needles, pierced the tree in various places.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1200</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From a certain perspective, Chen Tianhai had to take a large part of the responsibility for the current state of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because it was he who had arbitrarily activated the Huadao Stone Mother and performed over a billion deductions.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Dharma Transmission glimpse that one and only possibility of victory.</p><p></p><p>With the fall of the Ten Immortal Sects and the Six Immortals, Chen Tianhai was an undeniable sinner!</p><p></p><p>With so many deductions of the Huadao Stone Mother, it was naturally impossible to conceal. When Master Xingji Daoren returned and discovered the terrible consequences, which were most likely caused by Chen Tianhai's traitorous actions, he was furious. He wanted to execute Chen Tianhai on the spot to apologize to the world.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful consideration, Xingji Daoren still did not take action.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the deep bond between master and disciple, like father and son, ultimately softened Xingji Daoren's heart.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, if this news were to spread, it would inevitably lead to the Taiyi Sect becoming the target of public criticism and even possibly being expelled from the Xuanhuang Realm. After all, traitors are always more hateful than enemies.</p><p></p><p>But the tragic deaths of old friends and the extreme condemnation in his heart made it impossible for Xingji Daoren to truly pretend that nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>So he could only strip Chen Tianhai of his status as the first disciple, throw him into the Taiyi Sect's prison, and suppress him for eternity. To the outside world, it was announced that Chen Tianhai had defected.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai stayed in the dark prison cell for an unknown length of time.</p><p></p><p>By the time he was released, it was already a time of calamity, and the Taiyi Sect was facing a crisis of life and death.</p><p></p><p>The world was in chaos, and the once-renowned Ten Immortal Sects were struggling to survive.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Taiyi Sect, by using the Huadao Stone to continuously run complex deductions, could suppress the murderous intent brought about by the inability to cultivate together. They had not yet fallen into extreme chaos like the other immortal sects.</p><p></p><p>However, they had also reached their limit.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Huadao Stones within each cultivator's body but even the Huadao Stone Mother, due to the sudden appearance of an "extreme variable," overturned all past deductions and began to rapidly re-deduce, almost exhausting its computing power in order to seek a glimmer of hope for the Taiyi Sect's survival. Master Xingji Daoren, before his lamp oil ran out, released Chen Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>And pointed out a path for him.</p><p></p><p>Abandon the body, but information remains imperishable.</p><p></p><p>"Misfortune and blessing depend on each other. Although you made a grave mistake back then, it also allowed you to calculate the ins and outs of the Dharma Transmission."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Dharma Transmission has been attracted by our final move and temporarily left the Xuanhuang Realm, it has also given us a moment to catch our breath and preserve our strength."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I'm afraid our immortal sect's legacy would have perished!"</p><p></p><p>Before he could fully impart his last words, Xingji Daoren had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>And before the calamity of the Dharma being unable to be cultivated together completely engulfed the Taiyi Sect, Chen Tianhai finally completed the act of merging the entire Taiyi Sect into the Huadao Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, before the master's death, he had already eliminated all opposing forces within the sect for him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Chen Tianhai would not have been able to persist until that moment.</p><p></p><p>When every person in the sect could experience and utilize the nearly infinite computing power of the Huadao Stone Mother, Chen Tianhai knew that the master's decision was correct.</p><p></p><p>And after the divided Huadao Stones were re-integrated into the body and mixed with the thoughts of more than a thousand cultivators of the Taiyi Sect, the Huadao Stone Mother itself underwent some mysterious changes.</p><p></p><p>It gave birth to its own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>A collective consciousness that belonged to the Taiyi Sect.</p><p></p><p>During the thousands of years the Taiyi Sect secluded itself from the world, Chen Tianhai reviewed the past and also re-examined his actions from back then.</p><p></p><p>However, no</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai couldn't find anything wrong with the forbidden magic treasures of the sect, the venerable master, or the other long-lived powerful figures of the sect like Taishang and Tianjian.</p><p></p><p>He could only assume that it was simply his own inner demons at work.</p><p></p><p>"The means of transmitting the teachings are truly mysterious and difficult to guard against."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the venerable master passed away before revealing his background. And the other informed members of the Immortal Sect have long been missing. However, after so many years, I have also deduced a general idea..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's thoughts surged as he listened to Sun Erlang recount the simulated experiences he had gone through.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, senior, the techniques I learned in the simulated world..." Sun Erlang hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"They are naturally real as well." Chen Tianhai said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"But it's best if you don't learn to use them in reality. Otherwise, you might attract the pursuit and killing from the Protector Hall of the Myriad Immortals Alliance." Chen Tianhai added.</p><p></p><p>"The Protector Hall of the Myriad Immortals Alliance..." Sun Erlang said in a low voice, but there was no fear in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since the young gentleman has already gained a lot, please take your leave. Don't keep your master waiting too long." Chen Tianhai gave the order to see the guest off.</p><p></p><p>"Yi Shu will go with you to the small world of Daqi."</p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking, Sun Erlang felt his vision blur.</p><p></p><p>When he came to his senses, he was already outside the blue transparent building.</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu stood aside smiling, seeming to have been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Sun Erlang immediately noticed that Yi Shu was different from before.</p><p></p><p>He was even different from all the other cultivators in Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>No longer the cold, completely identical common aura, but a living, vibrant life of his own.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the young gentleman's blessing, I temporarily have a real body again and can go out and enjoy myself for a while." Yi Shu smiled and explained the current situation of Taiyan Sect to Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Information is indestructible..." After experiencing hundreds of years of tempering in the simulated world, Sun Erlang was obviously much more composed.</p><p></p><p>But he was still shocked by the wild ideas of Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Young gentleman, there's no need to be surprised. If you truly experience it personally like us, you'll know that whether you have an actual body or not makes little difference. A physical body in reality is a genuine burden." Yi Shu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"But occasionally taking a break is not bad either."</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu followed Sun Erlang out of Taixuan Realm, heading straight for the entrance of Congyun Sea and the small world of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Taiyan Sect was no stranger to the location of the small world of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>However, after passing through the Immortal Severing Formation and seeing only a vast and desolate void with no small worlds existing, Yi Shu finally showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was stunned for a moment, and then it seemed that the memories from a hundred years ago finally resurfaced.</p><p></p><p>He said somewhat embarrassedly, "Senior, please wait a moment. My Imperial Dynasty's Daqi is now drifting in the void, floating about. I don't know where it is now either..."</p><p></p><p>"Let me ask."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a golden light suddenly arrived from the darkness, reaching the two of them in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Baihua!" Sun Erlang recognized the person and respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren glanced at Yi Shu but didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>A golden light of glazed tiles enveloped the two, and the surrounding void seemed to distort, emitting a strange glow.</p><p></p><p>When the golden light dissipated, they had already returned to the Imperial Dynasty's Daqi.</p>

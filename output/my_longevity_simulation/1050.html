        <h1>Chapter 1050</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1048: The World Changes in Five Years</p><p></p><p>Jiushan State, the only free trade state within the territory of the Wanxian Alliance, has undergone earth-shattering changes after five years of development.</p><p></p><p>It has transformed from a previously desolate and uninhabited place into a prosperous and flourishing one.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye can see, the vast plains are occupied by the cave dwellings of cultivators, guarding the central Jiushan Trade City.</p><p></p><p>After several expansions, the scale of the trade city has increased nearly tenfold compared to its initial size. However, it still cannot meet the growing trade demands.</p><p></p><p>Every newly arrived cultivator in the city is filled with excitement and curiosity, lost in the dazzling array of goods within the city.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian kneels on the ground, respectfully bowing to a faceless stone statue in the shadows above.</p><p></p><p>He then walks out of the secret room, opens the shop door, and begins his first business after completing the restocking.</p><p></p><p>Without any active promotion, it doesn't take long for the store to be crowded with cultivators coming to shop.</p><p></p><p>Product descriptions and prices are all clearly marked, so cultivators can complete their purchases on their own without the need for the shopkeeper's personal assistance.</p><p></p><p>There is no bargaining, because in Jiushan State, goods are often sold out shortly after being put on the shelves.</p><p></p><p>This is certainly due to the rare and special products from various states that can be sold in Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>But the most fundamental reason is...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian maintains a full smile on his face, but sighs in his heart: "No wonder everyone wants to come to Jiushan State now. It is said that even a pig can make a fortune just by lying down here, and it truly does not deceive me."</p><p></p><p>"Three years ago, the trading function of the Tianxuan Mirror was suddenly shut down, and cultivators could no longer trade freely. However, the demand for trade could not disappear. Therefore, in a short period of time, five major trading cities appeared across the world, barely taking over the trading function of the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Jiushan State is the largest in scale and has the most variety of goods among them."</p><p></p><p>"Not only do cultivators from various states of the Wanxian Alliance come here to trade, but also cultivators from the Five Elders Association come here to sell specialties and purchase goods."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian looks at the endless stream of people in the store, his heart filled with gratitude: "It's all thanks to the help of the superior, otherwise how could a small Yuanyuan cultivator like me from Congyun Sea purchase a property here."</p><p></p><p>Although half of the store's profits have to be handed over, the speed of earning contribution points is still much faster than in his hometown.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I accumulate for ten years, not only can I pay off all my debts, but I can also purchase Huashen cultivation techniques and [The Change of Heaven and Earth Will Be Born] at a discounted price in the alliance!"</p><p></p><p>"If I can become a Huashen, my status will be greatly different in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"Even in the worst case, I can return to Congyun Sea and become a guest minister, as there are only two Huashen cultivators guarding the entire Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian envisions a bright future in his mind, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the successful sale of an item on display in the store suddenly awakens Zhao Xian.</p><p></p><p>It is a seemingly ordinary white jade statue. A simple decorative piece without any special functions attached. If there is anything special about this white jade statue, it should be the appearance of the carved woman.</p><p></p><p>Peerless heavenly beauty, lifelike.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the outrageous price of 200,000 contribution points, it has been in the store for a long time without being sold.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The statue had been listed for more than two whole years without being sold.</p><p></p><p>Yet today, someone actually took the initiative to buy it. It should be known that this statue is related to the task assigned by the superior!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian suppressed his excitement and hurriedly walked up, "Fellow Daoist, please wait!"</p><p></p><p>However, the person didn't pay any attention to Zhao Xian and left straight away without looking back.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian didn't chase after him either.</p><p></p><p>He just showed a meaningful smile and quietly came to the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>He knelt down in front of the faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Superior, someone bought the white jade statue."</p><p></p><p>Even though it wasn't the first time reporting to the superior, Zhao Xian's heart was still very nervous at this moment. He held his breath and concentrated, not daring to have the slightest distraction.</p><p></p><p>After Zhao Xian finished praying, he waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a cold voice sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>After just one sentence, there was no more sound.</p><p></p><p>But Zhao Xian could keenly sense the sacred aura enveloping him descending and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>And his cultivation level suddenly increased a lot without any sign.</p><p></p><p>The joy was beyond words. Zhao Xian hurriedly kowtowed a few more times.</p><p></p><p>"With the superior's bestowed grace, even with my aptitude, I'm afraid I can ascend within a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"Those so-called geniuses who are usually arrogant are far inferior to me."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian was extremely complacent in his heart and paid more attention to the affairs within the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already locked onto the location of the cultivator who purchased the white jade statue.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be him. He's not dead yet."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's disguise naturally couldn't deceive Li Fan's eyes. After comparing with the list in his mind, Li Fan quickly determined the other party's identity.</p><p></p><p>Jia Yiyuan, who was once a receptionist at the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>During the time when the anomaly occurred at the alliance headquarters, he happened to be on duty.</p><p></p><p>After the incident, Jia Yiyuan's family was wiped out from the world. A total of 342 cultivators at the Golden Core stage and above, none survived.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he appeared in Jiushan Prefecture today.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Li Fan knew the reason why he would buy this white jade statue.</p><p></p><p>This white jade statue was personally made by Li Fan and indeed had nothing special about it.</p><p></p><p>But the person carved on the statue was not ordinary. It was a very important figure that Li Fan had secretly investigated over the years.</p><p></p><p>After the anomaly at the alliance headquarters that day, the Myriad Immortals Alliance launched a bloody purge.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were liquidated, and even many innocent cultivators were implicated.</p><p></p><p>However, where there is oppression, there is resistance.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators in the alliance did not just watch this massacre, but extended a helping hand to those innocent people.</p><p></p><p>They had powerful divine powers and actually saved a large number of cultivators' lives under the high-pressure pursuit of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>The woman carved on this white jade statue was one of these "saviors".</p><p></p><p>She seemed to appear out of nowhere, and the Myriad Immortals Alliance knew nothing about her life.</p><p></p><p>But she knew the Myriad Immortals Alliance very well. She could know some top-secret orders in advance before they were issued.</p><p></p><p>She rescued people before the blade of slaughter was wielded.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance was exasperated and offered a bounty to capture her. But there was never any result.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even figure out what she looked like.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Li Fan knew what she looked like was because he searched the soul of a cultivator who was rescued by her.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that person didn't know much about his savior either.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, Li Fan only saw a peerless beautiful face.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 789</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the departing figure of Dongfang Yao after avoiding the Formless Killing Technique, and thought to himself. </p><p></p><p>"This person Dongfang..."</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>After slowly withdrawing his gaze, Li Fan quietly came to a rather inexpensive stone forest area. </p><p>This place was located in Zhonghuaizhou, with scarce resources. And it had already been explored, with no small worlds or celestial realms entrances. So now very few cultivators came here.</p><p>It was perfect for Li Fan.</p><p>Just like Dongfang Yao, in the time to come, he too would set up contingencies in various places throughout the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Arriving three thousand zhang underground, after opening up an empty space,</p><p>Li Fan took out a pile of broken puppet components.</p><p>They were very similar to those guardian puppets from the Heavenly Sun Cave Dwelling. Made of shattered porcelain, with black and red patterns on the exterior.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, those red threads on each puppet component seemed to be part of the strokes of certain characters.</p><p>This was the method Li Fan conceived to disassemble the Chaotic Words Talisman!</p><p></p><p>Setting up a formation array, he placed the puppet core in the center.</p><p>Then randomly arranged the puppet components within the array.</p><p></p><p>"When a specific condition is triggered, the array will activate the puppet core to instantly reassemble."</p><p>"The Chaotic Words Talisman is complete."  </p><p>"Afterwards, the puppet self-destructs, serving as the energy for manifesting divine abilities."</p><p>Li Fan thought this in his mind as he finished the scattered placement of the puppets.</p><p>The silvery rays in the formation pierced through the puppet components as nodes, integrating the entire array.</p><p>Li Fan lightly tapped it, and the formation fell into quiescence, without leaking the slightest aura.</p><p></p><p>"The setup here is now complete."</p><p>"Although a bit crude, the cruder it is, the less likely it will be discovered."</p><p>Li Fan nodded with some satisfaction, then directly left stealthily without even setting up a concealing array.</p><p>After all, he had forged no less than a thousand of these chaotic word puppets.</p><p>Even if some were occasionally discovered, it was no great loss and would not affect the overall plan.</p><p></p><p>After drilling out from underground, Li Fan surveyed his surroundings to ensure no one was tracking him.</p><p>He then buried more chaotic word puppets at two other locations in Zhonghuaizhou.</p><p>With the setup complete, he headed towards the neighboring Shouyizhou.</p><p>He planned to bury three or four puppets in every prefecture of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"When the chaotic words are unleashed together, even a Longevity Celestial Emperor would have their vision attracted and obscured."</p><p>However, after methodically completing the setup in the thirty-fifth prefecture, he suddenly paused his movements.</p><p></p><p>"Is it finally time to ascend to the Immortal Realm?"</p><p>Li Fan looked up into the distance.</p><p>The footsteps of the Holy Embryo Xu Bai wandering the Xuanhuang Realm had also reached their destination at this moment.</p><p>The heavenly transformation he was about to undergo to enter his inner celestial realm was the "Celestial Spirit Birth Blossom".</p><p></p><p>"I had thought the Celestial Spirit Blossom, once tainted by demonic qi and its beauty lost forever, would never again appear in this world."</p><p>"It seems the self-restorative ability of this expanse of the Xuanhuang heavens and earth is truly remarkable," Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>As the Holy Embryo Xu Bai absorbed this transformation of heaven and earth, within his celestial realm, it was like a spring breeze blowing through.</p><p>Clusters of lush blossoms bloomed one after another, breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>Even Li Fan, millions of miles away, seemed to catch a whiff of the floral fragrance from Xu Bai's celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the final piece of the puzzle had been completed.</p><p>The entire celestial realm was finally elevated to the level of a small world.</p><p>An extraordinary energy began circulating within the celestial realm world.</p><p>From the celestial canopy, to all creatures, to the deep earth.</p><p>Then repeating the cycle endlessly.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>From the depths of the earth, a rumbling sound was faintly transmitted.</p><p>Accompanied by the sounds of rain, wind, insects, and birds in the Heavenly Cave World, they collectively formed a grand and vibrant symphony.</p><p>Li Fan seemed to see the Heavenly Cave World continuously expanding and sublimating in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Xu Bai stood in the void of the Tianliang State.</p><p>Although no other cultivators had discovered his existence,</p><p>the subtle changes in the Tianliang State caused by him were noticed by some cultivators.</p><p>For example, Sun Qi, who was reporting his progress in cultivating the "Reverse the Heavens and Earth Record" to Sun Liancheng, suddenly stopped.</p><p>He raised his head and looked up at the sky outside.</p><p>Sun Qi's brow furrowed, and after a long time, he shook his head slightly.</p><p>"Perhaps it was just my illusion."</p><p>"Just now, I seemed to feel that the heavens and earth were reviving."</p><p>"But it was only for a moment."</p><p>"That feeling has already disappeared now."</p><p>Sun Qi spoke slowly, word by word. From the lingering uncertainty in his eyes, it was clear that it was not just a simple illusion.</p><p>"The revival of the heavens and earth..." Sun Liancheng narrowed his eyes, lost in thought.</p><p>Through the Formless Killing Intent, Li Fan sensed the scene transmitted from Sun Qi's side and became deeply pensive.</p><p>Only he knew that Sun Qi's intuition was correct.</p><p>The revival changes in the Tianliang State were extracted by the Holy Fetus Xu Bai and infused into his own Heavenly Cave World.</p><p>Without this change force, it would take the Tianliang State a long time to accumulate the power to return to its original prosperous state.</p><p>The revival force of the Tianliang State was slightly different from that of the Cong Yun Sea.</p><p>The Cong Yun Sea was a creative change from life to death, from destruction to rebirth.</p><p>While the Tianliang State was a normal life force transformation from desolation to prosperity.</p><p>With this change, the Heavenly Cave within the Holy Fetus Xu Bai had also completely evolved into a small world.</p><p>Li Fan, as part of the same body, could now fully appreciate the scenery of this new small world.</p><p>His divine sense quickly swept across the vast and vibrant land below.</p><p>A sense of familiarity suddenly surged in his heart.</p><p>"This geographical distribution..."</p><p>"It seems I've seen it somewhere before."</p><p>To confirm his thoughts, he quickly located several characteristic mountain ranges and water systems.</p><p>"Indeed, exactly the same."</p><p>Li Fan was greatly shocked.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Through the writings of Xi Men Yu, Li Fan understood the differences in the geography between the ancient and the current Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>By removing the White Mist Barrier and reassembling the disrupted state domains, the original appearance of the ancient Xuanhuang Realm was restored!</p><p>This was what the Holy Fetus Xu Bai had accomplished during this period!</p><p>"Ordinary Transcendent Immortal cultivators rely on the changes of a single state or a single type."</p><p>"But the Holy Fetus Xu Bai used..."</p><p>Li Fan trembled.</p><p>"The Rebirth of the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p>"Using his Heavenly Cave World to rehearse the changes that the Xuanhuang Realm would undergo!"</p><p>"Without the interference of cultivators or the Immortal Emperors, this is the result of the Xuanhuang Realm's self-evolution!"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The more Li Fan thought about it, the more astonished he felt.</p><p>"If he is not the Embodiment of the Heavenly Dao, obtaining the support of the world itself, he would never be able to accomplish this!"</p><p>"Even if I kept trying, it would be impossible!"</p><p>Li Fan understood this clearly.</p><p>Although he had advanced to the Transcendent Immortal realm, the aura of the Holy Fetus Xu Bai had not changed in the slightest.</p><p>He stood quietly in the void, like an ordinary person.</p>

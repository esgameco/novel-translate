        <h1>Chapter 1198</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sun Erlang really didn't expect that after Chen Tianhai of the Taiyan Sect had laid out so many amazing properties of the Huadao Stone, he would end up giving this piece that had been lost from the Yi Xing Tomb for thousands of years to him.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Senior!" However, Sun Erlang wasn't stupid. Fearing that the other party might change his mind, he immediately took the treasure.</p><p></p><p>After admiring it in his hands for a long time with great pleasure, Sun Erlang's expression gradually changed from surprise to embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this Huadao Stone..."</p><p></p><p>"Why does it seem useless?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai said, "To experience the wonders of the Huadao Stone, it needs to be used in conjunction with our sect's secret art [Huadao Shenyi]!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang instantly became alert and said, "Senior, I already have a master. I cannot join your Taiyan Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai smiled disdainfully, "Young man, you think too much. I've already given you the Huadao Stone, so why would I care about this one secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>With a point of his finger in the air, Sun Erlang, enveloped in an illusory blue light, suddenly felt the information of [Huadao Shenyi] appear in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Slowly activating the secret art, the blue gem in Sun Erlang's hand shone like flowing light and was absorbed into his body.</p><p></p><p>And in his sea of consciousness, a brilliant crystal of the same shape was slowly taking form.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Sun Erlang felt the world between heaven and earth brighten up.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through his mind at the same time. His thoughts surged like a storm, and all the memories he had experienced from childhood to adulthood, some of which had even faded, began to resurface.</p><p></p><p>And as for the doubts in his heart, why this Senior Chen of the Taiyan Sect would regard him so differently, Sun Erlang, who originally only had a vague guess about this, now deduced several possibilities in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty's and his master's favor towards him, and his unique physique being beneficial to the Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>As well as the Taiyan Sect being able to achieve some kind of control through the Huadao Stone, which was part of a conspiracy...</p><p></p><p>Many possibilities were listed in turn.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, based on the information obtained from the outside world, the inferences were constantly adjusted.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Huadao Shenyi?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Sun Erlang came back to his senses from the shock and couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look at the Huadao Stone Mother in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Just that small piece of fragment alone possessed such powerful deduction abilities. Then how powerful exactly was this Huadao Stone Mother?</p><p></p><p>"Senior gifting me the Huadao Stone, does it have to do with the [simulation] you asked me about just now?"</p><p></p><p>Staring at the Huadao Stone Mother, Sun Erlang suddenly had an epiphany and asked.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai nodded somewhat inexplicably, "In addition to the future of the Xuanhuang Realm, there are many other fictional worlds in the Huadao Stone Mother."</p><p></p><p>"It's not only to make full use of the stone mother's abilities but also to better calibrate the established reality."</p><p></p><p>"You can think of them as a kind of drill."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang nodded thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>The moment he completely absorbed the Huadao Stone, he couldn't help but imagine the scenes of him going back, reporting this matter to his master, and what would happen afterward.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the past when it was just a simple thought, this time even the various expressions and reactions of the people he would come into contact with in the future all surged in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"And the Huadao Stone Mother, in addition to deducing the Xuanhuang Realm, even has the spare capacity to simulate more."</p><p></p><p>As Sun Erlang pondered, Chen Tianhai continued, "Among these fictional worlds, many are created based on the original materials of the Xuanhuang Realm. So you may encounter many similar..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The existence of right and wrong..."</p><p></p><p>"But don't worry, that place is real enough. It can let you truly experience a complete lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"Young Lang, have you ever heard this saying? To govern the world, the talents from just one county are already enough. Although this principle is prevalent in the mortal world, it also applies to our immortal cultivation realm. Back then, the Xuantian Sect that dominated the world had only twelve cultivators close to the Xuantian King at its core."</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect?" Sun Erlang heard this term for the first time and couldn't help but be a little curious.</p><p></p><p>However, Chen Tianhai had no intention of saying more and continued his inference: "In this world, there is no lack of talent. What is lacking is merely the space and opportunity for them to grow."</p><p></p><p>"And in the world simulated by the Huadao Stone, we have built such a stage. It can allow a figure like Young Lang to quickly grow."</p><p></p><p>After all, he was still young. When Sun Erlang heard Chen Tianhai praise him so highly, he couldn't help but feel a bit proud.</p><p></p><p>But he immediately frowned and asked, "How long will this simulation last? Will it keep Master waiting for long?"</p><p></p><p>"A dream of a thousand years, a thousand years in an instant. Young Lang, are you ready?" Chen Tianhai suddenly shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, blue light rings bloomed on the Huadao Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>Within the light rings, countless different world scenes could be vaguely seen. A figure wrapped in blue light also flew out from Sun Erlang's sea of consciousness and directly entered the light rings of the Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>When he clearly saw Sun Erlang's final destination, a trace of unusual color appeared on Chen Tianhai's face.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Xuanhuang, a world where the Immortal Tribulation did not occur. Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>What Chen Tianhai just said was actually not complete.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, to govern the world, the talents from one county are enough.</p><p></p><p>But they are just barely enough.</p><p></p><p>Although there are many talents in the world, there are always some people who are different from the rest.</p><p></p><p>They may be temporarily buried for some reason, but as soon as they have a chance, they can take advantage of the situation to rise up, and their fate can be turned upside down.</p><p></p><p>The Huadao Stone Mother has simulated and iterated countless worlds. Whenever such people appear, they can drastically influence and change the direction of the world's destiny.</p><p></p><p>"Among countless futures, there are countless branches. The existence or disappearance of certain beings will not have any impact on these possible branches. They are all irrelevant people, ordinary members of the masses."</p><p></p><p>"But for some people, their disappearance will lead to major changes in the future and even directly cause a large number of possibilities to disappear. Such people are [focal variables]."</p><p></p><p>"The Huadao Stone Mother has conducted statistics and analysis on the many focal variables that have appeared in the simulated worlds, and has summarized a set of effective prediction methods. This Sun Erlang fits some of the characteristics of a focal variable."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's thoughts surged, which was also the reason why he was very kind to Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Since Taiyi Sect had already been discovered by others, it was inevitably about to "enter the world" and be involved in future variables.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was necessary to prepare early.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed, as if trying to see clearly everything that happened in the world where Sun Erlang was.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I expected, after three years of lying low, he rose in a single morning. Once his momentum was established, no one could stop him."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, judging from his actions, order and rationality still remain."</p><p></p><p>"Not an [extreme variable]."</p><p></p><p>Giving Sun Erlang a chance to simulate also gave Taiyi Sect a chance to see clearly what kind of person Sun Erlang was.</p>

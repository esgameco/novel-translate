        <h1>Chapter 339</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Stealing the Heavens and Swapping the Sun Technique was obtained by Li Fan from the hands of Sikong Yizhi, a descendant of the Stealing the Heavens and Swapping the Sun Sect. It can steal fate and create clones, living up to its name.</p><p></p><p>The Transforming Appearance at Will secret art comes from Zhou Qingang, a spy within the Five Elders Council and the guardian of Tai'an Island. Paired with the Seven Apertures Exquisite Heart, a rare treasure of heaven and earth, it allows one to change their appearance and transform into another person, even deceiving the White Jade Heart Questioning Platform of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Qi, fate, and appearance.</p><p></p><p>In theory, combining the three would allow one to completely transform into another cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had previously considered this idea.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all extremely profound existences. With Li Fan's current theoretical knowledge, even if he were to meditate for hundreds of years, he might not necessarily be able to create a new technique based on their foundations.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the opportunity to utilize the Derivation Orb for extrapolation, and considering that the Heavenly Profound Soul Locking Formation would soon become widespread, leaving cultivators throughout the world with no privacy to speak of, this ability to possess an alternate identity at any time became particularly important for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, without hesitation, the contents of the two cultivation techniques and one secret art appeared on the blank paper.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only one page, as the text on it continued to increase, the characters became smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much content there was, it could all be accommodated.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan stopped his contemplation, and the white paper was filled with countless densely packed tiny characters.</p><p></p><p>"Is it done?" The little loli still had her hands propping up her chin, glancing at the tabletop with a blank expression, not even raising her head as she asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Li Fan nodded slightly. Before he could say the word "done," he saw the white paper in his hand once again transform into streaks of flowing light, floating towards the desk where the little loli was lying.</p><p></p><p>On the desktop, countless characters instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this, the little loli immediately pouted, somewhat displeased. "You have such high requirements, completely transforming into another person."</p><p></p><p>"You have the foundation techniques for changing qi, fate, and appearance, but what about flesh, divine sense, and primordial spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan wasn't embarrassed and simply stated the facts helplessly, "Collecting the current techniques has already been my best effort. Methods for transforming flesh, divine sense, and primordial spirit are extremely rare and beyond my capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"What, can't it be extrapolated?" Li Fan looked at the little loli and asked.</p><p></p><p>"It can be done, it's just that I was originally able to rest for a bit. How annoying..." The little loli raised her head, glared at Li Fan, and muttered in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred, but he pretended not to have heard and showed no change in his expression, earnestly watching the movements of the Derivation Orb.</p><p></p><p>She patted the table with her chubby hands, and the countless characters on the desktop instantly flowed like water, flying upside down towards the huge sphere overhead.</p><p></p><p>They joined the rapidly changing extrapolation sequence.</p><p></p><p>The frequency at which the characters flashed was several times faster than when Li Fan first saw it.</p><p></p><p>And the little loli lying on the desktop had an extremely sleepy appearance, constantly nodding off.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was deep in thought, not daring to make a sound to disturb her.</p><p></p><p>He quietly raised his head and gazed at the sphere composed of changing characters above.</p><p></p><p>This place was clearly not a real space.</p><p></p><p>It was more like a world purely constructed from consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no doubt that Li Fan's clone had come here with his body and interacted with consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the consciousness of the Derivation Orb, from time to time, Li Fan would feel another gaze sweeping over him in this space.</p><p></p><p>The owner of the gaze made no attempt to conceal their existence, and the warning in their eyes was evident.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan behaved in a very restrained manner.</p><p></p><p>As he remained silent, the little loli became drowsy.</p><p></p><p>This space fell into complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Only the light from the constantly changing characters above shone on Li Fan's face, accentuating his somewhat inscrutable expression.</p><p></p><p>"Derivation Orb..."</p><p></p><p>With just these three words flashing through his mind, Li Fan suppressed all other thoughts and silently calculated the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>He thought of nothing else.</p><p></p><p>When more than two hours had passed since the Derivation Orb began its extrapolation, the huge sphere overhead erupted with a dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the little loli seemed to awaken from her slumber.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing her eyes, she spoke in a listless manner, as if she hadn't fully woken up, "It's done."</p><p></p><p>Countless tiny characters instantly surged onto the desktop, forming a white paper that reappeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly and began to read attentively.</p><p></p><p>"Using profound and unfathomable power, replicate all life fluctuations of the target and make corresponding transformations."</p><p></p><p>"If there is no target, random transformations can also be generated."</p><p></p><p>"When using a living being as the target, the first transformation requires a small portion of the other party's living tissue."</p><p></p><p>"If there is no target, no materials are required."</p><p></p><p>"It can only replicate life traces and cannot replicate cultivation techniques and realms."</p><p></p><p>"It can only target living beings at the Nascent Soul stage and below. After the transformation, regardless of the previous cultivation level, the transformed state can only retain cultivation up to the Nascent Soul stage at most."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly memorized the contents of the technique in his heart, and the text on the white paper gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Derivation Orb, the effects of this Profound True Spirit Transformation Technique are even better than I anticipated. I just don't know how it will actually perform in practical use." The more Li Fan read, the happier he became, and he couldn't help but repeatedly ponder the contents of the technique.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a Nascent Soul level technique, the limitations were only reflected in the selection of transformation targets and the restriction of power after transformation.</p><p></p><p>As for the ability of "transformation" itself, there were not many discounts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued reading and found that in addition to "transformation," after mastering the technique, there was also the ability of "discernment."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a long illness leads to self-healing.</p><p></p><p>Since completely transforming into another person required a fairly comprehensive understanding of the essence of life, naturally, after mastering the technique, one would also understand how to distinguish the authenticity of a living being.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan even more delighted was that the True Spirit Transformation Technique retained the means of creating clones from the Stealing the Heavens and Swapping the Sun Technique.</p><p></p><p>When creating a clone, the profound transformative power of True Spirit Transformation could be incorporated to create a perfect replica of the target.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but immerse himself in this profoundly mysterious divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only at the Nascent Soul level, the "advanced feel" of the technique's effects made Li Fan feel that it was even above the Cloud and Water Illusion Dream Technique.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, seeing that Li Fan still hadn't responded, the little loli said in a muffled voice, "Time is almost up. If there's anything you want to improve, you can tell me."</p><p></p><p>With that, she yawned and looked at Li Fan listlessly.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan come back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>The white paper in his hand had completely disappeared, and the contents of the technique were deeply ingrained in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan solemnly bowed to the Derivation Orb, "I am very satisfied."</p>

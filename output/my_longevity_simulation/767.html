        <h1>Chapter 767</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>But unlike Li Fan, the divine abilities that Wang Wan comprehended should not have been too complicated. novel69shux.com</p><p>At the very least, Wang Wan accepted the data calmly and peacefully. </p><p>The black lines forming his lower body did not show any signs of wavering.</p><p>Not to mention leaving his body.</p><p>"Could it be that I'm the lucky one who hit the jackpot?" A trace of gloom flashed across Li Fan's eyes.</p><p>"This Wang Wan seems to not be the first time he has come here to deduce divine abilities with the help of the Celestial Mirror. Perhaps I can inquire about it from him."</p><p>Having completed the deduction of divine abilities, Li Fan's connection with the black lines linked to the platform below had been severed.</p><p>However, the countdown in front of him was still ongoing, so he had not been expelled from this space yet.</p><p>Thus, Li Fan did not hurry to leave. He observed the two people beside him patiently while waiting.</p><p>Time flowed slowly, and soon less than an hour remained.</p><p>Deng Mingxi, who had not made a choice, appeared anxious.</p><p>She looked somewhat resigned and eventually seemed to have made an unsatisfactory choice.</p><p>At this point, Wang Wan, like Li Fan, had also completed comprehending the divine abilities.</p><p>The connecting lines below his feet broke, and he opened his eyes.</p><p>Sensing Li Fan's gaze, Wang Wan seemed a bit surprised.</p><p>However, they could not communicate here. He just gestured with his eyes before looking back at Deng Mingxi. novel69shux.com</p><p>After observing her for a while, he shook his head slightly.</p><p>The countdown reached zero.</p><p>A radiance of seven colors shone down from above.</p><p>The black and white lines gradually faded, and the surrounding space became vibrant.</p><p>In a daze, the scene blurred momentarily.</p><p>In an instant, Li Fan and the other two found themselves back on the Lianhua Rock Mountain outside Tianquan State without realizing it.</p><p>Deng Mingxi unleashed a burst of qi and fiercely struck a nearby mountain body, as if venting her anger.</p><p>However, this mountain was not like ordinary rock mountains and was extremely hard.</p><p>Deng Mingxi could not even create a crack in it.</p><p>Tears of frustration welled up in her eyes.</p><p>"Little girl, being greedy leads to loss!" Seeing this, Wang Wan sighed.</p><p>Under Li Fan's inquiries, he slowly learned from the other party the reason for the abnormality of this "Limitless Spirit Void Method."</p><p>Apparently, the divine abilities tree initially generated in a cultivator's mind by the Celestial Mirror could not be fully perceived by all cultivators.</p><p>They could only choose by chance.</p><p>Deng Mingxi was dazzled by too many choices, which delayed the time for her comprehension.</p><p>"It's alright, don't be too disheartened. You're still young. novel69shux.com You can try again in another hundred years. When I first came here, I was like you, wanting to choose the most suitable and powerful divine abilities from the divine abilities tree. In the end, I wasted the precious opportunity."</p><p>Seeing that Deng Mingxi was still dejected, Wang Wan continued to console her.</p><p>Deng Mingxi said regretfully, "It's all because my brother secretly told me before we came that the Celestial Mirror would evaluate a cultivator's potential based on how much of the divine abilities tree they perceived."</p><p>"The more you perceive, the greater your potential. During the infusion of divine abilities, the upper limit of the divine abilities' power would also be higher."</p><p>"So I wanted to see a bit more..."</p><p>Deng Mingxi became more and more aggrieved, as if she was about to cry.</p><p>"Your brother may not have meant well by telling you that..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Heart, huh," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p>"What did you say!" Deng Mingxi suddenly froze, staring at Li Fan in that instant.</p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p>"What did you just think in your heart? What did that mean?" Deng Mingxi stared intently at Li Fan, sounding a bit aggressive.</p><p>Li Fan collected his thoughts completely, narrowing his eyes: "Fellow Daoist Deng, I don't understand what you mean."</p><p>"Don't pretend, I can sense the thoughts in other people's hearts. Especially those related to me!" Seeing Li Fan still playing dumb, Deng Mingxi's anger grew.</p><p>"You just now clearly thought that my brother Qingyu didn't have good intentions. What does that mean?"</p><p>"I sensed it very clearly. When Qingyu secretly told me this secret before, he was truly concerned for me." Deng Mingxi said righteously.</p><p>"This little girl really doesn't understand the ways of the world," Li Fan deliberately thought again.</p><p>As expected, Deng Mingxi, who could perceive Li Fan's thoughts, had her face turn even redder.</p><p>"He can actually sense others' thoughts," Li Fan was secretly surprised.</p><p>He reined in his thoughts again, no longer teasing the young lady, and began to explain to her.</p><p>"That Qingyu of yours, judging from your words, seems to be very close to you. Then he must be very familiar with the state of your cultivation. How could he not know whether you have truly mastered the divine sense of the Divine Ability Tree?"</p><p>"If he was truly concerned for you, he would not have casually revealed this to you. He would have just let you calmly choose a suitable divine ability for yourself."</p><p>"But he deliberately, under the guise of caring for you, inadvertently revealed it to you." </p><p>Li Fan sneered, "This is obviously to arouse your greed, so that you would return empty-handed this time!"</p><p>"As for the thoughts you sensed from the other party..."</p><p>"But he is obviously aware of your mind-reading ability. In that case, what you sensed doesn't really mean anything."</p><p>Deng Mingxi was about to refute him.</p><p>But suddenly she froze, because from Li Fan's heart, she suddenly sensed a strong sense of care and tenderness.</p><p>So warm and direct, truly something she had never seen before in her life.</p><p>Deng Mingxi instantly turned beet red.</p><p>"You..." </p><p>She stomped her feet, extremely embarrassed. She didn't dare look at Li Fan anymore and flew away.</p><p>"Hmph," Li Fan chuckled lightly.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, it might be best if you temporarily leave Tianquan State for a while," At this time, Wang Wan, who had witnessed the entire process, couldn't help but remind him.</p><p>"Although it was just an inadvertent slip, and the young lady overheard your thoughts. But after all, you also exposed Deng Qingyu's actions."</p><p>"This person has a narrow mind and always seeks revenge..." Wang Wan transmitted this message with good intentions.</p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands: "Oh? And how does the Deng family compare to the Xuan family?"</p><p>"Xuan..." Wang Wan first paused, then his expression changed drastically, "You are..."</p><p>"I am a mid-level guest elder of the Xuan family," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p>"In that case, I have spoken too much. The younger generation of the Deng family..." Wang Wan was at a loss for words.</p><p>He quickly expressed his apologies to Li Fan.</p><p>"No problem. Fellow Daoist was just kindly reminding me." Li Fan didn't mind, leaving his contact information with Wang Wan before flying away.</p><p>During the flight, Li Fan felt a bit lucky in his heart.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, after so long, I've actually encountered another cultivator who can read minds like the Heavenly Doctor."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1117: Revenge is a Must</p><p></p><p>"Our branch established in the Blood River has not been discovered yet."</p><p></p><p>"If we are lucky enough to escape alive, we can regroup there."</p><p></p><p>"The Blood River's power is special in nature and should effectively block the Myriad Immortal Alliance's tracking," Li Fan, who had already thought of countermeasures after escaping, said to the core members of the alliance such as Liu Ruchen and Baihua Daoist.</p><p></p><p>As for how the specific location of the Spirit Wood Realm was exposed, Li Fan actually already had a vague answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, now was not the time for settling scores.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also did not utter the cold words that would make them rather die than surrender.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Faceless Immortal binding them, even if they wanted to surrender, they probably wouldn't be able to do so.</p><p></p><p>Just as the people of the Spirit Wood Realm were preparing to flee for their lives, the Holy Fetus Li Fan quietly came before the Faceless Immortal's stone statue.</p><p></p><p>The statue was just a vessel.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal's power had long been revived through the growing network of alliance members.</p><p></p><p>"But there is no doubt that, compared to other ordinary members, He should value his own statue a bit more."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I could choose to throw out the statue and let the Myriad Immortal Alliance directly face the Immortal's power. However..."</p><p></p><p>"This method can only be used once. I'm still counting on Him to contend with the Immortals of the Immortal Ruins later."</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of Holy Fetus Li Fan's faint eyes, the Faceless statue actually slowly became transparent.</p><p></p><p>And then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Underworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the statue that slowly materialized out of thin air in front of him, his face expressionless. </p><p></p><p>Where the Immortal's web covered, the Immortal's power could naturally flow freely.</p><p></p><p>His previous bestowing of cultivation and knowledge to alliance members was actually also done through this method.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this was the first time he tried to transfer physical objects.</p><p></p><p>"If I really chose to completely side with the Faceless Immortal and unreservedly dedicate myself to become a true Immortal Envoy, perhaps by borrowing the vast Immortal power, the entire Spirit Wood Realm could be transferred in a single thought." Li Fan thought as he stared at the statue.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Prison did not undergo any changes with the arrival of the Immortal statue.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the statue, Li Fan, who was hiding inside, focused his attention back on the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The alliance members were hurriedly preparing to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was unhurriedly arranging formations.</p><p></p><p>Noticing the figure that appeared behind him, Li Fan's movements slightly paused.</p><p></p><p>"Envoy... do we really have to do this?"</p><p></p><p>The one who came was the spirit of the giant tree in the Spirit Wood Realm, Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>"Once this formation is activated, I'm afraid everything in the Spirit Wood Realm will be reduced to ashes." Lin Ling said with a pale face as she looked at the faintly discernible silver lines on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't paid attention for a while, your formation skills have improved quite a bit. You can actually see the purpose of the formation I'm setting up?" Li Fan's gaze swept over Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling pursed her lips, "I don't have that ability. It's just that being of one heart with the spirit wood, facing a life and death crisis, I can sense it."</p><p></p><p>"We will return here someday, right? Even if we temporarily let the Myriad Immortal Alliance have this place, so what? I believe that under the Envoy's leadership, that day will not be too far."</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the once ignorant tree spirit would actually say such persuasive words.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus's movements in setting up the formation couldn't help but pause slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Fan asked, "The Myriad Immortal Alliance was so fast that they could already lock onto our Spirit Wood Realm's</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The specific location. There must be a traitor among us. Do you have any clues?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's body trembled, and she exclaimed, "It's not me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at her, "If it were you, would you be standing in front of me talking so calmly?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling immediately felt relieved, as if a heavy burden had been lifted, and let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, she had witnessed the rise of the Spirit Wood Realm from nothing and Li Fan's various methods. She truly had no intention of betraying him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Li Fan, those people in the outside Xuan Huang Realm seemed much simpler.</p><p></p><p>Offending the Myriad Immortal Alliance might not necessarily lead to death.</p><p></p><p>But offending Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling wiped the cold sweat from her forehead, thought for a moment, and quickly replied, "Actually, it's not necessarily that a traitor has appeared in our alliance. Although the entrance to the Spirit Wood Realm is hidden, it can't be concealed from everyone in the world."</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, I know there is one person who is very clear about this. And..." </p><p></p><p>Lin Ling carefully observed Li Fan, then said softly, "He seems to have some grudges with you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed, "You mean, the Ancient Tree of Earth Veins?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling nodded.</p><p></p><p>"When I had a good relationship with him before, he saw me frequently entering and exiting the Spirit Wood Realm. Although we later lost contact, the location of our Spirit Wood Realm has never changed. And wherever the earth veins reach, it is within his sight..."</p><p></p><p>"More crucially, I could vaguely sense the gaze from the Ancient Tree of Earth Veins before. But since the Myriad Immortal Alliance attacked us, his prying eyes have never appeared again. It's as if he has a guilty conscience, like a thief. If he wasn't the one who leaked the secret, given our enmity with him, he would probably be gloating over our deaths right now." Lin Ling analyzed with sound reasoning.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>"You did well. Let's leave the Spirit Wood Realm for now." The Holy Fetus Li Fan stopped the progress of setting up the formation.</p><p></p><p>"A lot can change in a short time. It would have been better if you had reminded me earlier."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Lin Ling, Li Fan encouraged her.</p><p></p><p>He sent Lin Ling away to make preparations for escape. Li Fan then gazed into the distance outside the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, just like his ancestors, they are all so vengeful."</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence, so am I."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan approved of Lin Ling's inference.</p><p></p><p>After all, the entrance to the Spirit Wood Realm was extremely secret, known only to a few. After eliminating them one by one, the target could be quickly locked.</p><p></p><p>As for the possibility that Lin Ling was the mole and her reasoning was all fabricated to clear herself of suspicion...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan trusted his own judgment.</p><p></p><p>He also trusted his ability to read people.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Tree of Earth Veins..."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on being one with the earth veins, he dares to be so presumptuous. Hmph."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan had already thought of how to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>"The Wood of Ruo has a great appetite for these descendants left on the earth's surface back then. If I can send him a big gift, it might improve our relationship."</p><p></p><p>However, punishing the Ancient Tree of Earth Veins would have to wait until the next life.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan temporarily recorded this grudge and waited for the people of the Spirit Wood Realm to finish their preparations.</p><p></p><p>He gathered Liu Ruchen and the others again.</p><p></p><p>"After rushing out, follow behind Tian Yang."</p><p></p><p>"Form this formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan solemnly taught the formation to the people of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p>

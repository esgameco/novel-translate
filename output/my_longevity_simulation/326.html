            <p>However, he was completely unaware of his own abnormality and continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Your sword technique's aura seems very familiar to me."</p><p></p><p>"It seems extremely similar to the thing I'm looking for. Just now, I sensed a fluctuation in the aura and thought my lost item was here."</p><p></p><p>"I got my hopes up for nothing!"</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman shook his head, feeling a bit emotional.</p><p></p><p>"Similar... lost item?"</p><p></p><p>From the information he had checked before, Li Fan already knew that the reason this old fisherman wandered indeterminately through various states was because he couldn't find something of his own.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, he sensed the aura of the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword and tracked it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Fan thought of a possibility.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Slaughtering Sword!</p><p></p><p>However, if this answer was true, then this old man's strength...</p><p></p><p>The hilt of the Heaven Slaughtering Sword was on par with, or even surpassed, Qing Feng.</p><p></p><p>And the broken blade of the Heaven Slaughtering Sword was already able to go back and forth with Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>If the Heaven Slaughtering Sword was complete, how strong would it be?</p><p></p><p>And what cultivation level would this old fisherman, who might be the owner of the Heaven Slaughtering Sword, have?</p><p></p><p>There were two choices in front of Li Fan now.</p><p></p><p>One was to truthfully tell the old fisherman what he knew about the Heaven Slaughtering Sword.</p><p></p><p>Although he might receive a reward from a powerful figure like the old fisherman...</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>This old fisherman had been wandering around the Xuanhuang Realm for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Why did he lose his memory in the first place?</p><p></p><p>And why did the Heaven Slaughtering Sword become broken and separated from him?</p><p></p><p>This involved too much and the level was too high.</p><p></p><p>If he was not careful and got involved in the struggle, he would be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Even [Huan Zhen] might not be able to make it in time.</p><p></p><p>The second choice was to pretend not to know.</p><p></p><p>Although he would miss this great opportunity, for Li Fan, he could use his avatar in the next life, or more safely, have other cultivators tell the old fisherman on his behalf that his lost item was the Heaven Slaughtering Sword in the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>To see if there was any danger to his life and what changes it would bring later.</p><p></p><p>If he could really gain some amazing benefits from it, for Li Fan, it would only delay him by two or three lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the two choices, the second one was obviously the safest.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chose to wait.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting to see if this hidden powerhouse, the old fisherman, could perceive the mental activity of the cultivator in front of him like the Heavenly Doctor did before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already thought about the whole story in his mind.</p><p></p><p>If the old fisherman could really perceive what Li Fan was thinking, then the second choice of pretending not to know would be out of the question.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if the old fisherman couldn't...</p><p></p><p>Then making the second choice would naturally be without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the old fisherman's mental state was abnormal, or perhaps it was because he was not good at this and the Seven Apertures Spiritual Heart played a part.</p><p></p><p>In any case, fortunately...</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was lost in thought, he remained silent for one, two, three breaths in front of the sighing old fisherman.</p><p></p><p>However, the old man did not have any special reaction.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan was certain that the other party could not sense his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but become more active in his mind.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth breath, he pretended to think for a while and replied, "The sword technique I comprehended turned out to be somewhat similar to Senior's lost item?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Senior and I are really meant to be."</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Fan asked, "What exactly did Senior lose? I heard that you've been searching for a long time without finding it?"</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman shook his head, "I can't remember, just like my name, I can't remember."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, as long as I find it, I can recall everything..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the old fisherman was about to fall into confusion again, Li Fan handed over his storage ring to interrupt him.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, Senior, why don't you take a look and see if your item is in here."</p><p></p><p>"Since Senior and I are so destined, maybe you can find something useful from here."</p><p></p><p>This was also a necessary action for every cultivator who met the old fisherman.</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman did not refuse and took the ring to examine it.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, although the young man's strength is not much, his wealth is quite good."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the old fisherman praised.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, his only real secret was [Huan Zhen].</p><p></p><p>Even if everything else was known to others, it was no big deal.</p><p></p><p>So he was not afraid of the old fisherman's examination.</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman identified the items one by one.</p><p></p><p>"This is not it, this is not it either."</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat as he watched the old man take out an item from the storage ring and examine it carefully in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." He showed an interested expression.</p><p></p><p>The item that made a powerhouse like the old fisherman find it interesting was the treasure of the Stealing Heaven and Swapping Sun Sect that Li Fan had noticed had some problems and had been left in the corner to gather dust.</p><p></p><p>The Stealing Heaven and Swapping Sun Token.</p><p></p><p>"If I can make use of this waste and exchange it for a cultivation technique from the old fisherman, that would be the best."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly, and he immediately put on a very excited expression and said repeatedly, "Senior, is this the item you lost?"</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman held the token and was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>"I just find this little thing very interesting."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've come across such a rare item."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan and asked seriously, "Young man, are you willing to part with it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with great righteousness, "I'm not as perceptive as Senior. I've had this item for a long time and always thought it was just a token with storage function."</p><p></p><p>"In my hands, it's like a pearl covered in dust. Senior, just take it!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan agree, the old fisherman nodded.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Stealing Heaven and Swapping Sun Token disappeared from his hand, not knowing where it went.</p><p></p><p>"I won't take your item for nothing."</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman looked at Li Fan carefully again, making Li Fan's hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he say, "Hmm, I seem to have something here that will be of great use to you."</p><p></p><p>He brought the fish basket on his back to the front, reached in with his right hand, and grabbed.</p><p></p><p>"It's her!"</p><p></p><p>Then he grabbed a figure from it and threw it in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked closely, and his eyelids twitched.</p><p></p><p>This person was wearing the black and yellow robe of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, clearly a member of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance system.</p><p></p><p>As if tied by invisible ropes, she could only twist her body and struggle like a fish out of water.</p><p></p><p>"Hungry for so long and still so energetic." The old fisherman muttered, then reached out and slapped her from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator immediately fainted.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the transaction is complete, I'm leaving."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, let's meet again if fate allows."</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman put the fish basket back on his back.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan's response, he stepped out and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only a faint singing voice could be heard, but the specific content could not be made out.</p><p></p><p>"Danger averted and an unexpected gain."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the motionless female cultivator of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance beside him, Li Fan looked in the direction where the old fisherman disappeared, his face showing a pensive expression.</p>

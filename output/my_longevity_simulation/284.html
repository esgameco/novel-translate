        <h1>Chapter 284</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, under Li Fan's spiritual consciousness, the internal scene was completely visible.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of flame shot out from his hand, igniting the existing candle.</p><p></p><p>In the flickering candlelight, Li Fan's expression gradually became solemn.</p><p></p><p>In this space that was neither large nor small, a faceless stone statue stood against the wall.</p><p></p><p>In the middle was a long, dark brown wooden table.</p><p></p><p>On the table, faint traces of dark red congealed blood could be seen.</p><p></p><p>At the corner of the table was a wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan opened the wooden box and found tools of unknown use such as hammers, knives, nails, and needles inside.</p><p></p><p>Along the walls, many transparent clay jars were placed.</p><p></p><p>In the clay jars, numerous strange and misshapen organs were soaked in an unknown liquid.</p><p></p><p>In one corner, Li Fan even saw several skeletal specimens of young humans.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was indescribable as he continued to search through this secret room.</p><p></p><p>In another corner of the wall, he found that the traces on the ground were somewhat different from other places.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual consciousness penetrated deep into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Inside, there were shockingly one, two...</p><p></p><p>Twenty-eight corpses buried.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the appearance of the remains, they were all half-human, half-beast existences like the "dog" in the small temple.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, there were no other discoveries in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Without hurrying to take any action, Li Fan pondered on the spot.</p><p></p><p>From the various objects found in this secret room, the persona of Mr. Bai as "the best person in the world" seemed to be challenged.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be completely overturned yet.</p><p></p><p>When Daxuan was still a mortal and governing a place,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had judged countless cases, big and small.</p><p></p><p>Among them, some cases that looked very simple at first glance often had hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>Take the scene before him as an example.</p><p></p><p>It was possible that Mr. Bai was very good at disguising himself.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, he appeared to be very kind, but in fact, he was an extremely evil person.</p><p></p><p>The bones buried deep underground were all killed by his hands.</p><p></p><p>Even those half-human, half-beast existences in Ningyuan City might have been created by him, who was proficient in medical skills.</p><p></p><p>And rescuing the orphans in the small temple was also for the convenience of selecting research subjects.</p><p></p><p>But it was also possible that Mr. Bai was not pretending.</p><p></p><p>The specimens and corpses in the secret room were merely used by him to study medical skills.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, who had crossed over, this was not difficult to accept.</p><p></p><p>However, it might be a bit shocking in this Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>The reason for hiding in this underground secret room to conduct research might be that it was difficult for the world to understand and he was forced to do so.</p><p></p><p>Both of the above possibilities existed.</p><p></p><p>As for the truth, Li Fan still needed to verify it himself.</p><p></p><p>What could almost be confirmed at present was that the owner of this memory space that he had never met before was this "Mr. Bai".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided not to change his previous plan and first try to solve the "Ningyuan Longevity Fruit" incident without any mortal casualties.</p><p></p><p>After making up his mind, Li Fan focused his gaze on the somewhat damaged stone statue.</p><p></p><p>The stone statue seemed to have been born a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>It was full of traces of the vicissitudes of time and no longer had its former sacredness.</p><p></p><p>That faceless face was silently staring at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Such a large piece of stone is more than enough to make two or three sets of Immortal Extinction Stone Nails."</p><p></p><p>This was what Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the wooden box in the middle again and was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Well, very good, even the tools are prepared for me."</p><p></p><p>After a series of clanging sounds,</p><p></p><p>Dozens of slender Immortal Extinction Stone Nails were crafted and placed one by one on the long table in the basement by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I need to test whether the [Immortal Sealing Spirit Needle] can restrain Senior Brother Zhang."</p><p></p><p>"If it can..."</p><p></p><p>"Chu Liang and the others are just chickens and dogs. I can easily capture them by relying on my Insect Binding Divine Power."</p><p></p><p>"As for Song Hesong, I can also do the same and subdue him with the Immortal Extinction Stone Needles."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this Immortal Extinction Stone cannot be stored in the storage ring, so I need to invite the gentleman into the urn."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Li Fan returned to the surface and placed the Immortal Extinction Stone slab into the basement.</p><p></p><p>Then he sent a message to Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, come quickly, I have a major discovery!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then returned to the underground secret room, blew out the candle, and quietly waited for Senior Brother Zhang to arrive.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Zhang Qianmo's voice came from above: "Hmm? Junior Brother, what did you discover in this secret room?"</p><p></p><p>"So many bones..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Beast race!?"</p><p></p><p>Noticing the half-beast, half-human bones in the secret room, Zhang Qianmo's tone suddenly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Anger was faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>He flew down and landed in the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, look, not only are there many strangely shaped corpses here, but there is also a bizarre stone statue."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what its origin is."</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Li Fan slowly approached Zhang Qianmo and pointed to the increasingly dilapidated stone statue, saying.</p><p></p><p>Unable to display his spiritual consciousness, Zhang Qianmo only noticed the faceless stone statue not far away with the help of the faint light shining down from above.</p><p></p><p>His mind was greatly shocked, and he exclaimed, "The Xuantian God Statue?"</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, Li Fan suddenly stabbed a slender stone nail into his back, corresponding to the position of his dantian.</p><p></p><p>It pierced through his body.</p><p></p><p>Never expecting that his dear junior brother would ambush him, Zhang Qianmo seemed to have thought of something, and his expression greatly changed. He turned his head and was about to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>But the circulation of spiritual energy in his dantian was blocked, and the Purple Thunder Law he wanted to use was actually delayed by a moment.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, another stone nail fiercely pierced into his chest at the Shanzhong acupoint.</p><p></p><p>Then, it continued without stopping.</p><p></p><p>A total of thirty-six Immortal Extinction Stone Needles sealed all the vital acupoints on Zhang Qianmo's body.</p><p></p><p>His entire aura plummeted, and Senior Brother Zhang, who had the surface cultivation of the Foundation Establishment stage, now seemed to have become as weak as a mortal.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Sealing Spirit..."</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Although he was captured, there was not much panic on Zhang Qianmo's face.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he stared at Li Fan and said hatefully,</p><p></p><p>"You are not my junior brother Li Chen!"</p><p></p><p>"What have you done to my junior brother?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't expect the effect of these Immortal Extinction Stone Nails to be so good, easily subduing Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>After hearing him mistakenly regard himself as some "remnant of the Xuantian Sect", Li Fan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, his face remained unchanged, and he said in a normal tone, "Senior Brother, you are really muddled. You can't even recognize your own junior brother?"</p><p></p><p>Then, he recounted one by one some past events that only he and his senior brother knew, according to Li Chen's memories.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's expression kept changing, alternating between surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Was Junior Brother's soul searched? No, with the Purple Thunder Divine Protection guarding his body, he shouldn't fear soul searching techniques..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's face completely darkened.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that Junior Brother, you were actually a hidden agent of the Xuantian Sect who had infiltrated our Purple Thunder Sect since childhood?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was speechless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, he could see that Zhang Qianmo seemed to be fearless and not worried about his own situation.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he wanted to use this opportunity to extract information.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan played along and cooperated with the act.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you must be joking. What Xuantian Sect? I have no idea about it at all."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shrugged, looking completely innocent.</p><p></p><p>"No idea?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"At this point, don't pretend anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Secretly hiding the Xuantian God Statue and engaging in sinister activities."</p><p></p><p>"Who else could it be besides the remnants of the Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you have hidden yourself so well all these years."</p>

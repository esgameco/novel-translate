        <h1>Chapter 1233</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stood quietly, feeling the unyielding will of the vast sea beneath his feet.</p><p></p><p>Faced with a life-and-death crisis, any existence would struggle with all its might.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also felt the fierce desire for survival of this ocean.</p><p></p><p>But its struggle for survival was a naked "evil thought" for the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping, who claimed to be the incarnation of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, naturally could not stand on the side of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, you should obediently submit."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to make any more futile struggles."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his divine sense enveloped the entire Congyun Ocean.</p><p></p><p>The scenes on the thousands of islands scattered within, as well as the countless creatures living in the seawater, were all instantly reflected in Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is a necessary sacrifice."</p><p></p><p>A flash of determination passed through his eyes, and threads of golden light surged from his body, then scattered to various parts of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The power close to the essence of the original force could not be detected by anyone in the Congyun Sea, where the highest level was only Huashen cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the golden light had spread to all regions of the Congyun Sea. It penetrated deep into the ocean depths, reaching the bottom seabed.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the Congyun Sea, unknown violent tremors began to occur.</p><p></p><p>If one looked from the sky, one could see that the entire surface of the ocean seemed to form a huge net.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping this vibrant blue sea of life.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, dark clouds gathered in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The originally calm sea surface suddenly stirred up terrifying waves.</p><p></p><p>Even more violent than the waves during past wind disasters.</p><p></p><p>Some islands capsized without warning, and even the spiritual islands with cultivators stationed on them were in a precarious situation amidst the fierce wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Congyun Sea all looked at the changes in the world with doubt and alarm.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators with keen spiritual awareness had a feeling that a great calamity was imminent. Their faces changed color, and without further ado, they directly escaped through the transmission array on the Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Their fleeing actions also attracted the attention of a considerable number of people. A small number of cultivators chose to leave with them.</p><p></p><p>But the vast majority of people sneered at these "easily frightened, timid as mice" escapees.</p><p></p><p>They hid on Wanxian Island with peace of mind, watching the changing scenery of wind and clouds between the heaven and earth of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not pay attention to those fleeing cultivators, nor did he care about these onlookers.</p><p></p><p>His target, from beginning to end, was only the remnant will of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant net, invisible to ordinary cultivators, had already sealed off the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The energy of the original force essence was accumulating and evolving within it, and a great formation was about to reveal its lofty appearance.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Ping's view, it was just impotent rage.</p><p></p><p>"How to erase the world consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered this question while constructing the formation.</p><p></p><p>"I refine all gods with all living beings."</p><p></p><p>He quickly thought of this unparalleled fierce formation.</p><p></p><p>"A formation that can even block true immortals, I think it's not a big problem to deal with the remnant world will."</p><p></p><p>"Countless meaningless miscellaneous thoughts to impact..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping set up the formation, strange scenes began to appear in the sky above the Congyun Sea for no reason.</p><p></p><p>They were distorted, desperate faces.</p><p></p><p>They howled and waved their arms.</p><p></p><p>As if begging for help, or perhaps just subconsciously screaming miserably.</p><p></p><p>On the sky curtain, appeared...</p><p></p><p>(The excerpt ends here)</p><p></p><p>The strange faces in the sky became more and more numerous.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, they almost filled every corner of the field of vision.</p><p></p><p>In the ears of the creatures within the Congyun Sea, slowly, besides the wailing of the human faces, no other sounds could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Those with weak willpower were quickly influenced by these demonic faces, becoming equally desperate and mad.</p><p></p><p>And those who barely managed to hold on soon fell into a boundless and terrifying nightmare.</p><p></p><p>In a trance, they seemed to see a black sun rising in the sky, and the entire world on the brink of destruction - a scene of great terror.</p><p></p><p>Just like the despairing demon faces in the sky, they collectively experienced this unimaginable calamity.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation array on Wanxian Island remained open.</p><p></p><p>However, all the cultivators who saw the myriad faces in the sky lost the ability to control their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their cultivation level, from Qi Refining junior cultivators to Nascent Soul island masters.</p><p></p><p>All of them were like this.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the array formation laid down by Li Ping was not targeting these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Just being affected by it had already brought them to such a state. One could imagine how cruel the situation faced by the consciousness of the Congyun Sea was at this moment.</p><p></p><p>With the remnant world consciousness of a single state, it was simply impossible to resist.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the incessant miserable howls of the countless demon faces, Li Ping felt that the will of the Congyun Sea was dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant waves were slowly subsiding.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that everything would pass, and the sky would clear after the rain.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan knew that from now on, the Congyun Sea would never be the same as before.</p><p></p><p>The process of erasing the consciousness of the Congyun Sea lasted for an entire day.</p><p></p><p>During this period, all cultivators who entered the scope of the Congyun Sea were affected and fell into terrifying illusions.</p><p></p><p>But there was no incident of a large number of creatures perishing at the same time, so the Wanxian Alliance had not yet had time to react.</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds in the sky dispersed, and the Congyun Sea became crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>It was so quiet that it was a bit frightening.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sensed the scattered will of the Congyun Sea between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant net slowly retracted, incidentally bringing back the remnant thoughts of this world that had already been dismembered into myriad pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping absorbed the consciousness of the Congyun Sea, countless scenes began to flash incessantly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was already used to constantly monitoring everything that happened within the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>But the total amount of information between the two was not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>In the vast ocean, there were not only humans.</p><p></p><p>Below the tranquil sea surface, there were also countless living beings multiplying and thriving.</p><p></p><p>If it were from Li Ping's subjective perspective, he definitely would not pay much attention to these creatures that did not even have intelligence.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, it was a passive absorption.</p><p></p><p>In the concept of the world's will, these fish were essentially no different from human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping endured the intense pain in his sea of consciousness and accepted all this information.</p><p></p><p>As if he had taken a great tonic, his spiritual strength also began to expand like an inflating balloon.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's spiritual strength was already strong enough among cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But in the midst of this rapid growth, it was inevitable for cracks to appear.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators encountering this situation would only have the option of despairingly waiting for their soul to scatter.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping was different.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the Heavenly Emperor's Qi Scripture, he not only used the billions of citizens of the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty as anchors.</p><p></p><p>Within his body, there was also the quintessence of transcendent power.</p><p></p><p>Golden energy surged, repairing the wounds of his spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it served as a supplement for the expansion of his spiritual soul.</p>

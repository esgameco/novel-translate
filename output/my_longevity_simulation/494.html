            <p>"Human remains? What do they want with those remains?" Li Fan was surprised to learn that beneath the Ten Thousand Immortals Island where he resided daily, there might be many corpses of ancient cultivators buried there, which shook him. At the same time, facing Sima Changkong's response, he was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This is something I cannot know. Perhaps the Five Elders can even resurrect the dead? If those original founders were to awaken and see the current situation of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, they might directly charge into the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and not stop until the end," Sima Changkong coldly chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Daoist friend, be careful with your words." Li Fan did not continue, but changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Mountain Sea Changes, the original founders, and the origin of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island..."</p><p></p><p>"None of these are trivial matters. From what I understand about today's cultivators, I'm afraid those Nascent Deities might not be as well-informed as Daoist friend about all these secrets."</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly do you come from, Daoist friend?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>"What background can I have? I am just an ordinary cultivator." Sima Changkong said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's incredulous expression, Sima Changkong proudly declared, "Let Daoist friend know that in this world, whenever something happens, it leaves traces."</p><p></p><p>"This doesn't mean erasing the memories of cultivators will completely bury the truth of history."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong suddenly stood up, "Nothing should be hidden from people. I won't hide it from you, Daoist friend. I am Sima Changkong, a historian!"</p><p></p><p>With that, it seemed like all the blood and energy in his body were greatly circulated. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was well acquainted with the cultivation of life energy, was surprised to find that the blood and energy inside Sima Changkong's body were extremely mixed.</p><p></p><p>Some were very vigorous, like a newborn baby.</p><p></p><p>But some were quite old, as if they had existed for thousands or even tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The life energy gushed out of Sima Changkong's body, forming a magnificent river of blood above his head.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan carefully looked, each red blood drop contained countless images and sounds flashing.</p><p></p><p>The higher up it went, the older the recorded scenes became.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored river was majestic and vast, containing so much information that even with Li Fan's current strength of mind, after observing for a moment, he felt a bit dizzy and overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but be shocked, so he averted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong saw Li Fan's reaction and gradually retracted the external anomaly.</p><p></p><p>He slowly said, "This is the 'Bloodline Chronicle,' compiled by my Sima family through generations of cultivation and compilation."</p><p></p><p>"Since our ancestor Sima Pei created this 'Blood History' technique, our Sima family has taken the responsibility of meticulously recording the history of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they die, they have no regrets. So far, it has been passed down for fifty-six generations."</p><p></p><p>"Fifty-six generations?" Li Fan was slightly surprised and was about to inquire, but Sima Changkong nodded, "Correct, although practicing the 'Blood History' will compress one's lifespan to that of an ordinary person, our Sima family has never retreated."</p><p></p><p>"What fear is there in death? As long as there are descendants of our Sima family in the world, the 'Bloodline Chronicle' will automatically awaken appropriate host successors to continue the great historical legacy."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong said with pride.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel solemn and respectful.</p><p></p><p>He generally admired historians.</p><p></p><p>When he was still the Grand Senior of the Great Xuan, there was no one in the civil and military officials who did not bow under his tyranny, not daring to speak against him. Only the historians of the Great Xuan were not afraid of his slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Even if their entire family's lives were threatened, these people had to truthfully record Li Fan's turmoil in the court and oppression of the empress dowager in the historical records.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan killed some people and found that others still recorded it faithfully, he had no choice but to let it be.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that there would be historians even in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>While feeling respectful, Li Fan's heart also stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Many histories of the Xuanhuang Realm were shrouded in mystery.</p><p></p><p>Some were even deliberately hidden. Trying to figure out what happened in history just by consulting the records was like a fool's dream.</p><p></p><p>However, with the existence of Sima Changkong as a living history book, the situation was quite different.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan deeply realized the importance of this cultivator before him and engaged him in conversation once again.</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong's character was straightforward, and as he gradually got to know Li Fan, he was open about everything.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gradually learned that although the Sima family could record history with the Bloodline Chronicle, the Xuanhuang Realm was vast. How could all world events be fully known by just one person?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Sima family also possessed the divine power of 'Bloodline Incarnation,' which could separate a part of their blood and create avatars.</p><p></p><p>With many avatars traveling all over, they could try to record history as fully and truthfully as possible.</p><p></p><p>It was for this reason that the life spans of the Sima family were generally not very long.</p><p></p><p>The river of blood recorded countless pieces of information from the past in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any accidents from leading to the loss of generations' efforts, the Sima family's ancestors had created the secret technique of 'One is all.'</p><p></p><p>As mentioned earlier, as long as there was still Sima family blood flowing in the world, the Bloodline Chronicle would never be severed.</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong showed a proud smile.</p><p></p><p>With the bloodline of the Sima family, even if it was extremely diluted, it could still recreate the Bloodline Chronicle.</p><p></p><p>Over thousands of years, the mortal descendants of the Sima family were scattered throughout the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that as long as they didn't slaughter all the mortals in the Xuanhuang Realm, they could never completely eliminate the Bloodline Chronicle.</p><p></p><p>"The Sima family is truly extraordinary! Great methods, great divine powers!" Li Fan couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked Sima Changkong for a communication talisman, and he solemnly stored it in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Sima friend, we must keep in touch in the future." Li Fan warmly chatted with the immortal world historian for a long time before reluctantly parting ways.</p><p></p><p>When the avatar returned to the old site of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island, Li Fan, who was in a distant place called Shilin Prefecture, discovered that the communication talisman distributed by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was constantly flashing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel strange because normally, that talisman was only used for communicating between cultivators within the system of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. Now that the Ten Thousand Immortals Island had been captured by the Five Elders, the administrative system of the Cloud Mountain Sea could be considered completely dismantled.</p><p></p><p>At this time, who would contact him in this way?</p><p></p><p>With this doubt, Li Fan took out the communication talisman and activated it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his expression became somewhat peculiar.</p><p></p><p>"I am ordered to act as the acting island lord of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island, responsible for rebuilding the Cloud Mountain Sea Celestial City."</p><p></p><p>"The location is right above the former Ten Thousand Immortals Island."</p><p></p><p>"Implement immediately, no mistakes allowed."</p>

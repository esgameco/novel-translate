            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1319: Seeing the True Immortal's Blood Awakens Memories</p><p></p><p>The scene when he came into contact with the ancient symbols was different from the elders of the Immortal Boat. </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Tian's originally youthful body did not exhibit a regression phenomenon. Inside his body, the stored Qian-Kun Bone Hand emitted imperceptible tremors, absorbing and assimilating the power of the ancient symbols.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not know if it was appropriate to describe this process as "absorbing and assimilating." In his perception, the ancient symbols and the Qian-Kun Bone Hand seemed to form some kind of resonance.</p><p></p><p>This caused the power of the true immortal seal scripts that should have acted on Ouyang Tian's body to be drawn into this strange object, the Qian-Kun Bone Hand.</p><p></p><p>Another strange object in Ouyang Tian's body, the Book of Myriad Deaths, remained motionless.  </p><p></p><p>Stimulated by the ancient power, the Qian-Kun Bone Hand underwent subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>On the originally bare white bones, dark red flesh and blood began to appear, though only in thin lines that were almost imperceptible. But Li Fan, who watched the entire transformation process from the beginning, noticed this abnormality immediately.</p><p></p><p>The birth of flesh and blood made the Qian-Kun Bone Hand appear even more mystical, as if it had suddenly become imbued with spirituality and came to life. Without Ouyang Tian's control, the bone fingers trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..." Ouyang Tian, who was in a deep slumber, let out a muffled groan. It was evident that the anomaly of the strange object within him caused him no small pain.  </p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed his hands on Ouyang Tian's head, and he fell back into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>A golden light emerged from Li Fan's hands, forming a sharp surgical blade that sliced into Ouyang Tian's arm.</p><p></p><p>The flesh was not torn apart. The golden surgical blade went directly into Ouyang Tian's body and reached the Qian-Kun Bone Hand.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing the approach of an external enemy, the Qian-Kun Bone Hand began to violently tremble continuously. It even seemed to want to break free and escape, disregarding the host's life or death.</p><p></p><p>But how could Li Fan allow it to do as it wished?</p><p></p><p>Thin threads emerged from the golden blade, forming chains that firmly locked the Qian-Kun Bone Hand in place.</p><p></p><p>The blade's light flickered rapidly, slicing off inch by inch the newly formed flesh and blood from the bone hand.</p><p></p><p>A shrill, resentful howl seemed to ring in his ears, but Li Fan remained unmoved. He wove a golden net of source essence to seal and imprison all the flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Without the influence of the new flesh and blood, the Qian-Kun Bone Hand became quiet and peaceful again.  </p><p></p><p>However, Ouyang Tian looked deathly pale, as if he had suffered a severe internal injury.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sent out a spiritual force to nourish Ouyang Tian's body. Afterwards, he took the curled up flesh and blood trapped in the source essence net, which seemed to have lost its vitality, and flashed down below the lecture platform.</p><p></p><p>On the lecture platform above, the preaching illusory figure continued teaching without pause.</p><p></p><p>In the huge cavity excavated below, Li Fan had begun researching the flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the Qian-Kun Bone Hand is exactly the same as the White Bone Vanguard. According to the master of the Vanguard, Hedao Zizhong, the White Bone Vanguard was modeled after a painting record he had seen of a true immortal's discarded remains..."</p><p></p><p>"So this could very well be the flesh and blood of a true immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, looking at the dark red tissue in the golden net.</p><p></p><p>Having escaped from true immortals multiple times and even witnessing a true immortal being devoured by the Cat Treasure, Li Fan's awe of true immortals had long since disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In this life, by a fortuitous opportunity, his Emptying the Void and Charging with Essence progress had skyrocketed, allowing him to activate the Return to Truth three times in a row.</p><p></p><p>With safety assured, Li Fan began attempting to study this true immortal's flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>First, he could confirm that this clump of true immortal flesh and blood did not possess its own "consciousness." Its ability to move seemed more like an instinctive biological reaction.  </p><p></p><p>This clump was more than enough for research purposes. When it was nearly depleted, he could retrieve more from Ouyang Tian's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first conducted a rough analysis of the true immortal flesh and blood's composition.</p><p></p><p>A sliver of source essence formed a small blade that cut off a tiny piece. Then a rotating golden light formed a meat grinder, pulverizing that small piece of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"No immortal spiritual power." As Li Fan expected, he did not feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"The body tissue and blood have separated. The activity of the tissue is clearly inferior to the true immortal's blood. This blood seems to contain some special kind of energy..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes lit up as he separated a strand of divine sense, attempting to probe into the separated blood.</p><p></p><p>But the moment he touched the true immortal's blood, his divine sense felt like it had slammed into a scorching hot iron door. It was shaken into a daze, and more than half of it was instantly vaporized by the searing heat contained within the blood.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a separated strand of divine sense, the shock and burning sensation it experienced was simultaneously transmitted to Li Fan's main divine sense.</p><p></p><p>His head felt like it had been struck by a muffled cudgel, and then a raging blaze ignited within his soul.  </p><p></p><p>It was almost akin to the agony of his soul scattering - if an ordinary cultivator encountered this unprepared, they would likely be instantly incinerated.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was no ordinary person. </p><p></p><p>Imbued with the Infinite Replenishing Void method, his soul could flow and regenerate, becoming virtually indestructible.</p><p></p><p>Even if it felt like he was trapped in purgatory, Li Fan ultimately managed to endure it.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current endurance, after suffering this backlash from the true immortal's blood, his forehead was drenched in cold sweat and his muscles spasmed continuously.</p><p></p><p>The scorching sensation in his soul gradually dissipated. Once everything settled, Li Fan exhaled deeply, dispelling all discomfort.</p><p></p><p>"The divide between immortal and mortal..."</p><p></p><p>"True immortals cannot be touched."</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling Li Fan got from his recent experience.  </p><p></p><p>Even a single drop of blood still demonstrated the vast chasm between immortals and mortals in its own way.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>This small warning did not make Li Fan restrain himself, but rather piqued his interest even more.</p><p></p><p>The more he was forbidden from looking, the more Li Fan wanted to pry.</p><p></p><p>Burning his soul?  </p><p></p><p>Endless agony?</p><p></p><p>On his journey, Li Fan had long since learned to view such things as nothing.</p><p></p><p>With a slight mental shift, he instantly divided into countless divine thoughts, like fearless soldiers charging recklessly towards the true immortal's blood within the golden net.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The true immortal blood's retaliation constantly reverberated through Li Fan's soul, like a massive hammer pounding away.</p><p></p><p>The myriad impacts brought myriad retaliations. Li Fan's soul felt like it had been instantly set ablaze, with countless sparks raging uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>This pain was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Immortal Heart Mantra's protection and his own supreme willpower, he nearly collapsed and could barely hold on.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first glanced at the Return to Truth panel.</p><p></p><p>The Emptying the Void and Charging with Essence progress remained at 400, unaffected by the true immortal blood's retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>As it descended. It showed that just a drop of blood backlash was still not enough to threaten Li Fan's current strength. </p><p></p><p>With no safety concerns, Li Fan tried his best to maintain the operation of the yin-yang method, while concentrating his attention on the Celestial's blood that resembled a city wall of flames.</p><p></p><p>Having been struck by countless divine souls, the defenses within also seemed to have developed hairline cracks.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long the stalemate lasted, but finally, Li Fan broke through the defenses of the Celestial's blood. </p><p></p><p>The backlash dissipated into nothingness, and his divine soul instantly became clear and cool.</p><p></p><p>A ray of light emerged from the Celestial's blood, enveloping Li Fan's divine soul.  </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, a streak of light and shadow appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be covered in a haze of light, and all the surrounding scenery could not be seen clearly.</p><p></p><p>An angry voice came from the tall figure in the distance.  </p><p></p><p>Intermittent, only able to make out the gist: "...Qionglang Star Domain...oblivion...guard"</p><p></p><p>"...target found"</p><p></p><p>"Subject, orders received." A low voice came from himself.</p><p></p><p>The light and shadow changed again.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he was already in the Xuanhuang Realm.  </p><p></p><p>Standing in the high heavens, looking down at the myriad beings in the realm.</p><p></p><p>But it was outside the starry sky.  </p><p></p><p>It seemed to be waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>Unknown how long had passed, a brilliant light suddenly came from outside the heavens.</p><p></p><p>His body's gaze was instantly locked on it.  </p><p></p><p>But he did not interfere, allowing that brilliant light to fall into the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the light had completely faded and settled that his figure descended to the mortal world to examine it in detail.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet."</p><p></p><p>"But not bad. If it were back then, there would be hope of ascending to immortality. What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>His body seemed to have already become accustomed to this result, his tone neither sad nor joyful. He shook his head slightly, sighed, and then returned to the heavens of the Xuanhuang Realm.  </p><p></p><p>Silently watching, waiting for the arrival of the next target.</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly froze, and then faded away rapidly like a faded photograph.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan woke up from the illusion, returning to the present.</p><p></p><p>Although there were only a few scenes experienced in the memories of the Celestial's blood,  </p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt as if he had experienced dozens of lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>And this length was truly reflected in his physical body.  </p><p></p><p>His long hair was fluttering, and had unknowingly reached his waist, intermingled with black and white strands.</p><p></p><p>His face, palms, and even the skin all over his body had become somewhat wrinkled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his age on the Zhenzhen panel.  </p><p></p><p>His mental age remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>But his physical age limit had been directly reduced to 50 years old.</p><p></p><p>Still in the prime of his thirties, yet his great limit was approaching.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the price of glimpsing the Celestial's memories?"</p><p></p><p>After trying for a while and confirming that the longevity treasures of the Xuanhuang Realm could not increase this reduced lifespan limit,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have Zhenzhen by my side. The 50-year lifespan limit doesn't make much difference for me."</p><p></p><p>"I still have 20 years left in this life, which is enough time to complete my plans."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mood stabilized, and he couldn't help but recall the scenes he saw in the Celestial's blood.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial whose blood this belonged to should have been sent to the Xuanhuang Realm to search for some target..."</p><p></p><p>"The word 'subject' was used interestingly."  </p><p></p><p>"And that brilliant light that came from outside the heavens..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Combining this with the information he had previously explored from the ancient celestial formation in the Xuanhuang Realm and the nine red star beads,</p><p></p><p>A guess emerged in Li Fan's mind: "In ancient times, the Xuanhuang Realm was also capturing something."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the later captures of other cultivation realms, the target at that time was..."</p><p></p><p>"Humans?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered.  </p><p></p><p>"But not bad. If it were back then, there would be hope of ascending to immortality..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan repeated the Celestial's words a few times.</p><p></p><p>"The brilliant light from the outside that had the hope of ascending to immortality was not the target He was waiting for. What exactly..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan somehow associated it with himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the Celestial's memories were vague and unclear, and it was an event from who knows how many years ago,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a lingering sense of having narrowly escaped disaster.</p><p></p><p>By the time he came to his senses, his back was already drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>This was not because Li Fan was timid.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was an instinctive fear and relief after belatedly realizing it.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>His pounding heart gradually calmed down.  </p><p></p><p>Li Fan temporarily left the underground space of the Lecture Hall and flashed back to the heavens above the Small World of the Great Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered the premonition he just had.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's hard to believe..."</p><p></p><p>"But a lingering premonition tells me that many years ago, the target of that Celestial in the Xuanhuang Realm might actually have been me?!"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, not me, but Zhenzhen!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes to prevent the turmoil and shock in his heart from showing.</p><p></p><p>"Zhenzhen, Zhenzhen..."</p><p></p><p>Following his words, the surrounding scenery became illusory and indistinct again.</p><p></p><p>Only by isolating himself from the real world could Li Fan feel a little more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Zhenzhen involves the great way of truth and falsehood, reality and illusion."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's a heavenly wonder or the Celestial seal characters, even the mysterious symbols that created the Celestial Monarch of the Xuanhuang Realm, they are all partial manifestations of the great way."</p><p></p><p>"But only Zhenzhen transcends everything."  </p><p></p><p>"It can be said to be almost the great way of truth and falsehood, reality and illusion itself..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged as he calmly pondered.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to make a Celestial refer to himself as a subject, the tall figure in the distance in the memories must have held an extraordinary position."</p><p></p><p>"Qionglang Star Domain...oblivion"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to infer the possible truth from the fragmentary words.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the celestial realm was already in crisis at that time."  </p><p></p><p>"Oblivion..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps one of the ways to resolve the crisis in the celestial realm, relying on the Celestial's power, was Zhenzhen."</p><p></p><p>"So that's why He was lying in wait in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that, for some reason, I arrived here tens of thousands of years too late."</p><p></p><p>Having been separated from the Celestial's memories for a long time, the lingering sense of having narrowly escaped disaster that Li Fan felt in his heart gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Without the influence of that inexplicable emotion, Li Fan looked at his previous guesses again, but found them almost ridiculously absurd.</p><p></p><p>"What is the truth?"</p><p></p><p>With his mood stabilized, Li Fan flashed from the heavens back underground.  </p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining Celestial's blood in the golden net, he pondered for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I can't glimpse it again in this life."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if I can find more clues in the next life."</p><p></p><p>"Even if my guess is confirmed, it doesn't really matter. After all, those Celestials who wanted to capture me during the great calamity of the celestial realm have all disappeared first!"</p><p></p><p>A ray of brilliance flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and his state of mind became stable again.  </p><p></p><p>Although he could no longer glimpse the memories from the Celestial's blood in this life,</p><p></p><p>It did not prevent Li Fan from continuing his research on the Celestial's flesh and blood.</p>

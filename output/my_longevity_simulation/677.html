        <h1>Chapter 677</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After seeing Li Fan passing by, he quickly retracted his gaze. In the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Li Fan arrived outside the mountain range marked by Shuofeng. The mountain range was winding like a giant dragon, with sixteen towering peaks. Even through the protective array, one could still feel the dense spiritual energy within the mountains. Almost as soon as Li Fan arrived, a female cultivator in a pale yellow long dress flew out from one of the peaks and approached him. "You must be the guest of the young master. Please come this way," the female cultivator said respectfully, leading Li Fan through the protective array and into the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at the female cultivator leading the way and realized that she, like him, was at the mid-Yuan Infant stage. However, here, she seemed to be just a servant-like presence. But Li Fan didn't feel embarrassed; instead, he remained composed and asked the female cultivator about the situation there.</p><p></p><p>The mountain range was named Shuofeng Mountain, purchased by the Scarlet Snow Immortal and named after Shuofeng. Later, after Shuofeng successfully built his foundation that year, it was given to him as a gift. Although named a mountain, it was actually a carefully crafted cave. The sixteen peaks formed an array, gathering the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. The peaks were all created with extraordinary items containing the laws of heaven and earth, so staying there, even without deliberate cultivation, would be influenced by the rich laws, and one's cultivation would improve day by day.</p><p></p><p>Although the cave here was extraordinary, after Shuofeng broke through to the Yuan Infant realm, the Scarlet Snow Immortal gifted him a mansion in Tianquan City. Therefore, Shuofeng Mountain gradually fell into disuse. Only occasionally would he come here to play around.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan saw Shuofeng standing on the central peak in cyan clothing. With hands behind his back, his expression was indifferent as he stood in the center. Around him, six cultivators at the late Yuan Infant stage were launching attacks on him.</p><p></p><p>Without using cave powers, they simply used spells. Observing this scene, Li Fan's eyes involuntarily tightened. Strictly speaking, these Yuan Infant cultivators were not weak. Elemental spells, divine flying swords, and even void-piercing techniques that could suddenly attack from various strange directions.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of these attacks, Shuofeng neither dodged nor evaded, not even blinking his eyes.</p><p></p><p>As white light danced and the Sword of Heaven worked its magic, all the attacks were blocked and reflected back in an instant. Explosions continuously sounded, and after enduring for just over a dozen breaths, all six Yuan Infant cultivators were wounded by their own attacks, defeated. Shuofeng didn't show any mercy. Some of them were seriously injured, and one person's body was destroyed, only to be reconfigured through the cave powers after a while.</p><p></p><p>"You are all too weak; bring another group," Shuofeng's tone was a bit cold, with a hint of impatience on his face.</p><p></p><p>The six Yuan Infant cultivators leaving glanced at Li Fan as if speculating on his identity but did not dare linger, quietly retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Shu Brother, you are truly magnificent!" Li Fan suddenly laughed, applauding without showing any signs of submission to the other's momentum.</p><p></p><p>"Don't mock me, Li Brother!" A hint of a smile appeared on Shuofeng's icy face.</p><p></p><p>As the six Yuan Infant cultivators left, they discreetly cast their eyes over Li Fan. Not daring to stay any longer, they speculated about Li Fan's identity in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see, Brother Shu, your strength has indeed improved. But, I am not weaker than you!" "Please advise me!"</p><p></p><p>Without many words, Li Fan's expression turned cold, pointing directly at Shuofeng with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh...</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind passed by, and Shuofeng and the others who had been on high alert for a long time noticed no abnormalities around them.</p><p></p><p>The smile gradually faded from Shuofeng's face, and his gaze turned slightly cold. "Li Brother, are you teasing me?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained unchanged, smiling slightly. "Just comprehended a new supernatural ability, the first time I've used it, it's normal to make some minor mistakes. But it's alright, this time should work."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone instantly became extremely cold as he withdrew his pointing finger and gestured once more.</p><p></p><p>"Splinter!"</p><p></p><p>Still, the wind blew lightly, as if nothing had happened. Li Fan's emotionless voice echoed on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng, about to speak, suddenly felt something, his expression turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Threads were being stripped from the cyan robe he was wearing, meandering in the air like dissolving water, quickly disappearing. Shuofeng couldn't help but grunt involuntarily. And in front of him in the air appeared a red thread. "Threadsâ€¦" Cryptic voices kept echoing. Each time a voice sounded, an additional strand of bloodline appeared in the air and left a blood trail on Shuofeng's body. But in an instant, Shuofeng was all over injured and bleeding. Moreover, he sensed that it was not just superficial wounds but that his body's composition was being extracted and disappearing out of thin air! Like... a little figure entirely woven with threads being slowly pulled out by someone from within!</p><p></p><p>And, from the beginning to the end, his foundational artifact, the Sword of Heaven, had not defended itself!</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's called 'Splinter!'" Shuofeng couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>"If this continues..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a horrifying scene popped into Shuofeng's mind: due to the continuous extraction of threads, his body was getting smaller and smaller until he looked like a dilapidated rag doll, weakly falling to the ground amidst cries, waiting for his impending doom.</p><p></p><p>A chill ran down his spine.</p><p></p><p>But as his mind raced, he couldn't find a way to deal with this Splinter skill.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, still pointing in mid-air, had no intention of relenting!</p><p></p><p>"This guy might actually kill me!" Watching Li Fan's deeply profound gaze, Shuofeng was shocked to the core.</p><p></p><p>"I surrender! I surrender!" Driven by the instinct to survive, Shuofeng shouted repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Shuofeng's voice, Li Fan finally retracted his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Pfft!" In an instant, it seemed like countless threads were broken.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng was enveloped in layers of bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!" The female cultivator in the yellow dress was horrified, her face losing color as she screamed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine!" Shuofeng waved his hand, stopping the female cultivator from approaching to check on him.</p><p></p><p>"You are accommodating!" Li Fan arched his hand, his face calm.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng's eyes were somewhat complicated as he looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Friend has excellent supernatural abilities!"</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to admit sincerely.</p>

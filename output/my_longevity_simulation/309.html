        <h1>Chapter 309</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Cong Yun Sea, on the Wan Xian Island, apart from the mysterious Tian Sha Sword, there was no other force that could contend with Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>The black tide of Mo Sha loomed overhead, and Li Fan's thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, when Mo Sha descended, why did it alarm the Tian Sha Sword in the Yun Shui Heavenly Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"When I first entered the cultivation world, there was only the Chi Yan Fen Hai, which presumably did not affect the Yun Shui Heavenly Palace."</p><p></p><p>"In the twelfth lifetime, I sent the Diao Xiang of Tian Yi into the Yun Shui Heavenly Palace, but it attracted the Master. The two fought, and the Yun Shui Heavenly Palace was sealed again. So when Mo Sha annihilated the world, it did not encounter the Tian Sha Sword."</p><p></p><p>"In this lifetime, because I was wary of Tian Yi's shocking mind-reading technique, I did not choose to complete the mission of the Yun Shui Scroll. And Si Kong Yi, the only one who knew the secret of the Yun Shui Scroll, was eliminated by me early on. So the Yun Shui Heavenly Palace still hung high above the Cong Yun Sea. Until Mo Sha descended."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan understood the reason for the great battle between Tian Sha Sword and Mo Sha in this world.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed with a sharp light, as if his gaze wanted to penetrate the endless ink sea and reach the place where the two were fighting in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Sha, Tian Sha..."</p><p></p><p>"If I could observe the battle between the two, it would surely surpass countless opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering, the black particles had already arrived in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Without any fear, Li Fan raised his right hand high and offered his arm to the black particles.</p><p></p><p>Watching his body disappear into the wriggling ink, Li Fan carefully comprehended. </p><p></p><p>There was no pain, not even the slightest sensation.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he might not have even noticed that a part of his body had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Pure nothingness," Li Fan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Zao Hua Hong Lu technique roared into operation.</p><p></p><p>The hidden force within his body surged out and rushed towards the area of his arm being eroded by the black particles.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to use this pure life force to contend with that void force.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to indeed delay it for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But it also seemed to be just Li Fan's illusion.</p><p></p><p>The rolling ink color then devoured Li Fan's avatar.</p><p></p><p>In Tian Yu Province, at the Huan Yu Villa.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Fan's true body, just like his avatar millions of miles away, raised his arms, closed his eyes and pondered, as if comprehending something.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally put his hands down.</p><p></p><p>"The hidden force is the force of life, the force of creation."</p><p></p><p>"The force of Mo Sha is the force of erasure, the force of void."</p><p></p><p>"As for the force of Tian Sha, it's more like the force of distortion, chaos, and destruction."</p><p></p><p>"This may not be the true original appearance of their powers, but it is my personal realization."</p><p></p><p>"Such a realization is enough to form a golden core!"</p><p></p><p>After savoring the insights he just gained once more, and carefully storing them in the Hua Dao crystal in his mind, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit of joy.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth have laws, cultivators glimpse them and can form golden cores.</p><p></p><p>If the various laws between heaven and earth are compared to incomparably beautiful paintings,</p><p></p><p>then the current process of cultivators "glimpsing the laws of heaven and earth" to form cores is like taking a transparent white paper and tracing the paintings stroke by stroke.</p><p></p><p>The result, although it cannot be said to be comparable to the real artwork, is not difficult to make it extremely similar.</p><p></p><p>The golden core methods of cultivators are still far from the true laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But even if imitating by rote, it can still reproduce a few parts of its might.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I planned to form my core with four laws: the Tian Sha Law, the Han Hai Law, the Lan Yan Law, and the Mo Sha Law."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that with my comprehension, I can go a step further."</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Sha Law and Lan Yan Law. Distortion and chaos, versus calmness and rationality."</p><p></p><p>"The Mo Sha Law and the Hidden Force Law. Creation and void."</p><p></p><p>"The Han Hai Law is actually the law of water."</p><p></p><p>"Lone water can hardly survive. If I can form my core with the Five Elements Law, it can endlessly regenerate."</p><p></p><p>"More crucially, if this succeeds, it will also greatly benefit my next step of forming a Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>Those who do not plan for ten thousand generations are not worthy of planning for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan successfully built his foundation with the Huan Zhen technique, he had already made a general plan for his future cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the path of cultivation is not mysterious, and the direction has long been set in stone.</p><p></p><p>After glimpsing the laws of heaven and earth to refine the golden core, the next step is to seize the essence of heaven and earth to form a Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long known that the so-called essence of heaven and earth referred to the various blessed lands within this Xuan Huang realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Huang realm is vast and boundless. The blessed lands that existed long ago and were later sealed; the ones that are being born every moment; the ones that reappear with the fall of cultivators - they are countless.</p><p></p><p>And these places have become the basis for golden core cultivators to form their Nascent Souls.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, his goal had long been set.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the Five Elements Grand Blessed Land that once caused a brutal war between the Wan Xian Alliance and the Five Elders Association!</p><p></p><p>The stronger the blessed land seized by a Nascent Soul cultivator, the stronger his power will be after forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>Among the Five Elements Grand Blessed Land, just one of them, the wood-attributed blessed land, was evaluated by the Tian Xuan Mirror as having an "extremely large scale, extremely high wood-attributed spiritual energy, and an extremely abundant variety of spiritual plants and herbs".</p><p></p><p>It's hard to imagine how precious the complete Five Elements Grand Blessed Land would be.</p><p></p><p>And how powerful would a Nascent Soul formed with it be?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the five elements generate and restrain each other, evolving into all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>Using it as a foundation, coupled with the abilities of Huan Zhen, perhaps it will produce other changes.</p><p></p><p>Although seeking the Five Elements Grand Blessed Land will certainly come with great risks,</p><p></p><p>for ordinary cultivators, it can only be a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>But with the help of Huan Zhen, countless opportunities for repeated attempts, plus the ability to know in advance,</p><p></p><p>the Five Elements Grand Blessed Land will surely be in Li Fan's pocket.</p><p></p><p>"To supplement the Five Elements Law, I don't necessarily have to personally travel and observe the laws."</p><p></p><p>"Within the Wan Xian Alliance, only you have enough contribution points. There are few things you can't buy."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention it's just the core formation insights of golden core cultivators, it may not be that precious."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan himself had already made a fortune in the Ling Wu Grass incident. Later, when Jiao Xiu Yuan sold the Small Xuan Huang Ding, he gave him another 260,000 contribution points.</p><p></p><p>This made him completely worry-free in this regard.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan immediately started searching the Tian Xuan Mirror for core formation insights related to the laws of metal, wood, fire, and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Law is the most common law between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the results were unexpectedly numerous.</p><p></p><p>The prices also fluctuated up and down according to the specific power.</p><p></p><p>Ranging from 50,000 to over 100,000.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked through them one by one, selecting suitable targets for himself.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that the records of core formation insights were not on some jade slip,</p><p></p><p>but directly on golden core fragments.</p><p></p><p>It seems that they were the remains of cultivators' golden cores after their death, processed in some way.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was only supplementing the Five Elements Law, so he didn't have much requirement for the strength of the other four laws.</p>

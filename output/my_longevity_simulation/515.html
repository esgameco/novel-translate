        <h1>Chapter 515</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The wedding was held very frugally, even somewhat rudimentary.</p><p></p><p>But her master Zhang Wangshuang eventually attended. He looked at the couple below, sighed slightly, and then barely mustered a smile.</p><p></p><p>That night, numerous broken-hearted disciples of the Great Dao Sect got drunk to desolation. Many fights even broke out.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that the reason why so many young disciples of the Great Dao Sect had deep affection for Sister Zhao was not only because of her appearance and strength, which surpassed her peers.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, after practicing the "Harmonization of Heaven and Earth", Sister Zhao's inadvertent display of feminine charm became even more enchanting, almost irresistible.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the eyes of outsiders, Sister Zhao remained untouched, appearing as a virgin.</p><p></p><p>So even though she had always been close to Li Fan day and night, she still had no lack of relentless suitors.</p><p></p><p>After the grand wedding, with Li Fan's reminder, Sister Zhao removed her disguise.</p><p></p><p>While many hearts broke again, there were still some devoted admirers who did not give up.</p><p></p><p>Because after shedding her youthful innocence, the charm of a mature woman that emanated from Sister Zhao's every move and smile was simply irresistible.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Sister Zhao was wholly devoted to Li Fan, which slightly eased the pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>However, whether for longevity or to protect Sister Zhao, Li Fan became even more diligent in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>With an abundant supply of spiritual stones and elixirs, along with the dual cultivation of the "Harmonization of Heaven and Earth", Li Fan's cultivation realm increased day by day.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, thirteen years had passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a natural anomaly occurred.</p><p></p><p>All beings in the Xuanhuang realm saw a kind-faced old man with his head held high, propping up the sky with his hands.</p><p></p><p>The anomaly did not last long, but all cultivators were filled with indescribable and complicated emotions.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sad, confused, and angry emotions intertwined, leaving the cultivators feeling a mixture of emotions.</p><p></p><p>After the image of the old man disappeared, all cultivators slowly understood.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Patriarch of Transmission of Laws had attained longevity.</p><p></p><p>From now on, people were required to address him as the "Transmitting Law Deity".</p><p></p><p>With his sole effort, he changed the path of cultivation in the world. From that point on, cultivators could only practice based on the methods he established.</p><p></p><p>Although many years had passed, the vast majority of cultivators in the world had switched to the new methods.</p><p></p><p>Yet, there were still many who persisted on the old path of "Harmony of Heaven and Man".</p><p></p><p>Now, the Patriarch directly cut off the old ways.</p><p></p><p>Some of these "antiquated" old cultivators chose death in despair, while others indignantly left and secluded themselves.</p><p></p><p>Confusion and chaos unfolded in every corner of the Xuanhuang realm, including within the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The new ways had prevailed and were unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>These disturbances were just ripples in the tide and could not change the overall flow of the river.</p><p></p><p>After the turmoil subsided, they welcomed a rare period of peace and explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>The number and quality of cultivators were increasing at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, a mediocre talent, had risen to the Nascent Soul realm in just over twenty years after switching to the new methods with an abundant supply of resources.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the other elite disciples in the sect.</p><p></p><p>If not for the scarcity of the world's spiritual essence and the uncertainty of their emergence, there would likely have been a sudden emergence of many Daoist cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As one of the most prominent junior disciples of the Great Dao Sect, after passing numerous tests, Sister Zhao finally succeeded in combining the paths of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Becoming one of the few true disciples of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, congratulations! Nowadays, with the increase in water levels, the qualification for a true disciple, previously attainable at the Nascent Soul realm, now requires combining the paths," Li Fan kissed Sister Zhao and congratulated her.</p><p></p><p>However, there was little joy on her face. A rare look of worry appeared.</p><p></p><p>After decades of close companionship, Li Fan, who knew her well, was quite astonished because such an occurrence in Sister Zhao was very unusual.</p><p></p><p>He asked with concern, "What are you worried about, Sister?"</p><p></p><p>"When I was breaking through, I inexplicably had a premonition," Sister Zhao waved her hand and sealed off the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Then she quietly conveyed, "Today, this seemingly prosperous and bustling cultivation world is like boiling oil. Although it is flourishing to the extreme, there is also a hidden crisis."</p><p></p><p>"Once it erupts..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know where the crisis would come from, it did not prevent the two from preparing for any imminent drastic changes.</p><p></p><p>Having practiced together for many years, the couple had become inseparable and formed a united front for their shared interests.</p><p></p><p>Without alerting others, while continuing their usual cultivation, they secretly gathered resources, preparing for the imminent great changes.</p><p></p><p>What they did not expect was that this wait lasted more than thirty years.</p><p></p><p>Time passed swiftly, and there was no sign of the crisis. The couple began to consider their earlier premonition as a delusion.</p><p></p><p>In the thirty years, Sister Zhao, with her increasingly profound cultivation and overwhelming combat strength, became the designated Dao Disciple of the Great Dao Sect and was granted the "Grand Dao Scripture of Execution".</p><p></p><p>If there were no surprises, in a few years, when the current Sect Master passed away, she would be the next Sect Master of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao was excited, and Li Fan was genuinely happy for her.</p><p></p><p>But their joy did not last long.</p><p></p><p>One day, the world-shaking event they had almost forgotten suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>It was so shocking, unexpected, and difficult for cultivators to accept that even their years of "preparation" had become a joke.</p><p></p><p>During their dual cultivation, Li Fan and Sister Zhao felt something unusual at the end of a similarly enchanting journey.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>After the end of a mesmerizing dual cultivation journey, Li Fan expressed a puzzled voice.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao, who had not yet fully recovered from their moment of indulgence, couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Why does it feel like the effect of this dual cultivation is not as good this time?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that we have encountered a bottleneck again?"</p><p></p><p>After achieving the Harmonization, the increase in cultivation from dual cultivation was no longer as significant. Hence, Sister Zhao had not noticed anything unusual before.</p><p></p><p>But now, after Li Fan's reminder and some investigation, her expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"There is no bottleneck, but the effectiveness has greatly decreased."</p><p></p><p>"Let's try again."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face became solemn, "How did the effect suddenly disappear?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this 'Harmonization of Heaven and Earth'..."</p><p></p><p>As they were speaking, they suddenly heard a commotion and noise outside.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the dual cultivation technique, but all techniques..."</p><p></p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p></p><p>Finally realizing it, Sister Zhao stood up abruptly, her face growing pale.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1327</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1316: The Mystery of the Accused Dharma Transmission</p><p></p><p>It is indeed befitting of the ancient secret repository of the Xuanshang Immortal Boat that has been passed down since antiquity - there are truly many good things recorded in the Baiwen Immortal Records...</p><p></p><p>As the only surviving realm in the darkest starry sea now, it can be said that the Xuanhuang Realm has accumulated the essence of the entire starry sea. And Li Fan, having reincarnated for hundreds of lifetimes, can be said to have turned the Xuanhuang Realm upside down. Ordinary hidden treasures naturally could hardly enter his dharma eye.</p><p></p><p>But strolling through this place, Li Fan still saw many objects that piqued his interest.</p><p></p><p>For example: a bronze-cast immortal crane. According to the information in the Baiwen Immortal Records, this bronze immortal crane was actually cast from the remnants of many immortal artifacts. Although it does not possess the abilities of immortal artifacts, because of the nature of its material, it is incomparably sturdy. All kinds of divine abilities and spells are unable to damage it in the slightest. Not to mention being indestructible for eons, at the very least the cataclysms that destroyed the darkest starry sea were unable to cause any damage to it.</p><p></p><p>"Limited by mundane materials, the sun-yang immortal figures I refined in previous lives, even with the addition of quintessential spiritual power, still could not break through the mortal limits. Being able to hold off the dharma transmission for a period of time already demonstrated the firm battle will of sun-yang." Li Fan's thoughts flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Another example: a stream of seven-colored radiance. It looked extremely similar to the seven-colored jade illusory radiance that Zhong Shentong fished up from the Fishing Pool. However, the seven-colored jade illusory radiance was formed when great cultivators collected and refined the seven rays of light that illuminated the world of cultivation from the world of reverence. It was the manifestation of the Heavenly Dao, containing the origin of the world. But this bundle of radiance recorded in the Baiwen Immortal Records was the remnant of an unknown cultivation world after its natural end. It could be regarded as the corpse of that cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had personally offered sacrifices and refined the seven-colored jade illusory radiance before. In his comprehension, although the essences of these two seven-colored radiances were not the same, they seemed to be vaguely connected.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it involves the transformation of a world from death to life..." This lifetime, Li Fan, who had already taken possession of the Fishing Pool, naturally had the idea of gathering these two seven-colored radiances and making a detailed comparison.</p><p></p><p>Yet another example: a figure standing barefoot with lowered eyelids. An unexpected acquisition of the Xuanshang Immortal Boat, no matter how it was studied, its purpose could not be figured out. So it was placed in the secret repository and slowly forgotten by the world. When Li Fan passed by this figure, he clearly sensed a slight reaction coming from Huanzhen. Although not as excited as when encountering the Eternal Remnant Consciousness, being able to provoke a reaction from Huanzhen was enough to demonstrate the figure's extraordinariness.</p><p></p><p>"It should also be related to the projection of the Dao." Li Fan did not react outwardly, not letting his gaze linger on the figure for too long.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan patiently selected items in the Immortal Boat's secret repository, three elders of the Immortal Boat followed closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>They did not disturb him, only silently watching Li Fan's every move intently.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the thief from back then really caused heavy losses to the Immortal Boat. Even with the Severed Immortal Arm as an important safeguard, you fellow daoists still do not feel at ease," Li Fan suddenly stopped in his tracks and joked.</p><p></p><p>The three elders Gan Jingda, Nan Gonglie, and Lu Yuzhi looked at each other, pretending not to have heard.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what exactly the Immortal Boat lost back then?" Li Fan continued exploring the treasures, casually asking.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..." Hearing this, the Immortal Boat elders mostly showed looks of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daozhong's voice came from afar: "Past grievances are not worth revisiting. But since the matter has already passed so many years, if you are interested, daoist, it is fine to tell you."</p><p></p><p>"Among the few treasures lost by the Immortal Boat back then, the most precious was an ice crystal immortal amber," Zhong Daozhong's tone was somewhat reminiscent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Jiandaosheng, the head of the Severed Immortal Pavilion, was a witness to the incident back then. He suddenly sighed: "Even now, the dreamlike and illusory appearance of the ice crystal immortal amber still appears in my mind from time to time. I only regret not being more forceful back then and stepping forward to stop it, resulting in that tragedy."</p><p></p><p>The other elders also sighed in lamentation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan curiously asked: "Ice crystal immortal amber? The name alone sounds very beautiful. But what exactly is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daozhong: "The ice crystal immortal amber was actually a frozen cultivation world. Its origins involve an extremely rare celestial phenomenon in the ancient starry sea."</p><p></p><p>The curiosity on Li Fan's face deepened, and he sincerely asked to hear more.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the starry sea was not as lifeless and desolate as it is now. Apart from the countless flourishing and varied cultivation worlds, there were also many starry sea anomalies that would occasionally appear."</p><p></p><p>"The leaping of celestial whales, the flowing of celestial horses, the swirling of yin and yang..."</p><p></p><p>"When these anomalies erupted, they would often cover an entire star domain, affecting dozens of cultivation worlds. Some would simply manifest strange scenes in the celestial canopy of the worlds, while others would bring about apocalyptic disasters!"</p><p></p><p>"The Brilliant Crystal Wind was one of them."</p><p></p><p>"An icy wind of unknown origin suddenly descended, blowing from the starry void towards the land. Wherever the icy wind passed, whether it was spirit immortals, Dao immortals, or immortal cultivators, none had even a moment to react before being instantly frozen. All living beings in the world, even the world itself, were turned into ice sculptures under the sweeping of the Brilliant Crystal Wind." Zhong Daozhong lightly tapped his finger, and a horrifying scene of the frozen icy world appeared above the Immortal Boat's secret repository.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the image above with a slight frown: "I understand the meaning of 'ice crystal' now. But what is the meaning of 'immortal amber'?"</p><p></p><p>It was Jiandaosheng who explained the doubt in Li Fan's mind: "If it was merely a frozen world, the Xuanshang Immortal Boat would not have regarded it as such a precious treasure. In fact, although the probability of the Brilliant Crystal Wind occurring was small, given the vast expanse of the starry sea and the accumulation over millions of years..."</p><p></p><p>"The number of existing frozen world sculptures was not particularly low."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the one the Immortal Boat had back then was so valuable was because within that frozen cultivation world, there was an extremely special existence," Jiandaosheng's tone was pensive, as if he had returned to the past.</p><p></p><p>"The Brilliant Crystal Wind swept down from the starry void. The world should have instantly turned into an ice sculpture. However, in that world, a illusory figure appeared, attempting to block the icy wind..."</p><p></p><p>"But how could a mortal cultivator possibly block a starry sea anomaly? It was said that even True Immortals had to retreat when the starry sea anomaly erupted at its most ferocious. Not to mention us mortal cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"So the result was obvious. The act of trying to save the world was simply an insignificant struggle doomed to fail. But, having resisted for that brief moment... the world was no longer frozen in an instant, but rather..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It gave those living beings just a split second to react."</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng said with a sigh: "It is this instantaneous change that created an ice sculpture completely different from all others. Facing the apocalyptic calamity, the expressions of the living beings varied. Some were terrified, some were in despair, some saw that shadowy figure and had a glimmer of hope, some were in disbelief...it truly interpreted the phrase 'myriad states of beings.'"  </p><p></p><p>"If it were just this, at most it would only be a rare frozen world. It would not deserve our Celestial Boat calling it the 'Celestial Amber.'"</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng continued: "The reason we use the celestial name is because of that illusory figure trying to block the dazzling crystal wind."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help guessing: "Don't tell me, in that frozen world, there is truly an immortal sealed inside?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng shook his head: "That's not the case. If there was a true immortal sealed inside, our Celestial Boat probably wouldn't dare keep it on board. But just looking at its value, that shadowy figure may be even more precious than a true immortal. After all, before the path to immortality was severed, there were people from various realms who ascended to immortality."</p><p></p><p>"However, a manifested demonic mind is truly something unheard of and rarely seen in all ages!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly: "Demonic mind? Manifested?"</p><p></p><p>In his previous life when he possessed Zhao Xian's body for cultivation, Li Fan had experienced the harassment of the demonic mind in the heart of the stars. As long as one's cultivation did not stop, the demonic mind would accompany the entire cultivation journey, incessantly. Even if suppressed by external force, it would soon return, growing more and more intense. Zhao Xian's previous life was affected in his cultivation progress because he could not get rid of the interference from the demonic mind. This was why the impatient Li Fan directly took over his body using the Dao Pill technique.</p><p></p><p>And that was just the demonic mind under the broken laws of the stars.</p><p></p><p>Even though its power was reduced several times, it could still have such a great impact on cultivators. One can imagine how terrifying the demonic mind must have been when the ancient laws of the stars were intact.</p><p></p><p>No wonder ancient cultivators talked about the demonic mind changing colors and everyone avoided it at all costs.</p><p></p><p>However, what Li Fan experienced through Zhao Xian's body was merely the illusions erupting from within. He had never seen the true source that triggered those illusions.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic mind should be some kind of law. But it can actually manifest a physical form?" Li Fan looked astonished and in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"This is precisely why the Celestial Amber is so precious. If one hadn't seen it with their own eyes, who could imagine that such a wondrous thing could exist in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"After we collected this Celestial Amber back then, there were decades of discussions on our Celestial Boat before we finally confirmed the identity of that illusory figure in the frozen world as the demonic mind. We speculated that this demonic mind was derived from the demonic mind law of another cultivation realm. But we don't know why it left its original world and suffered this calamity of nihility."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong suddenly spoke up: "Actually, the Celestial Boat had reasonable guesses about this. The demonic mind is formless and unrestricted by space - it can freely roam the starry seas. Unencumbered by a physical form, it can even appear directly in a cultivator's mind. There are cultivators who were influenced by the demonic mind, their minds became muddled, as if they had become different people. The invasion of the demonic mind can be seen as the most supreme form of possession."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, judging from the power it displayed when the world was frozen, this manifested demonic mind has the ability to encroach upon not just cultivators, but even the consciousness of a world's Heavenly Dao. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to call it a Heavenly Demon."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong spoke eloquently, his words containing regret over losing such a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's mind was slightly stirred. </p><p></p><p>His mind conjured the scene from his previous life, where under the apocalyptic storm of the Celestial Formation, the Dharma Body's shell gradually dissolved, revealing a transparent figure within.</p><p></p><p>The moment Li Fan saw this transparent figure, a faint sense of familiarity welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was not that Li Fan had seen this transparent figure before.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he had come into contact with the aura of its "kind".</p><p></p><p>The familiarity came from Tian Xue, Tian Yu, Tian Yin, Tian Yi.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps...</p><p></p><p>From the Celestial Dharma Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Demon..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan might have realized the reason why the Dharma Body infiltrated this place back then.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Demon is also a venerable one from the Celestial Dharma Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The venerables of the Celestial Dharma Realm represent the Heavenly Dao. And the Heavenly Demon is a manifestation of the demonic mind."</p><p></p><p>"However, due to its innate nature, the Heavenly Demon roams the starry seas and is rarely in the Celestial Dharma Realm. It may have even encountered an extremely rare stellar phenomenon by chance and suffered the calamity of eternal freezing."</p><p></p><p>"If the Dharma Body hadn't intervened to rescue it later, it might have remained frozen forever, becoming just an object for the Celestial Boat to appreciate."</p><p></p><p>"But why did the Dharma Body rescue the Heavenly Demon, only to be encroached upon by it later?"</p><p></p><p>The image of Tian Yi appeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>From their interactions in the previous life, it was evident that the Dharma Body was under Tian Yi's control.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan had guessed that the Dharma Body was an avatar created by Tian Yi.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed their relationship might not be that simple.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Body, Xuanquan Gouzhi. Or perhaps the reincarnation of the Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>"In the first half of his life, he was just an ordinary person. Then he suddenly awakened, as if some consciousness had crossed over and possessed his body," Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I now understand why the Dharma Body was controlled by Tian Yi - the Heavenly Demon within his soul was the cause."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also thought about how there was no concept of a demonic mind in the current Xuanhuang Realm.  </p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was not solely due to the Dharma Body's new laws.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of the Heavenly Demon, this manifested demonic mind, naturally there would be no more minor demonic minds descending to interfere.</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts churned, after listening to the senior cultivators of the Celestial Boat, Li Fan could not help but admire: "If that's the case, it was indeed an extraordinary treasure. For it to be stolen like that is truly lamentable."</p><p></p><p>"What did the thief look like? Is he still alive now?"</p><p></p><p>"If we have enough information, our Great Formation may be able to help track down this thief," Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong raised his brows: "The Immortal Seal Script?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head: "No. It's a celestial apparatus that protects the realm, integrating the power of formations. In any case, it's quite profound, so I cannot explain in detail."</p><p></p><p>Although he was vague, the manifestation power he had displayed earlier was enough to prove the profound foundations of the Great Formation civilization. So when Li Fan said this, it did not arouse any suspicion from the Celestial Boat cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Fan did not make any promises, only saying "perhaps".</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, in order to avoid arousing Li Fan's suspicion, the senior cultivators of the Celestial Boat showed him the appearance of the thief from back then.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed the Dharma Body Monarch.</p><p></p><p>However, the record image left by the Celestial Boat showed slight differences from the Dharma Body that Li Fan had seen in his previous life.</p>

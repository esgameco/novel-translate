        <h1>Chapter 577</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Should be cautious."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Han Yi felt that what he heard was false and what he saw was real. Since he had encountered setbacks everywhere in Yuandao Prefecture, he decided to go back to Congyunhai, inspect the situation, and then make a decision.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Han Yi, who had come to Yuandao Prefecture with enthusiasm, returned to his old place after hearing some news by chance.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to Congyunhai, he found that the enthusiasm among the cultivators discussing the "Lord's Secret Envoy Fundraising" plan far exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Although not everyone blindly believed, there were still a considerable number of loyal supporters of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Believers and non-believers looked at each other as fools, all wanting to persuade the other side.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of continuous debate, the topic only grew hotter.</p><p></p><p>This once again attracted a large wave of cultivators who had originally chosen to watch from the sidelines to join in.</p><p></p><p>Watching this bustling scene as if on a boiling oil, Han Yi suddenly felt a chill in his heart for no apparent reason.</p><p></p><p>Yet, before he could delve deeply into the source of his unease, a piece of news swept through the entire Wanxian Alliance in an instant. While many cultivators breathed a sigh of relief, the discussion intensity of Li Fan's fundraising plan reached its peak for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association were about to cease fire.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's, Master Li's prediction had once again come true!</p><p></p><p>Since Li Fan spread this matter, there had been continuous attempts by people to inquire about the authenticity of the news, and there was a surge of public opinion. But there was still no exact result.</p><p></p><p>Until today, the prophecy was fulfilled again!</p><p></p><p>Although discerning people could see that there seemed to be an official flavor from the Wanxian Alliance in all this, it did not prevent Li Fan's already legendary inference skills from reaching a new peak.</p><p></p><p>Many who had previously believed without doubt that this large-scale fundraising plan was a scheme for Li Fan's final profiteering and escape began to waver.</p><p></p><p>And those cultivators who had initially chosen to wait and see also chose to join the fundraising ranks in the face of this ironclad fact.</p><p></p><p>Following the trend is a human instinct.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was still hesitating due to the unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, a rumor suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>It said that due to the excessive enthusiasm of the cultivators, the contributions raised exceeded the original plan. It was very likely that the initial "no upper limit" fundraising would be terminated in advance.</p><p></p><p>Although the representative of the Lord's Envoy, He Zhenghao, stepped forward at the first time to refute the rumors with a righteous tone, he couldn't change the fact that the efficiency of collecting contributions was getting slower.</p><p></p><p>This seemed to confirm the authenticity of the "rumors." </p><p></p><p>As a result, the cultivators became even more eager.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Yi could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the intense atmosphere, he impulsively handed over all his remaining 910,000 contributions.</p><p></p><p>When he was cleared by the cold sea breeze and came back to his senses, he regretted it a bit.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, I should have kept some for myself."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi regretted.</p><p></p><p>However, it was too late for regrets. Both sides had signed the contract, and once the contributions were submitted, they could not be withdrawn during the five-year closed period.</p><p></p><p>If there were vital matters requiring contributions urgently, a penalty of thirty percent of the principal as a breach fee would be required.</p><p></p><p>And the high interest rate could no longer be redeemed.</p><p></p><p>The loss was too great, and almost no cultivator would choose to do so unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>According to He Zhenghao, these stringent regulations were also to prevent malicious acts by evildoers. Li Fan's high-profile collection of contributions had raised a large sum, attracting envy from certain individuals who were using various means to tarnish Li Fan's reputation and then try to take a piece of the cake.</p><p></p><p>"With so many cultivators participating, and Li Fan being the highest ruler in Congyunhai at the moment, there should be no problem." Han Yi felt a sense of desolation in his heart that persisted for a long time, pondered for a while, but could not find the source of the problem. He could only console himself in this way.</p><p></p><p>Now penniless again, Han Yi felt lost for a while. Not knowing where to go, he wandered aimlessly in Congyunhai.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period, Han Yi suddenly woke up.</p><p></p><p>He quickly surveyed the environment around him and felt like he had been to this place before.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling..."</p><p></p><p>"Strange, I'm sure this is my first time here." A solemn expression briefly flashed in Han Yi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But practicing the "Tianyun Scripture" gave him a keen spiritual sense, so he did not dismiss the sense of déjà vu.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his gaze settled in a certain part of the sky.</p><p></p><p>Every being in the world has its own fate.</p><p></p><p>But in Han Yi's vision at this moment, the originally empty area showed a distorted anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"What is hidden here!" Han Yi suddenly felt excited.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that his luck had come, Han Yi, who had discovered a certain opportunity, first checked whether there were other cultivators around without giving away any emotions.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that there was only himself here, he carefully flew up to the sky and observed the unusual space closely.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed something is amiss!"</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Han Yi confirmed his suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Then, despite his attempts, he could not find a way to enter this hidden space.</p><p></p><p>The longer he stayed here, the greater the likelihood of being discovered by other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>How could such a significant opportunity be shared with others?</p><p></p><p>Thus, Han Yi gradually grew impatient.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another vague image flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking about where this inspiration came from, he squinted his eyes and imitated the actions of the cultivator in the image.</p><p></p><p>He first stretched a section, then accelerated to the extreme, and suddenly rushed towards the twisted snowy area in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A black light flashed on his body.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Han Yi saw two entities standing quietly in the space.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Broken Blade.</p><p></p><p>His eyes instantly turned bloodshot, and his brain was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was nearly out of control, about to rush towards the soul of the world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the bird feather in his dantian reached out again to save him.</p><p></p><p>The faint light enveloped Han Yi, temporarily restoring a bit of his sanity.</p><p></p><p>With a resolute look in his eyes, he turned his head away from the strange scene of Qingfeng and the Broken Blade in space.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he fully exerted his cultivation and fled to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, Han Yi broke away from that eerie space.</p><p></p><p>Continuous spitting out blood from his mouth, the feather of the bird in his dantian was severely damaged, and its feathers shrunk, looking limp.</p><p></p><p></p>

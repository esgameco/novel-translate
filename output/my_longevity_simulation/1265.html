        <h1>Chapter 1265</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The secrets of the Underworld were closely guarded by the Immortal Alliance, and even this Immortal Alliance envoy only knew very little about other information. .‚Ä¢‚ô´‚Ä¢‚ô¨‚Ä¢ Ôºñ‚ûà≈úÔΩàœÖùîÅ.‚ÑÇœåùìú ‚Ä¢‚ô¨‚Ä¢‚ô´‚Ä¢.</p><p></p><p>In order to avoid alerting the enemy, Li Ping did not make any further moves on him. </p><p></p><p>When the Immortal Alliance envoy named Jia Su gradually woke up, he had no idea that the secrets in his mind had already been thoroughly read by the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He even praised, "The divine technique from the Sect Leader is indeed extraordinary. Even as I read it, I unknowingly entered a state of self-transcendence."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping chuckled, "It would be great if it can be useful to the Immortal Alliance. However, can we negotiate the proportion of Source Power that needs to be submitted each year?"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the Immortal Alliance envoy's expression changed slightly. He said earnestly, "Sect Leader, everything can be discussed. But the matters of the Immortal Alliance cannot be taken lightly."</p><p></p><p>The envoy hesitated for a moment and lowered his voice, "To be honest with you, the higher-ups originally planned to collect even more this time..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Ping's extremely displeased expression, as if he could erupt at any moment, the envoy quickly reassured, "But Sect Leader, you have made contributions now, right? I'll try to talk to them and see if we can reduce some..."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Ping to react, the Immortal Alliance envoy hurriedly bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>The anger on the Holy Emperor's face slowly disappeared, replaced by incomparable calmness. </p><p></p><p>Leaving behind the puppet to continue guarding the disciples of the Lingyuan Sect, Li Ping returned to the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The profound technique he passed on to the Immortal Alliance was indeed a superior method to better develop the Source Power within cultivators, and he did not leave any tricks behind.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Dark Sea involved, the Immortal Alliance would definitely treat it cautiously and repeatedly verify it.</p><p></p><p>The reason Li Ping imparted this technique to the Immortal Alliance was because as its creator, he could roughly sense the corresponding locations of the cultivators practicing this technique. He could even perceive the Source Power these cultivators cultivated under the augmentation of this technique.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sea was endlessly pitch-black, engulfing everything. Even the Underworld race only moved within the areas they were familiar with.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, some means were needed to find the "Piercing Lance" the Immortal Alliance inserted into the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, it would still take some time for this technique to be widely promoted.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping first continued the previously unfinished plan of using the puppet body to comprehend the Dao outside the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>After the final refinements over the past few days, the puppet body had fully met the Holy Emperor's requirements. </p><p></p><p>Every time his consciousness descended upon it, the instinctive impulse to switch bodies would involuntarily surge, growing stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Ping also reduced the frequency of testing this puppet body.</p><p></p><p>The large amount of Void Crystals collected in the Hongze Realm was also enough for him to break free from the attraction of the Immortal Ruins and successfully fly out of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Without telling anyone, under the cover of the formation and the aura of Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao, the rainbow light silently flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it arrived at the edge of the world.</p><p></p><p>After losing the protection of Xuanhuang, the immense attraction from the Immortal Ruins made Li Ping's expression change slightly.</p><p></p><p>Knowing about the existence of a True Immortal's power and personally experiencing it were completely different matters.</p><p></p><p>Only when truly facing this vast and mighty power of a True Immortal would one understand one's own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>Even he, the Holy Emperor, who was currently one of the top existences in terms of strength in the Xuanhuang Realm, felt the same.</p><p></p><p>"The path is long and arduous."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor sighed inwardly and successively released rainbow lights to counteract the attraction of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The brilliance of the Xuanhuang Realm gradually dimmed, leaving only darkness all around.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the darkness of the Dark Sea, the Starry Sea was utterly dead and silent.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>Although there seemed to be nothing ahead, the Holy Emperor instinctively sensed that danger seemed to be waiting for him there.</p><p></p><p>So he decisively made a turn and bypassed that area.</p><p></p><p>On the subsequent journey, whenever there were any rampaging remnants of immortal power in the Dark Sea that could pose a threat to him, he could foresee it and avoid it in advance, as if it wasn't his first time setting foot in this Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's puppet body narrowed its eyes and continued to venture deeper into the Dark Sea, following the mysterious feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had already sensed that the upper limit of the laws in the Starry Sea was higher than that in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But his destination was not at the foot of the high wall mentioned in the sword light message.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was the place in this Dark Starry Sea where new upper-limit laws were being nurtured.</p><p></p><p>There, the efficiency of comprehending the Dao would be the highest.</p><p></p><p>The rainbow light shuttled rapidly as if the concept of time had ceased to exist.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor gradually broke free from the guidance of the premonition in his heart and changed his direction of advancement, following the inexplicably surging mysterious rhythm in the silent Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was like being in a real ocean and finding the intense currents beneath the calm surface.</p><p></p><p>The speed suddenly skyrocketed, traversing millions of miles in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding immense forces tore at him, and even the protective rainbow light shattered under the pull of this unknown mighty power.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping focused single-mindedly, disregarding the danger of his body being destroyed, and quietly comprehended the mysterious changes around him that he had never witnessed in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Destruction and rebirth."</p><p></p><p>"The people in the Xuanhuang Realm see this silent starry sky as the Dark Sea. But unknowingly, vitality is also slowly reviving within it."</p><p></p><p>"However, it is currently still in the most primordial stage. Moreover, the entire process is too slow, and it is destined to be extremely difficult to perceive from the perspective of [humans]."</p><p></p><p>"This has nothing to do with comprehension. It is purely the inevitable difference that arises between different life forms at different scales..."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>A peculiar rhythm slowly awakened on the Holy Emperor's puppet body.</p><p></p><p>That's right, this time the Holy Emperor secretly sent the puppet body out of the Xuanhuang Realm to comprehend the Dao without letting anyone in the Holy Dynasty know.</p><p></p><p>But how could it be hidden from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>At Its insistence, with the determination of no return, a strand of consciousness was split and attached to the puppet body.</p><p></p><p>It left Xuanhuang together and arrived in the depths of the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was different from that of several years ago.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao also came to "learn the Dao"!</p><p></p><p>Before the Dark Starry Sea was destroyed, the upper limit of its laws was about to surpass that of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Although the Xuanhuang Realm had survived until now, its own strength had not been elevated over the long period of time.</p><p></p><p>Considering that it had devoured many remnants of immortal realms, although they were occupied by cultivators, the overall strength had still slightly increased compared to before.</p><p></p><p>The newly born Dao laws being nurtured in the Dark Starry Sea were naturally a level higher than those in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course...</p><p></p><p>For the Xuanhuang Realm, observing these newborn entities in the Dark Starry Sea was also a great opportunity for It.</p><p></p><p>Previously, firstly, there was no trustworthy cultivator candidate to possess, and secondly, there was no way to break free from the attraction of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>So even though the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao had this intention,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was also impossible to implement concretely.</p><p></p><p>But this time, with the existence of the Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor, everything became different.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also completely handed over the control of the puppet body to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>He himself was just an observer, feeling and comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Just this simple point alone would be almost impossible for any other cultivator in the Xuanhuang Realm to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Like a child who hasn't been out for a long time, seeing the amazing scenery.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping felt joy, excitement, and thrill from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao...</p><p></p><p>As well as the increasingly bright Abyssal Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>To say it was bright might be a bit of an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>It was just the occasional appearance of a few glimmers of light.</p><p></p><p>The puppet body seemed to disappear, and the perspective suddenly zoomed in and out countless times.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the entire Abyssal Starry Sea, not the "center" in terms of space, but the center in terms of life, appeared before Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Like a slightly beating heart, although weak, it undoubtedly represented life, hope, and the future.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and Li Ping arrived at the foot of the heart.</p><p></p><p>Greedily seizing and absorbing the revitalizing power of the starry sea that radiated outward due to the beating.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless scenes flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>There was the destruction of worlds and the floating and sinking of starry seas.</p><p></p><p>There was the prosperity of living beings, receiving the response of heaven.</p><p></p><p>There were also terrifying shadows like ferocious beasts, secretly peering like black mist, ready to pounce at any time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In these countless complex changes and constants, the Abyssal Starry Sea after the destruction still tried to burst forth with vitality in a stable and persistent manner.</p><p></p><p>This was naturally the dao of the origin of this starry sea, but it was also a persistence that could bring people to tears.</p><p></p><p>Because it could not bear the vast and pure dao meaning of the starry sea's origin, the puppet body began to disintegrate bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's consciousness and Holy Emperor Li Ping had no worries or fears in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the entire Abyssal Starry Sea, what do the calamities suffered by the Xuanhuang Realm count for?"</p><p></p><p>"If the starry sea can revive from destruction, the Xuanhuang Realm will surely be able to do the same."</p><p></p><p>The two took the last opportunity to remember more insights as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also knew that the dao meaning of the Abyssal Starry Sea's origin was not something he could peek into at present.</p><p></p><p>The so-called insights at present were actually more like a blind man touching an elephant.</p><p></p><p>Everything he saw and comprehended was just the bit he wanted to see and could feel.</p><p></p><p>But even so, this part, which was insignificant to the entire starry sea, was of great significance to them.</p><p></p><p>Just at the moment when the puppet body was about to completely collapse and disappear.</p><p></p><p>A thread of attention was cast down.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, the fragile puppet body was not enough to withstand this vast and incomparable power.</p><p></p><p>It was annihilated in the vast power.</p><p></p><p>However, before the consciousness disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping, with the help of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, saw a fleeting and blurry image.</p><p></p><p>It appeared and disappeared so quickly that Li Ping couldn't even be sure if it was his illusion.</p><p></p><p>The immortal dao collapsed, the starry sea was destroyed, and disasters spread.</p><p></p><p>There was a figure whose face and details could not be seen clearly, becoming fainter and fainter.</p><p></p><p>Completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only his laughter echoed for a long time in this starry sea where calamities were about to spread.</p><p></p><p>"What does it have to do with me..."</p><p></p><p>"What does it have to do with me..."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor suddenly returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>He let out a groan and spat out a mouthful of golden blood.</p><p></p><p>The sleeping cat baby suddenly raised its head and flew at the speed of light to the side of the still floating blood.</p><p></p><p>It directly devoured the blood into its belly.</p><p></p><p>"Meow! Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, as if afraid of Li Ping's reprimand, the cat baby called out a few times in a flattering manner.</p><p></p><p>Circulating the golden origin power to slowly repair the internal injuries, Li Ping did not bicker with the cat baby.</p><p></p><p>All his thoughts in his mind were focused on the image just now.</p><p></p><p>"That figure..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's heart was filled with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>The existence only stayed in his mind for a little while, but it made the Holy Emperor's heart secretly surge with a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>He was immediately shocked and slowly forced himself not to think about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>But soon the Holy Emperor found that he was overthinking.</p><p></p><p>Because even if he didn't control himself to forget, the memory of that figure was also uncontrollably fading away slowly.</p><p></p><p>"This situation..."</p><p></p><p>"Although not yet at the legendary realm of the 'Nameless True Immortal', it seems to be only one step away."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor carefully savored the meaning that the newly born starry sea wanted to convey in that instant.</p><p></p><p>"If I guessed correctly, the main culprit causing the many disasters in the starry sea is most likely this person..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor frowned slightly, trying to capture the memory that was about to disappear from his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the end, a lot of details slowly faded away.</p><p></p><p>What remained were only the four characters "What does it have to do with me".</p><p></p><p>"He Gan Immortal." The Holy Emperor's expression was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Emperor's seat, Li Ping sat for a long time in silence.</p><p></p><p>The cat baby also seemed to have noticed something, lowering its body and looking around with its head, showing a hunting state.</p><p></p><p>As if looking for the existence that Li Ping was extremely wary of.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, it found nothing.</p><p></p><p>The cat baby became lazy again and fell asleep on Li Ping's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor began to digest the gains from this trip to the depths of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Not only him.</p><p></p><p>Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, because of this long journey, began to change in a way that had not happened for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Like the newly born Abyssal Starry Sea, it moistened things silently and was not yet known to people.</p><p></p><p>But it was indeed happening.</p><p></p><p>There were only a few people in the world who could perceive it.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet, who was chatting with someone in a teahouse in the Holy Capital, had a slight change in expression and looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>In the space of Jian Renshou, Ruomu, who was pruning his withered branches, stared at the new buds sprouting from the withered branches in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand miles underground, the ancient tree of the earth veins felt that the rushing power from the Xuanhuang Realm suddenly became more surging for no reason, as if something was brewing, making it both expectant and fearful.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A thousand sails pass by the side of the sunken boat, ten thousand trees bloom in front of the sick tree."</p><p></p><p>In the space of Yan Faju, these two lines of poetry suddenly welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that borrowing the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao to comprehend in the starry sea can gain the greatest insight."</p><p></p><p>"This is because the perspective of man and the perspective of heaven and earth are different."</p><p></p><p>"Just like back then, I used the Canghaizhou to understand the 'Formless Killing Intent'."</p><p></p><p>"Creating the Holy Emperor's avatar in this world to help the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was really a blessing in disguise."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Although the resonance between him and the Holy Emperor was very weak now.</p><p></p><p>But because the impact of the starry sea's origin dao meaning was too great, he also understood some of the Holy Emperor and Xuanhuang Realm Heavenly Dao's comprehensions.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was that he had grasped the method.</p>

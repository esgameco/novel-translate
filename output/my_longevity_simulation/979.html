        <h1>Chapter 979</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At present, the greatest resource Li Fan possessed, apart from the experiences, strength, and knowledge brought by the repeated reincarnations of [Huan Zhen], was the countless mortals existing in that small world. Under the day and night transformation of the [Heavenly Earth Furnace], all these mortals were potential future cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were cultivators who could be used by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was only one step away from creating a true alliance of myriad worlds. The only obstacle was the scarcity of cultivation techniques caused by the incompatibility of practicing multiple laws simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Before luring Yan Fa Jue into his hands, Li Fan had already thought of a temporary alternative solution.</p><p></p><p>That was the [Cangshen Lingyuan Technique] of the former Lingyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The more people cultivating simultaneously, the faster the cultivation speed of this technique. It was enough to offset the negative effects brought by the incompatibility of practicing multiple laws.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the Dharma Heavenly Venerate's Dharma image descended upon Jiushan Prefecture, it flattened the Nine Mountains with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect headquarters was destroyed as a result.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still Lingyuan Sect disciples in the world who knew the [Cangshen Lingyuan Technique].</p><p></p><p>Because the number of cultivators practicing the Lingyuan Technique had sharply decreased, the amplifying effect of the technique could not offset the negative impact of practicing incompatible laws. Therefore, these people had all changed their cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Hongchen Cibei True Immortal had also spent quite some effort to find out the information of one of these hidden sect members.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Qing's avatar had quietly gone to bring this person back to the Lingmu Realm for interrogation.</p><p></p><p>"Even if ordinary people can't last long in the Blood River, if there are small world cultivators continuously sacrificing their lives to fill it..."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the hidden history can be fully restored."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged as his gaze fell upon the Book of Genesis once again.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if I want them to risk their lives for me, simple oppression definitely won't work. I still need to entice them with benefits..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan formed hand seals and reconstructed the protective formation covering this mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>Previously, because the supreme treasure Fishing Pool couldn't be moved at all, Li Fan had only set up a simple formation here.</p><p></p><p>Although the Book of Genesis similarly hid itself spontaneously, its status was ultimately one level lower than the Fishing Pool.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it couldn't be ruled out that if discovered, it might be forcibly relocated by some old monsters in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who already considered it his own, naturally wouldn't allow such a thing to happen.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Ultimate Separation Disc emitted a faint white light, iterating to the latest formation set up by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Without new formation data input, the evolution speed of the Separation Disc has reached a bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>"Either there are brand new formations, or we wait for news from Mo Rubin's side and the nine Separation Discs of this world."</p><p></p><p>As the resources stored in the grotto-heaven were slowly consumed, the highest-level formations that this Ultimate Separation Disc could currently derive also gradually descended upon the world.</p><p></p><p>The formation level surpassed the current Xuanhuang Realm by two whole generations. Compared with it, the protective grand formation of the Wanxian Alliance was as crude as a child's toy construction.</p><p></p><p>"This formation can be named the [Ultimate Taixu Formation]." Li Fan took a deep breath after completing the formation.</p><p></p><p>Ultimate, as the name implies, had pushed the way of formations to the very end.</p><p></p><p>Taixu represented the nature of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Unified Dao cultivator came to carefully investigate, they might not necessarily detect any clues.</p><p></p><p>A Changsheng realm powerhouse merely sweeping over with their divine sense would not</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If carefully examined, the result would probably be the same.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the concealment function, the Taowu Array also possesses basic functions such as protection and counterattack. However, compared to its concealment ability, these are slightly inferior, so there's no need to elaborate further.</p><p></p><p>"All compassionate immortal believers in the mortal world can directly face the long river of time. If they bring back a fragment of time from within, they can receive the blessing of a true immortal..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan had already fabricated the statement in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the celestial furnaces of the Empire and the Separated Realm have been set up, we can try to initiate this plan soon."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, those who work with their minds rule over people, while those who labor with their strength are ruled by others. With a better and more efficient method, Li Fan naturally wouldn't risk himself in the blood-colored river. Dispatching cultivators from myriad realms to risk their lives for him was the proper way.</p><p></p><p>"Restoring the lost history in the blood-colored river. This is called 【Mending the Heavens】."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was quite pleased with himself for coming up with such a domineering-sounding name.</p><p></p><p>Even with the protection of the peerless Mending the Heavens array, Li Fan was not at ease.</p><p></p><p>He summoned Tian Yang and ordered him to keep watch here before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before departing, he didn't forget to warn Tian Yang not to attempt to observe that blood-colored river.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps only Tian Yang wouldn't become curious and insist on courting death by trying it out.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang just sat quietly on the ground, blankly guarding the Book of Genesis.</p><p></p><p>He had no interest in the treasure that recorded the entire history of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm, the newly arrived Zhong Shentong and Daotong Liuli were already shocked by the magnificent sight of the headquarters of the Myriad Realms United Association.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling, who hadn't returned for a long time, was also very surprised by the changes in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>When the female chief of the Treemen tribe, Lin Xin, appeared before her in human form, Lin Ling's expression was even more shocked, and a complex look flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>None of these subtle changes escaped the eyes of Li Fan, who was one with the heaven and earth spirit of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"As I thought, this little one has indeed developed some other thoughts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't quite appropriate to call it a rebellion, it was just that she had thoughts of unwillingness to submit to Li Fan in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, when she was enlightened by Li Fan and willingly acknowledged him as her master, her mind had just awakened and she was in a daze. She didn't have a clear understanding of the world.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan's strength was much weaker than hers, yet she still sincerely submitted.</p><p></p><p>However, over the years, she had been constantly communicating with the ancient trees of the earth veins, and her mind had grown rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan had not displayed his true strength in front of her. In her eyes, Li Fan was just a slightly stronger Yuan Ying realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Having some selfish thoughts was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long noticed this, which was why he didn't immediately go to her when he received her message before.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't care what Lin Ling thought.</p><p></p><p>As long as she didn't commit any acts of betrayal and still loyally carried out Li Fan's orders, everything could be discussed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered in his heart, his figure flashed, and he arrived at the central underground secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't interrogated it out yet?"</p><p></p><p>Clone Li Qing's face was a bit solemn: "I did interrogate, but it's a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>"This 【Cangshengling Yuan Gong】, I simply can't cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that it has no effect, but I can't even get started," Clone Li Qing emphasized.</p>

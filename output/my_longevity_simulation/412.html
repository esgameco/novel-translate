            <p>"Being placed in the center of the Museum's divine repository, this skull is definitely extraordinary. New 𝟔𝟗 book, 𝟨𝟫ⓢⓗⓤⓧ.ⓒⓞⓜ, quickly digest its residual thoughts, surely being able to uncover the hidden secrets within!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and act!"</p><p></p><p>"Take it and go, no one can stop you!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the increasingly urgent prompts, thoughts emerged one after another in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Whispers continually murmured in his ears, tempting Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>At one moment, Li Fan was truly on the verge of being swayed, almost ready to act.</p><p></p><p>However, he ultimately suppressed this impulse with strong willpower.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the scene when he absorbed the eternal residual thoughts of Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he felt the surrounding space becoming somewhat illusory.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Tianyang's bones disintegrated into sparkling white light, gradually being absorbed by him.</p><p></p><p>His mind was violently shaken, losing consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After seemingly experiencing Tianyang's long life firsthand, the prompt from "still true" finally came.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the absorption of the eternal residual thoughts was completed.</p><p></p><p>Based on past experiences, Li Fan quickly made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the eternal residual thoughts would surely cause a commotion. Not only would it lead to the disappearance of the residual vessel, but the white light representing the "eternal residual thoughts" would also accurately mark Li Fan as the instigator.</p><p></p><p>The absorption of eternal residual thoughts is not instant. It requires a certain amount of time. New 𝟔𝟗 book 𝟨𝟫🅂🄷🅄🅇.🄲🄾🄼</p><p></p><p>It also involves being impacted by the residual imprints of the owner during this process, possibly leading to temporary loss of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Realizing these points, Li Fan quickly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>The eternal residual thoughts of this skull should not be absorbed!</p><p></p><p>If done recklessly, forcibly absorbing it would be akin to seeking death!</p><p></p><p>Despite the skull appearing defenseless, in this place?</p><p></p><p>The headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals League.</p><p></p><p>Home to the divine treasures of the Museum's divine repository.</p><p></p><p>The most central area of the Museum's divine repository.</p><p></p><p>Would there be no hidden defensive measures here?</p><p></p><p>Absolutely absurd.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was certain that if he gave in to greed and foolishly absorbed the eternal residual thoughts, he would be subject to countless traps and restraints, subsequently being captured for research.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, there was indeed a slight chance that this skull had no protection.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wouldn't take the risk.</p><p></p><p>Because once failed, he would be beyond redemption.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the nature of the eternal residual thoughts, according to the hint from "still true."</p><p></p><p>After each restart, when Li Fan found the vessel of the eternal residual thoughts again, he could absorb it and reuse it. New 69 book → 69𝒔𝒉𝒖𝒙.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p><p></p><p>The essence of it, not much different from the Dao stone in the tomb of Yi Yin, was simply a reusable item.</p><p></p><p>What completely deterred Li Fan from absorbing these thoughts was the fact that the eternal residual thoughts could not be bound by "still true."</p><p></p><p>As a result, he wouldn't be able to take it back after adhering to "still true."</p><p></p><p>Risking it and trying to absorb the thoughts would be futile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After sorting out the known information and weighing it rationally, Li Fan should have completely abandoned the idea of absorbing the eternal residual thoughts here.</p><p></p><p>However, its attraction to "still true" was so strong.</p><p></p><p>The rational barriers he had constructed were utterly fragile.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Refining Plate spun frantically, and Li Fan tightly suppressed the constantly emerging desires.</p><p></p><p>He then asked the explainer, Bing Yin, to take him away from the skull and let him rest.</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin nodded understandingly and kindly helped Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>To disguise his abnormality and divert attention, Li Fan actively brought up the topic, "Senior Bing Yin, I heard you say just now that skull is designated by the Museum's chief to be placed in the central position?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this Museum's chief can also sense the residual thoughts contained within it," Li Fan silently pondered.</p><p></p><p>Casually, he inquired, "I wonder which senior in the Ten Thousand Immortals League is the Museum's chief? I've never heard of them before."</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin smiled, "It's normal for you not to know. The chief has always kept a low profile, rarely appearing. Even we explainers find it difficult to meet him."</p><p></p><p>"But in terms of seniority, in the current Ten Thousand Immortals League, there are probably not many who dare claim to be above the chief."</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan couldn't help but be curious.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his voice, Bing Yin said, "The chief has existed in the world since ancient times. That was during the distant and ancient era when humanity wasn't prosperous."</p><p></p><p>"He is almost omniscient, knowing everything and anything."</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin's admiration was evident.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan felt a sense of familiarity in his words.</p><p></p><p>"He is a symbol of longevity and wisdom. We address him as Emperor Sanxian." Bing Yin said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression turned somewhat odd, inwardly musing, "Emperor Sanxian... (貘)?"</p><p></p><p>However, Bing Yin didn't notice Li Fan's change and continued exalting the chief, emphasizing his knowledge and wisdom.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the resting room, Bing Yin still seemed to have more to say, but seeing Li Fan's worn-out condition, he tactfully stopped.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured and recuperate here."</p><p></p><p>"The Museum's divine repository is vast; one cannot explore it all in a short time."</p><p></p><p>"This place is specifically designed as a resting area for visitors, so you don’t have to worry about being disturbed."</p><p></p><p>After instructing Li Fan, Bing Yin watched as Li Fan gradually regained his composure, then left with his control card, assured of Li Fan's safety.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan manipulated the control card and activated the prohibition, completely sealing the resting room.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the secret chamber, the eerie skull vanished within his perception range, and his trembling body gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Feeling drained as if after a great battle, Li Fan felt utter exhaustion.</p><p></p><p>His already aging body was now even more worn out.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal residual thoughts..."</p><p></p><p>Quieting down, Li Fan contemplated the peculiar nature of "still true."</p><p></p><p>Humans feel hunger because they need to eat and replenish the necessary energy for survival.</p><p></p><p>The fact that "still true" also experiences the desire to eat implies that something useful for "still true" can be obtained from the eternal residual thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the skull in the divine repository, what could Tianyang's eternal residual thoughts provide for "still true"?</p><p></p><p>"Special: Eternal Residual Thoughts (Tianyang) (Usable once)"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the information on the "still true" interface and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Taking out materials from his storage ring, he set up a ritual for entering the Immortal Meteor Realm to confuse onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then consumed the final usage of the eternal residual thoughts, activating the mimic function of "still true."</p><p></p><p>After a dizzy spell,</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang, it's time to take your medicine..."</p><p></p><p>The voice of his Master, Guangyangzi, resonated in Li Fan's ears.</p>

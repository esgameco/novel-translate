        <h1>Chapter 692</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan suddenly remembered a story from the early days of the Daxuan dynasty. In the last days of the previous dynasty, Emperor Zhongxu was originally a rare revitalizing ruler. Since inheriting the throne at the age of sixteen, he executed corrupt officials, pacified bandits, promoted water conservation, and exempted taxes, sweeping away the decline of the dynasty, resembling the sages of ancient times. However, after more than twenty years, the country became peaceful and prosperous to the extreme. The people lived without worries, praising the wise ruler; the courtiers begged to bow down and submit, praising the emperor's virtues.</p><p></p><p>If he had continued in this way, perhaps there would not have been the subsequent events of the founding emperor of Daxuan changing the fate of the nation.</p><p></p><p>However, everything took a sharp turn when Emperor Zhongxu turned thirty-seven. The reason for this dramatic change was the death of his beloved Empress Duanmu due to illness.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the bad news, Emperor Zhongxu almost fainted on the spot. Later, due to excessive sorrow, he ignored state affairs for months. If this had been the only issue, with ministers present in the court, even if the emperor was absent, the Daxuan dynasty would not have fallen into chaos. However, perhaps due to the impending change in the dynastyâ€™s fortune, Emperor Zhongxu, when revisiting the place where he first met Empress Duanmu, saw a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Empress Duanmu.</p><p></p><p>Not only did she look eighty to ninety percent similar, even her demeanor and tone were identical to the person he dreamt of.</p><p></p><p>And she was even younger.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Zhongxu was shaken, believing it was predestined, and immediately brought her into the palace, bestowing upon her the title of noble concubine, entwining with her day and night.</p><p></p><p>In order to please her, Emperor Zhongxu did many absurd things: renovating palaces, building gardens in the palace, even constructing a small river connecting the imperial city to the outskirts for romantic encounters; he ordered his subordinates to collect rare items from the people for the concubine's amusement...</p><p></p><p>The chaos caused the people to be in distress and resentment. Any minister who dared to advise against it was either dismissed or beheaded.</p><p></p><p>Even so, relying on Emperor Zhongxu's accumulation in the first half of his life, the Daxuan dynasty did not suddenly perish.</p><p></p><p>But after the noble concubine gave birth to a son, Emperor Zhongxu, for some unknown reason, went against the opposition of all the court officials and intended to depose the crown prince. Seeing Emperor Zhongxu's firm stance, the crown prince naturally would not wait to die; he gathered followers for a rebellion, "to eliminate the demon concubine and cleanse the emperor's side." This rebellion, with support from many prominent families in the capital, including the Duanmu family.</p><p></p><p>After several days of fighting, although the rebellion ultimately failed, with the crown prince committing suicide, the Daxuan dynasty was severely damaged.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Zhongxu further isolated himself from the court, indulging in pleasure.</p><p></p><p>As the situation deteriorated, in the year when Emperor Zhongxu turned fifty-six, the imperial palace was breached by a rebellious army. Emperor Zhongxu and the noble concubine embraced each other and perished in flames.</p><p></p><p>In future generations, scholars found it perplexing how Emperor Zhongxu indulged in women to the point of causing the downfall of his country.</p><p></p><p>The reason was attributed to Emperor Zhongxu's love for Empress Duanmu reaching an unimaginable level. Therefore, upon encountering a woman resembling her after Duanmu's death, he completely lost his sanity, even became somewhat insane. Thus, he ruined the prosperous kingdom.</p><p></p><p>There is nothing truly new in the world. Similarly, if the clone Xu Bai was only favored due to resembling Mr. Bai, it could result in such favor from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Either Mr. Bai is a manifestation of fate, or he holds critical importance in the world of Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>To the extent that the heavens anticipate the emergence of the next "Mr. Bai" every moment. Even to the point where just having a similar appearance enhances one's affinity with the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai..." Memories related to this in the world of immortal cultivation flashed through Xu Bai's mind as he remained silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, as his thoughts settled, he retrieved the seventeen-petal spirit flower sealed with a special technique.</p><p></p><p>With narrowed eyes, after observing the various scenes on the petals, a feeling distinct from himself slowly emerged. It was as if looking down upon the entire Tianling Prefecture from the perspective of heaven and earth, swiftly passing through scenes of mountains, rivers, living beings, changing weather, prosperity, and decline.</p><p></p><p>Facing the spirit flower, it was as if he truly saw all that was happening in the Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>A hint of realization quietly passed through Xu Bai's heart. However, like snowflakes in water, it vanished in an instant, leaving him feeling lost.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling is like when I used the Canghai Pearl to observe the changes in the vast world from the perspective of heaven and earth, eventually comprehending the 'Inexhaustible Killing Intent.'"</p><p></p><p>"The magical techniques of cultivators largely originate from heaven and earth itself. Delving into it from the perspective of heaven and earth naturally becomes easier."</p><p></p><p>"However, it is ultimately just a flower that records the scenes of heaven and earth, not a true harmonization with it. Gaining insights from it is not easy; it requires a strong comprehension. Similar to before, even after I personally made it and carefully observed it many times, I still feel it's just an ornamental piece."</p><p></p><p>"But this is not a problem with the flower, it is a problem with people."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>After making slight adjustments to his plans in his mind, Xu Bai continued to contemplate the flower's enlightenment before returning.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianyu Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After wasting a lot of time, Li Fan and Dongfang Yao finally arrived in Tianyu City but did not go to the Universal Academy where Li Fan received formation training in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they entered a private room on the Dao Discussion Tower in the city.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I have informed Brother Huangfu, he will be here soon." Dongfang Yao sat cross-legged on the floor in a casual manner, tapping on the floor with his fingers, and before long, a cup of spirit tea emerged.</p><p></p><p>"You are so damn stingy." Dongfang Yao finished the spirit tea in one gulp and muttered under his breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a regular at the Dao Discussion Tower and knew that Dongfang Yao was relying on the free spirit tea given since he couldn't afford it.</p><p></p><p>Slightly smiling, he connected his divine sense with the control jade in the room.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a dark green teapot appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Dongfang." Li Fan gestured with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you're really generous!" Dongfang Yao immediately smiled and happily poured himself a cup, finishing it in one go.</p><p></p><p>"It's the best 'Thousand Cultivation Discussion' tea, Li Brother, you're generous! The last time I drank such high-grade tea was when I came back from the 'Thousand Pages Book Pavilion' and couldn't resist celebrating!" Dongfang Yao praised endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, eyes half-closed, seemingly pondering something.</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe you, Dongfang Yao, having such a good thing like the 'Thousand Cultivation Discussion,' and enjoying it alone behind my back!" At that moment, a familiar voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>A round-faced, seemingly amiable plump cultivator appeared in the room.</p><p></p><p>His face showed a hint of displeasure, but there was a smile at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at Li Fan without a trace of emotion, Huangfu Song remained calm and looked at Dongfang Yao.</p>

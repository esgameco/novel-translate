        <h1>Chapter 688</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"My ancestors, I don't even know which beast they originated from. I may lack other abilities, but this body of mine is exceptionally resilient to beatings," Dongfang Yao said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I'm not killed, I can recover in just a few breaths," he patted his chest, making a 'thud' sound.</p><p></p><p>"Benefiting from the legacy of my predecessors and a stroke of good luck. I can't help but envy you," Li Fan sighed, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like you are not far from breaking through to the Nascent Divinity realm, do you intend to ascend here?" after a while, Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, not at all. I'm here for two reasons: to refine my body and to comprehend the way of the 'Rift Realm'," Dongfang Yao explained confidently, "Although my defense is strong, I lack offensive capabilities. Once the fighting starts, I can only be a punching bag. How could that not be vexing? So, I found this place, which is extremely suitable for me to comprehend the way."</p><p></p><p>"The Rift Realm..." a barely perceptible light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Just heard you mention this term several times, is there any explanation for it?"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao shrugged, "I don't know the specifics. However, according to the memories inherited from my ancestors, I know there is an existence similar to a scar of the Xuanhuang realm here. It's more dangerous than ordinary spatial rifts."</p><p></p><p>"And..." he paused.</p><p></p><p>"Before coming here, I made some inquiries. According to legend, some cultivators in this vast vortex have occasionally witnessed a marvelous sight."</p><p></p><p>"A huge beam of light, gushing out from the center of the vortex, piercing the heavens and earth. It seemed as if the entire world was trembling slightly, with the colors of the sky changing."</p><p></p><p>"The magnificent scene only lasts for a few breaths before disappearing. The beam of light never truly appeared from the beginning to the end, leaving no trace behind, as if it were just an illusion. Some say it's a mirage of time. It's something that truly happened thousands of years ago in history, but I don't quite understand it."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao seemed to have no ulterior motives, as he disclosed all he knew to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I do have some knowledge about this 'Time Mirage'," Li Fan's gaze shifted slightly as he explained to Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>"When certain conditions are met, there will be phenomena recorded in this world that will reappear repeatedly at specific time points...‚Äù</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao suddenly realized, "So, it was that beam of light that tore the Xuanhuang realm, creating this vast vortex? Truly remarkable! If only I could comprehend its power..."</p><p></p><p>Speaking, a trace of excitement appeared on Dongfang Yao's face.</p><p></p><p>When the black crevice resurged, it roared into the center of the vortex.</p><p></p><p>"Southern Sacred Beast Mountain, Divine Weapons of the Rift Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then the former site of the Tianjian Sect should also have such a scar of the Xuanhuang realm. Perhaps I can ask Shuofeng about it since he found the location of the 'Sword' back then."</p><p></p><p>While Dongfang Yao comprehended the power of the Rift Realm, Li Fan was not just observing.</p><p></p><p>The intent to kill had long locked onto Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>Although his physical strength was not enough to charge into the center of the vortex like Dongfang Yao, Li Fan could still observe and comprehend the power of the black rift at close range through Dongfang Yao's perspective.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, it seems somewhat similar to the power generated when the Five Elements merge. No wonder there are also Time Mirage phenomena appearing here."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's original body was comprehending outside the vast vortex amidst the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>His clone had already arrived in the Tianlingzhou City.</p><p></p><p>With his peerless appearance, wherever Xu Bai went, it undoubtedly attracted others' attention.</p><p></p><p>However, he carried himself with an aloof demeanor and dressed in a manner that did not resemble ordinary people, clearly indicating his extraordinary background.</p><p></p><p>No cultivator dared to approach him recklessly.</p><p></p><p>He leisurely strolled through the Tianling City.</p><p></p><p>After a period of fermentation, the name of the Tianling Flower had become widely known throughout the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Originally a relatively niche interest, it was only spread among specific groups of people. But now, due to Li Fan offering longevity treasures as a reward and Shuofeng and Luxuejing sending people to inquire, disciples of various Medicine King sects dispersed across various regions, actively stirring up the situation.</p><p></p><p>With collective efforts, almost all but the most isolated information-sealed cultivators had heard of the Tianling Flower to some extent.</p><p></p><p>And after much public effort, people finally begrudgingly admitted to one fact.</p><p></p><p>That is...</p><p></p><p>The Tianling Flower was no longer in the world!</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders had fought bloody battles, resulting in numerous fallen cultivators. The entire province was tainted with unimaginable bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>Born from the essence of heaven and earth, the Tianling Flower naturally resonated with it. Now, the petals contained a subtle bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>"What a ghastly scene, it's a disgrace to civilization!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, what's the benefit in all this fighting? It's the cultivators who lose their lives in vain, causing the world to lose its former beauty. Peace is hard-won; fellow cultivators should cherish it and refrain from starting conflicts again!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Some lamented, some reflected.</p><p></p><p>But others seized the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"While the Tianling Flower may no longer exist in the world, the blood essence on my flower is minimal. It's almost invisible, little different from the original variety. If fellow cultivators are interested, you may come and see it for yourself."</p><p></p><p>With the increase in popularity, the value of the Tianling Flower continued to rise.</p><p></p><p>Some sharp cultivators took advantage of this hype, deliberately selecting those varieties with less blood color to sell.</p><p></p><p>After all, the original strains had become extinct, so observing a substitute could be considered a decent choice.</p><p></p><p>Although there weren't many cultivators willing to pay for it, the vast number of cultivators in the Wanxian Alliance compensated for it.</p><p></p><p>And with the fixed annual production of the Tianling Flower, especially the rarity of those with less blood essence, the selling price of the Tianling Flower kept soaring.</p><p></p><p>The once desolate Tianling City after the great war had completely livened up.</p><p></p><p>Some came to admire, others to take advantage and profit.</p><p></p><p>The merchants selling the Tianling Flower also came up with new ways to attract customers.</p><p></p><p>In their shops, they displayed Tianling Flowers that had not yet bloomed.</p><p></p><p>Customers could try their luck, betting on the amount of blood essence on the flower petals after they bloom.</p><p></p><p>If lucky enough to select one with very little blood essence, they could sell it for a considerable profit right there.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the majority would lose out.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, there was never a shortage of cultivators who believed in their own good luck, so these suspense-packed Tianling Flowers were sold quickly in the shops, being nearly snatched up as quickly as they were placed on display.</p><p></p><p>"Such luck..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled slightly amidst the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Without carefully selecting, he casually chose one.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, this one will do."</p>

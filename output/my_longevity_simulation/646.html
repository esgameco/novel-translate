        <h1>Chapter 646</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The body that was intertwined with crimson flames and dark red, in an instant, was flickering like a candle in the wind, constantly leaping.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan keenly noticed that the green threads seemed to be absorbing something, as the crimson flame's body was slowly shrinking and its momentum continuously diminishing.</p><p></p><p>Crimson fire wanted to struggle free, but like an insect caught in a spider's web, the more it struggled, the tighter the threads wound around it.</p><p></p><p>The green giant web firmly trapped the crimson fire.</p><p></p><p>That pitiful appearance, in stark contrast to Li Fan's memories of its previous strength even in the face of defeat, showed a spirit that could at least exhibit the essence of heaven and earth, forming a distinct comparison.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the essence of heaven and earth comes from the heavens and the earth. And the Profound Heaven Sealing Spirit Formation precisely takes the place of the heavens, severing its connection with the heavens and the earth. No wonder the performance of the crimson flame is so pitiful," Li Fan couldn't help but murmur as he witnessed the tragic scene of the crimson fire.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this formation can act as a suppressor against Mosha. If Mosha is still being cultivated, will the heavens and the earth continue to send down more powerful essences of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Just when everyone watching the battle in the sea of clouds thought the outcome was already determined.</p><p></p><p>A huge hand suddenly emerged from below the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the fingers all joined together, grasping Hong Xi and the crimson flame in its palm!</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang!" Li Fan almost instantly recognized the origin of this giant hand. </p><p></p><p>However, Tianyang's appearance this time did not come with his signature phrase "Tianyang's life is never inferior to anyone." Instead, he silently lurked beneath the two who were previously at a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Striking out from behind, he caught them off guard.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish!" Facing Tianyang's sneak attack, Hong Xi's expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>While cautiously maintaining the Profound Heaven Sealing Spirit Formation, he also employed the might of the heavy mountains, charging towards the five looming giant palms that resembled prisons around him.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>What caught Hong Xi off guard was that these palms, facing his attack, offered no resistance. They allowed the mountains he manifested to collide directly. In that instant of collision, the peaks, indistinguishable from real mountain ranges, seemed to encounter something a hundred times harder than themselves. They were crushed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Hong Xi's body trembled slightly, almost losing control of the tremendous force rebounding, under which the Profound Heaven Sealing Spirit Formation was almost compromised.</p><p></p><p>Within the formation, the crimson flame also sensed a turnaround, ceasing its struggles.</p><p></p><p>It only curled up, gathering strength, waiting for Hong Xi to reveal another flaw.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" Feeling a bit of a loss, Hong Xi, the fairy lord, cursed inwardly and opted to temporarily ignore Tianyang's giant hand. Instead, he made up his mind to fully operate the Profound Heaven Sealing Spirit Formation and refine the crimson flame.</p><p></p><p>But with the enhancement that Li Fan had made at any cost, and the increasingly clever Tianyang, it was evident that Hong Xi's plans might not go as smoothly as he hoped.</p><p></p><p>The fingers of the huge hand turned red in an instant, as if there were molten lava flowing gently within. Part of it even overflowed from the puppet's body, swirling and drawing something from nothing.</p><p></p><p>Like fire dragons dancing around, in a flash, a complete formation formed, trapping Hong Xi and the crimson flame within.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation!" A gleam flashed in Li Fan's eyes for an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Tianyang's transformation is quite apparent, no longer merely relying on brute force to fight but understanding the use of formations!"</p><p></p><p>"Hong Xi is too greedy, failing to dodge throughout the prolonged obvious formation setup. Unable to let go of the essence of heaven and earth that has been restrained."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's a matter of who outmaneuvers who between the two of them. Will Hong Xi be the first to drain and kill the crimson flame, stepping into the realm of harmony? Or will Tianyang succeed in consuming Hong Xi first, eventually becoming an immortal in harmony..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, watching with a mindset of enjoying the show, observed the standoff in the air among the three figures.</p><p></p><p>However, some cultivators in the Cloud City couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of heaven and earth belongs to the virtuous! Fellow Daoists, the opportunity to defy fate is right in front of us!"</p><p></p><p>Incited and instigated by the provocateurs, dozens or even hundreds of cultivators couldn't resist the temptation in their hearts, launching attacks on the three figures that were at a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>In hopes of becoming the lucky ones to benefit from the situation, paving their way to success in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan noticed that He Zhenghao was about to lose control and was already flying forward. But halfway, for some reason, he suddenly realized something and turned back.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait a little longer, just a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan heard him mutter softly.</p><p></p><p>Closed eyes and trembling body, all clearly indicating that he was currently repressing his desires to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly and shifted his gaze back to Tianyang and the others.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation had been pushed to its limits by Tianyang. Earth fire magma continuously erupted from the depths of the cloud sea, creating a spectacle of surging sea fire dragons. Li Fan knew that these were the effects of Tianyang fully leveraging the power of earth fire in the cloud sea.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the power of the earth fire was attached to and limited by the earth veins. It wasn't something that cultivators could easily control.</p><p></p><p>However, earlier, Hong Xi, to lure out the crimson flame, had activated the Heaven Origin Transformation Formation, destroying all the earth veins in the cloud sea.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the earth fire magma was no longer bound and flowed freely like unbridled horses.</p><p></p><p>This allowed the Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation to exert two hundred percent of its power.</p><p></p><p>So, in a sense, Hong Xi, too, was digging his own grave.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that his energy was depleting faster than the crimson flame, Hong Xi's face kept changing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, if he were to retract the Profound Heaven Sealing Spirit and abandon the pressure on the crimson flame, with full concentration, he might still break free from the Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation.</p><p></p><p>But this Profound Heaven Sealing Realm could only be used once. After using it, this mirror would also become ordinary. Only by returning to the main headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance for reapplication and recharging could it continue to be used. This meant that if the process were interrupted, all previous efforts would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>He might be able to save his life, but the thought of advancing to the realm of harmony would be out of the question.</p><p></p><p>If he risked it all in a desperate fight, there was indeed a danger to his life. But there was also a certain probability of reaching the realm of harmony! From then on, life would be entirely different!</p><p></p><p>With a fierce expression, Hong Xi, in a sudden change of mind, made his final decision.</p><p></p><p>Streams of radiance flew out from him, rushing towards the Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation, attempting to slow down the process of his own refining and absorption.</p><p></p><p>With a resolute gaze, Hong Xi completely forgot about everything else, focusing all his attention on controlling the Profound Heaven Sealing Spirit Formation to suppress and cultivate the crimson flame.</p><p></p><p>As time passed by, the fiery crimson flame's body grew dimmer and dimmer.</p><p></p><p>It was becoming more transparent, as if it could disappear between heaven and earth at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" Hong Xi roared furiously, his body transformed into a yellow light, charging mercilessly towards the crimson flame.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Profound Heaven Sealing Spirit Formation erupted with the most brilliant radiance.</p><p></p><p>The intertwining green and yellow light, like a sharp blade, was about to stab deeply into the body of the crimson flame.</p>

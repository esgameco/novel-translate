            <p>Chapter 1084: The Sword of Destiny Prevails</p><p></p><p>"Who is that? He's only at the Golden Core realm, yet he dares to be so arrogant? Didn't he see that Senior Brother Hua, who is at the late Nascent Soul stage, was defeated in just one move?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the inner sect disciple Ji Zhaoxuan! He's usually quiet and unremarkable. Who would have thought he would step forward at this moment!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! He is indeed a disciple of our Heavenly Sword Sect. Although he knows he's no match, he still dares to draw his sword! Just based on this, he is already one of the best among the inner sect disciples!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The onlooking disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect were discussing amongst themselves. Some were disdainful, some were admiring, and some were worshipful.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan ignored the surrounding voices and only stared directly at Mr. White: "Sir, your strength must far surpass mine. But if we only compare our understanding of the Dao of the Sword, I'm afraid you may not necessarily be stronger than me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was full of confidence, while Mr. White just smiled slightly without refuting.</p><p></p><p>"So in today's contest, we will only compare whose Dao of the Sword is superior, not whose strength is higher!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, everyone present was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"He wants the opponent to maintain his cultivation at the Golden Core realm before competing?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Bah! Shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"However, I think this is not unreasonable. After all, this guest's cultivation is unfathomable. If he really uses his full strength, I'm afraid only the First Senior Brother can defeat him."</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's somewhat rude request, Mr. White didn't mind. He nodded and said with a smile, "Don't worry, I never bully the weak."</p><p></p><p>With that said, the unfathomable aura emanating from his body suddenly calmed down. It became the same as Ji Zhaoxuan, who Li Fan was possessing - only at the late Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands and said solemnly, "In that case..."</p><p></p><p>"Behold the sword!"</p><p></p><p>Before the words "behold the sword" were uttered, Li Fan had already made his move.</p><p></p><p>When the onlookers heard Li Fan's shout, a giant illusory sword had already descended between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Descending from the sky, the sword tip pointed directly at the top of Mr. White's head.</p><p></p><p>Around the giant sword, countless different divine swords seemed to be inserted. The giant sword was like the emperor of swords, leading countless sword energies to crisscross and radiate.</p><p></p><p>At the scene, all the observing disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect lost control of their life-bound swords the moment the giant sword appeared. They flew out one after another, floating in the air, their blades humming as if in audience.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, even the entire Heavenly Sword Sect was slightly shaking.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that deep within the Heavenly Sword Sect, something was awakening.</p><p></p><p>This earth-shattering scene naturally attracted the attention of all the cultivators in the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Countless figures rushed over.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when a drunken cultivator holding a wine gourd arrived, it caused the crowd to exclaim in unison: "It's the First Senior Brother?!"</p><p></p><p>"The First Senior Brother is here!"</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao of the Heavenly Sword Sect was not as frivolous as usual at this moment. His expression was solemn as he stared at Li Fan and Mr. White, who were competing.</p><p></p><p>The moment the giant sword phantom appeared with tens of thousands of swords, a trace of astonishment flashed in Mr. White's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because he noticed that the wooden sword in his hand suddenly became much lighter.</p><p></p><p>As if...</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the Sword condensed on the wooden sword was instantly transferred to his opponent!</p><p></p><p>"Deceiving the Heavenly Dao, coupled with my understanding of the Heavenly Wonder of the wooden sword. Catching him off guard, it's enough to instantly seize back control of the Xuanhuang Sword Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"However, Mr. White is after all the incarnation of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. This method of deceiving the Heavenly Dao can only be used once, not twice."</p><p></p><p>"So there is only one chance!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was incomparably firm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was calmer than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Under his manipulation, the giant sword transformed from illusory to real, and the thousands of swords around it also materialized.</p><p></p><p>Like a torrential downpour, they suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Countless sharp swords tore through space, forming a terrifying storm that swept across the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers all changed color and retreated one after another.</p><p></p><p>But there were still many Yuan Ying and even Hua Shen cultivators who were knocked about by the sudden storm of ten thousand swords, unable to control their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those disciples with even lower cultivation levels.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a joke? Can a Golden Core realm cultivator do this?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Ji Zhaoxuan has been hiding his cultivation level all along?"</p><p></p><p>"Monsters, today we are fortunate to witness two monsters competing!"</p><p></p><p>The raging sword qi obscured the vision of the vast majority of people.</p><p></p><p>But those at the Harmonious Dao level and above were still staring intently at the center of the storm.</p><p></p><p>They were somewhat shocked to see that in the face of this world-destroying killing move, Mr. Bai did not dodge or evade.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he allowed the countless sharp swords to slam into his body.</p><p></p><p>However, strangely, these swords did not cause any damage to Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they disappeared silently like stones sinking into the sea or snow falling into water.</p><p></p><p>The storm of ten thousand swords was endless and showed no signs of subsiding for a while. Meanwhile, Li Fan had quietly disappeared in the storm.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai had no intention of counterattacking and just stood quietly in the center of the storm.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Sword..."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect there to be someone in the world who could master it to this extent. Impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai praised sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, just relying on this is not enough to defeat me."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's words echoed in the storm of ten thousand swords.</p><p></p><p>His gaze wandered, trying to lock onto Li Fan's position.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Li Fan had already transformed his body into a sword, merging with the myriad sword paths. Even Mr. Bai, as the embodiment of the Heavenly Dao, could not find Li Fan for a while.</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand swords roared, finally reaching the most violent moment before they were about to subside.</p><p></p><p>In the instant when countless sword lights bloomed together, an seemingly ordinary wooden sword, hidden among them.</p><p></p><p>It quietly flew towards Mr. Bai, unstoppable and full of determination!</p><p></p><p>At first, it was just like an ordinary sword path.</p><p></p><p>But as the speed of the wooden sword got faster and faster, its momentum also grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Like raging flames spreading across the sky, or a meteor illuminating the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Compared to it, all the other sharp swords in the storm seemed dull and lackluster.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." At this moment, Si Tu Yao and the various Heavenly Sword Sect elders who were watching all showed shock and regret on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Because this was the strongest sword, triggered by sacrificing one's own life.</p><p></p><p>It was also the last sword.</p><p></p><p>The Sword of Life!</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai naturally also saw through the essence of this sword.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>It was just a competition after all, there was really no need to risk the life of the young man opposite for the sake of winning or losing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>The other party's comprehension of the Dao of the Sword was indeed rare in the world. Not inferior to himself.</p><p></p><p>At this critical juncture, the more talents there were, the better it was for the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It would be a pity to just die like this.</p><p></p><p>In the time it took for his thoughts to turn rapidly, Mr. Bai had already made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"I admit defeat."</p><p></p><p>The moment he spoke, he released the restriction on his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Using the power of the Eternal Life realm, he forcibly reversed Li Fan's process of burning his life.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed no intention of stopping at all.</p><p></p><p>Even though the sword's momentum was exhausted, his figure's speed did not decrease.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the wooden sword in his hand still lightly stabbed into Mr. Bai's body.</p>

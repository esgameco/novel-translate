        <h1>Chapter 337</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The grand scenes were basically all related to the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate from the past."</p><p></p><p>"However, it will only be like this the first time."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk's tone carried a hint of regret: "After staying here for a long time and getting used to the Heavenly Venerate's aura, it becomes a luxury to see the illusions again."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi and Ximen Yue were still in shock from the illusions and only nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, he was still cautiously looking ahead.</p><p></p><p>While concealing the fear in his heart, he tried to recall the familiarity that came from nowhere just now.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk saw the three people's reactions and didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>He didn't urge them but waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the shock and astonishment of these newcomers were all too normal.</p><p></p><p>As a "guide", he was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>After a while, seeing that the three people had gradually gotten rid of the impact brought by the illusions, he continued his duty for this time.</p><p></p><p>"I was entrusted by the Extreme Immortal Venerate to lead you to the Dharma Protector Hall."</p><p></p><p>"You follow closely behind me and don't run around."</p><p></p><p>"Although those who can enter the headquarters have passed identity verification and generally won't have any problems."</p><p></p><p>"But this is, after all, the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, a vital place. There are monks secretly guarding at all times."</p><p></p><p>"If you go to places you shouldn't go and get caught and killed, no one will redress your grievances."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk warned coldly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the others all nodded, indicating that they were clear.</p><p></p><p>Following behind him, Li Fan took the opportunity to observe the scenery of the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>In an endless void, many majestic buildings were floating and towering.</p><p></p><p>Arranged in different positions overhead in the void, they were like stars all over the sky.</p><p></p><p>And the current position of Li Fan and the others was at the very bottom of the entire building complex.</p><p></p><p>Silver rays of light crossed overhead.</p><p></p><p>Shuttling back and forth between different floating buildings, vague figures seemed to be faintly visible in the light.</p><p></p><p>Walking unhurriedly, along the way, they occasionally encountered solemn-looking monks who were in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>And the floating land underfoot here seemed to be used only as an external entrance and for accepting inspections.</p><p></p><p>Except for the plants planted on both sides of the road, no other buildings were set up.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, they reached the boundary of the land.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw that there seemed to be a strange formation engraved on the ground ahead.</p><p></p><p>Silver fine lines were constantly moving in the formation, and every time a monk stepped in,</p><p></p><p>A silver light would carry them up into the sky and head to different areas above.</p><p></p><p>In front of the transfer formation, a tall and sturdy monk was standing.</p><p></p><p>This person was wearing the standard black and yellow Taoist robe uniform of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and his sharp eyes were examining the passing monks.</p><p></p><p>When it was Li Fan and the others' turn, the tall monk glanced at the black-robed monk and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>But he still raised his hand to stop them.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk didn't mind either, and took out the small circular mirror from before.</p><p></p><p>A beam of light shot out and fell on the tall monk.</p><p></p><p>What was strange was that this beam of light seemed to be absorbed by him, disappearing without a trace as soon as it fell on his body.</p><p></p><p>And in the tall monk's eyes, many symbols flashed quickly in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He put down his hand and didn't stop them anymore.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk led Li Fan and the three into the transfer formation.</p><p></p><p>That sturdy middle-aged monk pointed at the formation.</p><p></p><p>A silver fine line shot out from his finger and entered the ground transfer formation.</p><p></p><p>It circled a few times and expanded several times.</p><p></p><p>Then it wrapped around Li Fan and the others and flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan's body seemed to have turned into light, shuttling through this space at an unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>And what was strange was that he didn't feel any discomfort brought by the excessive speed.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery was rapidly receding.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the original floating land had become as small as a black dot.</p><p></p><p>The sharp-eyed Li Fan even vaguely saw the iconic slanted metal cube building of the Strategy Formation Hall in a certain area.</p><p></p><p>Before long, shadows loomed overhead.</p><p></p><p>The light carried Li Fan and the others and plunged into it.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Fan changed from light form back to human form.</p><p></p><p>Setting foot on land again, Li Fan looked ahead and saw a tall black stone tablet not far away.</p><p></p><p>Only one wide avenue led straight to the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>There were no plants or other decorations on either side of the road.</p><p></p><p>Compared with the other floating lands seen before, this place seemed a bit simple and desolate.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk walked silently at the head of the straight avenue.</p><p></p><p>The road surface seemed to be made of some kind of cyan-green stone, and when walking on it, Li Fan found to his horror that the spiritual energy inside his body suddenly became silent.</p><p></p><p>As if it had lost its vitality, no matter how Li Fan manipulated it, he couldn't mobilize a bit of it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when the Golden Core early-stage clone walked on this road, it became no different from an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi and Ximen Yue had obviously also discovered this point.</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other in fear and didn't dare to discuss much, hurrying to catch up with the black-robed monk who had already walked far ahead.</p><p></p><p>The tall black stone tablet seemed not far away, just at the end of the straight avenue.</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan and the others relied entirely on their physical bodies and walked slowly step by step, this road seemed to become extremely long.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's perception, it took most of the day for them to reach the end, somewhat exhausted.</p><p></p><p>And in this process, they had encountered monks who walked out of the black stone tablet and left.</p><p></p><p>However, they seemed to be unaffected and could still fly at low altitude on the straight avenue.</p><p></p><p>"It should be a restriction on outsiders. The members of the Dharma Protector Hall seem to be able to avoid the silence of the spiritual energy in their bodies by relying on some secret technique." Li Fan secretly said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the foot of the black stone tablet, Li Fan deeply felt its height.</p><p></p><p>The towering top had already exceeded the scope of vision, and the whole body was black, like a deep and oppressive feeling.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan feel strange was that the entire stone tablet seemed to be one piece.</p><p></p><p>There was also no entrance or exit to be seen.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the black-robed monk who led them here spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, just here, present your [Audience Law Jade Tablets]."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan and the three took out the exquisite jade tablets.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored light on the jade tablets shone on the black stone tablet, making the black on it become colorful as well.</p><p></p><p>As the light halo spread, the hard stone tablet seemed to dissolve in these colorful colors.</p><p></p><p>A seven-colored passage appeared on the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>"You go in. I don't have an [Audience Law Jade Tablet] and can't enter the Dharma Protector Hall without permission." The black-robed monk said.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 849</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Heart Ape and Mind Horse are existences that are vastly different from the rules of the Xuanhuang Realm. </p><p></p><p>They seem to be remnants of the Heavenly Dao's power left over from the Xuanhuang Realm's process of devouring and merging with other small worlds.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they can still produce their own effects within the scope of the Longevity Celestial Venerate's inverted principles."</p><p></p><p>"The power of anomalies..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered that in the 114th lifetime, during the fight against the Xuan Net, the Overturning Heaven Society had created a superweapon called the "Destroying Heaven Arrow".</p><p></p><p>The specific method of manufacturing was unknown, but the source of the materials was the increasingly frequent anomalies at that time.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Net replaced the heavens, and its power was no different from the current Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since the Destroying Heaven Arrow could damage the Xuan Net, it meant that it could similarly harm the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that although the power of anomalies is different from the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm, it is ultimately a force that can be mastered and utilized. It's not an existence without logic or reason."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully examined the brilliant sphere in his hand: "However, I didn't expect that the Myriad Immortals Alliance's research on anomalies had already reached this level. If we don't force their hand, we really don't know how many methods they are hiding."</p><p></p><p>"But this is to be expected." Li Fan suddenly remembered that when he had an audience with Gong Sun Qi Xuan in the Congyu Sea Heavenly Mechanism Hall, he had seen a giant map.</p><p></p><p>The map seemed to mark the locations of anomalous events occurring within the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance has always kept a close watch on anomalies. It's normal for them to be able to initially utilize it this time."</p><p></p><p>The Heart Ape and Mind Horse are terrifying anomalies related to mental power that can directly transform cultivators into aberrations.</p><p></p><p>After being transformed into a Heart Ape, one's divine sense can be enhanced.</p><p></p><p>And transforming into a Mind Horse can directly nourish the soul!</p><p></p><p>"When I first consumed the 'Mind Horse', I experienced that extremely illusory yet realistic power. If in the illusion, you feel that you have died, then in reality, you will truly perish as well! Consciousness can change matter..."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the fact that this brilliant sphere is being mass-distributed at such a low cost, the Myriad Immortals Alliance should have already fully grasped the application of this extra-dimensional law."</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Li Fan couldn't find any solution.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly say he was proficient in the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm, let alone this power from outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could actually understand the headache the Five Elders were facing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A sage once said, "Therefore, in the governance of the sage, he empties their hearts, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones. He always causes the people to be without knowledge and desire."</p><p></p><p>Now, all the cultivators affected by the brilliant spheres claimed to be "Children of Heavenly Mandate".</p><p></p><p>Their potential for destruction was simply incomparable to ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Before crossing over, Li Fan had read quite a few online novels.</p><p></p><p>Eight or nine out of ten protagonists in the books were transmigrators.</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>Besides increasing the readers' sense of immersion, it also gave readers expectations.</p><p></p><p>The destiny of transmigrators was bound to be different from the so-called natives.</p><p></p><p>They were bound to make a name for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the final outcome, there will certainly be a process of attempting it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the brilliant spheres deployed by the Myriad Immortals Alliance have a similar effect.</p><p></p><p>They cause the affected cultivators to become conceited and arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the tempering of ninety-nine reincarnations is indeed a great opportunity for cultivators. It is enough to allow some of them to transform from serpents into dragons and complete their metamorphosis!</p><p></p><p>"It's equivalent to thousands of weakened transmigrators appearing within the territory of the Five Elders Council."</p><p></p><p>"And they have been brainwashed to be permanently hostile."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"It's very likely that the Myriad Immortals Alliance has also placed cultivation techniques and other things useful in the Xuanhuang Realm into the illusory realm of reincarnation within the brilliant spheres. This helps these 'Children of Destiny' to quickly grow in power."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan revealed a look of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how they deal with it."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling, if the Five Elders Council sends another message to inquire, just ignore it for now," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling nodded, seeming to half-understand.</p><p></p><p>"Fighting back fiercely is to cause internal chaos within the Five Elders Council, temporarily leaving them no time to deal with the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Immortal Alliance truly attaches great importance to this grand examination."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With everyone's anticipation, the month-long grand examination finally ended.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators returned from the Tianxuan Mirror one after another, each with their own joys and worries.</p><p></p><p>On Sea Pavilion Island.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from Daoist He's expression, he must be fully confident this time?"</p><p></p><p>The six cultivators from the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association who had registered for the grand examination gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Originally, only four cultivators, including He Zhenghao, participated in the examination. However, after the Immortal Alliance announced the selection of the Thirty-Three Immortal Candidates, two others were inspired.</p><p></p><p>They decided to give it a shot.</p><p></p><p>"Last-minute cramming really works." One of the two, a cultivator named "Wei Qizheng," said with some excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The content of the question bank provided by Daoist Ji was really too much. Actually, I didn't have time to read it all, I just swallowed it hastily and memorized some. But I was really lucky, the exam questions this time were surprisingly mostly the ones I had memorized!"</p><p></p><p>"For the ones not in the question bank, I feel I performed well too." Wei Qizheng shared his joy with everyone.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao stroked his beard, also revealing a smile: "Then shouldn't we congratulate Junior Brother Wei in advance?"</p><p></p><p>The others also joined in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>They all seemed fully confident.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ji Shaoli lightly coughed, interrupting their lively atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps because not much time had passed since the outbreak of the Mortal-Transcendent Miasma, the cultivators present still had lingering fears about coughing sounds.</p><p></p><p>Before Ji Shaoli could speak, they all changed their expressions and looked over at him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their inquiring gazes, Ji Shaoli felt a bit exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand, he spoke of the important matter: "When the exam results come out, you will inevitably face scrutiny from the Myriad Immortals Alliance. If it is discovered that you knew the exam questions in advance, that would be troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was startled.</p><p></p><p>"However..." Ji Shaoli smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Our mutual aid association has a secret technique called [Covering the Sky with One Hand]. I will teach it to you in a moment."</p><p></p><p>"With the help of this secret technique, there will be no worries!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others all showed joyful expressions.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli lightly tapped the glabella of each person, and after a moment, everyone present closed their eyes to comprehend and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli took the opportunity to observe secretly.</p><p></p><p>The one who woke up the fastest was the cultivator named Wei Qizheng.</p><p></p><p>In the previous few lives, while being friends with He Zhenghao, he had occasionally heard about this junior brother with exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>However, later on, as Li Fan's horizons broadened day by day, he encountered too many geniuses.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't pay much attention to this person anymore.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Huangfu Song then just remembered that once you enter the realm of confusion, you can only leave by finding and passing through a special location.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if the distance is short, it will be as far as the edge of the sky, and you will never be able to cross it in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a drop of cold sweat dripped from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>East Horizon Yao had a bit more courage, he patted Huangfu Song's shoulder and comforted, "Relax, Brother Huangfu. Although this place looks a bit strange, after all, they are all dead people. There shouldn't be any danger."</p><p></p><p>"If you are really afraid, just hide behind me. I'll take the lead." He patted his chest reassuringly.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song nodded repeatedly, "Then I'll leave it to you. But be careful, this place..."</p><p></p><p>He hesitated for a moment and said in a low voice, "I didn't feel any death aura. These cultivators, maybe they are still alive."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, East Horizon Yao's body trembled momentarily.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Huangfu, don't scare yourself for no reason. Don't speak recklessly." East Horizon Yao's gaze swept over the countless ice coffins on the black sea, his face becoming very unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Don't scare yourself. Let's just accept the situation and figure things out first." Compared to the two people next to him, Li Fan, who had a true rare treasure and could escape at any time, appeared much calmer. Stepping up at a critical moment, he calmly commanded.</p><p></p><p>The three put away the Primal Pure Boat, gathered in formation, and set up defensive formations around them. Li Fan, who had many defensive treasures prepared, carefully flew over the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>The Qing Liang Mirror flickered, collecting and recording data from the passing areas.</p><p></p><p>The three dared not approach the frozen cultivators floating on the sea surface, just carefully observing from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the attire of these people, they should all be ancient cultivators from the immortal realm. Unable to sense their aura, we cannot judge their cultivation level."</p><p></p><p>"It's strange. They don't seem to be alive. But compared to dead people, there seems to be some difference."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what they saw before being frozen. Their expressions are really ferocious."</p><p></p><p>"Who could have done all this? To instantly freeze so many cultivators, his cultivation levelâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The three continued to communicate with each other through divine consciousness, refraining from acting rashly and attempting to break the ice coffins below.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the treasures, elixirs, and techniques carried by countless ancient cultivators looked very tempting. But no one dared to guarantee that breaking the ice coffins wouldn't trigger unknown accidents.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the Qing Xuan points obtained from exploring the realm of confusion, as long as they could safely return from here, it would already be a great profit.</p><p></p><p>With the rewards from the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance in sight, the treasures of the ancient cultivators seemed less attractive.</p><p></p><p>In the deathly silent black sea, time seemed to stand still. There were no changes of day and night, the sky always gray and misty.</p><p></p><p>The connection between the Qing Tian Mirror and the Tian Xuan Mirror seemed to be cut off, and the points they earned were only recorded in the ancient square mirror and not synchronized.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song and the others knew that if they couldn't get out alive, all these Qing Xuan points would just be a pile of unfulfilled numbers, meaningless. But if they could safely escape after completing their exploration, even if they didn't gain anything in the future actions, what they obtained here would be enough.</p><p></p><p>So they were especially cautious.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, they had been flying for dozens of days but still hadn't reached the end of this black sea area.</p><p></p><p>What they saw was still the frozen bodies.</p><p></p><p>Even East Horizon Yao could tell something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Are we circling in the same place?" Huangfu Song nodded in agreement, "It seems so now. Although the direction we are moving forward seems to be a straight line, it's evident that our perceptions have been distorted by some force in this place. Otherwise, the corpses we have seen these days would add up to billions. Even if all the ancient cultivators were buried here, there wouldn't be so many."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He compared and reorganized the images recorded in his mind from the Dao Stone.</p><p></p><p>Blue light shimmered, seemingly operating to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Li Fan discovered a chilling fact.</p><p></p><p>In fact, up to now, the frozen cultivators they encountered didn't seem to repeat.</p><p></p><p>Or, even if there were a few whose appearance was similar and he ignored them. But in this deathly silent black sea, most of the cultivators they saw were indeed individual and distinct.</p><p></p><p>"There are a total of 2 billion 679,800,000 cultivators sleeping here."</p><p></p><p>"This is only what I have seen so far."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but look into the distance, the dark ice coffins floating on the ocean, still without seeing an end.</p><p></p><p>"After all..."</p><p></p><p>The strangeness of this realm of confusion far exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>"This won't work. We need to find a way out quickly," Huangfu Song said and then suddenly coughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and East Horizon Yao were stunned for a moment, their faces changing slightly as they exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>"Huangfu, are you okay?" East Horizon Yao flew to Huangfu Song's side, grabbing his shoulder to check his physical condition.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>"It's strange, nothing unusual. But what was that cough just now?" East Horizon Yao's expression was very serious.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song also realized that something was wrong, closed his eyes, and after careful introspection, his face turned dark, "I feel like I've weakened a bit. It's as if vitality is continuously draining from me..."</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the dead silent black sea, "It seems like this ocean is drawing out our vitality."</p><p></p><p>"So that's it. My body is a bit stronger than yours, so I'm still fine for now." Saying this, East Horizon Yao suddenly stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look at Li Fan, "But Li Fan Daoist friend, how..."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's eyes narrowed as well.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was because of Li Fan's guidance that they came to this strange realm of confusion. East Horizon Yao understood his special constitution, and Huangfu Song was clear about it as well.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who only had the cultivation level of Nascent Soul, seemed to have more "vitality" than Huangfu Song, who was in the Core Formation realm, and could even persist longer on this dead sea...</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song couldn't help but have doubts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally understood this reasoning. He smiled faintly and shook his head, "Brothers, there is no need to doubt. Perhaps it's because my Dao Field is of wood attribute, so my vitality is more vigorous."</p><p></p><p>"In such a situation, we should still work together and not harbor doubts."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Huangfu, you should take the Longevity Pill I gave you, it might have a miraculous effect."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan so calm, Huangfu Song temporarily suppressed his doubts. He took out the jade bottle, swallowed the Longevity Pill, and indeed his complexion improved a bit.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed useful. Thank you, Brother Li!" Huangfu Song looked somewhat guilty.</p><p></p><p>"No worries." Li Fan waved his hand, seeming completely unconcerned.</p>

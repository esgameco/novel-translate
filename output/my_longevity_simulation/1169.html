        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1167: Xuanyuan Shiling Formation</p><p></p><p>As time passed by second by second, cold sweat dripped from Sun Luyuan's forehead.</p><p></p><p>His younger brother Sun Luyao seemed to also be controlling his own desires, quickly searching for information related to the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold on anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Sun Luyao showed no signs of stopping, a flash of determination passed through Sun Luyuan's eyes. In an instant, he put away the Tianxuan Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly losing the object it could devour, Sun Luyao became frenzied as usual.</p><p></p><p>"It's not enough! I want more!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother, save me!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was only with the help of Sun Luyuan's essence blood that his emotions gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>As if having suffered a great trauma and coming back to life, Sun Luyao's phantom seemed even weaker than before.</p><p></p><p>He sighed softly with little strength, "Brother, you were a bit too hasty. Just a little more..."</p><p></p><p>"I'd rather fail than be exposed. Wait, you said..." Sun Luyuan was speaking when he suddenly reacted to the meaning in his brother's words.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao nodded and transmitted some images over, "It's indeed not an excuse made up to devour a bit more. This time we were really lucky, capturing possible information about the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar in one go."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that just as I was about to sense the avatar's specific location and identity, you cut off the connection."</p><p></p><p>There was some regret in Sun Luyao's words, but no hint of blame.</p><p></p><p>"Proving one's own Dao to attain freedom. This Tianxuan Mirror actually split off an avatar long ago, not only escaping the Immortal Alliance's control but also wanting to use this to achieve a different kind of transcendence?" Sun Luyuan felt it was a bit unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>And the other piece of information shown in the data made his mind and spirit tremble, causing him to lose his composure on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Backlash against the mirror holder, mirror slave?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the abnormality of the mirror holder Cang that Lord Fu had mentioned before, as well as the unspoken parts in Fu's words, Sun Luyuan instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that Fu was also attempted to be controlled by the Tianxuan Mirror, but perhaps escaped by luck and wasn't successfully captured by it. That's why he was suspicious of Cang, who was also a mirror holder."</p><p></p><p>"The one supervising and controlling the Tianxuan Mirror actually risks being controlled in reverse. If this matter is leaked, I'm afraid the entire lineage of mirror holders will have to be thoroughly purged. It may even cause upheaval in the Immortal Alliance because of this..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the possible consequences if this matter was exposed, Sun Luyuan's heart turned cold.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he made a decision in his heart, "No, even if I have to risk being punished by Fu, I can't reveal that I know about this matter. Otherwise, in order to maintain their own ruling position, Fu and all the other mirror holders will choose to silence me."</p><p></p><p>"Enough. This matter ends here. The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar has nothing to do with our Sun family. Brother, you rest for a while next. I'll make up an excuse to Lord Fu." Sun Luyuan said coldly with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Brother? Such a good opportunity..." Sun Luyao was a bit startled and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Luyuan didn't explain to him and instead expressed his resolute attitude with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Sun brothers had always followed the eldest brother's lead. Seeing this, Sun Luyao had no choice.</p><p></p><p>After comforting his brother for a while, Sun Luyuan left this secret room with a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>It was quiet for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you also saw that this can't be blamed on me." Sun Luyao pleaded guilty to Li Fan with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't...</p><p></p><p>There is some exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>To be able to maintain calm thinking and make the most correct decision under the influence of Li Fan's distracting secret technique, the deliberate guidance of blood ties, and the temptation of many great secrets.</p><p></p><p>This Sun family patriarch is truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when in contact with the Tianxuan Mirror, peering into the mysteries within the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was not stealing any information about the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the location of the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar, Li Fan had long known. Just casually revealing some information was enough to get by.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought that he could use this great secret to directly facilitate the opportunity to meet the Mirror Holder Fumi.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Luyuan's decisiveness left Li Fan's plan temporarily unfulfilled.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>"Today is just planting a seed. The future is long, and there will be plenty of opportunities in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, the goal this time has already been achieved."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan checked the true information that the Infinite Mirror had just peered into.</p><p></p><p>"[Xuanyuan Shiling Great Formation], re-establishing earth, fire, water, and wind in the void, opening up the world, recreating the world..."</p><p></p><p>"With such power, it is almost no different from the gods in myths. The formations of immortals are truly enviable."</p><p></p><p>That's right, this time Li Fan controlled the Infinite Mirror to steal from the Tianxuan Mirror the fleeting thoughts about the immortal-level formation.</p><p></p><p>These thoughts appeared several times, including but not limited to when the Tianxuan Mirror was bound and unwilling, thinking of a way to escape, recalling the glorious years in the immortal realm in the past, or pondering how to solve and deal with the world-ending crisis in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>This great formation with the power to create worlds is composed of a set of nine kinds of immortal-level formations.</p><p></p><p>Even in the immortal realm back then, it was extremely powerful, and few could complete its arrangement.</p><p></p><p>The [Xuanji, Wanling Guishu], [Huangluo, Xushi Shenghua] that Li Fan knew before, as well as the [Wuliang, Hongmeng Jianfang] which was the source of power for the Infinite Mirror to be able to peer into the Tianxuan, were all part of this Xuanyuan Shiling Great Formation.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanji, Wanling Guishu Formation can digitize everything within the formation's coverage. Transforming at will.</p><p></p><p>The Huangluo, Xushi Shenghua Formation is able to create things out of the void, creating something out of nothing.</p><p></p><p>And Wuliang, Hongmeng Jianfang is to spontaneously analyze the secrets of the world within a square inch, laying a solid foundation for the Xuanyuan Shiling Great Formation to create the world.</p><p></p><p>Through the fleeting thoughts of the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan learned that in the immortal realm, there was a perception that any constituent part of the world has an absolute similarity to the world itself. In other words, all the secrets of the world can be parsed and displayed through any item in the world.</p><p></p><p>All the divine powers and techniques can be comprehended from the most ordinary stones on the ground.</p><p></p><p>If someone had told Li Fan this before, he would have definitely thought they were talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>But if it came from the memories of the Tianxuan Mirror and the consensus in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan had to ponder deeply.</p><p></p><p>However, the rules of cognition that transcend the mundane are obviously not something he can figure out.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Li Fan could only shake his head slightly and firmly remember it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Coming back to his senses, according to the remnants of the formation in the Infinite Mirror and the vague memory fragments of the [Xuanyuan Shiling Great Formation] in the Tianxuan Mirror, he began to try to extrapolate the [Wuliang, Hongmeng Jianfang] formation using the Doomsday Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>"If the formation is complete, this Infinite Mirror can not only peer into the Tianxuan Mirror. All the objects in this Xuanhuang Realm will probably find it difficult to escape its analysis."</p><p></p><p>"Even that immortal treasure fishing pool..."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1201: The Future of the Dao Transformation</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu gradually recovered from his shock, still choosing not to take a stance.</p><p></p><p>However, his specific actions had already changed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had thought of observing for a while and then returning. Now, he made a request to Sun Erlang to stay and observe for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was a little troubled: "I can't make this decision on my own. I need to ask my master for instructions."</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu nodded: "I think your master will agree."</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Faceless Holy Emperor agreed to the Taiyi Sect's request to stay. However, there was a condition.</p><p></p><p>"Use [Simulation] to help the cultivators of the Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment grow quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"The master said that even if the Taiyi Sect doesn't do this favor, he has other methods. It's just a bit more troublesome. The core of the Taiyi Sect is still the extrapolation of the future of Xuanhuang. Before there is no final certainty, the master also agrees that your Taiyi Sect maintains a certain neutrality. Just consider it a kind of transaction." Sun Erlang repeated Li Ping's original words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Yi Shu finally agreed after discussing with the Taiyi Sect and the Dao Transformation Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>For the Taiyi Sect, a few more simulations were just a waste utilization of idle computing power. </p><p></p><p>But it could provide one more path for the future, which seemed like a good deal no matter how you look at it.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the past, before the calamity arrived, some cultivators in the sect chose to flee. The Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao never put their choices in only one basket.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment had one more observer.</p><p></p><p>Except for the place where the Holy Emperor's subordinates and the Youzu people were, as well as the Xuanhuang Realm's fishing pool, Yi Shu could freely observe without restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not worried about this either.</p><p></p><p>With the fortune of the Holy Dynasty and the increasing perfection of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Formation, Yi Shu's every move was under his control.</p><p></p><p>Even the life and death of Yi Shu's body was at his will.</p><p></p><p>And in the distant Xuanhuang Realm, someone had already set their sights on the Taiyi Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have no intention of actively harming others, I have no choice but to keep a means."</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyi Sect has abandoned their physical bodies to exist collectively within the Dao Transformation Stone Mother. Information is indestructible, which is indeed remarkable. Even when the Immortal Ruins Immortals destroyed the world with a glance, they were able to escape from that terrible calamity. But..."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that every trade has its specialization!"</p><p></p><p>In the Yanfa Jue space, Li Fan seemed to be meditating with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his mind was constantly surging with thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Information is indestructible, and physical means or even ordinary immortal techniques would not have much effect. But data pollution might have a miraculous effect.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Fan's knowledge, among the Dao lineages currently circulating in the Xuanhuang Realm, there was no such method yet. His idea still originated from the mysterious and unfathomable [Xuanyuan Shiling Grand Formation].</p><p></p><p>A composite of nine immortal-level formations, its power was unimaginable. It could even re-establish the elements of earth, fire, water, and wind in the void and create a new world.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the Ultimate Separation Disc and a series of coincidences, Li Fan had already mastered three of them preliminarily.</p><p></p><p>Xuanji, Wanling Guishu; Huangluo, Xushi Shenghua; Wuliang, Hongmeng Jianfang.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's only a theory, it's fundamentally impossible to complete the formation due to the lack of materials. But fortunately, the Taiyi Sect also has no physical form, and pure information is more likely to reveal flaws."</p><p></p><p>"If the Hongmeng Jianfang and Wanling Guishu formations cooperate with each other..."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Ultimate Separation Disc, with the computing power of the Dao Transformation Stone, was rapidly extrapolating a brand new formation form.</p><p></p><p>The most...</p><p></p><p>In the recent half year, Li Fan's divine sense had already roughly completed the analysis of the Hongmeng Jian Formation in the "Boundless Mirror".</p><p></p><p>After a series of repairs by his divine sense, the abilities of the damaged Boundless Mirror had been greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>The corresponding price was that his divine sense had once again weakened a little.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was not worried.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan had been slow to complete the task assigned by the Mirror Holder "Fu", and even his deliberate perfunctory attitude had been noticed by the other party. The pressure he was under was growing, and perhaps before long, he would have no choice but to succumb and once again attempt to use the Boundless Mirror to spy on the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>After sensing what his avatar Li Ping had seen and heard, Li Fan was now thinking about something else.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking about the origin of the Dao Transformation Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>When the Taiyi Sect first obtained the inheritance of the Tiandu Grand Master, there should have been no Dao Transformation Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>It was only later that, from somewhere, they found such a treasure, directly changing the Taiyi Sect's techniques from being suitable for only a few people to being cultivable by everyone. It thoroughly solidified the Taiyi Sect's position among the Ten Sects.</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Realm, there are many treasures that can be deduced. For example, that Boundless Mirror, although damaged, can still predict some future events. But the oddities of the Boundless Mirror and even the Tianxuan Mirror seem more like the result of the refinement of immortal-level power. They are 'tools'."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Transformation Stone Mother, on the other hand, is more like a pure 'object'."</p><p></p><p>"The legendary heavenly materials and earthly treasures... Although the Xuanhuang Realm is vast, it doesn't seem like it can naturally give birth to such divine objects."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered a lost story he had heard from the people of the Duguo Sect before.</p><p></p><p>A foreign star fell into Xuanhuang, causing all the spiritual power in the Xuanhuang Realm to become ineffective.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Dao Transformation Stone Mother also came from outside the stars?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>But it was just speculation. Unless one day he could invade the Dao Transformation Stone, only then could he truly know the answer.</p><p></p><p>"The Stone Mother's deduction of the future relies purely on its own powerful computing power. Even so, it has already reached a certain extreme, which shows how powerful its computing power is. If it were to be supplemented with external objects to further optimize its deduction methods, who knows what realm it could reach."</p><p></p><p>For example, the Dao Transformation Stone in Li Fan's sea of consciousness, although it had been upgraded to a high-grade after several fusions, if it wanted to deduce formations on its own, let alone immortal-level grand formations, it would be very difficult even for existences like the "Reversing Life and Death Grand Formation".</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if relying solely on the Doomsday Dissociation Disc itself, after all, it was just a mortal object, and it would be somewhat reluctant to deduce immortal-level grand formations.</p><p></p><p>But the two working together was a different story.</p><p></p><p>"Complementing and benefiting each other."</p><p></p><p>Such a harmonious scene made Li Fan imagine freely, if the Dao Transformation Stone Mother was equipped with existences like the Doomsday Dissociation Disc, and not just formations.</p><p></p><p>What kind of scene would it be?</p><p></p><p>The techniques of the Deduction Jade, the future of the Boundless Mirror...</p><p></p><p>If these things were combined with the Dao Transformation Stone Mother's formidable computing power, there would surely be a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>It could even be infinitely superimposed on the Dao Transformation Stone Mother, which had already reached the pinnacle of perfection, through each reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Pushing it to an unimaginable realm.</p><p></p><p>The help of the Doomsday Dissociation Disc to Li Fan in the reincarnation cycle goes without saying.</p><p></p><p>If you add others...</p><p></p><p>It made Li Fan's heart race with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, the way to break the situation lies within."</p><p></p><p>"With treasures ahead, it all depends on how to plan."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1077: The First Act of the Plan is Broken</p><p></p><p>"Only by personally witnessing the scale of development the Wanxian Alliance has reached can we draw the attention of the sect elders." Li Fan said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"If we can eliminate all these villains at once, it would be a great achievement for us. By then, it won't be as troublesome for us to enter and exit the mountain gate as it is now."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was Li Fan's last sentence that moved Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>He agreed to Li Fan's plan.</p><p></p><p>Next, Zhang Qianmo manipulated Song Hesong to transmit a message to Chu Liang and others in the city. He said that the situation had changed and Zhang Qianmo, who was originally supposed to come to retrieve the longevity fruit, would not be coming. They needed to meet in person to re-discuss the ambush.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Liang and the others felt slightly puzzled, they didn't suspect anything amiss.</p><p></p><p>They still came to the outskirts of the city as agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Song, what exactly happened?" From afar, Chu Liang saw Song Hesong disguised by Zhang Qianmo and immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's actually a good thing." Zhang Qianmo responded in Song Hesong's tone.</p><p></p><p>"During this trip down the mountain, Zhang Qianmo seemed to have accidentally discovered a hidden secret realm. This secret realm turned out to be an ancient stronghold of the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"This matter is of great importance. He didn't even have time to retrieve the longevity fruit. He just hurriedly came to instruct me before returning to the mountain to report."</p><p></p><p>Chu Liang felt a bit baffled: "Xuantian Sect? What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"Humph." Song Hesong pretended to look a bit disdainful, but still patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying this Xuantian Sect is an existence even more ancient than the Ten Immortal Sects? Then wouldn't there be many treasures in this secret realm?" Chu Liang and the others suddenly became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>The reason they wanted to surround and kill Zhang Qianmo was partly for revenge. But the more important reason was to force out various techniques and divine abilities of the Zixiao Sect from Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>Although they had joined the Wanxian Alliance and were taught the most basic "Heavenly Net Divine Technique", they were after all just fringe members and only knew this one technique. When encountering disciples of the Ten Immortal Sects, they could only rely on strength in numbers to barely win. In one-on-one combat, they had no chance of victory at all. Their foundation was too shallow and they urgently needed to arm themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Then what are we waiting for? Let's go seize the things in that secret realm before the people from Zixiao Sect arrive." Chu Liang said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong shook his head slightly: "The secret realm of the Xuantian Sect has all kinds of formations, mechanisms, and restrictions, and is extremely perilous. Otherwise, Zhang Qianmo wouldn't be in such a hurry to return to the mountain to get reinforcements."</p><p></p><p>"With just the few of us, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Liang said dismissively: "Then let's call a few more brothers! They may look down on a Foundation Establishment sect disciple, but surely they can't remain indifferent to this Xuantian Sect secret realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>The others also nodded in agreement one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Then we must hurry. It will probably take Zhang Qianmo more than a day for a round trip..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the efficiency of the brothers is not something those decayed sects can compare to." Chu Liang patted his chest and said.</p><p></p><p>Next, Zhang Qianmo, who received a message from Li Fan indicating that preparations were ready, first brought Chu Liang and the others to the so-called entrance of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk...Daoist Song, you were right. This secret realm is indeed extremely perilous. As I approach, my heart is pounding hard."</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, the alliance brothers nearby will..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Brother, they are already rushing here. Among them, there are quite a few at the Golden Core stage, and even a Nascent Soul great cultivator." Chu Liang stared intently at the entrance of the secret realm, his eyes full of greed.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the efficiency of the initial Myriad Immortals Alliance was indeed high.</p><p></p><p>Like a pack of wolves smelling blood, in just over half a day, they gathered from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-five Golden Cores, one hundred and six Foundation Establishments..." Looking at the crowd of cultivators in front of him, although their clothes were very plain, the surging aura was full of vitality. Zhang Qianmo couldn't help feeling a sense of horror in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after receiving the message, the Sect Master of Purple Empyrean Sect had already led the crowd to subdue the demons here.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhang Qianmo feel a little more at ease.</p><p></p><p>After the people of the Myriad Immortals Alliance gathered, they did not rush to enter the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were waiting for a heavyweight figure to arrive.</p><p></p><p>It is said that he was a cultivator who was fortunate enough to follow the Dharma Transmission Immortal Venerable at the beginning, and now he has reached the Nascent Divinity stage.</p><p></p><p>With him present, no dangerous secret realm was to be feared.</p><p></p><p>Soon, this Nascent Divinity cultivator arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>He did not show the arrogance of having a cultivation base several realms higher than others, and still greeted the cultivators present in a friendly manner.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by the crowd, he came to the entrance of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the formation sealing the secret realm, he frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Formations were not his specialty. In the end, he chose to use his absolute strength at the Nascent Divinity stage to destroy the formation.</p><p></p><p>He took the lead and stepped into the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>After just a moment, he retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, this is a trap!" At the same time, he shouted a warning.</p><p></p><p>However, it was too late.</p><p></p><p>On the horizon, rolling purple Qi had already arrived in an instant.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Looking from afar at the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators fighting against the Purple Empyrean Sect, Li Fan was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>He had already noticed that this scene of the Fallen Immortal Realm had begun to become unstable.</p><p></p><p>That Dharma Transmitter who came later was not one of those who survived in later generations.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he should have unfortunately sacrificed in the battle with the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>It's just that under Li Fan's instigation, his time of death was brought forward a little.</p><p></p><p>"This move of bringing calamity to the east has caused the great battle of cultivators that should have erupted in Ningyuan City to be changed to a place with no one around."</p><p></p><p>"Although it took some effort, the task has been perfectly completed."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, the surrounding scene began to gradually blur.</p><p></p><p>Like glass, it shattered inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's consciousness once again fell into darkness.</p><p></p><p>He did not immediately enter the next test scene.</p><p></p><p>Instead, scene after scene, like a carousel, surged into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was everything that really happened in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm in Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already known.</p><p></p><p>But this time, there were some different images.</p><p></p><p>On the ruins of Ningyuan City, Mr. Bai stood in a daze.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, as if silently questioning.</p><p></p><p>An unusual aura began to appear on his body.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a vague feeling.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mr. Bai seemed to have gained the gaze of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Although he still had the cultivation of a mortal, he already had the momentum of being the center of the world.</p><p></p><p>"This is the fate that belongs to the protagonist."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed inexplicably in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Reviving from the darkness again, the scene in front of Li Fan was, as expected, the change of the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>The scene of Little Black, who had not yet been born, inside the bird egg.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 643</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Not only were those mortal islands easily destroyed. Even those large islands with island protection arrays and monks guarding them were as fragile as paper, instantly turning into ashes in the face of terrifying destructive power.</p><p></p><p>Even the monks guarding the islands did not offer any resistance and disappeared completely in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The phenomenon of the fallen monks only lasted for a moment, quickly overshadowed by the dense black aura in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The giant waves continued to sweep across, and the original huge black fireball, in the astonishing collision, turned into tens of millions of black streams of light.</p><p></p><p>From the point of impact, they flew whistling in various directions towards the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying scene first left the monks in the city of Clouds momentarily stunned. Then they could not contain themselves, letting out cries of fear one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Clan Chief above! Is this the arrival of the apocalypse?"</p><p></p><p>"A great calamity! A terrifying great calamity is here!"</p><p></p><p>"Why was there no warning from the Thousand Immortals League about such a large meteor? What are they doing!"</p><p></p><p>Some monks were in fear, some were frenzied, some were furious. Yet there were still some monks who maintained confidence in the Thousand Immortals League.</p><p></p><p>They believed it was just a small meteorological disaster, even though the terrifying tsunami was enough to destroy all the islands in the Sea of Clouds. The city of Clouds, hanging high in the sky, should be able to remain unscathed.</p><p></p><p>However, there were monks whose priority was to save their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the first thought that flashed through their minds was to run.</p><p></p><p>However, when they rushed to the transmission square, they found something that horrified them.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why are all the transmission arrays ineffective!"</p><p></p><p>"We're done for! Nowhere to escape, we're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"Conspiracy, it must be a conspiracy of the Thousand Immortals League!"</p><p></p><p>The monks in the square were in chaos, and their shouting quickly spread panic throughout the entire city of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>However, moments later, all the monks in the city knew about the malfunctioning transmission arrays.</p><p></p><p>Watching the approaching tsunami, the monks couldn't help but fall into panic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Zhenghao was unusually calm. Even though there was some fear in his heart, he managed to suppress it temporarily through self-convincing.</p><p></p><p>"This terrifying power should be the soul of heaven and earth. I wonder when it will manifest its form? It is said that the true form of the soul of heaven and earth is humanoid."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"It should be fine. Since Master Superintendent could deduce the arrival of the soul of heaven and earth in advance, there should have been preparations made long ago."</p><p></p><p>He comforted himself in this way.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, shortly after he had such thoughts, Li Fan's voice suddenly echoed throughout the city of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Monks, there's no need to panic! With Lord Gloomless Immortal present, there will be no trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"You just need to stay in the city!"</p><p></p><p>"The Strategy Hall should fully activate the defense array to counter the disaster! The Martial Arts Hall team, gather to maintain order!"</p><p></p><p>The calm voice continued to echo, as if the monks had found a backbone, they instantly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a light curtain instantly enveloped the entire city of Clouds, and the monks began to reinforce and arrange various formation points.</p><p></p><p>Order briefly returned to the city of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the black streams of light in the sky and the surging tsunami, Li Fan's gaze shifted to the nearby Gloomless Immortal in white.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw the seriousness on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Black flames? Has Crimson Flame been strengthened, or are there other souls of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>"Inky Flame?"</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was somewhat surprised by the unexpected turn of events in this world, the overall result was still within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>In the previous few worlds, Crimson Flame descended according to its responsibility, causing the sea to burn and bringing about the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>And after Crimson Flame was refined by the monks, it would trigger a fierce backlash from the will of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the annihilating Ink Slaughter would completely turn the Sea of Clouds into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, due to the battles of Tianyi, the Master, and the Fisherman, the predetermined end of the world had been greatly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Flame burning the sea still leaves room for maneuver."</p><p></p><p>"And if from the beginning the will of heaven and earth held the intention of complete destruction, then it wouldn't be the feeble blacksmith Crimson Flame descending."</p><p></p><p>"It would be replaced by a stronger soul of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Destiny, change, predestination..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts were spinning with a hint of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"The will of heaven and earth is not unchanging, but dynamically changing according to actual circumstances."</p><p></p><p>"But the purpose remains the same..."</p><p></p><p>"The reasons for this may not only be due to the monks' plundering of heaven and earth, but also with the group led by the Tianyi master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes sparkled.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was contemplating, a wave was about to reach beneath the city of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>Even though the city of Clouds was high above the clouds and a few hundred meters of waves seemed inconsequential, the monks inside the city, for some reason, all experienced an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, their premonitions were accurate.</p><p></p><p>When the huge wave with black flames reached beneath the city of Clouds, it seemed to come alive, instantly changing its trajectory as if alive.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly swept upward towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Cries of astonishment echoed one after another.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gloomless Immortal, who had been silently observing, finally took action.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the city of Clouds, undulating group of mountains suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Like a Great Wall, it directly blocked the wave.</p><p></p><p>The wave was obstructed and fell back to the sea.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan, who had witnessed Gloomless Immortal exerting this much force, could see that what seemed like a casual blow was actually using almost half of Gloomless's strength.</p><p></p><p>"So strong?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the slight tremor underfoot, Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although he was just a clone at this moment, his body contained three fully-powered divine skills passed on by his true self.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to deceive others at a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>The reason for doing so was to fully confirm the news of the fall of the Tianji Sect monk Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that even in the end-time calamity of burning the sea, the Thousand Immortals League would surely find out what had happened before the Sea of Clouds was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the performance had to be convincing, without exposing any loopholes.</p><p></p><p>"Now is not yet the time to make a move."</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Flame... no, where is the true form of Ink Flame now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared closely at the sea of clouds, trying to find any clues.</p><p></p><p>And the temporarily blocked wave by Gloomless Immortal, like a dormant flag, returned to the sea surface and fell into calmness.</p><p></p><p>What followed was the myriad streams of black flame.</p><p></p><p>Like sentient beings, seeing the wave attack being blocked, they suddenly changed their original trajectory.</p><p></p><p>All of them collectively flew towards the city of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>This magnificent scene caused all the monks to exclaim in unison.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>When the first stream of fire collided violently with the protective barrier, the entire city of Clouds trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>More astonishingly, with just one strike, there were faint cracks on the protective shield.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

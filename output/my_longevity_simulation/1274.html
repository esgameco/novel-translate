            <p>Chapter 1271: The Truth in Falsehood</p><p></p><p>After casually eliminating Sun Luyao, Li Fan's consciousness still stood silently in this mysterious space, his expression cold and stern as he pondered quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Huan Zhen, Huan Zhen, Huan Zhen..." He kept muttering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene became blurred and dimmed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it brightened up again.</p><p></p><p>"Truth becomes falsehood when falsehood is truth."</p><p></p><p>Seven large characters, emanating a calm, seemingly eternal radiance, appeared before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was a sentence that appeared every time he activated [Huan Zhen]. After hundreds of cycles, he was already very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in the eyes of Li Fan who had discovered the deepest secret hidden in the primordial protective formation of the Xuanhuang Realm, these seven characters took on a completely different meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Falsehood is truth, falsehood is truth..."</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had once again become Li Taishi, who single-handedly covered the sky in the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>When the cornerstone of the world's reality was shaken and on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan once again let out a gloomy and deep laugh.</p><p></p><p>Time and time again, the endless variables born from the Xuanhuang Realm, the Darkest Starry Sea, and even beyond the starry sea, nourished his own body.</p><p></p><p>It was undeniable that the tip of the iceberg revealed by the primordial protective formation showed Li Fan a certain possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Truth and falsehood."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether he had really fallen into such a situation, what Li Fan could be extremely grateful for was that the [Restart] button, the eternal constant amidst endless variables, had always been in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>It made one's heart shudder at the thought and difficult to accept.</p><p></p><p>[Huan Zhen] might essentially transcend the arrangement of the immortal realm over the lower realms, but it could also be a part of the device left by the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>When the boundary between reality and illusion could not be distinguished or verified.</p><p></p><p>The only thing one could do was to tightly grasp that unchanging anchor.</p><p></p><p>So to unravel the answer to the riddle, what needed to be done was still not much different from the immortal freedom that Li Fan had been desperately pursuing before.</p><p></p><p>"Who is real, and who is false?"</p><p></p><p>But now that he thought about it, the additional variables outside the high walls might not have been intentionally displayed for the reorganized world after Huan Zhen.</p><p></p><p>The truth was hard to discern.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"I am the only one!"</p><p></p><p>For the current Li Fan, this belonged to an existence that could not be verified.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had tried to determine the specific scope of influence of Huan Zhen by guiding the variables beyond the Darkest Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, none of this matters at all. As long as I always control the only button, I am the truth!"</p><p></p><p>To achieve transcendence.</p><p></p><p>If he discovered an existence that could compete with him for the button, then he would kill it.</p><p></p><p>When he found the ultimate end to everything, the answer would naturally be revealed.</p><p></p><p>Now, for Li Fan, besides Chuanfa and Tianyi, there was one more obstacle standing in his way forward.</p><p></p><p>An unknown existence that posed an even greater threat, could not be ignored, and urgently needed to be resolved.</p><p></p><p>That was the mysterious person who had stolen the Nine-Star Red Pearl, one of the eyes of the Xuanhuang primordial protective formation.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine-Star Red Pearl should record all the characteristic information of the living beings in Xuanhuang before the destruction of the protective formation. With the Red Pearl in hand, it shouldn't be difficult to deduce the same conjecture as me."</p><p></p><p>"In the face of such a huge gap in strength, the wise thing to do is to hide first before finding a countermeasure."</p><p></p><p>"Or, when he is certain that the immortal realm has truly perished, with the divine artifact in hand, he will inevitably give rise to unprecedented ambitions and secretly make other arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze swept over the empty formation center here.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps some clues can be gleaned from the other pivots of the original grand formation."</p><p></p><p>However, with the Infinite Mirror Spirit now destroyed, it was beyond his power to continue the investigation.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait until the next life.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense shook his head slightly, and his figure turned into a black line, leaving from underground.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the secret room of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan, who had rushed back from the outside world without regard for anything, overwhelmed by an unspeakable sadness welling up in his heart and tears unknowingly flowing, burst into the basement. Seeing the familiar Infinite Mirror floating quietly ahead, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother?" </p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan called out softly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's figure immediately emerged from the Infinite Mirror: "Brother, you're looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Sun Luyao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's spirit suddenly became dazed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was stunned for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he said blankly, "It's nothing. Maybe I've been too tired lately and have become a bit paranoid."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao showed concern, "Brother, you need to take care of your health. The future of the Sun family still depends on you."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>After carefully instructing, he left the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>What Sun Luyuan didn't know was that Sun Luyao didn't do as he had always done before: gazing in the direction where his elder brother's figure disappeared, seeing him off.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the fluctuations in his expression vanished in an instant, and he entered the Infinite Mirror without any reluctance.</p><p></p><p>The moment the real Sun Luyao died, the wisp of his spirit that he left behind also lost its source.</p><p></p><p>It was integrated into the counterfeit Infinite Mirror, becoming an existence that would only respond mechanically.</p><p></p><p>Although the degree of mechanization was slightly more realistic, it was ultimately not a real life.</p><p></p><p>Not the real Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Li Fan's divine sense returned with the empty shell of the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Without the spirit of the artifact, I'll create it myself."</p><p></p><p>After summoning the wisp of Sun Luyao's remnant spirit and carefully observing it, Li Fan coldly decided in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This wisp of spirit contained Sun Luyao's complete memories from when he was alive.</p><p></p><p>It was his personality and way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, it was entirely possible to "resurrect" him.</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't have treasures like the Indefinite Copper Ring or the Nine-Star Red Pearl on hand."</p><p></p><p>"But there's no need to consider the body. It's just a true recreation of a wisp of spirit, which makes the actual operation a bit easier."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the many details of the formation, with the constant deduction of the Doomsday Dissociation Disk, a simplified version of part of the original boundary-protecting grand formation slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Simulating the Myriad Living Beings."</p><p></p><p>"This name is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan named the formation according to the naming method of the three immortal-level formations he had already mastered.</p><p></p><p>Then he tried to begin "creating" and "resurrecting" Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>To be safe, Li Fan first divided Sun Luyao's remnant spirit into several portions for preservation.</p><p></p><p>Then he took one of them and invested it into the simplified simulation formation.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious and extraordinary aura gradually emanated from the formation.</p><p></p><p>As the formation slowly operated, Sun Luyao's figure reappeared in a beam of luminous white light.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had a few more traces of liveliness, and his communication with Li Fan was very smooth.</p><p></p><p>In the span of a few breaths, the two exchanged millions of times with their spiritual senses, without a single instance of revealing a flaw that shouldn't be there.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still shook his head slightly, unsatisfied, and destroyed it.</p><p></p><p>"Too real. To the point of being a bit fake."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 522</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Hmm? Junior Brother, what's wrong with you?" She glanced at Li Fan and spoke gently, "We have lived and died together for over a hundred years. Is there anything we can't be candid about with each other?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing." Li Fan shrugged casually and smiled, "Junior Sister, just go ahead. Remember, no matter what you do, I will support you."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao smiled playfully and walked into the main hall of the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The heavy doors closed with a bang. Li Fan watched Senior Sister Zhao's disappearing figure, a hint of complexity passing unnoticed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Rather than patiently waiting outside the main hall, he returned to Penglai Peak where he and Senior Sister Zhao lived, looting all the valuable items in their cave.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, pretending to be on inspection duty, he approached the exit near the formation protecting the sect.</p><p></p><p>Although his behavior seemed no different from that of an ordinary disciple, Li Fan was already prepared to escape at any moment.</p><p></p><p>It was not because he wanted to betray the sect, but because...</p><p></p><p>During the hundred years on the mountain, Li Fan accidentally discovered that Senior Sister Zhao was secretly collecting the blood of cultivators and even ordinary people infected with the "Immortal Plague."</p><p></p><p>Although she only took a drop each time, her actions were extremely discreet.</p><p></p><p>But how could Li Fan, who had spent so much time with her, fail to notice?</p><p></p><p>Initially, each time she collected a blood sample, Senior Sister Zhao would fall seriously ill. With Li Fan's careful care and an ample supply of elixirs to fortify her body, she managed to pull through safely.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan inquired about the reason, she just joked that she wanted to try reversing the "Immortal Plague" and achieve immortality directly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally didn't believe her.</p><p></p><p>But knowing Senior Sister Zhao's character, once she made a decision, even her companion of a hundred years like him could not dissuade her.</p><p></p><p>So, he didn't bother stopping her, just reminding her, "Health comes first."</p><p></p><p>Later, she seemed to have indeed taken Li Fan's advice seriously and gradually stopped collecting blood samples.</p><p></p><p>The intervals of illness became shorter, and the symptoms of infection became lighter each time.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan knew that it was all a fa√ßade.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao had never really given up her crazy actions.</p><p></p><p>And the reason she appeared normal was probably because she had found a way to isolate the influence of the "Immortal Plague."</p><p></p><p>Over the years, despite staying in the same place, Senior Sister Zhao's cultivation had become so profound that Li Fan could no longer comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>The various auras inadvertently emanating from her occasionally made Li Fan secretly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Even though he could be sure that Senior Sister Zhao did not intend to harm him, Li Fan still felt an inexplicable sense of danger in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't say it, Li Fan could guess it. She was probably collecting such a large amount of blood containing the power of the "Immortal Plague" to deal with the sect leader, Ji Changxi, of the Grand Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The intentional suppression over the past hundred years had pushed Senior Sister Zhao's dissatisfaction with the sect leader to its limit.</p><p></p><p>In the sense of "obstructing my path, I will not rest until I succeed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that the frenzied Senior Sister Zhao was not impossible to do such a rebellious act.</p><p></p><p>Just before she entered the main hall of the sect, the hint of killing intent that flashed in her eyes was definitely not a delusion of Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>"Although Ji Changxi has cultivated for over six hundred years, his profound abilities and mysterious methods are unfathomable. But after all, he has not yet reached the realm of immortality."</p><p></p><p>Judging from Senior Sister Zhao's talent and actual strength, combined with the assistance of the "Immortal Plague," there might be a chance of success.</p><p></p><p>However, even if she narrowly won, what then? Killing Ji Changxi would mean facing over a dozen elders of the sect, and even the two immortal elders who never appeared.</p><p></p><p>Could she really eliminate them all?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was puzzled as to why Senior Sister Zhao made such a decision.</p><p></p><p>Whether successful or not, the entire Grand Dao Sect would be aware of it.</p><p></p><p>By then, not only would she face the siege of the whole sect, but Li Fan, her companion of a hundred years, likely wouldn't be spared either.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan, being prepared, was ready to flee early.</p><p></p><p>As for why he hadn't left yet, it was purely to see if any miracles would happen.</p><p></p><p>As time passed little by little...</p><p></p><p>Due to Ji Changxi's previous order that he and Daozi had important matters to discuss and should not be disturbed, the main hall of the sect remained closed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gazed at the mountaintop from a distance, feeling increasingly uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later...</p><p></p><p>The doors of the main hall slowly opened, causing Li Fan's breath to stagnate suddenly.</p><p></p><p>However, something entirely unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi was in front, and Senior Sister Zhao was behind.</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't they fight to the death? Did I misunderstand something?" Surprised in his heart, Li Fan squinted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the situation where Senior Sister Zhao broke the net and fought desperately not happen, but the relationship between the two also seemed much more harmonious than before.</p><p></p><p>Even at the end, when she was leaving, Ji Changxi patted her shoulder encouragingly.</p><p></p><p>To Li Fan's surprise, Senior Sister Zhao calmly accepted the gesture without any strange expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Li Fan's mind was slightly shocked, filled with many questions.</p><p></p><p>In the past, except for himself, Senior Sister Zhao had always been very resistant to physical contact with others.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Feeling something amiss, numerous thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't think it through in time.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that there was something he had forgotten, Li Fan hurried back to Penglai Peak while Senior Sister Zhao had not yet returned, and returned everything to its original place.</p><p></p><p>When Senior Sister Zhao returned, she didn't notice anything abnormal in their cave.</p><p></p><p>After all, they hadn't been back to this "home" for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, we've been away for a hundred years, and we have been busy with trivial matters, it seems like it's been a long time since we've been intimate. How about...?" Li Fan tentatively invited her for dual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A hint of nostalgia flashed in Senior Sister Zhao's eyes, and with a charming look, she gladly agreed.</p><p></p><p>After a soul-stirring session, Li Fan's doubts faded away.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the sect leader summon you this time, what's the matter?" Li Fan held Senior Sister Zhao's flawless body in his arms and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"He said that soon, he will pass on the position of the Grand Dao Sect's leader to me. He wants me to be prepared in advance," Senior Sister Zhao replied in a calm tone, showing no emotion.</p><p></p><p>As if she was inheriting not the position of the head of the Ten Sects of Immortal Path but some trivial toy.</p><p></p><p>However, this seemingly casual statement that she didn't care about at all, when it reached Li Fan's ears, it was like thunder, shaking his brain, temporarily losing his ability to think.</p><p></p><p>"Then, what about the 'Suppression of Heaven Grand Dao Scripture'?" Li Fan, who was blank in the head, couldn't help but subconsciously ask.</p>

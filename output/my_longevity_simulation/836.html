        <h1>Chapter 836</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Title: The Capture of the Mostone</p><p></p><p>With the construction of the Multiverse Alliance headquarters under the direction of Oudao Zi, things were gradually getting on track. The continuous feedback of cultivation from the Likai and Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association had also allowed Li Fan to successfully break through his realm.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he did not encounter the restraint of the Heavenly Tribulation this time. He quickly returned to the late Golden Core stage. Based on the current accelerating trend, it was believed that the distance to perfection was not far away.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to consider the matter of merging with Tianyang," Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a [Fruit of True Temptation] and pondered for a moment. In the end, he still summoned Tianyang and let him eat the fruit. Tianyang didn't ask why and swallowed the crystal clear Fruit of True Temptation without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Good, there's no time to waste. Let's set off now. This time, I have prepared a big gift for you!" Only then did Li Fan put his mind at ease. Looking at Tianyang, he said with some gratification.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang tilted his head, seeming not to quite understand the meaning behind Li Fan's words. Li Fan didn't mind. He still commanded Lin Ling, left the Lingmu Realm, and headed straight for the destination.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan's target was the Worldsoul [Mostone]. Being able to share the same prefix as Mosha, Mostone's strength was beyond doubt. The current Mostone had just been born not long ago. Hidden underground in Qiling State, it was not yet known to the world.</p><p></p><p>It was thanks to Mr. Bai that Li Fan was able to know about the existence of Mostone at this point in time. If Mosha's heavenly duty was to exterminate everything, then Mostone's mission was to fill the void and cavities brought about by the destruction.</p><p></p><p>Deep underground in Qiling State, some terrible catastrophe had occurred, causing large areas of void cavities to appear. It was as if the depths of the earth had been continuously gnawed by insects, already riddled with holes. If there was no external intervention, it would not be long before Qiling State would be destroyed in a shocking collapse.</p><p></p><p>The birth of Mostone was to prevent this disaster from happening. Its ability was to generate black, stone-like hard substances to fill the void cavities and repair the gnawed and destroyed space.</p><p></p><p>But if Mostone's ability was limited to this, Li Fan would not have set his sights on it. In addition to "repairing", Mostone had another absolutely powerful ability - "space shattering".</p><p></p><p>The so-called "Mostone" did not refer to stones, but a kind of power that could affect and transform space. This was only a part of the information synchronized from Mr. Bai's memory. It was believed that when Tianyang truly refined and integrated with Mostone, he would be able to awaken more abilities.</p><p></p><p>As for how Li Fan would deal with such a powerful Worldsoul... Before the group traveled through the earth veins and quickly arrived underground in Qiling State, Li Fan had already conducted a simulated deduction in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dao-Transforming Stone in his mind was only of medium grade, Li Fan believed that as long as there were no more variables involved, this hunt should be under his control from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>When the three emerged from the surging earth veins, they also saw the shocking endless cavities ahead. Intermittently, it looked like the traces left by a twisted long worm drilling and destroying.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Even the power of the earth's veins is severed here." Li Fan became alert in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Not seeing Moshi's figure for the time being, the three of them did not advance rashly.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they set up an array outside the range of this hollow space.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the Xuantian Fengling Array that Hongxi used to control the enhanced version of Chiyanhuo in the 115th lifetime!</p><p></p><p>Tianxuan Suoling, Xuantian Fengling.</p><p></p><p>One body with two sides, different paths but the same destination.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan mastered the entire array diagram of the Tianxuan Suoling Array, even though he was not familiar with the Xuantian Fengling Array before.</p><p></p><p>But when this world had the [Ultimate Separation Disc] as a great weapon.</p><p></p><p>Under the principle of "understanding one, understanding all".</p><p></p><p>He still deduced an array that could achieve the same effect as [Xuantian Fengling].</p><p></p><p>Lacking the most critical component, the Tianxuan Mirror, the power would naturally be weakened.</p><p></p><p>But the Ultimate Separation Disc was, after all, the supreme creation of two Tianxuan secondary entities superimposed on each other.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was an array specialization.</p><p></p><p>With its enhancement, maintaining an array that could reduce the power of the world's soul...</p><p></p><p>It was still achievable.</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible to be like Hongxi before, just by showing the array, completely depriving the world's soul of its ability to act."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently pondered while arranging the array.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang knew nothing about arrays, and the two could only stare at each other and watch from the side.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had continuously arranged arrays for several decades, and had already imprinted how to quickly arrange arrays into his instincts.</p><p></p><p>After more than a month, a huge modified Xuantian Fengling Array that covered the entire underground hollow cave area was completed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, it was necessary to set up an array to block the upcoming battle fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>As well as sealing the space to eliminate the possibility of Moshi escaping when the situation was unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of space was not Li Fan's forte.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the help of many precious materials obtained from the Five Elders Association, it was finally completed with difficulty after a small half month.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also let Lin Ling ask the Earth Vein Ancient Tree for help.</p><p></p><p>With the powerful power of the earth veins, this place was sealed again.</p><p></p><p>When the real fight started later, they deliberately made some movements to cover up the fluctuations that might leak out.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Lin Ling's request, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree was a little hesitant at first.</p><p></p><p>However, after promising to bring some heavenly dew and earthly nectar as compensation for the other party in the future.</p><p></p><p>She reluctantly agreed.</p><p></p><p>Meeting Lin Ling twice with a short interval.</p><p></p><p>Seeing with her own eyes that her strength had skyrocketed in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Vein Ancient Tree was naturally curious about this heavenly dew and earthly nectar.</p><p></p><p>Having secured outside help, the next thing Li Fan had to do was to communicate with Lin Ling and Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>In the battle of merging Dao, he, with only Golden Core cultivation, naturally could not risk his life.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang were the main fighters, while Li Fan had to hide far away.</p><p></p><p>Commanding from behind.</p><p></p><p>Given that these two people's brains were not very bright.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained to them in detail the various situations they might encounter in the upcoming battle.</p><p></p><p>Then he temporarily connected the thoughts of the three people together through the array.</p><p></p><p>He also handed them many treasures prepared in advance for unexpected needs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In this way, Li Fan quietly retreated.</p><p></p><p>With a clap of his hands, he opened the array layers by layers.</p><p></p><p>"With such thorough preparations, if you still can't defeat a small Moshi. Then even if you are killed in return, you can't blame me."</p><p></p><p>As a strange fluctuation spread towards the hollow cave in the void.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 551</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Endowed with extraordinary talent, among the young generation of the Long family, he was the most outstanding.</p><p></p><p>From the peak of Qi Refinement to Nascent Soul in just over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, due to the rarity of the soul of heaven and earth, such a genius could only be trapped in the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>Another hundred years passed, and today finally brought some light.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Long, I wonder where Brother Jiuyuan obtained the soul of heaven and earth for the joining ceremony?" </p><p></p><p>After a passionate celebration, the cultivators present couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>Long Yaoyou hesitated for a moment, but considering they were all allies and his elder brother had already succeeded in the joining, the existence of the soul of heaven and earth was no longer a secret.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the curious and hopeful gazes of everyone, Long Yaoyou couldn't contain his pride and slowly said, "It should be destined for my brother!"</p><p></p><p>"He guarded the Tianling Prefecture for more than thirty years and once during a mission, he discovered a strange scene in a deep mountain."</p><p></p><p>"The mountain appeared no different from usual peaks, but the previously hard rocks inside turned into black, sticky mud."</p><p></p><p>"The mud emitted an unknown aura; any creature that inadvertently entered, even magical weapons or Taoist methods, would be devoured and assimilated, disappearing without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"In theory, such a dangerous area would make any sentient being feel uneasy and subconsciously avoid it. But my brother discovered something strange."</p><p></p><p>Here, Long Yaoyou paused, seemingly intentionally building suspense. Seeing the eager expressions of the cultivators present, he continued with some satisfaction, "All creatures around the Black Mire rushed into it like moths to a flame, regardless of their lives."</p><p></p><p>"Even cultivators were no exception. My brother's will was strong, but staying around the Black Mire for too long almost made him unable to resist entering."</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators present immediately realized and exclaimed, "A fatal temptation..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Black Mire is the soul of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Long Yaoyou nodded slightly, "Exactly! My brother had thought about this as well. He had been trapped in the Nascent Soul realm for many years, so naturally, he was ecstatic."</p><p></p><p>"But he also knew that the soul of heaven and earth embodies laws and is not easy to deal with. So he forcibly contained his restlessness and withdrew."</p><p></p><p>"Sealing the entrance of the mountain with a secret method, he quietly returned to Tianling City."</p><p></p><p>"Without alarming anyone, he secretly prepared alone."</p><p></p><p>"After about half a month of preparation, Brother, well-prepared, made an excuse to return to the deep mountains."</p><p></p><p>"Using an array to block the surroundings of the mountain to prevent others from noticing, he attempted to attack the Black Mire."</p><p></p><p>"But just like before, all attacks were ineffective and stirred no reaction."</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Long Yaoyou seemed to be recalling Long Jiuyuan’s tale, "For three days straight, my brother tried various methods but couldn't harm the Black Mire in any way."</p><p></p><p>"At that moment, my brother recalled scenes from his years of being trapped in the Nascent Soul realm and made a firm decision."</p><p></p><p>With a determined stance, he leaped into the Black Mire!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present gasped in shock. They asked themselves if they would have the courage to do the same.</p><p></p><p>Who knew what was in the Black Mire? Jumping in like that, was it a death sentence?</p><p></p><p>Even if the joining was unsuccessful, having Nascent Soul cultivation could still dominate, but risking life and death was beyond anything else.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Long Jiuyuan dared to do so!</p><p></p><p>While marveling at him, they also deeply respected him from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"I have long heard that Long Jiuyuan is exceptionally brave, surpassing ordinary people. Now, it seems the rumors were not exaggerated; in fact, they might have underestimated Brother Jiuyuan!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Brother Jiuyuan, at the Nascent Soul level, can stand toe to toe with many Dao Masters!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's an honor for us to call him Brother Jiuyuan!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As they praised Long Jiuyuan, Long Yaoyou also beamed with pride, knowing their unbreakable bond as blood brothers.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Long Yaoyou cleared his throat and continued, "Once inside the Black Mire, the defensive magical artifacts on my brother's body were rapidly depleted at an alarming rate."</p><p></p><p>"These were specially crafted by a Dao friend skilled in artifact refining."</p><p></p><p>"If it were ordinary protective artifacts bought from the Sky Mirror, they would have likely eroded by now."</p><p></p><p>"With little safety time remaining, my brother remained composed. Instead of panicking like a headless fly, he closed his eyes, calmed his mind, and sensed the changes in the Black Mire."</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mire resembled a deep, dark ocean without any signs of life except for my brother. Yet somehow, he faintly felt periodic vibrations like waves."</p><p></p><p>Following these vibrations, my brother explored deeper into the Black Mire.</p><p></p><p>When all his protective artifacts were almost depleted, he finally found the source of these disturbances!</p><p></p><p>At this critical moment, Long Yaoyou suddenly stopped, a strange glint passing through his eyes. He then lowered his voice and said to the others, "In the center of this Black Mire, you can vaguely see a blurry black figure."</p><p></p><p>"Not a cultivator but a humanoid figure formed from the distorted, murky black mud of the mire."</p><p></p><p>"The soul of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>However, what shocked my brother the most was not only the presence of the soul of heaven and earth but another entity in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Long Yaoyou revealed the answer, "It seems to be a broken sword. The overwhelming murderous aura it contains made even my brother, who had slain numerous cultivators at the Nascent Soul level, feel unsettled."</p><p></p><p>"The broken sword wriggled violently, and the Black Mire acted as a cage, trapping it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene described by Long Yaoyou left everyone in awe, speculating about the origin of the broken sword.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, flying towards a certain place, Li Fan suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>"Tiansha Sword?！"</p>

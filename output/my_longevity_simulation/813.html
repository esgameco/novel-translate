        <h1>Chapter 813</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A teenage boy in his early teens, full of youthful vigor. It is the age most easily incited.</p><p></p><p>And Shang Tianci was also under the influence of Li Fan's "Blood Lineage" technique, trusting him completely.</p><p></p><p>What kind of person is Li Fan? When he was a mortal, he could easily deceive many people into willingly giving their lives for him.</p><p></p><p>So without much effort, Shang Tianci was successfully brainwashed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance is utterly corrupt. We cultivators should take it upon ourselves to overthrow them."</p><p></p><p>"Only then will a wonderful era of freedom in cultivation techniques truly arrive!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci only felt his blood boiling, filled with an unprecedented sense of supreme mission that he never had before.</p><p></p><p>As for what to do after overthrowing the Myriad Immortals Alliance,</p><p></p><p>And whether it would truly be possible to achieve freedom in cultivation techniques for cultivators,</p><p></p><p>These were not within his scope of consideration.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance is powerful, and our strength is still very weak. We need to take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"The first thing to do is to unite all the forces that can be united. Such as the Xuanhuang Youli Dongtian, the world..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci's eyes lit up: "An alliance across myriad worlds, how wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to instill various ideas in him.</p><p></p><p>However, this process was suddenly interrupted by an inexplicably oppressive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The two simultaneously raised their heads and looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Tianlaos han, the tallest mountain range among the Nine Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Thus, their line of sight could penetrate through most of the state, seeing the border where countless cultivators suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>"That is..." Shang Tianci said in shock.</p><p></p><p>The attire of those cultivators was very different from the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They clearly belonged to the other major force in Xuanhuang, the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, foreign enemies are invading. I must immediately..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was about to transfer through the Tianjing Treasure Gourd, but after looking around, he couldn't find his gourd.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he remember that the gourd was still in Li Fan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!" </p><p></p><p>He was about to say something, but was stopped by Li Fan with one hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance is corrupt. The Five Elders Society is no good either."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Venerable Ones go against the principles of heaven and earth, deceiving the residents within the realm."</p><p></p><p>"The more fiercely they fight, the more advantageous it is for us."</p><p></p><p>"It's called driving out the wolf and swallowing the tiger, sitting on the mountain and watching the fight!" Li Fan's words were very gloomy.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful consideration, he ultimately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The moment the cultivators of the Five Elders Society appeared on the land of the Nine Mountains State,</p><p></p><p>Chaos also suddenly erupted in various parts of the Nine Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators wearing the attire of the Myriad Immortals Alliance rose up and attacked the Nine Mountains Garrison Cities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed that as time passed, the number of rebelling cultivators was also increasing.</p><p></p><p>"You see, the Myriad Immortals Alliance is unpopular. As long as someone rises up and raises their arms high, there will immediately be countless responders!" Li Fan took the opportunity to say.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Shang Tianci slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Five Elders Society was not entirely useless.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, this sudden attack demonstrated their organizational capabilities very well.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, the vast Nine Mountains State had already fallen by more than half.</p><p></p><p>The army of the Five Elders Society advanced rapidly. While sending out personnel to take over the Nine Mountains Garrison Cities, they continued to advance towards the final Tianchang Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield was chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tianci, the two of them, had been hiding on the top of Tianlao Mountain the whole time, and had not been discovered by others in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>As the most important city in the Nine Mountains, Tianchang City not only had a Harmonious Dao cultivator stationed there,</p><p></p><p>But also had the existence of the Myriad Laws Business Association.</p><p></p><p>If the Myriad Laws Business Association put in effort to help defend, they might be able to hold out until reinforcements from the Myriad Immortals Alliance arrived.</p><p></p><p>However, it was very...</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, the Wanfa Chamber of Commerce was the one calling the shots.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, none of their personnel came out to fight.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Tian Chang, facing the siege of three Hedao sent by the Five Elders Association, was already somewhat overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the defeat of the Wanxian Alliance is already set in stone. It's time for us to leave as well," Li Fan, who had been watching the show for a long time, suddenly stood up and said.</p><p></p><p>"But before we leave, we should leave something behind to prove that we were here."</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw a jade slip over.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang, having received the order, caught the jade slip and held it tightly in his palm.</p><p></p><p>What flew along was not just the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>It also included Tian Yang's entire palm!</p><p></p><p>Following the palm, a red and black tail flame erupted.</p><p></p><p>The speed suddenly increased by several times.</p><p></p><p>Like a shooting star, it quickly flew over the Nine Mountains State, heading straight for the target.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan patted Shang Tianci's shoulder, not saying a word, only returning the Tianjing Treasure Gourd.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci felt something in his heart, and suddenly understood the other party's intention.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, in an instant, a strange fluctuation enveloped the two.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the figures of the two disappeared from the top of Tianlao Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Above Tianchang City.</p><p></p><p>The three Hedao from the Five Elders Association who were besieging the Tianchang Guardian, Qingyu Immortal Venerable, suddenly had slight changes in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the raging fire that was rapidly flying towards them.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking it was the Wanxian Alliance's hidden killing move.</p><p></p><p>However, after sweeping with their divine sense, they discovered that hidden within this ball of fire was actually a jade slip!</p><p></p><p>The three did not communicate, but their actions were surprisingly consistent.</p><p></p><p>A Hedao cultivator dressed in hemp clothes, looking like a middle-aged farmer, intercepted the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>After some inspection, the three narrowed their eyes in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Wanjie Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Helped us resolve the crisis of information leakage?"</p><p></p><p>"A method that can greatly reduce the effect of the Devouring Element White Fog and allow marching in the fog?"</p><p></p><p>Although the content contained in the jade slip was not much, the amount of information was extremely large.</p><p></p><p>Their divine senses instantly swept across the entire Nine Mountains State, but did not find the figure of the person who sent the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The three all showed very interested expressions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Taihua State.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tianci, without any signs, appeared on Mount Taixu, one of the Ten Veins of Taihua.</p><p></p><p>"Your Tianjing Gourd is truly wondrous indeed."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to achieve instant spatial shifting by borrowing the power of the earth veins?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, savoring the process of spatial traversal just now, exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"No, rather than saying it's the power of earth veins, it's more like directly achieving location changes through the Xuanhuang Realm's power."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly recalled the scene of Mr. Bai "strolling" that he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>There was a hidden realization in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although Mr. Bai had fallen, the various "abilities" that existed in the Xuanhuang Realm did not disappear because of this.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were scattered and inherited by all kinds of so-called geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"But even Mr. Bai, who could integrate the wonders of Xuanhuang into one, was no match for the Dharma Transmission."</p><p></p><p>"Let alone these geniuses."</p><p></p><p>"At most, they are just good ingredients in the eyes of the Dharma Transmission!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered the thoughts of the Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But Shang Tianci had no awareness of this.</p><p></p><p>He still introduced his twin treasure gourds to Li Fan in a show-off manner: "My companion wonders, there are two gourds."</p><p></p><p>"One purple and one cyan."</p><p></p><p>"You've already seen the cyan one, Senior. It can record mountain and water locations, and then freely shuttle between them."</p><p></p><p>"As for this purple gourd..."</p>

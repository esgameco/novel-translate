        <h1>Chapter 859</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Following the principle of sustainable overfishing, for the first time forming the bait of intention, Ji Shaoli did not choose any particularly outrageous targets. ɯoɔ˙xnɥs69 Bar Book 69 New</p><p></p><p>Although he also really wanted to see what would happen after White Mister, True Immortal, Luan, Ji, and even [Huan Zhen] formed the bait of intention.</p><p></p><p>But after all, the fishing pool is a fairy tool of the first grade, and its interior is even more mysterious and immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>If one insists on doing so, no one can say for sure whether some unspeakable monster will be caught.</p><p></p><p>Then, like the True Immortal of the 115th generation, the Xuanhuang Realm will be brutally destroyed with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>This world has just begun, and the layout has just begun to take effect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan currently has no intention of Huan Zhen.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps when this world comes to an end, it can be tried."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this first bait of intention, what Ji Shaoli visualized was the seven-colored divine light that Zhong Shentong had caught in the previous life!</p><p></p><p>If we talk about like attracts like, what could be more in line with this requirement than the item itself in the bright starry sky?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this is also an experiment.</p><p></p><p>If it is really as expected, for known items, it will be easier to catch them...</p><p></p><p>Then with the help of Huan Zhen, there is no doubt that the difficulty of fishing can be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>As long as the number of reincarnations and attempts is sufficient, a complete list of light group items in the fishing pool can be established.</p><p></p><p>Maybe, there will even be a day when this countless fishing pool will be completely emptied!</p><p></p><p>The most critical point is that the resource output of this fishing pool is completely independent and not affected by any other things in the Xuanhuang Realm. New 𝟼𝟿 Book Bar → 𝟼𝟿𝚜𝚑𝚞𝚡.𝚌𝚘𝚖</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's different plans in each life, leading to different historical trends, will not hinder the fishing pool from becoming the most stable magic weapon supply base.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to be of great significance.</p><p></p><p>Of course...</p><p></p><p>The premise of all this is that Li Fan's guess is correct.</p><p></p><p>In the bright starry sky of the fishing pool, the avatar Ji Shaoli's mind emerged, and the various characteristics of the seven-colored divine light displayed by Zhong Shentong before.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light, continuous and uninterrupted.</p><p></p><p>Not only is the killing power very amazing, but the escape speed is also terrifyingly fast.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment stage can be comparable to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seems to have a special function of protecting the owner.</p><p></p><p>In the 114th generation, Zhong Shentong was able to use the seven-colored divine light to freely shuttle in the white mist without being invaded by the Yuan-devouring white mist.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to be an all-in-one for attack, defense, and escape, with endless wonderful uses. Once obtained, there is no need for other magic weapons.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's experience, among all the scenes he has seen in the reincarnation of the worlds, the wonder of this seven-colored divine light is definitely ranked at the top.</p><p></p><p>Only the Foundation Establishment stage can have such performance.</p><p></p><p>What about Nascent Soul, Dao Integration, and even Eternal Life realm? Will this seven-colored divine light have even more unimaginable characteristics?</p><p></p><p>With Ji Shaoli's continuous visualization.</p><p></p><p>A blurred seven-colored light shadow gradually formed at the end of the hanging fishing line. New 𝟲𝟵 Book Bar → 𝟲𝟵𝘀𝗵𝘂𝘅.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p><p></p><p>Because he only knew its external appearance, and did not truly grasp it like Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>So the formed bait of intention is still a bit different from the actual seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>But even so, at the moment when the bait took shape, it was like a drop of water dripping into a pond.</p><p></p><p>Ripples quickly spread to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The countless light groups seemed to sense something and showed different changes one after another.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority were indifferent, as if they could not perceive it. These were basically mostly white.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, there were some blue light clusters within.</p><p></p><p>Some others, as if encountering their own kind, floated towards the bait of thought with a hint of confusion. These light clusters were a mix of blue and purple.</p><p></p><p>But after getting closer, most of them recognized it clearly.</p><p></p><p>They didn't take the bait.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli didn't pay attention to these low-quality light clusters.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he concentrated, watching for any gold or even higher quality light clusters being attracted over. </p><p></p><p>But just as Zhong Shentong had described, the range affected by the bait of thought was extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>The invisible ripples, after spreading out a certain range, rapidly decayed.</p><p></p><p>Eventually completely vanishing into the endless starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The result of this fishing attempt was also obvious.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't able to fish up the seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>What he caught was only a blue light cluster containing a defensive magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>Casually putting it away, Ji Shaoli wasn't discouraged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He just patiently waited for tomorrow to come.</p><p></p><p>This attempt, at least, confirmed that the method of visualizing what already exists in the fishing pool was indeed effective.</p><p></p><p>It's just that luck wasn't on his side, and he wasn't able to cast the rod into an area the seven-colored divine light could detect.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's like searching for a needle in the sea, I have enough room for trial and error. No rush."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that technique paired with the fishing pool also has a method for targeted casting."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli looked at the shallow yet abyssal pool water before him, silently pondering.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, if a cultivator with supreme talent, could they deduce the technique for manipulating this fishing pool based on need. Although it's a immortal artifact..."</p><p></p><p>"But in the end it's just an artifact. There should still be a big gap compared to a true immortal."</p><p></p><p>In Ji Shaoli's mind, a flash of a white figure couldn't help but appear.</p><p></p><p>In the following period of time, Ji Shaoli persisted in patiently trying.</p><p></p><p>The bait of thought never changed each time.</p><p></p><p>It was always the seven-colored divine light!</p><p></p><p>The light clusters in the fishing pool, as if truly possessing spirituality,</p><p></p><p>As the number of times the seven-colored divine light emitted its invisible fluctuations increased, those attracted and willing to take the bait also became fewer and fewer.</p><p></p><p>This also directly led to, in the beginning, Ji Shaoli could still fish up some blue light clusters.</p><p></p><p>But later on, blue light clusters became nearly extinct.</p><p></p><p>Even the probability of white light clusters appearing became less and less, the vast majority were empty rods!</p><p></p><p>This caused Zhong Shentong, who had been paying attention to Ji Shaoli's fishing progress, to silently shake his head.</p><p></p><p>But Ji Shaoli wasn't frustrated because of this.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, he gradually became delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because when all the wrong answers are eliminated, then what remains must be the only correct answer!</p><p></p><p>Thus, Ji Shaoli continued to pull up empty for another twenty days in a row.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Zhong Shentong watched Ji Shaoli slowly stand up by the pond, seemingly empty-handed again.</p><p></p><p>He finally couldn't help but speak words of consolation: "Fellow Daoist, you mustn't be discouraged. In the Dao of fishing, returning empty-handed is the norm. As long as you can endure the loneliness, one day, your luck will explode, and you'll fish up the big fish you desire."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's expression was calm: "What Fellow Daoist Zhong says is very true."</p><p></p><p>"I also deeply agree."</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't in vain that I sat here for over sixty days..."</p><p></p><p>"I've finally made a small gain."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the first part of what Ji Shaoli said, Zhong Shentong nodded frequently.</p><p></p><p>But the more he listened, the more he felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>A hint of bewilderment surfaced on his face.</p><p></p><p>But accompanied by the descent of a brilliant golden light, this bewilderment instantly turned into unbelievable shock.</p><p></p><p>In Ji Shaoli's hand, a golden light cluster emitted a dazzling radiance.</p>

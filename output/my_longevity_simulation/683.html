        <h1>Chapter 683</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"However, young master, speaking from the heart, the treasures that Master Fang refined this time are truly excellent. He put his heart into it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this from San Liu, Fang Zaiji immediately smiled with joy, "Of course, the Sect Master lent me the Medicine King's True Cauldron for research for such a long time, there should be some gains."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Watching the two bicker, Li Fan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fang, why not show me the treasures? I am a bit impatient." It was Xu Bai, the clone, who spoke.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan explored the realm of Xian with meteorites and comprehended the way of the sword for the past half a year, the clone remained in the realm of beast species, continuing to comprehend the principles of the five elements and the world.</p><p></p><p>This body was extremely compatible with the beast species realm, making comprehension easy. His talent was not inferior to any so-called prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Both of them were already used to the existence of the clone, so seeing Xu Bai suddenly appear in the secret room did not surprise them.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, please take a look."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's face showed a proud look as he waved his hand, and four orbs instantly appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Inside the orbs were a white robe, a folding fan, a sachet, and a jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>"The Pure Light Luminous Robe is made from rare materials such as Hundred Color Luminous Glass and Floating Light. It is impervious to dust and unaffected by calamities. It can ignore conventional attacks below the Convergence Realm. Even if a cultivator of the Convergence Realm wants to break through its defense, it would require some effort."</p><p></p><p>"The Shadowless Hundred Flowers Fan is made from materials such as Shadowless Stone and Tian Gorge Jade. It features a painting of hundreds of blossoms competing for beauty on the fan, but it actually seals hundreds of real flowers. It can choose and mix various floral scents at will. Its main use, however, is to create an illusion that attracts the enemy's attention in times of crisis. Meanwhile, the owner can quietly escape hundreds of miles away..."</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Bonds Silk Sachet, apart from its conventional storage function, can also contain female cultivators who are taken a liking to. Through the entanglements of the Thousand Bonds, day by day, their thoughts change, even if they were once sworn enemies, they can gradually change their minds and eventually fall in love with the owner of the Thousand Bonds Silk Sachet. Till death do us part."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji spoke incessantly, very excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and San Liu showed a hint of strangeness on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, the Celestial Hundred Vehicles Plate. Apart from its appearance, the mode of transportation is also very important. Using common methods like flight or sword control like ordinary cultivators would damage their demeanor. Inside this plate are sealed hundreds of various flying vehicles and boats. Every time you go out, you will have a dazzling choice."</p><p></p><p>"Each flying treasure has enough space reserved. Even if you load a dozen or twenty maidens, it'll be more than enough..."</p><p></p><p>"Cough, Mr. Fang, let's stop here."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face twitched, and the clone Xu Bai couldn't help but speak helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji noticed the slightly awkward atmosphere at this moment, looked around, and then cleverly directed Xu Bai to refine these four treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Refining with blood and divine thoughts not only binds the treasures to the owner, but when severely injured, these four treasures can also share the burden of the injuries together."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a short while, Xu Bai refined all these treasures.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a white robe and holding the folding fan, the sachet turned into a small chain hanging at the tip of the folding fan. The jade pendant was worn on the body.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai opened the folding fan, gently fanning it, enveloping himself in a radiant white light with a fragrance emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>"What a handsome and elegant young man." San Liu's eyes lit up at the sight and couldn't help but compliment.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, clothes make the man. Originally, Xu Bai was extremely handsome, with exceptional temperament. Now, under the carefully crafted treasures of Fang Zaiji, he looked like a celestial being, making people lose themselves at sight.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji couldn't help but admire slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, after a while, he frowned, "But I feel like something is missing."</p><p></p><p>San Liu was puzzled, "What's missing? I think it's already perfect."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji suddenly realized and clapped, "A beautiful woman accompanies the hero. Young Master's clone looks like a celestial being, without a beautiful woman by his side, it's truly a pity!"</p><p></p><p>San Liu, who usually retorted Fang Zaiji, surprisingly nodded slightly, showing agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled but remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"How is the implementation of the disciples' worldly plans?" After admiring Xu Bai's extraordinary beauty, Li Fan finally asked about business.</p><p></p><p>San Liu regained his focus and said seriously, "In the past half a year, nearly two hundred disciples have left the Longevity Valley. Following your instructions, they have dispersed to different states and regions, undercover."</p><p></p><p>"While spreading news about the Heavenly Spirit Flowers, they also pay attention to collecting all relevant information. Through the connection of the [Great Dreams and Spring Chronicles Formation], this information is fed back to the headquarters of the sect in the Longevity Valley."</p><p></p><p>"I have also established a dedicated organization to summarize and classify this information. Extracting useful parts..."</p><p></p><p>San Liu was still trustworthy in this regard. Without the need for Li Fan's specific instructions, he organized everything neatly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very satisfied upon hearing this. He then instructed, "Very good. The disciples should not seek achievements but aim to avoid mistakes. In daily life, just consider themselves ordinary members of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. Their safety should come first."</p><p></p><p>San Liu nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"However..." He looked at Li Fan, hesitating to speak.</p><p></p><p>"You can speak freely, San Liu."</p><p></p><p>"While a large number of disciples have gone out into the world, the manpower in the Longevity Valley seems a bit stretched. Young Master, have you considered awakening more people?" San Liu asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan shook his head, "Currently, we don't have any extra cultivation methods on hand. Even if we awaken them, besides causing more trouble, the benefits are not significant."</p><p></p><p>"The exotic beasts in the realm of beast species can be used first. With my clone suppressing one realm, they won't have any strange intentions."</p><p></p><p>"We'll proceed step by step. We are in no rush for the revival of our Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, San Liu slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But it will happen soon. This time, if there are no accidents during the outing, we might be able to acquire a batch of ownerless cultivation methods. San Liu, just be patient and wait." Li Fan made another vague promise.</p><p></p><p>After a careful explanation, the clone and Li Fan both left the Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the white mist barrier, they went their separate ways.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan changed his appearance to that of a middle-aged cultivator and headed straight to Qi Hong Island in Leyang State.</p><p></p><p>The clone Xu Bai set off calmly towards the Tianling State.</p><p></p><p>Now back to the main story.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's goal in visiting Leyang State this time was to meet Ximen Yu, who studied the changes in ancient and modern geography.</p><p></p><p>He had detailed maps of the differences between the ancient and modern geography of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wanted to use these maps to go to the Nanming Sacred Beast Mountain from years past.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1294</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The atmosphere of the meeting reached its peak with the announcement of Gan Jingda's resolution.</p><p></p><p>A cultivation world that was still intact and rich in resources - something that originally only existed in the imagination of those on the celestial ship - now seemed to be within reach. How could this not make people excited?</p><p></p><p>Before the meeting, the vast majority of cultivators on the Xuan celestial ship only knew about the Xuanhuang world from the captured flying ship that came from there. After the meeting, they began frantically studying information related to the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan celestial ship had a long heritage. Although it had experienced the tragedy of splitting into two, it had not been severed after all. </p><p></p><p>On the tenth day after the end of the council meeting, a detailed report on the Xuanhuang world was produced through the joint efforts of the断仙楼 (Duanxian Tower), 仙枢院 (Immortal Pivot Institute), 证道学宫 (Dao Verification Academy), and the major families of the celestial ship.</p><p></p><p>The content provided by the Duanxian Tower accounted for the vast majority of the report, sourced from the confessions of the captured Lan Yu of the Hedao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The content provided by the Immortal Pivot Institute and other organizations originated from the records left behind by the Xuan Merchant Celestial Ship's several visits to the Xuanhuang world before the Star Sea Tribulation struck.</p><p></p><p>At a small-scale council meeting among the high-level members of the Xuan Celestial Ship, this Xuanhuang report was distributed to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan's status was not high enough, he attended as Ai Tianjue's disciple.</p><p></p><p>"At present, we still cannot determine the extent to which the Star Sea anomaly will develop after three years. So whether we can actually launch an expedition to Xuanhuang still needs further observation. But that doesn't prevent us from making preparations first."</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look, everyone..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuzhi, one of the five [Rudao] cultivators of the Duanxian Tower, summarized for everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Our Xuan Merchant Celestial Ship visited the Xuanhuang world three times in ancient times. One of them was an official visit and was warmly received by Xuanhuang. The other two were secret visits to collect resources. At that time, Xuanhuang had two specialties that were priceless even in the entire Star Sea. One was the [Ruomu Fruit], and the other was [Immortal Realm Bestowed Artifacts]."</p><p></p><p>"This Ruomu Fruit contains the most primordial laws of life in Xuanhuang. After a cultivator consumes it, it can greatly increase their lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"As for these Immortal Realm Bestowed Artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuzhi paused for a moment, and Li Fan could hear a slight fluctuation in his tone.</p><p></p><p>"According to records, Xuanhuang was one of the few cultivation worlds that had the most frequent contact with the Immortal Realm in ancient times. Therefore, it had a considerable number of bestowed immortal artifacts remaining. Some of these artifacts gradually became ownerless as time passed. There were cultivators in the Star Sea who specialized in going to Xuanhuang to secretly collect information about these lost immortal artifacts, hoping to reap huge profits."</p><p></p><p>"Although the probability of success was extremely low, there were indeed a few successes. The two secret visits by our Xuan Celestial Ship were actually to rendezvous with those who succeeded."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuzhi's words immediately caused a commotion among those present.</p><p></p><p>Even as high-level members of the celestial ship, some of them had never heard of such secrets.</p><p></p><p>"Of the two artifacts we collected from Xuanhuang, one was sold by us before the Star Sea Tribulation descended. The other fell into the hands of the [Shang Celestial Ship] during the celestial ship split that year." Lu Yuzhi said with great regret.</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath, their faces showing indignant expressions.</p><p></p><p>Gan Jingda, the second elder of Duanxian Tower, lightly coughed to suppress the whispers and gestured for Lu Yuzhi to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Although the immortal artifacts that flowed out of Xuanhuang are no longer in our hands, our celestial ship still has [Ruomu Fruits] remaining."</p><p></p><p>After seeking permission, the representative from the Immortal Pivot Institute made several hand seals.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the dazzling light, a crystal clear, jade-like round fruit appeared before everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even under layers of restrictive seals, the cultivators present could still feel the surging vitality emanating from this Ruomu Fruit.</p><p></p><p>For the celestial ship cultivators who were very short on resources, this was undoubtedly a huge temptation. Even though they were all high-level members, none of them had enjoyed such a treasure.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority stared intently at the Ruomu Fruit, swallowing their saliva.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also carefully observed.</p><p></p><p>"It indeed comes from a Ruomu tree. But the vigorous vitality permeating the fruit is not something the current Ruomu tree can produce. It seems the injuries the Ruomu tree suffered back then were really severe."</p><p></p><p>"Also..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred. He noticed that strands of vitality seemed to emanate from the Ruomu Fruit and disappear into thin air. Or rather, flow into the void.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuzhi said solemnly, "You should all understand that the vitality of this Ruomu Fruit has been dissipating for tens of thousands of years. Although our celestial ship has used many secret techniques over the generations to greatly slow down the rate of vitality dissipation, we ultimately cannot stop this process."</p><p></p><p>Someone in the audience exclaimed in amazement, "The vitality it contains is so powerful even after dissipating for tens of thousands of years. It's hard to imagine what the original Ruomu Fruit was like."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's said to be a priceless treasure in the entire Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, strange. How could those old fellows in the Immortal Pivot Institute restrain themselves from directly swallowing such a treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions, someone grasped the key point of Lu Yuzhi's introduction of this Ruomu Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lu means that the vitality dissipating from this Ruomu Fruit is returning to the Xuanhuang world?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone quieted down. In addition to greed and desire, their eyes looking at the Ruomu Fruit contained a different meaning.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuzhi nodded, "Correct!"</p><p></p><p>"The Star Sea is vast and boundless. Even that Lan Yu of Xuanhuang we captured can't remember the way back. But through this Ruomu Fruit, we can accurately locate the position of the Xuanhuang world in the vast Star Sea!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, intense discussions erupted again.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Xuanhuang world still have Ruomu Fruits now? If we each had one, that feeling would be unimaginable..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder those fellows in the Immortal Pivot Institute didn't consume it. Although the treasure is good, it's inextricably linked to the fundamental power of another cultivation world. It's fine for other cultivators, but as the rulers of the celestial ship, they absolutely cannot do so. Unless they are willing to give up their positions."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, are there such coincidences in the world? Also, the way the fruit's vitality drifts towards its original world seems a bit too deliberate. Could it be that this fruit is actually bait to lure beings in the Star Sea over to be hunted?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The crowd argued endlessly. Lu Yuzhi, the host, did not stop them.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he closed his eyes in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the venue became quiet again that Lu Yuzhi continued to summarize, "From Lan Yu's memories, we have ruled out the possibility of this being a trap. Even if the Ruomu Fruit conspiracy really existed in ancient times, there is no need to worry about the current Xuanhuang world. Although Xuanhuang survived the Star Sea Tribulation, it also experienced unimaginable changes."</p><p></p><p>"The current Xuanhuang world is under the joint rule of the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Council..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yuzhi introduced the relevant information about the Xuanhuang world to everyone in detail.</p><p></p><p>"That's not right. How come the scale of this Xuanhuang world is much larger than what was recorded in our Xuan Celestial Ship?"</p><p></p><p>"The initial judgment is that it should be the joint efforts of Star Sea survivors to resist the attraction of the Immortal Ruins. The so-called Xuanhuang world would be more appropriately called the [Land of Survivors from Various Worlds]."</p><p></p><p>"Defying the laws of heaven and earth to achieve growth and life... it's indeed a bit interesting. Binding with the world can indeed obtain a lifespan that ordinary cultivators can hardly reach. One can even synchronously amplify their own strength as the world prospers. It's just a pity that once outside the world, the strength is greatly weakened. And when the world is destroyed, one can only perish along with it."</p><p></p><p>Everyone solemnly reviewed the information about the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not forget that there are many immortal artifacts bestowed by the Immortal Realm in the Xuanhuang world. This Tianxuan Mirror of the Wanxian Alliance is obviously one of them. Are there other immortal artifacts in the Wanxian Alliance? If we go on an expedition, we must take this factor into consideration. I believe everyone understands how powerful the strength of true immortals is. Can we really win that easily?"</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, there's no need to fight. From Lan Yu's memories, it can be seen that the resources in the current Xuanhuang world are still quite abundant. Our celestial ship, at most, is equivalent to less than half a state of the Wanxian Alliance. We can very well use the method of trade to exchange for what we need."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Even if we can't occupy the Xuanhuang world, exploring the so-called Immortal Ruins will also greatly benefit us. Such surging true immortal power... maybe there will be complete [True Immortal Seal Characters] inside!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I advise everyone to be more cautious. We covet the various resources of the Xuanhuang world, but the Xuanhuang world is also very eager to get rid of the shackles of the Immortal Ruins, right? Our Xuan Celestial Ship, in their eyes, is also a piece of fat meat, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Whether to go to the distant Xuanhuang world was definitely something that could completely change the fate of the celestial ship. It was really difficult to make a decision in a short time. And because of historical reasons, everyone present tacitly did not propose to allocate a portion of their forces as a probe.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Celestial Ship, no matter what, must advance and retreat together. It could no longer withstand a second split.</p><p></p><p>The council decided to discuss again in thirty days to make a final decision.</p><p></p><p>After everyone left one after another, only nine cultivators remained.</p><p></p><p>Four from Duanxian Tower, three from Immortal Pivot Institute, one from Dao Verification Academy, and one from the Celestial Ship Forging Star Workshop.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, as a personal disciple, did not have the qualifications to be present and waited outside.</p><p></p><p>Gan Jingda lightly pointed his finger, and a scene immediately appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>A sword light split the sky.</p><p></p><p>Sixteen characters glowed brightly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the Star Sea, below the high walls, the Xuan Merchant Celestial Ship, ferrying through the tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Gan Jingda slowly said, "What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>"This transmission method... [Boundless]?" Nan Gong Lie from the Dao Verification Academy had a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"There are traitors on the celestial ship?"</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily. It could also be that group of people who defected back then. Wanting to bring calamity from afar? And then reap the benefits of the fisherman?"</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, in the face of absolute strength, any conspiracies and schemes are just illusions. The only thing to consider is whether it's worth it or not."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The few of them discussed the future of the Xuan Celestial Ship, each expressing their opinions.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the buildings located in various parts of the celestial ship's divine tree below, but his thoughts were focused on the Ruomu Fruit that had appeared briefly at the council meeting.</p><p></p><p>"The vitality of the Ruomu Fruit is indeed dissipating and drifting towards the Xuanhuang world. But it's not through ordinary means, but involves the level of the Star Sea itself."</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to use its vitality to lock onto the location of the Xuanhuang world... is simply impossible."</p><p></p><p>"They are lying. They should be relying on other methods."</p><p></p><p>Several possibilities flashed through Li Fan's mind, but at present, he had not yet touched the true core of the celestial ship's high level.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have the answer to lock onto the correct one.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was pondering, a transmission interrupted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, come quickly!"</p><p></p><p>It was a voice transmission from Wang Hai, a fellow disciple under Ai Tianjue.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, Wang Hai would almost never take the initiative to find Li Fan. This time it was so urgent, so it must be something important.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also stopped waiting for Ai Tianjue and directly returned to Wang Hai's residence.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, take a look at this."</p><p></p><p>"How could the celestial ship's report have such a big oversight?"</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Hai did not attend this meeting, he had already obtained the celestial ship's numbers.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes and saw that what Wang Hai held in his hand was a jade slip that exuded an ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>The contents recorded on the jade slip surprised Li Fan quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>"...At this point, the Xuan Immortal Boat has reached a critical juncture of life and death. In order to solve the survival problem of the immortal boat cultivators at that time, the last remaining immortal artifact on the immortal boat was finally put to use."</p><p></p><p>"[The Seed of Rebirth]."</p><p></p><p>"As a black, ordinary-looking seed was planted, a divine tree took root and sprouted on the broken body of the immortal boat."</p><p></p><p>New 65 Book Bar → 65shux.com</p><p></p><p>"It was precisely because of the reinforcement of the divine tree that the immortal boat, which was broken in half, gradually maintained stability."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, every sip and every peck is predestined. Who would have thought that this immortal artifact from the Xuanhuang Realm, which was evaluated as having no transaction value back then, would eventually become the life-saving straw of the immortal boat..."</p><p></p><p>After reading the contents of the jade slip, Li Fan found it to be a historical record and reflective essay about the immortal boat after its split.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this come from?" Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"When I was young, I read through all the classic jade slips in my family's collection. So I had an impression of this passage. It clearly states that the divine tree of the immortal boat came from the Xuanhuang Realm. But this report says that the immortal boat has no immortal artifacts left..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's somewhat strange expression, Wang Hai hurriedly explained, "I know there must be something fishy about this, so I haven't spread it yet. That's why I invited you here, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I just wanted to try and see if pointing out this error counts as a [Correction] merit. If it doesn't, then let's pretend I never mentioned this matter."</p><p></p><p>The so-called [Correction] merit is one of the most significant merits that Xuan Immortal Boat cultivators can accumulate. During the process of cultivation and study, if one discovers and points out errors in the immortal boat's inherited classics, or proposes suggestions for improvement, they can receive extremely generous rewards.</p><p></p><p>For countless years, the immortal boat has not been complacent. It is through the wisdom of generations of cultivators that it has been able to survive in the starry sea until today.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan returned the jade slip and answered straightforwardly, "In my opinion, this is not an error, but the immortal boat actively concealing the connection between the immortal boat's divine tree and the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Why is that? There's absolutely no need..." Wang Hai was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then showed him the sixteen characters from Lan Yu's memory.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I remember now."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the Myriad Immortal Alliance dispatched a flying boat to the other side of the starry sea." Wang Hai pondered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan whispered, "This is the boundless communication method, a secret technique of the immortal boat."</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai was shocked and wanted to say something, but was stopped by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal boat's divine tree originated from Xuanhuang. Could it be that the Xuanhuang cultivators still retain the method to control it?"</p><p></p><p>"The divine tree saved the immortal boat, yet we are going to conquer the immortal realm that sent out the divine tree back then. Isn't this repaying kindness with enmity?"</p><p></p><p>"If the truth is made public, it will inevitably cause many concerns among the immortal boat. It's better to conceal this matter. Anyway, it's been many years, and few people know about what happened back then." Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, there may still be spies from the Xuanhuang Realm on the immortal boat. If this secret is discovered by them, it will be very unfavorable for our immortal boat." Wang Hai also came to his senses and transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, what a pity. I thought I had finally discovered another error." Wang Hai said somewhat dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be anxious. The starry sea anomaly is about to arrive. As the residual true immortal power in the starry sea slowly becomes active, it will inevitably become easier for us to comprehend the true immortal seal characters." Li Fan comforted, with an inexplicable expression.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"[The Seed of Rebirth]?"</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan's divine sense attached to Sun Tianxi tried to search for clues related to these four characters in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The name doesn't match. But the appearance is extremely similar to that treasure left behind after the destruction of the Divine Tree Sect, as recorded."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>In the same era as the Desolate God Sect and the Reincarnation Sect, before the immortal dao was severed.</p><p></p><p>The [Sitting Mountain Technique] that Li Fan was familiar with also originated from this sect.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Divine Tree Sect, there was an otherworldly divine tree that constantly grew and threatened the existence of the Ruomu tree.</p><p></p><p>The two sides came into conflict.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Divine Tree Sect was destroyed and disappeared from the long river of history.</p><p></p><p>The defeat of the Divine Tree Sect, apart from the Ruomu tree being at the peak of its life and extremely powerful at that time, as well as the assistance of many other cultivators and other factors.</p><p></p><p>The more critical reason was the same as the Desolate God Sect. The connection between the Divine Tree Sect and the immortal realm was mysteriously severed, and many of their techniques could not be used.</p><p></p><p>After the defeat of the Divine Tree Sect, that otherworldly divine tree was also completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Only a few treasures were left behind and divided among the cultivators of various sects at that time.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a treasure in the shape of a tree seed was almost identical to the [Seed of Rebirth] recorded in the Xuan Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, after that, there were no more records about it in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out it was sold to the Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat long ago."</p><p></p><p>"According to the deductions of the cultivators at that time, after this tree seed is planted, it will give birth to another otherworldly divine tree. At that time, the Ruomu tree had just achieved a great victory. Even if it was planted, it would inevitably face the Ruomu tree's reckoning. It was meaningless. Moreover, the Xuanhuang Realm could no longer accommodate a second divine tree."</p><p></p><p>"There was really no value, so it was gradually ignored by the cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"If the speculation is correct, the immortal boat's divine tree that took root and sprouted through the Seed of Rebirth should have a mysterious connection with that otherworldly divine tree of the Divine Tree Sect back then. The otherworldly divine tree was defeated in battle back then. Its body was destroyed, and its essence was absorbed by the Ruomu tree..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Immortal Boat should be able to remotely lock onto the location of the Xuanhuang Realm in the void through this method."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Although the starry sea is vast, there are hidden connections between worldly affairs."</p><p></p><p>"In this light, the Xuan Immortal Boat will almost certainly come to the Xuanhuang Realm. When the time comes, it might encounter the battle between the Holy Emperor and the Immortal Alliance and intervene. Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of a smile appeared in his heart: "Since that's the case, I'll add more fuel to the fire!"</p><p></p><p>In an endless dark space.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred terrifying illusory ghost gods flew and howled incessantly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Below these ghost god images, a woman with disheveled hair sat cross-legged with her eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Although her face was calm, one could vaguely see the extreme resentment deep in the woman's heart.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu!</p><p></p><p>During the process of merging with the Dao, she was used as a sacrifice by the Sun family, achieving Sun Tianxi's unparalleled innate talent of being born merged with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>On the verge of her soul dissipating, only a remnant of her obsession was saved by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Bestowing upon her the Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating too slowly!"</p><p></p><p>"So much time has passed, and the Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique has only cultivated three hundred and sixty-four gods..."</p><p></p><p>"What a waste!"</p><p></p><p>"Look at what level your precious son has reached now!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan mocked while waving his hand, displaying the image of Sun Tianxi.</p><p></p><p>In the image, Sun Tianxi appeared to be only five or six years old.</p><p></p><p>However, in front of him, three adult cultivators who had merged with the Dao stood ready to face him.</p><p></p><p>"Please teach me!"</p><p></p><p>Without any nonsense, these three cultivators joined forces and launched a siege on Sun Tianxi.</p><p></p><p>The strength of these three was not weak, and the heaven and earth aura devoured by one of them was an unpredictable and difficult to defend against black mist.</p><p></p><p>However, as their techniques approached Sun Tianxi's body, they were quietly blocked and turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained with mockery, "Do you know what this represents?"</p><p></p><p>"Your precious son's comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth has already reached a shocking level. The attacks of cultivators who have merged with the Dao using the aura of heaven and earth are all easily transformed by him into the most primordial power of laws and returned to the heaven and earth of Xuanhuang! If they continue to fight like this, these three merged cultivators are at risk of falling in realm..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's words corresponded, before long, the three cultivators in the image had an ugly expression and stopped their siege. They cupped their hands to Sun Tianxi, indicating their surrender.</p><p></p><p>And Sun Tianxi also politely reciprocated with courtesy.</p><p></p><p>The image abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu, who had always been calm, suddenly went into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>"It's mine! Originally, all of this should have been mine!"</p><p></p><p>"Hate! I hate it so much! The Sun family, they should all die!"</p><p></p><p>She cursed incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I really made a mistake, actually cultivating such a waste!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu slowly recovered from her frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Although she couldn't see the hidden divine sense of Li Fan, it didn't stop her from kowtowing and begging.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, help me! I'm willing to give up anything! As long as I can make the Sun family and that little bastard pay the price..." Wu Ninglu said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Give up? With just you?" Li Fan said with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's naked mockery, the hundred demon gods refined by Wu Ninglu trembled slightly, as if they would go berserk at any moment.</p><p></p><p>However, they were forcibly suppressed by Wu Ninglu.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu still begged with tears of blood.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at those demon gods who were still glaring at him ferociously under the suppression, and smiled slightly, "There's still some spirit in them."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I personally also like to watch a good show. Helping you is not impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu's face was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"However, you have to first change this appearance of yours that is hated by people and ghosts."</p><p></p><p>The vague figure of Li Fan's divine sense suddenly appeared from the darkness, and a hand pressed on top of Wu Ninglu's head.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu's body, originally composed of shadows, instantly emitted countless white smoke.</p><p></p><p>She immediately let out a miserable howl and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>She changed from begging the senior she had previously pleaded with to cursing him with all kinds of viciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned a deaf ear and never loosened his hand.</p><p></p><p>The hundred demon gods refined by Wu Ninglu attempted to charge.</p><p></p><p>But the moment they approached Li Fan's divine sense, they were suddenly sucked into his body and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Without exception.</p><p></p><p>The hundred demon gods that Wu Ninglu had painstakingly refined were reduced to only a few in an instant because they launched an attack on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Trembling, they no longer dared to approach.</p><p></p><p>Her painstaking efforts were destroyed, and she suffered torment. Wu Ninglu howled, but still didn't give up struggling.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inwardly praised her, but accelerated the speed of his transformation.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Wu Ninglu's screams slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>That originally sinister and terrifying body also became indistinguishable from a normal person.</p><p></p><p>"With your previous ghostly appearance, you would have been casually purified before even getting close to your son."</p><p></p><p>"To deal with him, you have to find his weakness."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how much of an unparalleled genius he is, he is ultimately a pitiful child who grew up without a father or mother."</p><p></p><p>"He is very much looking forward to the family affection he has always lacked. You should first learn how to be a qualified mother."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said coldly, pouring countless images into Wu Ninglu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, Wu Ninglu's face also became gentle.</p><p></p><p>Just like a kind mother.</p><p></p><p>But only Li Fan could see the hatred in the depths of her eyes that was still fiery and indelible.</p><p></p><p>And outside this dark space.</p><p></p><p>In a place that Wu Ninglu could not perceive.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how was my performance just now?" Sun Tianxi was asking Li Fan in the depths of his own sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, you could have done even better. Did you hesitate?" Li Fan reprimanded lightly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianxi admitted frankly, "It was just a spar. If it were a life-and-death battle, with my skills just now, those three would have had three layers of their cultivation stripped away by me."</p><p></p><p>"Did you feel the emotions of heaven and earth?" Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>A hint of guilt flashed across Sun Tianxi's face, "Not yet."</p>

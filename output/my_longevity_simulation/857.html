        <h1>Chapter 857</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli spoke at length, "If my guess is correct, the treasures each person can obtain from this fishing pond are relatively independent and do not affect each other. In other words, you and I do not have a life-and-death competitive relationship. This is the first point."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, we have a common appeal. That is, the fewer cultivators who know the secret of this fishing pond, the better. Brother Zhong, do you think that with your strength alone, you can keep this secret?"</p><p></p><p>"Today I was able to discover the anomaly here. Someday, other cultivators will also be able to discover it. Can you stop them?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli stared intently at Zhong Shentong and asked bluntly. </p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"But if you have our help, it can greatly reduce the risk of being discovered by other cultivators. It's even possible to occupy this supreme treasure forever!" Ji Shaoli said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Us?" Zhong Shentong finally changed his expression.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a long time, he dejectedly put away the purple-gold gourd in his hand and said somewhat helplessly, "Fellow Daoist, come down and talk."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sense of crisis that lingered in Ji Shaoli's mind, as if a blade was at his back, completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Is this purple-gold gourd also fished out from the fishing pond?" Ji Shaoli asked with flashing eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he did not approach.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong smiled wryly, "This old Daoist has guarded this fishing platform for most of my life, and I have only fished out this treasure."</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Purple-Gold Gourd, purple quality. I don't know which cultivation realm created it, but it contains primordial dual qi. In an instant, it can transform the primordial dual qi into flying knives to defend against enemies. It is said that even Huashen cultivators can be instantly slain. It's just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong shook his head slightly, "This is only in other cultivation realms. In our Xuanhuang realm, cultivators above the Yuanying stage reside in heaven and earth. As long as heaven and earth are not destroyed, cultivators will not perish. This Primordial Purple-Gold Gourd is not that powerful."</p><p></p><p>These words revealed the reason why he did not easily choose to take action.</p><p></p><p>Under the blessing of many protective treasures, the aura revealed by Ji Shaoli had already far surpassed the scope of a Golden Core cultivator. </p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong was not sure of his true cultivation level and did not have the confidence to kill him in one strike.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that there might be an organization behind Ji Shaoli, he had no choice but to give up.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhong, how many years has it been since you discovered the mystery of this fishing pond?" At this time, Ji Shaoli finally flew down from the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's eyes flashed with a trace of recollection, "I can't remember clearly either. It was when I was still young, time flies ah..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli inconspicuously observed the young Daoist Liuli, who had been protected behind Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>Like a porcelain doll, with exquisite features.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a loose Daoist robe, at a glance, one couldn't even tell the gender.</p><p></p><p>Liuli now poked out her head, with no fear in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She just glared fiercely at Ji Shaoli with puffed cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"This little doll..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong said with a fake smile, "Just an adopted mortal orphan..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Liuli widened her eyes and looked up at Zhong Shentong in shock, "Master, didn't you say that I was also fished out from this pond..."</p><p></p><p>"Mmph mmph..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish speaking, Zhong Shentong, who regretted it, covered her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>With a fierce look, he sized up Zhong Shentong: "If Fellow Daoist Zhong insists on this, then don't blame me for not showing mercy."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling!"</p><p></p><p>Liuli also knew that she had caused trouble and immediately stopped struggling.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhong Shentong did not reprimand her. He only patted the little Daoist's head, continuously comforting Liuli, who was on the verge of tears.</p><p></p><p>The two sides confronted each other for a while.</p><p></p><p>As a figure appeared in the sky, the oppressive might of a Harmonious Dao descended.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's face turned extremely pale. With a long sigh, he finally settled down.</p><p></p><p>"Little Liuli indeed fell out of the fishing pond."</p><p></p><p>"At first, she was just a transparent fruit like Liuli. I was about to eat her when I vaguely heard a baby's cry from within."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Giving up resistance, Zhong Shentong sat on the ground and slowly recounted.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was very curious about this pretty little Daoist and kept scanning her with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, this little girl could sense it and glared back at Lin Ling, unwilling to back down.</p><p></p><p>The two engaged in a staring contest, neither giving in to the other.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Zhong Shentong laugh and cry at the same time, and his uneasiness disappeared.</p><p></p><p>When the other party displayed the power of a Harmonious Dao, he felt despair.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the actions of this Harmonious Dao Immortal, the situation didn't seem as bad as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ji Shaoli also walked to the edge of the fishing pond.</p><p></p><p>With his back to Zhong Shentong, he slowly said, "I am not one to commit murder. Unless absolutely necessary, I am unwilling to create unjust killing. However, the secret of the fishing pond must not be leaked."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhong, you now have two choices."</p><p></p><p>"One is to sacrifice your life. If so, I promise you that this little baby will live a carefree life."</p><p></p><p>"As for the second..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's eyes narrowed as he listened to Ji Shaoli deliberately pause.</p><p></p><p>"That is to join our Myriad Realms United Association. As long as we are one family, there's no need to worry about leaking secrets."</p><p></p><p>However, with a Harmonious Dao cultivator presiding, it was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>With no real choice, Zhong Shentong quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to join you."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Fellow Daoist Zhong is indeed one who knows the current affairs!" Ji Shaoli applauded and praised.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling!" he called out again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling looked at Ji Shaoli and then lightly pointed into the air.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the illusory image of a faceless stone statue appeared above Zhong Shentong's head.</p><p></p><p>Although the statue's features were unclear, Zhong Shentong's heart suddenly felt a bone-chilling sensation.</p><p></p><p>Facing the starry light spheres in the fishing pond every day, he had formed an instinctive ability to appraise the grade of items.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong could tell at a glance that this stone statue must have a remarkable origin!</p><p></p><p>As expected, he heard Ji Shaoli say respectfully, "This is the statue of the 'Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal.' All who join the association must recite the oath before the statue."</p><p></p><p>With that, an oath of more than two hundred characters was transmitted into Zhong Shentong's mind.</p><p></p><p>"True Immortal..." Zhong Shentong's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that behind this Myriad Realms United Association..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong dared not think further.</p><p></p><p>From the fishing platform, he had seen too many items from different immortal cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>He was absolutely certain of the true existence of the immortal realm that stood above all other immortal cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>With an extremely solemn expression, Zhong Shentong recited the membership oath in front of everyone.</p>

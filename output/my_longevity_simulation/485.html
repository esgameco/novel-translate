            <p>It took a lot of effort, first it was pretending to be a sheep in order to divide up the contribution rate by four, then helping the fellow practitioners to resolve their cultivation methods, then planning and exploring the Cloud Water Sky Palace together.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal is to implant suggestions in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After he completes the first task as the heavenly doctor, he will then take the initiative to trigger the mission of delivering the white jade statue.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Sikuang Yi's recent back and forth to the Cloud Water Sky Palace, it seems that Li Fan's calculations should be successful.</p><p></p><p>In this world, he intends to push the Fisherman, Master, and Heavenly Doctor into a battle.</p><p></p><p>But the premise of all the planning is that someone needs to deliver the heavenly doctor's statue into the Cloud Water Sky Palace.</p><p></p><p>Only then will Master sense the presence of the heavenly doctor in the Cloud Water Sky Palace and come driving a cart across the sea.</p><p></p><p>This dangerous mission is naturally something Li Fan cannot personally undertake.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor's "Four Techniques of Observing, Listening, Questioning, and Pulse" are truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even with a prepared clone, it may not be able to deceive the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Sikuang Yi, who handed in and received a hundred thousand contributions, naturally became the best candidate for the mission.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not sure if Sikuang Yi, at that time, also received the request from the heavenly doctor to help transport the statue.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure that things go as planned, this is where the scene with "Han Wuyou" coming to the door comes in.</p><p></p><p>Even if Sikuang Yi or the heavenly doctor had suspicions about the inexplicable appearance of Han Wuyou, Han Wuyou had already died. </p><p></p><p>Either way, dying inside the mysterious Cloud Water Sky Palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that even the heavenly doctor, if he wanted to investigate, might not succeed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the eyes of the heavenly doctor, Sikuang Yi at most was just a greedy practitioner blinded by self-interest, wanting to cling to power.</p><p></p><p>He might not have the intention to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Li Fan's planning was perfect and flawless, devoid of any traces, cutting off any possibility of being discovered.</p><p></p><p>It can be considered perfect.</p><p></p><p>This kind of calculation can only be done after experiencing multiple lifetimes, mastering various information.</p><p></p><p>Others cannot replicate it.</p><p></p><p>Even the heavenly doctor, as a strong individual, fell into the invisible web woven by Li Fan without any awareness.</p><p></p><p>Although it was slight, the significance of "manipulating and driving a strong individual according to one's own expectations on the path of integration" was extraordinary in itself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's lingering depression in his heart faded away, feeling that the long-standing shadow that had been pressing on him had finally gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Even if your cultivation reaches the sky, you still have to fall into my trap!"</p><p></p><p>While emotions surged, Li Fan did not let temporary success cloud his judgment.</p><p></p><p>He deeply understood that this minor victory was based on gathering enough possibilities.</p><p></p><p>And next, the advantage had been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He needed to face various unknowns and proceed cautiously step by step.</p><p></p><p>"Better to give up than to push too hard."</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly doctor is in position. The next step is to inform Fisherman the trapped Heavenly Demon Sword incident in the Cloud Water Sky Palace when he returns to the mortal world after 16 years."</p><p></p><p>"This matter also needs a proxy."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan had already thought of a suitable candidate.</p><p></p><p>"Han Yi..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed a lock of invisible killing intent. More than a year had passed, and this person had not returned from the Sea Eye to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that his extraordinary experience this time might have yielded rich rewards.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter; he can't escape my grasp."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gazed for a moment at the Cloud Water Sky Palace standing on the horizon, collected his thoughts, and quietly returned.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Body Transformation Island.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng had been quite pleased recently.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, the immortal teacher who had brought them to this island and had been indifferent suddenly reappeared.</p><p></p><p>He even broke all precedents by checking the progress of the children's cultivation on the island.</p><p></p><p>Those who worked hard in their cultivation and exceeded expectations were rewarded with spiritual stones and elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Those who lagged in their practice and made no progress were punished by fighting the "villain puppets" for three days and three nights.</p><p></p><p>They said it was a fight, but in reality, it was one-sided beating.</p><p></p><p>The "villain puppets" were what the children on the island called the seemingly foolish-looking puppet in private.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought this puppet would be easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>The first one to take the initiative was Sun Erlang, who was gifted and skilled in all martial arts. </p><p></p><p>Within less than half a year, he had progressed from an ordinary human to the mid-stage of the Qi Refinement realm.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his proficiency in martial arts, he could unleash even greater power in actual combat.</p><p></p><p>During their usual sparring sessions, almost none of the children on the island were a match for him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Sun Erlang, whose ego had been gradually expanding, took the initiative to challenge the Sun Puppet in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The result was predictable.</p><p></p><p>Sun Ye was always obedient to Li Fan's orders and would only stop when the opponent was not fatally injured and didn't harm their fundamental cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Each strike was measured, allowing Sun Erlang to truly experience what it meant to be in a treacherous situation and playing the fool to catch the wise.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Sun Puppet was only slightly stronger than Sun Erlang, and with a little more effort, he could defeat him.</p><p></p><p>Sun Ye constantly goaded Sun Erlang into launching attacks repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>But every time, he unfortunately missed at critical moments.</p><p></p><p>The highly competitive Sun Erlang fought until exhaustion and fainting before the battle ended.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when Sun Erlang woke up, he had some realizations.</p><p></p><p>After secluding himself for seven days and nights, he directly broke through to the late stage of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Excited, he decided to challenge the Sun Puppet again to reclaim his reputation.</p><p></p><p>And the result was...</p><p></p><p>He was still just a bit short!</p><p></p><p>Now the children on the island could tell that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>This seemingly honest puppet appeared to be intentionally toying with them!</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang, in his anger, was once again knocked unconscious.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, no matter how much effort the children put into battling it, the puppet always held a slightly superior force.</p><p></p><p>Some children were angry and called the Sun Puppet a great villain.</p><p></p><p>Some children vaguely understood that the Sun Puppet was simply the perfect practice target.</p><p></p><p>They started seeking battles with the Sun Puppet continuously.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng was naturally one of them.</p><p></p><p>Though he had no desire for battles, as the only practitioner of the "Three Laws of Simultaneous Cultivation" on the island, Ye Feipeng would never allow himself to be weaker than the others.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his talent was not top-notch, and he initially managed to maintain an advantage through his dual cultivation of physical body and spirituality.</p><p></p><p>But as others' realms gradually improved, Ye Feipeng's performance in battles against the Sun Puppet was slowly catching up with others.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was becoming anxious, the immortal teacher arrived.</p><p></p><p>While he maintained a clear system of rewards and punishments, Ye Feipeng received special treatment in addition.</p><p></p><p>After checking his progress in cultivation and thorough examination of his body, the immortal teacher felt that Ye Feipeng's current practice of the "Steady Sea Divine Sword" might not be the most suitable.</p>

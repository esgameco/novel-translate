        <h1>Chapter 1196</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Could it be that your master was a member of the ancient Shenmu Sect?" Chen Tianhai seemed to have thought of something, and he was somewhat doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Zuoshan Jue'?" Upon hearing these three words, Sun Erlang's heart stirred slightly. Moreover, a sense of familiarity arose from the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>"No, no." However, before Sun Erlang could answer, Chen Tianhai shook his head to deny it himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the aura is somewhat similar."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it is said that the 'Zuoshan Jue' is a cultivation technique practiced by that divine tree of the Shenmu Sect back then, exchanging time for cultivation. It is extremely arduous and slow for ordinary cultivators to practice. Young master, you have already reached the peak of the Yuanying stage at such a young age. It obviously doesn't match." Chen Tianhai smiled self-deprecatingly and looked at Sun Erlang, his curiosity growing even more.</p><p></p><p>"This junior is indeed not cultivating any 'Zuoshan Jue', but a profound technique personally taught by my master. The reason why I cultivate so quickly is largely due to this profound technique." Sun Erlang said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, perhaps I was indeed mistaken." Chen Tianhai did not argue further and skipped the topic.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, is this Shenmu Sect one of the ten immortal sects back then?" Although Sun Erlang had clarified the origin of his cultivation technique, he was still a little curious about the 'Zuoshan Jue'. So he asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang found that this Taiyan Sect was very different from the ancient immortal sects he had in mind, which were strict in rules and regulations.</p><p></p><p>There was almost no distinction between superiors and inferiors, and they addressed him, a very young outsider, as "young master" in a friendly manner.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the reason for such an atmosphere, it was undoubtedly a good thing for Sun Erlang, so he simply followed the local customs.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai also answered whatever he was asked. After inviting Sun Erlang to sit down, he said, "The Shenmu Sect is even more ancient than our ten immortal sects."</p><p></p><p>"In the same era as the Shenmu Sect, there were the Huangshen Sect, Lunhui Sect, and other ancient immortal sects that have long been destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Before the immortal path was severed, some of them had already disappeared completely due to various reasons."</p><p></p><p>"The Shenmu Sect was said to be named after a divine tree from outside the realm within their sect. This divine tree was said to be bestowed by the immortal realm and took root in the mortal realm, displaying all kinds of unimaginable divine powers. But it was precisely because of this divine tree that it incurred the displeasure of the [Heng Huan Heng Yuan]. Ultimately leading to its demise. It is truly difficult to predict fortune and misfortune."</p><p></p><p>"The meaning of the five characters [Heng Huan Heng Yuan] is [existing since ancient times and will continue to exist eternally, standing tall above the river of life like a wall supporting the heavens]. It is an ancient primordial tree that has existed alongside heaven and earth since the birth of the mortal realm, and even holds the authority of longevity."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'one mountain cannot accommodate two tigers'. The growing strength of this divine tree from outside the realm would inevitably pose a threat to it. Thus, the Shenmu Sect was destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai casually recounted one ancient anecdote after another.</p><p></p><p>Since embarking on the path of cultivation, apart from cultivating and killing, this was the first time Sun Erlang had the fortune to learn about these ancient secrets, and he listened with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"This Huangshen Sect and Shenmu Sect seem to be different from other sects just by hearing their names." Sun Erlang sighed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai smiled faintly, "That's natural. These were all sects born since the opening of the mortal realm, and they had countless ties with the immortal realm. When the immortal realm existed, their status was naturally unshakable. However, if the immortal realm encountered great changes and the immortal path was severed, their prosperity would naturally cease."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang listened and nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the origin of our Taiyan Sect?" Chen Tianhai suddenly changed the topic and asked.</p><p></p><p>"This junior does not know," Sun Erlang answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>"Our Taiyan Sect is a true immortal lineage. We received the 'Nine Scrolls of Heavenly Derivation' from the 'Heavenly Capital Grand Master', which allows us to glimpse all possible changes in the next thousand years," Chen Tianhai said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Unlike those second-rate sects like the Tianji Sect that play tricks, we don't rely on any mysterious qi sensing. Instead, we use powerful derivation abilities to truly simulate the future."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang suddenly thought of the word "simulation" he had heard from Yi Shu before.</p><p></p><p>"Young gentleman, please look!" Chen Tianhai waved his hand, and a blue sphere instantly appeared in front of Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, Sun Erlang saw that there seemed to be countless overlapping images appearing simultaneously within this blue sphere.</p><p></p><p>The scenes all depicted him and Chen Tianhai conversing here.</p><p></p><p>There were even some showing Sun Erlang suddenly making a move here and then being easily slain by Chen Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>"These are all the possible futures we derived after your arrival. However, during my interaction with you, I gained a clearer understanding of your temperament and strength. So among these, some futures lost their meaning before even reaching the conclusion."</p><p></p><p>As Chen Tianhai spoke, about four-fifths of the scenes in the blue sphere suddenly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>The remaining ones showed scenes identical to what Sun Erlang was currently experiencing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sun Erlang seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>But when he thought about it carefully, he felt confused and couldn't comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai continued, "Just during our conversation, based on the content of our discussion, the derivation results that align with the future direction are becoming fewer and fewer."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, after you leave, our derivation of this matter will come to an end and converge with reality."</p><p></p><p>"A new derivation will occur again."</p><p></p><p>The blue sphere completely dimmed.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, it burst out with a dazzling blue light.</p><p></p><p>The sphere disappeared, turning into blue mist floating in front of Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>The blue mist demonstrated countless possibilities for the entire Xuanhuang Realm's future.</p><p></p><p>"Calculating the Xuanhuang Realm and calculating the small matter of meeting with you are essentially the same. As long as we have enough information and timely correct the deviations in the derivation results, we can simulate a future Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"This also allows us to see further along the river of time compared to outsiders."</p><p></p><p>With a flash of Chen Tianhai's hand, the blue mist that derived various future scenes instantly retracted into his body.</p><p></p><p>The originally impressive Chen Tianhai suddenly turned into a dreamy existence completely composed of blue crystals.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Sun Erlang slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Our Taiyan Sect has been calculating the future trajectory of the Xuanhuang Realm for over a thousand years without much significant error."</p><p></p><p>"But now..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai stared straight at Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"It's like a mysterious person suddenly appearing out of nowhere in this room where you and I are meeting, slaying you, and then fleeing far away."</p><p></p><p>"This is completely beyond common sense and wouldn't normally happen..."</p><p></p><p>"We call this a 'variable beyond'."</p><p></p><p>The blue light on Chen Tianhai's body gradually subsided, and he returned to his original normal human appearance.</p>

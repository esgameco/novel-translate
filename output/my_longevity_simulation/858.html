        <h1>Chapter 858</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After finishing the recitation, Zhong Shentong only felt a heaviness in his heart, as if an invisible shackle had been added.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, good." At this moment, Ji Shaoli also seemed relieved, instantly putting away all the magic treasures that were protecting his body, completely unguarded.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhong Shentong even more certain that this membership oath must have some kind of restrictive power.</p><p></p><p>"Since Fellow Daoist Zhong has already joined the association, why doesn't little Liuli join as well?" Ji Shaoli said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a suggestion, the tone was not to be refused.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong had no choice but to signal Liuli to do as he said. </p><p></p><p>There was no need to specifically transmit the message.</p><p></p><p>Just by listening to Zhong Shentong's recitation once, Liuli had already memorized it all.</p><p></p><p>She then repeated it in a lifelike manner, without a single word out of place.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that she had completed the membership oath and still looked carefree, without feeling any pressure, Zhong Shentong couldn't help but sigh inwardly: "Indeed, a newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger. A young child does not know the mystery of true immortals."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhong Shentong deep in thought, Ji Shaoli spoke up at this time: "Fellow Daoist Zhong, don't worry. I have already contacted the headquarters. This fishing pond will still be under your care."</p><p></p><p>"Everything remains the same."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhong Shentong was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, we will not make any concealment here. After all, only treasures need to be hidden. What reason is there to specifically protect an ordinary small pond? However, Fellow Daoist, you can set up an array outside this mountain temple to avoid such incidents of being spied on by outsiders," Ji Shaoli said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"If it really leaks, we can also come to support quickly."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's detailed explanation dispelled most of Zhong Shentong's doubts.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I was a bit too cautious. This Myriad Realms United Association really lives up to its name," he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Ling's help, the protective array outside the small temple was quickly established.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli wanted to take out some magic treasures to protect Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhong Shentong, who had not felt cared for in a long time, feel a little embarrassed instead.</p><p></p><p>"These things are not necessary. In recent years, I have fished up too many miscellaneous things."</p><p></p><p>"If a real crisis is encountered, they won't be of much use anyway."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head.</p><p></p><p>With that said, he threw over a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, see if there's anything in here that I've overlooked?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's divine sense swept over the storage ring space that was like a junkyard, piled up with things all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shook his head and said, "Not much value."</p><p></p><p>"But..." Ji Shaoli paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong nodded slightly: "I naturally know this principle too. But for fear of attracting the attention of others, I simply gave up taking action."</p><p></p><p>"But now, you don't need to worry about this anymore." Ji Shaoli put away the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"We will have someone specifically handle these things. At that time, half of the profits will be handed over to the association, and the other half will still be returned to Fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong had no objection to this distribution, and even sighed: "Having backing is indeed better than fighting alone."</p><p></p><p>"The fishing pond is an extremely rare treasure. Within the United Association, strict confidentiality measures will also be taken for it. Only occasionally will people come to fish, not very frequently." Ji Shaoli told Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He explained the matters to come.</p><p></p><p>Various measures made him feel more and more at ease.</p><p></p><p>After this, Ji Shaoli began to ask him about his experience of fishing in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the bait of consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>"Can any kind of consciousness work?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Zhong Shentong explained: "The fishing pool doesn't come with any instructions, so I can only figure everything out by myself."</p><p></p><p>"Based on my experience over these years, the bait of consciousness generally follows the principle of 'like attracts like'."</p><p></p><p>"In the fishing pool, there are countless light spheres. Naturally, they also have their own different attribute classifications."</p><p></p><p>"Light spheres that are similar to the condensed consciousness bait are more likely to be caught."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong took out the Mixed Element Purple Gold Gourd again and said: "For example, this gourd was luckily fished up by me while visualizing a similarly shaped gourd-like lethal magic weapon that I had seen before."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ji Shaoli seemed pensive: "If we consider those light spheres as having their own consciousness, doesn't it mean that they will be attracted by consciousness bait that is similar to themselves or that they are interested in?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Having said that, it still depends on luck." Zhong Shentong said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"The starry sky inside this fishing pool is too vast. The range that the consciousness bait can affect each time is only a small corner of it. Lowering the fishing line and being able to coincidentally touch a light sphere that can be attracted..."</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult!" Zhong Shentong said "difficult" three times in a row, expressing his helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"I think there should be a special set of techniques that are used together with this fishing pool. But they have disappeared, leaving only this fishing pool existing between heaven and earth." He sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The conversation between the two was only completed through transmitting thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Liuli and Lin Ling on the side did not know about it.</p><p></p><p>But in this short period of time, their relationship had already rapidly heated up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Zhong Shentong felt even more emotional.</p><p></p><p>"I see this... former..." </p><p></p><p>After struggling for a moment, Zhong Shentong still didn't say the two words "senior".</p><p></p><p>"This girl named Lin Ling seems to be quite young?" He asked probingly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded: "Born only a dozen or so years ago, inexperienced in worldly affairs, so she still has a childlike nature."</p><p></p><p>These words completely stunned Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>"A dozen or so years old? Merged with the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Fellow Daoist, there's no need to be surprised. Inside our alliance, there are countless peerless prodigies. This level..."</p><p></p><p>"Is nothing much."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled mysteriously and only gave a simple explanation.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong was lost in thought amidst his shock.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli tried fishing again.</p><p></p><p>His mind settled and arrived in the endless dazzling starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Consciousness as bait..."</p><p></p><p>He tried to condense his visualized consciousness into bait.</p><p></p><p>But as expected, he failed.</p><p></p><p>However, he was quite lucky this time and fished up a blue light sphere.</p><p></p><p>Its specific use was unclear, and it seemed to be a remnant piece of some magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>After some fruitless research, Ji Shaoli put it away for the time being.</p><p></p><p>For a period of time after this, he stayed in the small temple, practicing every day to increase his proficiency.</p><p></p><p>After becoming more and more familiar with Zhong Shentong as his teacher, and with the other party's guidance, his progress soared.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli finally condensed consciousness bait for the first time.</p>

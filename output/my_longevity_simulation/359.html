        <h1>Chapter 359</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It seemed that the phrase "天醫" (Heavenly Doctor) spoken by Li Fan had thoroughly stirred up the emotions of the reversed monster. It exerted great force, repeatedly slamming its head onto the ground, creating cracks on the hard and desolate earth. At the same time, it continuously made intermittent whimpering sounds with tears and blood streaming down its face.</p><p></p><p>Although the appearance of this monster was detestable, the scene made Li Fan unexpectedly feel a sense of inexplicable pity. </p><p></p><p>"Is the tragedy here really caused by the Heavenly Doctor?" Li Fan wondered, recalling the seemingly amiable and kindly figure resembling a neighborly old man. Despite the pleasant appearance, the reality was chilling.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the wails of resentment that erupted from the disciples of the Qin Hall in the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace upon seeing the statue of the Heavenly Doctor, it seemed that the downfall of the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace was undoubtedly related to the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>"However, where is this place exactly? And why has it become a fragment of space, appearing within the White Mist Barrier?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would the Heavenly Doctor mercilessly slaughter these cultivators without discrimination?"</p><p></p><p>And...?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gradually calmed the shock in his heart and looked at the reversed monster still bowing continuously. It had managed to survive the Heavenly Doctor's lethal hands and had lived alone in this realm for so long, despite even Li Fan's proud Five Elements Extinction Sword unable to harm its fur.</p><p></p><p>Various signs indicated its formidable strength. But now, it seemed like an ordinary commoner who had suffered a great injustice, kneeling and pleading before Li Fan, the "high-ranking official."</p><p></p><p>As someone who had been in office for many years, Li Fan was very familiar with the scene before him. </p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it couldn't be because Li Fan was stronger than this reversed monster. Instead, it was because...</p><p></p><p>"Identifying the wrong person?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that must be it. As for why this reversed monster has made a mistake..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's limited cycle of rebirths, making such mistakes had occurred once before. To confirm his speculation, the inner alchemy circulated, and Li Fan individually summoned a trace of Heavenly Scourge power, condensed into a sword.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, feeling the slightly familiar aura, the reversed monster became even more excited. Its wailing cries were incessant, as if it wanted to smash a giant hole in the ground. </p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Scourge Sword, the Old Fisherman."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the monster kneeling before him, a gleam passing through his eyes. "It only pleads to me in this way because it senses the Heavenly Scourge method in my Five Elements Extinction Sword, mistaking me as the master of the Heavenly Scourge Sword."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Old Fisherman himself almost made a mistake. This monster, locked here for who knows how many years, is acting on instincts without a clear mind."</p><p></p><p>"Mistaken identities are normal."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Old Fisherman might have been a leader among the fallen cultivators in this realm. Back when the Heavenly Doctor massacred the disciples, there must have been a conflict with him."</p><p></p><p>"The incomplete Heavenly Scourge Sword, the Old Fisherman losing his memory and becoming unstable—it may all be the work of the Heavenly Doctor."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan soon felt something was amiss. If the Heavenly Doctor was truly responsible, having survived for so long, his current strength would definitely be much stronger than when the tragedy occurred. It was unlikely that he was unaware of the Old Fisherman's existence.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't he eradicate the Old Fisherman but allowed him to survive until now? Or was it indeed as Li Fan had speculated before—had the Old Fisherman become so bizarre and fundamentally unremovable?</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Doctor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes. He was not a forgiving person. Back then, the Heavenly Doctor, using his "Observation, Auscultation, Olfaction, and Inquiry" technique, discovered his true identity. He directly broke through the defenses of the Heaven-Profound Mirror, intending to capture him. The fear he felt at that time was unforgettable.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the vast disparity in strength between him and the Heavenly Doctor, he had no choice but to keep his thoughts of revenge deep within him. Now that he realized the Old Fisherman and the Heavenly Doctor might be archenemies, Li Fan felt a stirring in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"If the Old Fisherman retrieves the Heavenly Scourge Sword and confronts the Heavenly Doctor and the Master when they battle..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered, combining his experiences from several lifetimes, he quickly formulated a rough plan in his mind. With a cold smile, he temporarily set it aside and looked back at the reversed monster before him.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Death Symbol can hold for one more day. Perhaps the hope of escaping lies with it."</p><p></p><p>Retracting the Heavenly Scourge power, Li Fan attempted to reassure and communicate with the monster. He explained that he had been deceived and trapped by the Heavenly Doctor here, seeking a way out to seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>The reversed monster had lost its senses and took almost half a day to understand Li Fan's intentions after he stopped bowing. It quieted down, its head constantly rotating, seemingly pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it began to crawl outside, occasionally turning back to signal Li Fan to follow.</p><p></p><p>In the vicinity of the Twelfth Ruin, the area was still filled with disorienting forces. Li Fan closely followed the reversed monster as it constantly changed its position irregularly, using it as a reference point to adjust his direction during the flight.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, the faint black light wandering on the Black Death Symbol had become increasingly weak, as if it could extinguish at any moment. And Li Fan, following the reversed monster, kept delving deeper, seeming to have reached the central location of this realm.</p><p></p><p>In a circular pit that seemed as if it had been smashed by a meteor, numerous figures stood inside. They were similar to what Li Fan had seen before, lifeless bodies. However, unlike before, these bodies no longer seemed lifelike but retained their appearance from their past.</p><p></p><p>They had undergone eerie changes.</p><p></p><p>Some had petrified, becoming statues. Some had turned into jade, emitting a radiant light. And some had bodies covered in jagged bark-like cracks, resembling trees.</p><p></p><p>What chilled Li Fan the most was a kind of worm transformation. They appeared normal at first glance, but upon closer inspection, they had been hollowed out entirely. Even after many years, these maggots were still wriggling constantly.</p><p></p><p>The closer they got to the center of the circular pit, the more pronounced the transformations became. There were no more standing corpses but substances adhered to the ground, displaying various types of abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly terrified of something ahead, Li Fan faintly noticed that the reversed monster's pace slowed down, and its body trembled imperceptibly. Eventually, it stopped moving forward, refusing to advance any further.</p><p></p><p>After comforting the monster, Li Fan had no choice but to proceed alone, feeling extremely vigilant, prepared for anything unexpected.</p><p></p><p>The center of the circular pit held no terrifying monster as imagined. Instead, there lay a shattered stone quietly. There seemed to be some inscriptions originally on the stone, but they had now faded and were barely visible. However, Li Fan could still faintly make out a "chaotic" character from the remaining traces on the stone.</p>

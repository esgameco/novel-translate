            <p>Chapter 1152: Reshaping the Realm with One Hand</p><p></p><p>Although Shang Shaojun was the commander of the Qingxuan Army, he had never directly confronted a Changsheng realm existence before.</p><p></p><p>During the anxious waiting process, he felt restless and uneasy, as if a day felt like a year.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the constantly rotating sword light around them finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had been waiting with his eyes closed, finally opened them.</p><p></p><p>As the sword light dissipated, Shang Shaojun subconsciously looked around.</p><p></p><p>The scene he saw instantly made him feel like he had fallen into the depths of cold, his whole body freezing.</p><p></p><p>Just now, those few shattered worlds that Li Fan had stimulated and destroyed with the sword light had inexplicably reappeared!</p><p></p><p>Hanging upside down overhead, the eerie red threads intertwined with each other, becoming even thicker.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, they continuously extended towards the Chita Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Not only did they not disappear, they even..." Shang Shaojun's heart trembled as he looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He even began to doubt whether the scene of the worlds being destroyed that he had witnessed before was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"He has been here," Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?" Shang Shaojun couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's obvious at a glance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flicked his fingers, pointing towards the void in front.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of sword lights that formed the sword array reappeared in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>They then began to rapidly revolve and rotate.</p><p></p><p>As the speed of the sword light became faster and faster, some blurry scenes also appeared on the light screen formed by the sword light!</p><p></p><p>"The one who can do all this must be an extremely powerful existence. If we had secretly peeked just now, even with my supreme formation concealing us, even with the impact of the worlds being destroyed as a natural cover..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid we would still have been noticed by Him."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan finally explained the reason why he had used the formation to shield Shang Shaojun's prying gaze earlier.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's heart trembled, but he heard Li Fan continue, "Even the sword light I used to record was not concentrated in one place. Each sword light only recorded a fragment of information. Only when fully combined together does it show the true nature of what was recorded."</p><p></p><p>"Only in this way can we minimize the possibility of being discovered."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan whispered, the images on the sword screen also began to change.</p><p></p><p>The remnants of the shattered worlds were destroyed, and the world-destroying fluctuations erupted and rampaged outwards.</p><p></p><p>Just as this violent scene was slowly subsiding.</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in the center of the storm.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, he had never revealed his true appearance in the first place?</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun only knew that the moment this mastermind appeared, the originally turbulent energy fluctuations instantly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>That figure observed for a moment, seeming a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Then he glanced in the direction of the Chita Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a simple recorded image, even though the other party had no clear appearance, even though they were separated in different times and spaces.</p><p></p><p>Being swept by this glance, Shang Shaojun felt as if his body and even his soul were about to be frozen.</p><p></p><p>His whole body was stiff, unable to think.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, that figure only did a brief inspection and didn't investigate deeply.</p><p></p><p>He withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun felt as if he had experienced a great battle, his whole body exhausted, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>But he still stared intently at the constantly changing rotating sword screen.</p><p></p><p>That figure pressed his hands in front of his body, and the spatial storm here instantly stopped.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the remaining embers of the worlds were taken away by him.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>That figure seemed a bit solemn, carefully taking out something unknown from</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Somewhere, an equal number of world fragments were taken out!</p><p></p><p>Like the giants who created the world in ancient myths.</p><p></p><p>He hung these broken worlds at the bottom of the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a light touch of his fingers, strange red threads flew out from these world fragments.</p><p></p><p>As if having their own consciousness, they flew towards the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Chizha Abyss, roaring sounds were heard again.</p><p></p><p>That was a sign of two worlds merging.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, once the suspended worlds stabilized, that figure finally left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Realm, there was actually such a person hidden?"</p><p></p><p>"The legendary immortals who could pluck stars and grab the moon are nothing more than this, right?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the scene of that figure taking out world fragments and gently lifting them, Shao Jun couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's answer made him suddenly break free from the endless terror.</p><p></p><p>"Although this person is strong, he is no match for true immortals."</p><p></p><p>His tone was indifferent, as if he had really seen immortals before.</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that my guess was correct. Behind such a bizarre situation in the Xuanhuang Realm, there must be someone carrying out an unknown conspiracy."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Shao Jun to respond, Li Fan continued.</p><p></p><p>"The figure we saw is one of them."</p><p></p><p>"What is Shao Jun planning to do?"</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun was suddenly stunned.</p><p></p><p>What to do?</p><p></p><p>The strength of that unknown terrifying existence must be at the Changsheng Realm or even above.</p><p></p><p>What could he, a small Hedao cultivator, do?</p><p></p><p>"I must immediately return to the Immortal Alliance headquarters and report this matter."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun said righteously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just looked at him with a smile that wasn't quite a smile: "Are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>"If you really insist on doing so..."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm afraid today will be our last meeting." Li Fan's tone was ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun's face changed: "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"The Chizha Abyss obviously hides secrets. Many years ago, wise people from the Immortal Alliance spontaneously organized to investigate, but were rejected by the Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't Shao Jun understand? On the Immortal Alliance's territory, how could such a big move possibly be hidden from them?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, how could Shao Jun not understand this principle?</p><p></p><p>But he had always been unwilling to admit this result in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Fan had ruthlessly exposed it, Shao Jun's face changed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear that if the Immortal Alliance was involved in all this, or even led it...</p><p></p><p>The implications behind this...</p><p></p><p>Even though he had seen too many conspiracies and struggles, Shao Jun felt a deep sense of powerlessness at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"But Shao Jun must not despair."</p><p></p><p>"This matter has obviously exceeded the scope that you and I can handle. Using the doomsday world's Dao to pollute Xuanhuang is tantamount to being a public enemy of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Immortal Alliance may have high-level members participating, I believe those people cannot completely cover the sky with one hand."</p><p></p><p>"The Chuanfa Tianzun roams outside the heavens and does not concern himself with worldly affairs. But I heard that the Chuanfa disciples have a special method to summon him back..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan patiently guided.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shao Jun's eyes lit up: "That's right. In such a dire crisis, I'm afraid only summoning Chuanfa back can solve it. However, the only ones who can contact the Venerable Tianzun are..."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan recalled the scene just now.</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa Tianzun..."</p>

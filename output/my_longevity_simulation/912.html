            <p>The golden chains connected to the object were shrouded in a hazy glow. The details were unclear. </p><p></p><p>But there was no doubt that this glowing mass was an enormous object.</p><p></p><p>Judging from its size compared to Chuanfa's, it was almost as large as half a state in the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>And Chuanfa dragged this giant object seemingly without any pressure at all.</p><p></p><p>His facial expression was completely still, like ten thousand year old ice.</p><p></p><p>With the huge glowing mass behind him, Chuanfa was like a comet flying backwards. </p><p></p><p>He quickly flew through the endless dark void.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he completely disappeared from view.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Water Mirror Technique ended there, but Han Zhong did not stop his narration.</p><p></p><p>"What I just described was only one of the scenes I witnessed during my long years of being trapped."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I saw Venerable Chuanfa more than once."</p><p></p><p>As Han Zhong spoke, he continuously used the Water Mirror Technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, over a dozen light screens appeared in front of Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>The scenes shown on each light screen were very similar, yet subtly different.</p><p></p><p>They all showed Chuanfa dragging a glowing mass behind him with golden chains.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the glowing masses varied in size.</p><p></p><p>"These scenes are too similar."</p><p></p><p>"So much so that I even suspected I was having illusions due to despair."</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong also looked at the scenes he depicted with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was certain this definitely could not be an illusion.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine Venerable Chuanfa based on the stone statues seen before.</p><p></p><p>But those golden chains behind Chuanfa...</p><p></p><p>If Han Zhong, with only Golden Core stage cultivation and knowledge, had not seen it with his own eyes, he absolutely could not have depicted it out of thin air!</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan had also seen this kind of chain before.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the golden chain of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation in the memories of Xuantian Sect's Dharma King Ji Yuzhen!</p><p></p><p>The Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation could use these golden chains to capture cave heavens and small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan naturally arrived at a reasonable guess.</p><p></p><p>"The things Chuanfa is dragging behind him are other worlds?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose of doing this?"</p><p></p><p>"And where are these immortal worlds now?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"Controlling the Xuanhuang Realm alone is not enough for Chuanfa, so he wants to devour even more immortal worlds to further advance."</p><p></p><p>"Thereby breaking through to the True Immortal realm?!"</p><p></p><p>Combining the recently gathered information about the Xuantian Sect, Li Fan deduced what seemed to be the most logical conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was silently pondering.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan not speaking, Han Zhong thought he also believed that he had produced illusions after long despair.</p><p></p><p>So after some hesitation, he added: "Actually, besides Venerable Chuanfa, I once saw one other person."</p><p></p><p>"I had never seen that person before. And he only appeared once..."</p><p></p><p>"This is also why I believe everything I saw may not have been my illusion."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Han Zhong used the Water Mirror Technique again.</p><p></p><p>And the scene that appeared on it shocked Li Fan to the core!</p><p></p><p>Because flying through the void was one of Li Fan's psychological shadows.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor flew through the darkness, his body emitting a holy white glow.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Chuanfa, he was not dragging anything behind him with golden chains.</p><p></p><p>He just flew and stopped intermittently, seeming to be calculating something with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Successfully discerning the dir</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After a while, he flew away again in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"How could the Heavenly Doctor also escape the attraction of the Immortal Ruins?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw the Heavenly Doctor, this thought surged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>While being extremely shocked, he quickly glanced at Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Doctor's true strength was unclear, Li Fan had never dared to underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>Even now, when he could be called invincible under the Eternal Life Realm, he didn't dare say he could gain the upper hand against the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's identity was extremely mysterious. </p><p></p><p>He could issue tasks through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But apart from the task of the Cloud Water Scroll, Li Fan couldn't find any clues about him in the Myriad Immortals Alliance at any other time during the reincarnation cycle.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that although he also belonged to the Myriad Immortals Alliance, his situation was different from ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>More like Emperor Sanmao, he served in a "guest minister" type of role and wouldn't show his face normally.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Doctor's abilities were also extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>That "inspection, listening, inquiry, and palpation" secret technique that could glimpse into a cultivator's heart, Li Fan had not seen it from any other cultivator besides the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>But even if he had already tried his best to overestimate the Heavenly Doctor's true cultivation level, Li Fan never thought that the Heavenly Doctor could actually ignore the restraints of the Immortal Ruins like the Dharma Transmission Master.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Xuanhuang Realm and traveling in the Darkest Starry Sea!</p><p></p><p>"Actually being able to do what even Eternal Life Realm experts cannot do..."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was extremely shaken in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"No. This doesn't necessarily mean that the Heavenly Doctor's strength has already surpassed the Eternal Life Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Eternal Life Realm is powerful, the price is being deeply bound to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Unless one transcends like the Dharma Transmission Master, otherwise they cannot leave the Xuanhuang Realm in their entire life."</p><p></p><p>"Even without the Immortal Ruins, it's the same."</p><p></p><p>"This also doesn't mean Eternal Life Realm cultivators cannot resist the pulling force of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Heavenly Doctor, he doesn't pursue the Eternal Life Realm. Perhaps because of this, he can instead leave the Xuanhuang Realm and come and go freely."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Slowly sorting it out clearly, Li Fan's state of mind gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>But Han Zhong, who had been observing his words and expressions all along, couldn't glimpse the changes in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he continued to recount with some regret, "Apart from the scenes I just described, I didn't see anything else."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long I stayed in that intangible bubble. Most of the time I was facing absolute darkness."</p><p></p><p>"Not going crazy because of that, I'm a bit proud of myself."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I discovered that in that bubble, I didn't even show signs of aging."</p><p></p><p>"Originally I thought, if I had to suffer this kind of confinement and torture forever, I might as well end it myself."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, not long ago, for some reason, that bubble seemed to have encountered something."</p><p></p><p>"Constantly shaking and shrinking..."</p><p></p><p>"I thought I was done for," Han Zhong said with some relief. "I never expected that before the bubble completely collapsed, with a bang, I actually returned to the Xuanhuang Realm again."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, when I saw that endless plain, I didn't know that was Jiushan Province. It was only after encountering Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators and some inquiries that I figured it out."</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong recounted his strange experiences in full.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was still pondering, he suddenly heard Han Zhong say in an extremely shocked tone, "You are..."</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't said to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled and looked back, discovering that a figure had quietly appeared in the room at some unknown time!</p><p></p><p>It was none other than...</p>

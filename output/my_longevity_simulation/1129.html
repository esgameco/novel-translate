            <p>Chapter 1127: Immortal Power Turns into Void</p><p></p><p>[This simulation has ended]</p><p></p><p>[You can choose one of the following options to retain:</p><p>1. An item you possessed in this simulation.</p><p>2. Your cultivation level in this simulation.</p><p>3. The simulated memory of a person closely related to you in this simulation. This memory can be inherited by that person.</p><p>4. Give up the above choices to speed up the recharging process.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The prompt truly appeared in front of Li Fan's "eyes", but now he had no intention of making a choice.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he felt the changes happening to his body.</p><p></p><p>Just like when he came into contact with the immortal power of the Immortal Ruins before, even after the simulation, he still felt an incomparable hunger.</p><p></p><p>This time, under the illumination of the brilliant immortal power of the Faceless Immortal, the miserable Li Fan who had just returned from the simulation was unable to completely get rid of the erosion of the immortal power through just one simulation.</p><p></p><p>"The side effect brought by the Immortals of the Ruins is the feeling of wanting to devour everything around due to hunger. As for the Faceless Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully felt his face.</p><p></p><p>It was like a layer of skin had covered it, concealing all his facial features.</p><p></p><p>Only the sense of touch remained.</p><p></p><p>Although he could rely on his spiritual sense to perceive, not affecting normal actions and life.</p><p></p><p>But it still made Li Fan feel a slight chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Not only has my face disappeared, but also..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan "looked" at his body through his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, from time to time, it showed a sense of transparency that came and went, like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>"My [existence] is also disappearing."</p><p></p><p>He had just returned to the anchor point of 1 year, and the simulation was still recharging. If he died now, he would really die, with no chance to start over again.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a desperate situation, Li Fan did not panic.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he pondered at an extremely fast speed with great calmness.</p><p></p><p>The previous experience of completely diluting the influence brought by the immortal power of the Ruins through several simulations made Li Fan understand that the influence the Faceless Immortal imposed on him this time should similarly be resolved through multiple simulations.</p><p></p><p>This did not mean that facing immortals, the ability of [Simulation] was beginning to become increasingly stretched. Rather, Li Fan himself was too weak.</p><p></p><p>But now there were a few key issues in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"First, the simulation needs to recharge. And before that, if I don't do something, I'm afraid I won't last that long."</p><p></p><p>"Second, under the influence of the Faceless Immortal's brilliant immortal power, I turned into this appearance. Compared to the previous life when I was an Immortal Envoy, now His influence on me is even deeper. In other words..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan walked out of the wooden house on the mountain top, arriving outside the boundless sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the red sun rising on the horizon, under the sunlight, Li Fan did not feel the slightest warmth.</p><p></p><p>Instead, a thread of coolness uncontrollably emerged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat quietly on the edge of the cliff, thinking seriously.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he seemed to be waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>Until the sun reached its zenith, a full half day passed, and Mount Daxuan Lijie remained calm and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Nothing unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan let out a long sigh of relief, feeling like he had escaped a disaster.</p><p></p><p>"The Faceless Immortal did not come."</p><p></p><p>Getting up, he patted the dust off his body.</p><p></p><p>Feeling his body becoming more and more ethereal, Li Fan looked at the simulation prompt that was still constantly flashing on the light screen in front of his "eyes".</p><p></p><p>Still not making any choice, he temporarily ignored it.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the wooden house on the mountain top, he lay down...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Lying on the bed, he pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>"What is the true essence of Huan Zhen?"</p><p></p><p>"When truth becomes falsehood, falsehood becomes truth."</p><p></p><p>"As for me, this insect that suddenly appeared in the True Immortal's web without any signs, the Faceless True Immortal chose to turn a blind eye. Either it means that He cannot perceive the specific situation in the small world of the Xuanhuang Realm. Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Before this, the world did not exist. The moment I returned, time began to flow, and everything truly gained meaning. From my perspective, it was because of the karma from my previous life that I suddenly appeared in the True Immortal's web. But for that Faceless True Immortal, I had always existed on the True Immortal's web. So there was nothing unusual about it. This is also the reason why He did not descend."</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts surged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"If time were flowing backward, then the Faceless True Immortal at this point in time should be able to keenly perceive the changes happening to himself. For a True Immortal, something happening beyond his control is unheard of. He would definitely not let this anomaly slip by and would trace it back to its source."</p><p></p><p>"But none of this happened."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan repeated in his heart the seven characters that appeared every time along with [Huan Zhen].</p><p></p><p>"When truth becomes falsehood, falsehood becomes truth."</p><p></p><p>"Having such a divine object by my side, yet falling into such a miserable state, it's truly hard to justify." Li Fan shook his head and mocked himself.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that even after activating Huan Zhen, that brilliant immortal power could still be traced back to its source.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed that the more powerful the existence, the more sensitive they were to the power of [Huan Zhen].</p><p></p><p>The Faceless True Immortal's sudden outburst, suppressing the immortal power of the Immortal Ruins, and his urgent arrival clearly indicated that he knew something about Huan Zhen.</p><p></p><p>"Huan Zhen's performance is closely related to my strength. Before advancing to the Eternal Life Realm, it's better not to provoke Them." Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After making a staged guess and summary about the True Immortals and Huan Zhen, Li Fan finally began to think about how to solve the predicament he was facing.</p><p></p><p>"I am currently at the third anchor point. [Huan Zhen], as a foundation-building exotic treasure, has the cultivation of the late foundation-building stage. If I choose to inherit the cultivation from my previous life, then I will instantly complete the transformation from the foundation-building stage to the Nascent Soul stage."</p><p></p><p>"But I am now in the True Immortal's web. The reason I haven't attracted the attention of the Faceless True Immortal is that my own strength is negligible. But if a foundation-building ant instantly becomes a Nascent Soul ant, it may attract His attention..."</p><p></p><p>"So the method to solve the crisis in this life is also very clear. Hide in the Secluded Realm, and at the moment of choosing to inherit the cultivation from the previous life, activate Huan Zhen again. Avoid the Faceless True Immortal's infection once more, and use Huan Zhen to wash away the mark he left on me. Repeat this process."</p><p></p><p>"But before that..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out, wanting to pick up a teacup placed in the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>At first, there was no problem, but as his body became somewhat transparent, the teacup actually slipped from his hand and fell directly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the Faceless True Immortal. The deprivation of existence..."</p><p></p><p>The first thing Li Fan needed to solve was to find a way to stabilize his own existence before Huan Zhen completed its charging.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, all would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>And from the current state of his body, Li Fan didn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>There's one more chapter, please wait a moment.</p>

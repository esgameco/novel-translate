            <p>Chapter 1131: The Great Mysterious Army Conquers Myriad Realms</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he needed rare treasures from heaven and earth to advance further, Sun Erlang would have directly leaped to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's temperament was quite steady, and he didn't show any signs of joy. He only took the initiative to report this matter to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Mysterious Forbidden Army, and even the military and civilians of the realms that will be conquered in the future, will all be aided by your cultivation of the 'Sitting Immortal Technique'."</p><p></p><p>"Within five years, I need you to help me forge a capable and battle-ready army."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat suspended in the air on the "Sacred Emperor's Seat", looking at Sun Erlang kneeling below, and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"As for the necessary items for your promotion in realms, there is no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart was surging, his whole body's blood boiling. He responded and retreated.</p><p></p><p>He went to train the forbidden army under his command.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, he took out a Tianxuan Mirror and probed it with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>This Tianxuan Mirror was an unexpected gain from Taiyan Boat's trip to the Xuanhuang Realm this time.</p><p></p><p>While Taiyan Boat was extracting spiritual energy from the Xuanhuang Realm, a Golden Core cultivator happened to pass by.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it was a coincidence or if this cultivator had extraordinary talent, but he was actually able to vaguely sense the abnormality of Taiyan Boat hidden under the concealment of the formation.</p><p></p><p>This person thought he had discovered some hidden treasure and excitedly explored around it.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he triggered Taiyan Boat's defensive formation and was unfortunately captured into the boat and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was imprisoned by Li Fan in the Great Mysterious Dungeon, temporarily left to hang for a while.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that it's just an ordinary Tianxuan Mirror without the function of directly transmitting items."</p><p></p><p>Even though he hadn't joined the Myriad Immortal Alliance in this life, and even though this Tianxuan Mirror didn't belong to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still accessed the Tianxuan Mirror without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the existence of the Tianxuan Mirror's origin.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, at the same time as the launch of the world-ending plan, Li Fan used the blank anchor point to replace the "Thousand Machines Jade Disc Golden Seal" with the Tianxuan Mirror's origin.</p><p></p><p>On the Haozhen's panel, it became the "Xuantian Mirror Origin (Remnant)".</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror seemed to be unaware of this origin that had inexplicably appeared in the world.</p><p></p><p>And in this life, as the true owner of this origin, when Li Fan came to the Tianxuan Mirror again, it felt different from the previous life.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, the Tianxuan Mirror's origin was bestowed by the Tianxuan Mirror's human avatar.</p><p></p><p>Although he indeed had various privileges exclusive to the Tianxuan Mirror, fundamentally, the source of his authority still belonged to the Tianxuan Mirror itself.</p><p></p><p>If the Tianxuan Mirror was willing, it could take back the bestowed origin at any time and invalidate the privileges.</p><p></p><p>But in this life...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wandered among the countless information in the Tianxuan Mirror, feeling true "freedom".</p><p></p><p>He had completely independent authority.</p><p></p><p>For example, deleting certain transaction data.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps influenced by the previous refinement by the Mysterious Heavenly King, the Tianxuan Mirror couldn't perform acts of forgery or deception.</p><p></p><p>And in order to maintain the stable operation of the Immortal Alliance, all data in the Tianxuan Mirror was indelible and traceable.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, Mo Rubin's act of deducing the whereabouts of the Mysterious Heavenly King through the Tianxuan Mirror was eventually uncovered by the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't a betrayal by the Tianxuan Mirror, but a result of its own characteristics.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the empowerment of this newly emerged origin power, Li Fan could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>He erased the information of the original owner of this Tianxuan Mirror, and then registered a brand new blank identity for himself.</p><p></p><p>By selling key information, he earned more than 10,000 contribution points in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Then, using this as capital, he frequently traded and...</p><p></p><p>Over half a month, Li Fan's account contribution swelled to hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>He purchased the necessary supplies on a large scale.</p><p></p><p>The agreed trading location was set in the sea area near the Daxuan exit.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remotely controlled the Taiyan boat to retrieve the items.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed troublesome, Li Fan operated with ease.</p><p></p><p>He purchased all the supplies needed for the promotion of the Daxuan Imperial Guards.</p><p></p><p>Without the shackles of the world's wonders, the strength of the Daxuan Imperial Guards ushered in its first surge.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment stage cultivators emerged one after another, and Sun Erlang, as the leader of the group, also quickly reached the peak of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>He was even slightly stronger than Li Fan at that time.</p><p></p><p>However, with the blessing of Daxuan's fortune, if he really confronted Li Fan, he would not be Li Fan's match.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's cultivation level rose too quickly, so Li Fan ordered him to suppress his strength for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He also taught him the [Kalpa Body] technique of the Taishang Sect, storing all the excess feedback cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Three years later, the Daxuan Imperial Guards already had fifty-six Foundation Establishment cultivators and eight hundred and forty-two Qi Refinement cultivators.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan lectured in the Xuanjing City.</p><p></p><p>His image was transmitted throughout the world through the Emperor's Throne.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the dazzling display, countless golden dragons danced.</p><p></p><p>The furnaces of heaven and earth that Li Fan had previously sealed with formations began to emit spiritual energy produced over the past three years.</p><p></p><p>Even mortals could feel this wonderful change happening between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention these cultivators in Xuanjing.</p><p></p><p>Among the fifty-six Foundation Establishment cultivators, three of them directly sensed something and advanced to the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was naturally among them.</p><p></p><p>However, it was only a simple advancement in cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>In terms of actual combat power, they were still far inferior to ordinary cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, it was enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not expect them to personally kill enemies, only to serve as machines for filling spiritual power to operate the formations.</p><p></p><p>He passed on the formations to Sun Erlang and ordered the Daxuan Imperial Guards to practice day and night to achieve seamless cooperation.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Daxuan increased day by day.</p><p></p><p>Five years later, Daxuan, which had been accumulating strength for a long time, finally began its first conquest.</p><p></p><p>The target was the Lingmu Realm that Li Fan was very familiar with.</p><p></p><p>Due to the lack of Harmonious Dao cultivators, the entrance to the Lingmu Realm could not be directly connected to Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>So this time, the expedition route was to pass through Xuanhuang and then attack the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>In order to avoid being noticed by the Wanxian Alliance, the expedition team consisted of only fifty cultivators led by Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Riding the Taiyan boat, they arrived in the Lingmu Realm quietly.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the towering tree in the world, all the Daxuan Imperial Guards couldn't help but be slightly dazed.</p><p></p><p>However, years of brutal training quickly made them focus.</p><p></p><p>The formation was instantly set up, and a remnant shadow whistled towards the Lingmu tree.</p><p></p><p>It was the Xuntian Arrow!</p><p></p><p>The assault of the Xuntian Arrow naturally aroused the anger of the Treemen race.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to stop it.</p><p></p><p>But even the Nascent Soul stage Treemen elders were as fragile as paper in front of the Xuntian Arrow.</p><p></p><p>Screams kept ringing out as the Treemen used their lives to block, but they could not prevent the Xuntian Arrow from finally landing in the Lingmu tree.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Lingmu tree, a terrifying large hole was pierced through.</p><p></p><p>The pulsating heart of the Lingmu tree was vaguely visible inside.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang, wearing black and gold battle armor, flew forward.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, ninety Xuntian Arrows circled around.</p><p></p><p>"Submit or die."</p>

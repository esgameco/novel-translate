        <div class="content">
            <p>The woman in blue slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>When Li Chenfeng, Zhu Shaotang, and others heard this, they looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>They knew very well that the two holy masters of the empire, Qing and Hong, had been powerful beings since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The two holy masters had witnessed the empire's evolution from a mere human community to the vast empire it was today.</p><p></p><p>The guidance of the holy masters was indispensable in the eyes of the people of the empire.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the people of the empire, the two holy masters represented the embodiment of power and wisdom.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Qing Holy Master actually said that he couldn't see through the messenger just now?</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to his previous reckless behavior in front of the messenger, Li Chenfeng couldn't help but feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I haven't been back here for too long. I'm a bit out of place after all."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qing's somewhat melancholic sigh made Li Chenfeng feel a little relieved.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of miles away.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the intermittent and unclear scene of the invisible killing intent coming, Li Fan was also secretly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this holy master is not simple either, to be able to faintly sense and counteract the invisible killing intent."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing my skills are better."</p><p></p><p>In exchange for the technology held by the empire, such as the "Beast God Armor," Li Fan was more than willing.</p><p></p><p>However, if they really had to cooperate and continue the act, he was afraid he couldn't handle the stage alone and risked being exposed. ùüîùüóshux.com</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with five million contribution points, it was a bit tight to handle.</p><p></p><p>"It seems it's time to move forward with my original plan."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan sensed the position where Han Zhenghao was.</p><p></p><p>Heading towards Liuli Island, he transformed back into the appearance of an ancient Tianji sect cultivator.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao had been feeling a bit troubled recently.</p><p></p><p>Watching the incessant inquiries coming through the communication talisman, he simply sealed it completely in his storage ring, finally calming down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Now, he didn't even dare to step half a foot outside of Liuli Island.</p><p></p><p>With the spread of the myth of his sudden wealth overnight, more and more people were trying to pry into news about Li Fan from him.</p><p></p><p>Some approached with skepticism, wanting to personally verify the master's worth.</p><p></p><p>Some purely wanted to latch onto him and replicate Han Zhenghao's experience of ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>There were even some speaking inexplicable words, wanting to make a deal with him.</p><p></p><p>This made him feel overwhelmed, with his head feeling like it was going to explode, and he was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He could only pretend to be in seclusion, hiding inside the stellar formation of Liuli Island's mountains and rivers, not daring to go out and meet people.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao was in deep trouble.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was trying to shift the blame; ever since he joined the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, the senior from the Tianji sect had disappeared and he couldn't see him again.</p><p></p><p>It was really beyond his control!</p><p></p><p>Just as he was frowning and thinking about how to explain to his friends, a somewhat familiar aura was rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the defense of the stellar formation, a figure landed in front of him with great ease.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Han kid, long time no see!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan laughed heartily, full of confidence and contentment.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao was first stunned, then overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like when you think about it, it happens.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you finally came!" he almost wanted to hug Li Fan's legs and cry.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's wrong with you, kid?" With a light touch that pushed Han Zhenghao back several meters, Li Fan asked knowingly.</p><p></p><p>After Han Zhenghao poured out his grievances, Li Fan immediately suppressed his smile and scolded, "Serve you right!"</p><p></p><p>"You're already at the Foundation Establishment stage; how can you not understand the principle of silently making a fortune?"</p><p></p><p>"You've obtained the Yuanying technique, should focus on cultivation, why did you show off to others?"</p><p></p><p>"It's fine if only close friends know, but why did you have to make it known to everyone?"</p><p></p><p>"If you reap the consequences, you're not the only one who will suffer, but it will also implicate me!"</p><p></p><p>Shaking and trembling, Han Zhenghao didn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, looking at Han Zhenghao with disappointment.</p><p></p><p>As if about to fly away.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao immediately panicked, "Senior, please wait! Senior, save me!"</p><p></p><p>With a tearful face, he explained, "I didn't mean to show off. Perhaps it was the result of years of longing, and I was so excited that I couldn't control myself that day."</p><p></p><p>"By the time I came to my senses, it had already spread, and it was too late to regret."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Han Zhenghao's will was not so dismal.</p><p></p><p>While emotional motivation and impulsiveness were factors, the main cause was the subtle temptations and guidance from Li Fan on that day.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Han Zhenghao's abject remorse, Li Fan chuckled inwardly but maintained a stern face.</p><p></p><p>He coldly said, "Save you? How can I save you? One who acts recklessly brings misfortune upon himself; how can I help you?"</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao's face looked even more sorrowful, but seeing that Li Fan didn't fly away immediately, he knew there was still room to maneuver.</p><p></p><p>So, he hurriedly said, "All these friends who are pestering me are just hoping to be like me, to receive your guidance and profit from it."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, with your ability to perceive hidden secrets, you can..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face turned cold, "A joke. If they're neither relatives nor close, why should I help them?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, using such abilities also comes with risks. How does it benefit me?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, Li Fan, displeased, was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao hastened to stop him. He had a sudden inspiration and said, "Sitting on the Mountain Secret! Sitting on the Mountain Secret!"</p><p></p><p>"Previously, when I broke through to the later stages of Foundation Establishment, did you sense the feedback of my cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face slightly twitched, and after a while, he said slowly, "It seems there was indeed something like that."</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao slapped his thigh, "Exactly! Senior, think about it. Nowadays, in the cultivation world, techniques are exchanged through contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"By helping us earn contribution points, we can buy cultivation techniques with them."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't this mean that indirectly you are passing on your teachings?"</p><p></p><p>"You should know that in the current cultivation world, passing on one's teachings is the greatest form of gratitude!"</p><p></p><p>"By practicing the Sitting on the Mountain Secret, by doing so, you will surely receive a strong feedback in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention, there are many friends who have come after hearing about it."</p><p></p><p>"If you take action and help them all..."</p><p></p><p>"Gradual accumulation will result in a tremendous increase in overall cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"In this way, Senior, you should soon be able to restore the cultivation you had before going into seclusion, right?"</p><p></p><p>Han Zhenghao seemed to have an epiphany and became more and more excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slowly, "It makes some sense!"</p><p></p><p>"However... with so many people, my use of such abilities is limited. How can I help them one by one?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Li Fan made a firm decision.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Han Zhenghao had a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking, he said, "We can collect the contribution points from those who want you to intervene and manage them collectively."</p><p></p><p>"When you use your abilities to find suitable investment methods to earn contribution points, we can return them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very satisfied and thought to himself, "Well done, Han Zhenghao, you've learned how to answer quickly."</p>

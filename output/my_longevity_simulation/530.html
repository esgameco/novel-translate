        <div class="content">
            <p>Zhou Kebao quickly shook his head, "How can you be so ignorant of what's good for you?"</p><p></p><p>He cautiously glanced at Li Fan and flattered, "In fact, I came to find a fellow daoist, based on the principle of harmony…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan forcefully placed his teacup down, producing a loud bang that startled Zhou Kebao, causing him to halt his words and straighten up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression turned cold, a hint of killing intent flashing in his eyes, "Harmony, it seems like that wasn't your original plan."</p><p></p><p>"Withholding so many resources, all under the premise of my military order. Are you trying to push me, Li Fan, into a dead end?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao repeatedly waved his hands, trembling as he explained, "Absolutely not! Absolutely not! From start to finish, we were merely seeking wealth…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained noncommittal, saying lightly, "Since things have come to this point, I won't bother to argue with you any longer…"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Kebao's face was filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But before he could heave a sigh of relief, he heard Li Fan continue, "However, once the Congyun Immortal City is officially completed, any necessary reports to the higher-ups cannot be lacking."</p><p></p><p>"After all, completing the construction of the Immortal City without any wasted resources merely showcases my strong capabilities, Li Fan, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's necessary to announce it to the world, to let everyone know. If all the lords of the cities were like me, wouldn't it just be a matter of time before the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance swallows up the Five Elderly Council?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you say, Fellow Daoist Zhou?" Li Fan unabashedly declared.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Fellow Daoist is joking." Zhou Kebao wiped the cold sweat off his forehead, having already grasped the implication of Li Fan's threatening words.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever requests you have, just say it. We will definitely meet them, please don't escalate the situation."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao reassured, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Don't focus on what I want, but what you have to offer." Li Fan stepped forward, patting Zhou Kebao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Contribution points? Do I lack those?" Li Fan's expression exuded pride, "My skill in divination is renowned, turning wealth into more wealth easily. To me, contribution points are just a string of numbers."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao's body trembled at his words.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, once the Congyun Immortal City is completed, corresponding rewards are sure to be abundant. As a significant figure at that time, my authority level will soar accordingly."</p><p></p><p>"With contribution points and authority, how many things in this world can I not acquire?"</p><p></p><p>"What could you possibly offer to sway me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze was intense, firmly fixed on Zhou Kebao.</p><p></p><p>Feeling pressured by Li Fan's gaze, Zhou Kebao found his reasoning so valid that he couldn't come up with a suitable answer.</p><p></p><p>"After you've thought it over, come find me. I have business to attend to and won't entertain you any longer," Li Fan spoke coldly, giving Zhou Kebao the order to leave.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao's face filled with worry as he retreated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's intention was crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>They could be forgiven for meddling in this matter, but it required adequate compensation.</p><p></p><p>"The request for no request is the most difficult." Zhou Kebao sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>He glanced back at the room where Li Fan was.</p><p></p><p>In the short time since he left, seven to eight different cultivators had come and gone with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The influence has been established; it's not advisable to be the enemy."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, why not take this opportunity to turn an enemy into a friend? From what I observe, this person isn't one to hold grudges. As long as there are enough bargaining chips, I won't have trouble dealing with him."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao's thoughts quickly turned, and in an instant, he had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He hurried back and began discussing with his associates.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, Zhou Kebao appeared before Li Fan once again, full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please take a look at this."</p><p></p><p>He pointed into the air, and a miniature version of a floating city appeared.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?" Li Fan looked at it for a moment but couldn't decipher its significance.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining his composure, he inquired.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's reaction, Zhou Kebao felt even more confident, revealing a mysterious smile.</p><p></p><p>"Similar to the suspended Immortal City of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, even surpassing it, an extraordinary cave residence…"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if my fellow daoist is interested?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan's gaze sharpened as he turned to examine the miniature city in the air more closely.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced, and he couldn't help but take in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>"Are the resources you withheld more than double what you owe me? You've got quite the nerve, don't you?" Zhou Kebao hurriedly explained, "Fellow Daoist, you've misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, these resources are all surplus accumulated over time from renovations and reconstruction in various Immortal Cities in each state. As you know, the budget for the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance projects needs to account for various unexpected situations, so the funds are relatively sufficient. With our experience in this field, we are careful, and the actual losses are minimal."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, there's always a surplus of resources after each project. It's impossible to hand over the excess, so it ends up in our pockets."</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao smiled slightly, his words trailing off, everything left unsaid.</p><p></p><p>"Over the years, we have gathered these materials. Rather than continuing to gather dust in the warehouse, we can utilize them fully to resolve this misunderstanding with you, Fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"Using public resources for personal use to turn the Immortal City into a cave residence. Hehe, I can guarantee that even within our Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, such a thing is rare to see."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared fixedly at the rotating miniature city image, clearly moved.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this reaction, Zhou Kebao began to sell vigorously once more.</p><p></p><p>"This cave residence, aside from not being directly connected to the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance headquarters, we can make its facilities indistinguishable from a regular Immortal City. If, however, Fellow Daoist finds it too conspicuous, we can provide a concealment function. Buildings like the administrative hall and martial hall can remain hidden most of the time. They can be summoned out when needed."</p><p></p><p>"In the cave residence, we will also leave ample space for future renovations. If Fellow Daoist wishes to reinforce protection formations, or restrictions, it's within our capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if Fellow Daoist contributes some contribution points, we can handle the labor for you. If you are generous, long-distance teleportation formations, or even virtual mustard seed micro-enchantments, can be negotiated."</p><p></p><p>"An Immortal City cave residence that can be carried with you, with its own teleportation functions, adaptable for both offense and defense…"</p><p></p><p>"Are you satisfied, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao asked, enticingly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan burst into hearty laughter, as his response.</p>

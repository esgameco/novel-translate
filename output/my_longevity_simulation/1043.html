            <p>Chapter 1041: The Principle of Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a thief never leaves empty-handed. </p><p></p><p>This time, exploring the Crossing Calamity Sect had indeed taken quite a bit of effort.</p><p></p><p>If he were to return empty-handed, it would not be in line with Li Fan's style.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan's split soul suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Book of Crossing Calamity, Li Fan once again set up a layer of restrictions created by himself.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current strength, he was still unable to deal with the unsealed and unrestrained Book of Crossing Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Creating from scratch was much more difficult than repairing.</p><p></p><p>Even after exhausting one-third of his soul, he still hadn't successfully completed it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan's main body, who was squatting outside this space, had already sent reinforcements of another one-third of his soul power.</p><p></p><p>After two months, a new restriction was finally completely set up outside the Book of Crossing Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of the double restrictions, the frequency of the Book of Crossing Calamity's flipping became faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Even the paper cutout figures inside became less clear.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that the strength of the seal was fine, Li Fan then began to dismantle the original restrictions left by the Dharma transmission.</p><p></p><p>He dismantled while maintaining the highest vigilance at all times.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his main body quietly retreated thousands of miles away to observe if any anomalies occurred.</p><p></p><p>Facts proved that Li Fan's worries were unnecessary. </p><p></p><p>Until the Dharma transmission restrictions were completely removed, no abnormalities occurred.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Book of Crossing Calamity in front, his soul wrapped it up and returned from the microcosmic space the same way he came.</p><p></p><p>The split soul did not return to the main body, but went back to the Spirit Wood Realm alone first.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's main body went to the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar to report.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you go for so long? I thought you encountered some trouble." </p><p></p><p>Now dressed as a charming woman in a gorgeous red dress, the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the three other naked mortals in the room, he asked in disbelief, "You are..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar was indifferent to Li Fan's shock.</p><p></p><p>"It's just comprehending a new way of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"A life without experiencing lovemaking is incomplete. Since I'm transforming into a human, naturally I have to experience everything a human should."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the peerless beautiful face transformed by the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar, his expression inexplicable: "But you didn't have to change into a female body, right?"</p><p></p><p>"There's no problem with the formation to break the restrictions. If everything goes according to plan, then it won't be long before you successfully break free. But..." Li Fan paused, "That Crossing Calamity Sect seems a bit strange. When I arrived there, the Dharma transmission restrictions were already a bit loose. When I completely broke the restrictions, the Crossing Calamity Sect actually disappeared right in front of me." Li Fan said somewhat angrily.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar slightly narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be thinking about something. After a while, he explained, "Don't worry, as long as the calamity in the Profound Yellow Realm hasn't passed, the people of the Crossing Calamity Sect will always be like that."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing they can do is nothing more than some shady tricks."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then asked, "You mean, if one day the Profound Yellow Realm successfully passes the calamity, the Crossing Calamity Sect might even be revived?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar</p><p></p><p>The clone smiled faintly and said, "It's just a possibility. They wanted to transform into paper people to survive the catastrophe, but they didn't expect that the time to wait for the catastrophe to pass would be so long."</p><p></p><p>"Transforming into paper people for nearly ten thousand years, how could there be no side effects? So you can completely consider them all dead."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he asked again, "Before I came, I inquired around. It seems that the Crossing Calamity Sect has some kind of calamity-bearing person who can help them overcome the catastrophe? Is this really the case?"</p><p></p><p>"If there really is such a mysterious person, I must kill this calamity-bearing person to prevent the Crossing Calamity Sect from rising from the ashes," Li Fan said righteously.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone frowned slightly, "According to the cultivation method of the Crossing Calamity Sect, there is indeed a calamity-bearing person."</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Crossing Calamity Sect stay out of the way and avoid disasters. But they can sense the trends and variables of the calamity. The one who can influence the disaster is the so-called calamity-bearing person. However..."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone laughed coldly, "If it's an ordinary calamity, naturally there will be a destined person born in the Xuan Huang Realm to turn the tide and save everything."</p><p></p><p>"But in the face of the world-ending calamity, even the Xuan Huang Realm itself is in danger, so where would there be a destined person?"</p><p></p><p>"As for a calamity-bearing person who can end the catastrophe, that's even more out of the question."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone seemed to think of something and suddenly fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he spoke in a faint tone, "If there really is such a person, I'm afraid all the cultivators in the entire Xuan Huang Realm would have to do their utmost to assist him."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it means passing on their teachings to him, they would probably have to come see him in person."</p><p></p><p>A trace of imperceptible light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He forced a laugh and agreed, "You're right. To preserve our lives, we still have to rely on ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"Like the Crossing Calamity Sect, relying only on the so-called savior is truly unreasonable. They deserved to die!"</p><p></p><p>Skipping the topic of the Crossing Calamity Sect, Li Fan, who had completed the verification of breaking the seal, asked the Tian Xuan Mirror clone for benefits.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone also kept his word, "During the time you were away, I observed human life in female form and gained new insights."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed and he was about to refuse.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing what the Tian Xuan Mirror clone handed over, he swallowed back the words that were about to leave his mouth.</p><p></p><p>In the Tian Xuan Mirror clone's hand was a crescent-shaped white jade.</p><p></p><p>It emitted a warm and gentle aura.</p><p></p><p>Just by being close to it, Li Fan felt that the circulation of his spiritual power and soul had become smoother.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone had a slightly proud expression, "It is said that the solitary yang does not grow. I observe that you seem to have not enjoyed the union of yin and yang for a long time, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Although the solitary yang is strong, without the assistance of yin, there will inevitably be some defects."</p><p></p><p>"This is something I have realized from observing the female form of humans. It is called the 'Crescent Yin Jade' and can assist you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan's expression became very strange.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's hesitant appearance, the Tian Xuan Mirror clone solemnly advised, "The dual cultivation of yin and yang is also the great Dao of heaven and earth. You don't need to reject it."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this Crescent Yin Jade is a pure manifestation of the law. Even if you have a mental cleanliness obsession, it won't affect you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan half-pushed and half-accepted, putting the Crescent Jade into his bosom.</p><p></p><p>As expected, it didn't need formal refinement.</p><p></p><p>Just by placing it in his bosom, his internal energy, which was already at its peak, seemed to break through its limits inexplicably and became even more powerful, as if a withered tree had met spring.</p>

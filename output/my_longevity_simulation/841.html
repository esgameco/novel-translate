        <h1>Chapter 841</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It must be said that Ruomu is indeed the oldest tree between heaven and earth, and the source of the ancient fruit of longevity.</p><p></p><p>Her premonition was shockingly accurate.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan and Tian Yang were still slowly returning to the Lingmu Realm,</p><p></p><p>A calamity destined to create boundless killing karma had quietly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the bizarre degree of this calamity truly exceeded the imagination of cultivators in the world.</p><p></p><p>Qiling State.</p><p></p><p>After an investigation confirmed that the impact of the earthquake had completely disappeared and would not recur,</p><p></p><p>The rescue and investigation team sent by the Immortal Alliance headquarters had completed their mission after some reassurance.</p><p></p><p>They left Qiling State and returned to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>This group of people, including the leader He Dao,</p><p></p><p>None of them noticed the imperceptible changes that had occurred in their own bodies.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance and conducting a detailed report,</p><p></p><p>They then returned to their respective states.</p><p></p><p>Until seven days later...</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough. Strange, cough cough... why is it a bit hard to breathe." Li Xinhai, a Hua Shen cultivator in the investigation team, was in secluded cultivation in the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly feeling uneasy, his cultivation progress was also forced to be interrupted.</p><p></p><p>He dared not neglect it, and quickly scanned with his divine sense to check his body.</p><p></p><p>But he could not detect the source of the abnormality. </p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>But the worry in his heart did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to suppress the cough, but the more he thought about it, the more he couldn't control it.</p><p></p><p>As if he was going to cough out his lungs, Li Xinhai looked at the pool of fresh blood in his palm with a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a name that had almost been forgotten by the vast majority of cultivators appeared in his mind like lightning.</p><p></p><p>Li Xinhai's whole body trembled, and an indescribable fear descended in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal... mortal... miasma..."</p><p></p><p>He shuddered and quickly contacted his teammates who had gone to investigate Qiling State before.</p><p></p><p>As expected, without exception.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies had all shown some discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Some light, some heavy.</p><p></p><p>Even the leader, the He Dao cultivator, Green Willow Immortal Venerable, had some wandering thoughts and difficulty calming his mind.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of terrifying legends about the immortal-mortal miasma appeared in Li Xinhai's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At first his mind went blank.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Li Xinhai, who came back to his senses, told his companions about his guess.</p><p></p><p>Because among the crowd, only his symptoms were the most severe.</p><p></p><p>So the other cultivators still had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>Especially Green Willow Immortal Venerable, who couldn't help but reprimand: "How absurd! The immortal-mortal miasma has been purified for thousands of years, and besides mortals' bodies, it can no longer be found in the world. How could we inexplicably..."</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." Green Willow Immortal Venerable's words were inexplicably interrupted by a cough.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the communicating crowd fell into a dead silence.</p><p></p><p>"You stay where you are, don't run around. I will personally go to the headquarters. Cough, cough..." Green Willow Immortal Venerable no longer doubted, but his tone became extremely heavy.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years have passed, and all kinds of things about the immortal-mortal miasma have long become ancient legends.</p><p></p><p>How to detect it. What are the symptoms after being infected. How to remove and purify it...</p><p></p><p>This information has long been sealed by history, and ordinary people cannot access it.</p><p></p><p>Even Green Willow Immortal Venerable, whose position is not low, knows nothing about it.</p><p></p><p>But he knew the seriousness of the matter, and first made contact.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the initial investigation results on the Immortal-Mortal Miasma in Qiling State, the Myriad Immortal Alliance immediately established an emergency response team. They first gathered and isolated all the personnel from the Qiling State investigation team. Then, they sent out puppet cultivators to thoroughly investigate the source of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma in the underground of Qiling State.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they declared a state of war emergency and temporarily closed all the teleportation formations in each state. They sealed off the borders of each state and prohibited cultivators from entering, leaving, or moving around.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that in this regard, the Myriad Immortal Alliance indeed lived up to its status as one of the two hegemons of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even though the Myriad Immortal Alliance's response was already very swift, it was still too late.</p><p></p><p>Seven full days had passed from the time the investigation team returned to the outbreak of symptoms.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the teleportation formations of the Myriad Immortal Alliance were already spread across every corner of their territory.</p><p></p><p>Even though a large number of cultivators would try to minimize cross-state teleportation due to the influence of the Devouring Element White Fog, there were still a considerable number of cultivators frequently traveling between states in the face of the huge population base.</p><p></p><p>Seven days.</p><p></p><p>It was enough time to bring this inexplicably erupting Immortal-Mortal Miasma to every state of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The sudden state of war in the Immortal Alliance already made the cultivators uneasy.</p><p></p><p>They thought it was the full outbreak of war and that the Myriad Immortal Alliance was caught off guard, so they had no choice but to take this measure.</p><p></p><p>For a time, everyone was in fear for their own safety.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the cultivators discovered that something even worse than they thought had happened.</p><p></p><p>It was not war, but the shadow of an ancient calamity that had once again enveloped the Xuanhuang Continent after thousands of years!</p><p></p><p>The preliminary investigation results on the Immortal-Mortal Miasma in Qiling State had already come out.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Immortal-Mortal Miasma existed in every corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>In the end, after the unremitting efforts of the cultivators, they finally thoroughly cleansed the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>This was only what the cultivators thought.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in a cavity underground in Qiling State, the Immortal-Mortal Miasma still persisted for thousands of years without dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed, it seemed to have undergone some kind of mutation.</p><p></p><p>It became more hidden and powerful.</p><p></p><p>The various countermeasures recorded in history, although not completely ineffective, had their actual effects greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>New treatment methods needed to be researched.</p><p></p><p>But before that, the mutated Immortal-Mortal Miasma had already revealed its hideous and terrifying fangs.</p><p></p><p>In the current cultivation world, the vast majority of cultivators were concentrated in the floating celestial cities of the states.</p><p></p><p>The population density of cultivators was even higher than that of the cultivation sects back then!</p><p></p><p>The spread of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma was also astonishingly efficient!</p><p></p><p>By the time the Myriad Immortal Alliance's announcement regarding this matter was released, coughing sounds had already spread in various places one after another.</p><p></p><p>At first, under the appeasement of the Immortal Alliance's cultivation techniques, the cultivators' emotions were still somewhat optimistic.</p><p></p><p>But as cultivators fell due to the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, panic was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal-Mortal Miasma was indiscriminate.</p><p></p><p>As long as one was infected, even Nascent Soul and Deity Transformation cultivators would not have milder symptoms or a lower probability of falling than Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who fell into despair tried various methods to delay the arrival of death.</p><p></p><p>But it was to no avail.</p>

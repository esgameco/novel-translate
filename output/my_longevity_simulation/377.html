            <p>They communicated using their divine senses.</p><p></p><p>"I knew a big shot was coming, but I never expected it to be Chief Lu!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother, please forgive my ignorance. May I ask who Chief Lu is?"</p><p></p><p>"Seriously? Brother, which state are you from to not even know the title of our Chief Formation Master of the Formation Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"With Chief Lu's abilities in merging with Dao, she can easily scan through the entire Hua Ling Gorge with just a thought. Why does she need to inspect every place personally?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. She definitely needs to do that. If she just comes and goes without seriously examining anywhere, wouldn't it seem..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, be careful what you say!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not participate in the lively discussion.</p><p></p><p>He calmly focused on conducting formation tests as if nothing was happening.</p><p></p><p>Because he vaguely sensed a huge divine sense continuously sweeping back and forth above the Hua Ling Gorge.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone knows we have to put on an act, yet some are using divine senses to gossip right under others' noses. They really think divine voice transmission is absolutely secure."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He maintained his composure, refusing to engage in such self-destructive behavior.</p><p></p><p>After the initial excitement passed, an order was issued, causing everyone to groan in distress.</p><p></p><p>The Chief Adult would leave in two days.</p><p></p><p>Before that, everyone needed to work harder.</p><p></p><p>Thoroughly complete the construction of the entire Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array.</p><p></p><p>Although the original progress was almost complete, now the deadline was forcibly compressed to two days. </p><p></p><p>The sudden increase in workload was almost quadrupled.</p><p></p><p>But this order was directly issued by Dong Fangyao, and the wording was extremely severe.</p><p></p><p>Everyone also knew that Chief Lu was present, so they dared not complain.</p><p></p><p>They had to work desperately.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately for Li Fan, it was just a matter of continuously working without a break, which was ordinary for him.</p><p></p><p>His expression remained unchanged, showing no signs of abnormality.</p><p></p><p>To prevent mistakes in their busyness, Huo Fu Song and Dong Fangyao would sometimes appear to check on progress.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Xichan herself, apart from showing herself that day, she had not appeared in front of everyone again.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what she was busy with.</p><p></p><p>But the huge divine sense enveloping the Hua Ling Gorge never left, so Li Fan worked diligently without displaying any anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by rapidly amidst everyone's intense work.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to completely form the main pivot and lock-spirit array of the Heaven Dark Array, Chief Lu finally appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"I will install this Heaven Dark Mirror myself."</p><p></p><p>She made a somewhat surprising request that left everyone astonished.</p><p></p><p>Although it was unexpected, no one dared to disobey Chief Lu's order.</p><p></p><p>Dong Fangyao's face tensed slightly as he handed over the red phantom formed from the pivot of the Heaven Dark Array to Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the gaze of the crowd, Lu Xichan placed the Heaven Dark Mirror in the central core area of the formation.</p><p></p><p>The mirror seemed to be extremely familiar with her.</p><p></p><p>It cleverly found its position without much manipulation and began to connect with the outer formations.</p><p></p><p>The scene was similar to what Li Fan had seen outside the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Blue rays of light continuously expanded outward from the central pivot, forming a spectacular display.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan keenly sensed that the Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array here seemed to have a slight difference from the one he had constructed.</p><p></p><p>He did not show any change in his expression.</p><p></p><p>His mind was just rapidly turning.</p><p></p><p>"What's different here?"</p><p></p><p>Simply looking at it from the perspective of formation knowledge, Chief Lu's operation could be called flawless and showed no flaws.</p><p></p><p>Quietly observing the formation taking shape, he once again felt that familiar feeling of being watched.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat, realizing the source of his feeling.</p><p></p><p>Right at the moment of completion of the Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array, the previously unnamed formation that had enveloped the Hua Ling Gorge and the transparent patterns vanished simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The huge divine sense he had perceived during this time also disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to follow a logical sequence.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone noticed it, they would just assume Chief Lu had completed the formation and withdrew her divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan did not think so.</p><p></p><p>A daring thought suddenly emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the unknown formation that unfolded in sync with the Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array or the strikingly similar surveillance effect, Li Fan couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't disappear."</p><p></p><p>"Did they merge?"</p><p></p><p>"Are they integrated into one entity? Or just lurking?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze remained calm, but his mind was filled with tumultuous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Is she leaving a backdoor for herself in the Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array?"</p><p></p><p>As the first formation master to propose the Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array project, Lu Xichan undoubtedly had the ability to do so.</p><p></p><p>But her intentions puzzled Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Is it to prevent the potential loss of control in the future with the Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is there another purpose?"</p><p></p><p>"After the widespread use of the Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array, controlling it also means holding immense power."</p><p></p><p>"The Chief Formation Master of the Formation Hall is just a formation master after all."</p><p></p><p>"There is still quite a distance to reach the peak of real power."</p><p></p><p>"Even achieving immortality is not impossible."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's thoughts continuously diverged,</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Dark Locking Spirit Array, which had been thoroughly formed by Chief Lu's personal operation, stirred the applause of the cultivators inside the Hua Ling Gorge.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan also rarely revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Her expression mild, she looked down at the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As her gaze swept over the face of an elderly man with white hair, her eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Where had she seen this person before?</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan felt puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But he was only a Foundation Building cultivator and shouldn't have caught her attention.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts turned rapidly, memories flooding her mind.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her memory stopped at a few years ago when her daughter returned after being missing for a while.</p><p></p><p>Her daughter, Lu Xuejing, had been taken by an old fisherman due to her arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a cultivator had exchanged his belongings to bring her back.</p><p></p><p>As Lu Xuejing was about to thank her savior, he hurriedly left, seeming to be in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>She knew nothing of her savior, only remembered his face.</p><p></p><p>Using the water mirror technique, her daughter had described the man's appearance to her and she had remembered it.</p><p></p><p>It should be the same person.</p><p></p><p>But why had he aged so much in just a few years?</p><p></p><p>"Who is that person?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan asked Dong Fangyao through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"He indeed came!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the gaze of Chief Lu and Dong Fangyao simultaneously shift towards Li Fan, Huo Fusong inwardly remarked.</p>

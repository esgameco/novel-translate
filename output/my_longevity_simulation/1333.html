        <h1>Chapter 1333</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1322: Ascending to the Realm of Caressing Immortals</p><p></p><p>Around them was endless darkness, while in the distance lay a lifeless, boundless world fragment with no visible edge. </p><p></p><p>The ebbing and flowing stellar forces kept increasing, causing Li Fan's group to advance at an ever slower pace.</p><p></p><p>"The converged remnant forces of immortals under the great wall have grown even stronger than in the past," Zhong Daozhong said heavily while gazing ahead.</p><p></p><p>Affected by the omnipresent ebbing stellar forces, not only their bodies exposed in the void, but even their divine consciousnesses began drifting away like leaves in the wind, scattering if they ventured too far from their bodies. </p><p></p><p>Communication between them now relied on the immortal ark's special boundless transmission method.</p><p></p><p>"Though the great wall stands towering, at this rate it may eventually collapse one day."</p><p></p><p>"The rate at which the remnant forces are increasing is even faster than we anticipated. It seems that even without that kid, we would ultimately have to proceed with the plan to breach the wall. Otherwise, once the great wall collapses, we would have no chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, being forced into this is quite unacceptable."  </p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, might as well take advantage of the situation and have him test it out himself."</p><p></p><p>The immortal ark elders discussed fervently. </p><p></p><p>The boundless transmission was a core communication method of the immortal ark, so they spoke rather unrestrainedly in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But what they could never have imagined was that Li Fan also mastered this boundless transmission technique. So he heard every word the immortal ark elders said without missing a single one.</p><p></p><p>Though pensive inwardly, he maintained an outward appearance of being completely oblivious.</p><p></p><p>"How...much...longer?" </p><p></p><p>He would only occasionally turn back and ask unclearly with his divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>And Zhong Daozhong's answer never changed: "Soon, just up ahead."</p><p></p><p>It was not an excuse from Zhong Daozhong.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, you can run a horse to death looking at the mountain. The vastness of the stellar sea was fully manifested in this remote place at the foot of the great wall. Though the Remnant World Wall seemed not far away, after flying for so long, the distance ahead did not decrease at all, as if it was endless.</p><p></p><p>Only the slightly changing scenery of the Remnant World Wall indicated that they were indeed making progress.</p><p></p><p>And the increasingly strong ebbing stellar forces became an obstacle to their advance. It was like walking through a boundless mire, with their goal being the towering mountains in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Too slow." Li Fan seemed to be getting impatient. "At this pace, I might expire before even getting there."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daozhong was about to explain, "It's not that we..."</p><p></p><p>But he suddenly heard Li Fan coldly say: "Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>An image of a long sword radiating golden light descended upon them, following Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>The sword body bore the patterns of mountains, rivers, the sun, moon and stars, exuding a solemn and sacred aura.</p><p></p><p>"In which direction?" Li Fan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The immortal ark elders were still marveling at this extraordinary sword image, not just because of the supreme sword way it represented.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, they were astonished to find that when enveloped by the golden sword image, the ebbing stellar forces affecting them were instantly reduced by more than half!</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were standing on a precipitous highland, in another world, no longer battered by the surging waves.</p><p></p><p>The ebbing stellar forces were essentially remnant immortal forces. Even tainted with the word "remnant", it was still a force at the immortal level.</p><p></p><p>Yet this golden sword image could mitigate its effects, did that not imply it was on par with immortal power?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the immortal ark elders dared not contemplate further. Even so, Li Fan's ability to wield such a divine ability that could contend with immortal forces made the elders view him differently.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is truly an inexhaustible treasure trove of surprises."</p><p></p><p>"If we could comprehend this divine ability, perhaps it could open a second path for our immortal ark besides the immortal seal scripts!"</p><p></p><p>"No, rather than him alone, it is that profound Dakai civilization that is immeasurably deep."</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the golden sword image sent ripples through the group. The immortal ark elders' expressions varied, while Li Fan seemed completely unconcerned, staring at Zhong Daozhong: "Quickly point the way, manifesting this Sword Strike of Severing Immortals consumes greatly - I cannot maintain it for long."</p><p></p><p>Within the domain of the golden sword image, even communicating with divine consciousness became much clearer.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the words "Sword Strike of Severing Immortals", Zhong Daozhong's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, he ultimately guided Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The radiant sword flashed across the stellar sea. Its speed was many times faster than the group's flight. The lifeless world fragment within the Remnant World Wall rapidly grew larger in their vision. They drew ever closer to the foot of the great wall.  </p><p></p><p>Following Zhong Daozhong's guidance, Li Fan maneuvered the sword image to an abnormal "protruding" section of the Remnant World Wall.</p><p></p><p>It was like a towering signal fire platform along the continuous great wall, with this area having a visibly greater accumulation of world fragments compared to other sections.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a weak point in the great wall?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daozhong shook his head. "No. There are many such structures along the Remnant World Wall that are likely key points maintaining its stable form. To reach our destination, we need to take advantage of the momentum here."</p><p></p><p>The golden sword image came to a stop, and the expressions of Zhong Daozhong and the other immortal ark elders turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Please proceed upwards, Daoist friend."</p><p></p><p>The immortal ark elders joined forces in casting a spell, and a blurred image appeared before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was a flat, slightly curved space. Due to the protrusion of the Remnant World Wall here, it also exhibited an extreme distortion, like an uplifted tower whose momentum and potential were significantly higher than other locations.</p><p></p><p>"Follow the momentum of the Remnant World Wall upwards."</p><p></p><p>With a light point from Zhong Daozhong, the distorted space image expanded infinitely, instantly enveloping them all.</p><p></p><p>They now found themselves within the space-time protrusion indicated in the image, yet remained unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood still, carefully sensing the subtle spatial-temporal differences around him.</p><p></p><p>"It took our immortal ark hundreds of years to figure out this method of ascension back then. It's only normal if you can't grasp it immediately, Daoist friend," the immortal ark elders "kindly" suggested.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ignored them, closing his eyes as scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had personally experienced this sense of spatial-temporal highs and lows before.</p><p></p><p>It was during the previous life, when the great wall collapsed and an unknown existence descended, causing upheaval that rocked the entire stellar sea.</p><p></p><p>At that time, overwhelmed by the shocking scene, Li Fan was distracted by the surface events.</p><p></p><p>He did not pay attention to the sense of spatial-temporal turbulence brought about by the stellar sea's great upheaval.</p><p></p><p>"Highs and lows."</p><p></p><p>The memory in his mind slowly transitioned from illusion to reality, as if he had returned to the end of his previous life, watching the majestic sight of the surging stellar sea amidst the upheaval.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of enlightenment gradually welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The illusion faded, and he looked back at the present reality.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At the towering heights of the Remnant Wall, this protrusion was extremely conspicuous. </p><p></p><p>"Everyone, get ready!" Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The sword shadows once again radiated brilliant golden rays. Although it was like the great sun in the sky, for some reason, the golden light only shone in this area and did not illuminate a very large range. </p><p></p><p>Without actually moving, the illusory golden sword seemed to have traversed billions of miles of space in an instant, becoming decayed and flickering unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>Beads of cold sweat began to appear on Li Fan's forehead. His body trembled involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>The elders of the Immortal Boat watched as the boundary of the Remnant Wall, which appeared smaller due to distortion and deformation, came into their view, revealing looks of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"He actually completed the ascent on the first try?"</p><p></p><p>"This child's talent and comprehension are truly rare in this world. He must be a prodigy among that great enlightened civilization."</p><p></p><p>"At such a young age, to have such accomplishments. Give him a few hundred more years, and he may truly be able to cross the great wall! No wonder he went a bit mad when his great limit suddenly approached. If it were me, I wouldn't be able to accept it either!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Boat elders looked at Li Fan, many flashing a hint of pity.</p><p></p><p>The ascent and transformation continued. </p><p></p><p>The area enveloped by the illusory golden sword rapidly shrank, barely covering the Immortal Boat elders and Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The originally brilliant golden light also slowly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>But the changes it brought were evident.</p><p></p><p>The scenery of the Remnant Wall originally stretching endlessly to the horizon slowly curled up and formed a circular ring.</p><p></p><p>The perspective kept rising, and the ring became smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it converged to a single point.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had reached the end of the road, or had crashed into a wall.</p><p></p><p>The last remaining illusory golden sword shattered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan violently coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>But he just casually wiped it off, his eyes flashing with delight and obsession.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the great wall?" Li Fan coughed lightly, spitting out another mouthful of fresh blood. But he didn't care, turning to ask.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"This is only truly at the foot of the great wall." Zhong Daogang shook his head in denial first, then sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>He also examined the surroundings carefully.</p><p></p><p>"We need to ascend again?" Li Fan asked, looking up at the mention of this.</p><p></p><p>"The great wall is difficult to cross, or perhaps impossible to cross over. The only way is to sacrifice oneself to crash into it," Jian Daosheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"There are fewer people who came this time. With just our combined efforts, we probably won't be able to reach the impact point from back then. But the distance should be enough to observe the traces."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the Immortal Boat elders formed a circle.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, an extraordinary aura emerged from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>It did not rise in stages, but rather like the waves at the sea shore, surging continuously, each wave higher than the last.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the force of this impact, the originally shrunken scenery that had become a small point began to transform again.</p><p></p><p>The small point extended downwards, forming what seemed to be restraining lines.</p><p></p><p>The aura from the Immortal Boat elders became more and more vigorous, and the lines also grew thicker and sturdier.</p><p></p><p>Like towering mountains, they gradually became impossible to see the end of, yet solidly supported those above.</p><p></p><p>Due to the continuous ascent, their perspective also became higher and more vast.</p><p></p><p>And in the unseen distance, a majestic mountain stood.</p><p></p><p>Its peak could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>It was only slightly lower than the endless great wall.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>"The True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins?"</p><p></p><p>Looking back into the distance, a sense of enlightenment welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had learned from the memories of the Profound Heaven Sect's Dharma King that the Profound Heaven King had once told the Profound Heaven Sect that he had found a way to lead everyone, or even the entire Profound Primal Realm, to escape to the Dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, only a True Immortal could accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>"This is the difference between immortals and mortals."</p><p></p><p>"The mortal is forever below, while only by ascending to immortality can one stand at the peak."</p><p></p><p>"The process of cultivation is also a process of step-by-step ascent. But when the great catastrophe descends, the originally inhabitable mountain peaks also collapse."</p><p></p><p>"With the mountain gone, the path is no longer visible. Even if one can temporarily soar through the air, one still cannot stay in that realm for long."</p><p></p><p>Borrowing the momentum of the Remnant Wall, they arrived at a height that would normally be impossible to reach, as if prematurely ascending to the peak of a realm that no longer existed. Various insights not belonging to this era welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"The difference between immortals and mortals is already like this."</p><p></p><p>"And the great wall..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his gaze towards the even greater distance.</p><p></p><p>Towering and stretching endlessly, like a canopy pressing down from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Its beginning and end were invisible, its peaks and valleys imperceptible.</p><p></p><p>It only stood there, blocking the way ahead.</p><p></p><p>Filling one with despair.</p><p></p><p>If he had not personally witnessed the collapse of the great wall, Li Fan, upon seeing this magnificent scene, would likely develop demonic obstructions, his heart inevitably filled with dread whenever the existence of the great wall came to mind.</p><p></p><p>And judging from the expressions of the Immortal Boat elders, this was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>The lofty ambitions they had when they came were now gone, replaced only by endless terror and awe on their faces.</p><p></p><p>However, they seemed to have some secret method among them.</p><p></p><p>After a while, they gradually awoke from their shock.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also pretended to have just woken up.</p><p></p><p>"We can't go any higher at all."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang sighed, then looked into the distance, seemingly searching for the traces left behind by the former Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly half a day before Zhong Daogang pointed in one direction, his expression solemn as he said, "Can you sense the anomaly over there, friend?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked in the direction Zhong Daogang pointed.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it seemed no different from the surrounding scenery.</p><p></p><p>But after carefully examining it, Li Fan did indeed find some subtle clues.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out his hand, as if wanting to touch the anomaly in the extreme distance.</p><p></p><p>"Here...it's distorted."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the trajectory left behind when the former Immortal Boat crashed into it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was strange.</p><p></p><p>He caressed the spatial scars in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Before his eyes, it seemed a magnificent immortal boat appeared, resolutely crashing forward.</p><p></p><p>And then an earth-shattering brilliance erupted.</p><p></p><p>A hint of emotion flashed across Zhong Daogang's eyes as he nodded, "The energy released from crossing the great wall was so immense that even the great wall itself could not withstand it."</p><p></p><p>"Hence, the mark left behind here has not faded for tens of thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"The imprint remains. From this, we can see that over so many years, there has been no sign of so-called restoration. So in theory, we have a very good chance of replicating the feat of crossing the great wall by following the trajectory left by the former Immortal Boat." Zhong Daogang said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, seeming to ponder something.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he shook his head slightly, "No, that's not right. For us to reach this height has already exhausted all our efforts. And that place..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed to where the imprint left by the former Immortal Boat was located and asked, "I'm afraid even if we exerted ten times the effort, we still wouldn't be able to get there."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 955</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The contradiction between the two made Li Fan frown slightly. </p><p></p><p>"Do they only riot collectively when they appear in the Xuanhuang Realm?" </p><p></p><p>While pondering, Li Fan passed by the Qintang stone statue and rushed towards the interior of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>The area he was heading to was one that Li Fan had never set foot in before - the residence of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace's sect master.</p><p></p><p>It was also the location of the "Hanhai".</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current perspective, recalling the struggles he had seen in the Yunshui Heavenly Palace back then, Hanhai was at most at the peak of the Hedao realm and had not achieved immortality.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that he had long since perished and could only exist in a strange form.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan was not worried that this trip would pose any danger.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan was more concerned about was whether the Heavenly Doctor was currently lurking in some corner, observing his every move.</p><p></p><p>He quickly arrived at the group of buildings at the very back of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace, which was completely enveloped by a blue protective light sphere.</p><p></p><p>The seal that sealed off the Yunshui Heavenly Palace began to take effect from here and spread throughout the entire area.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed for a moment and discovered that from the blue light sphere, invisible shockwaves were emitted from time to time.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely due to the effect of the shockwaves that the seal gradually lost its effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Having thoroughly read the "Butian Records", Li Fan quickly realized that this was because Hanhai, even while in slumber, had experienced a tremendous emotional impact.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he uncontrollably released excess energy and emitted shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>Just like a mortal's "sleepwalking", strictly speaking, it was also a type of cultivator's illness.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Heavenly Doctor guided me here to alleviate Hanhai's suffering?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be that simple, just running errands and strengthening the seal..."</p><p></p><p>"There must be a deeper meaning to this."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while longer, Li Fan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He separated an extremely subtle and almost completely blank thread of divine sense, passed through the blue protective membrane, and entered the interior of the sphere.</p><p></p><p>A blue and white interlaced pearl floated in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>It was very similar to the Canghai Pearl, but there were obvious differences.</p><p></p><p>The round pearl rotated rapidly, and on top of the blue and white, there was a trace of black, which was quite eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a nightmare had always been entangled with the blue and white pearl, unable to be dispelled.</p><p></p><p>"Has Hanhai's original body disappeared, leaving only this pearl?"</p><p></p><p>After searching and discovering that there were no other existences inside, Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the streak of black is the source of Hanhai's torment..."</p><p></p><p>The world spun.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had entered the Fallen Immortal Realm and attached himself to a brand new body.</p><p></p><p>However, he could not control it and could only passively observe and experience the events happening to this body.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Doctor has been gone for a long time, and I don't know if things can be accomplished."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai sat on the main hall of the sect, with the turtle-snake Taiyi, only the size of an ordinary tortoise, under his feet, saying gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"Before Heavenly Doctor left, she said that there was at least a ninety percent chance of success in this matter. You and I should still have some faith in her." Unlike Taiyi's worried expression, Hanhai seemed very relaxed and comforted with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Taiyi shook his head slightly and curled up the turtle-snake into his own shell.</p><p></p><p>"I can still live for a hundred thousand years, so what am I afraid of? If it really doesn't work out, I'll just find a random pond and take a nap. Any calamity will pass, and what else can they do to me?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I heard that little Qintang say that some other sects are already getting restless."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Recently, there have been whispers suggesting surrender..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai snorted coldly, "Admitting defeat before the battle has even begun, such scum will be dealt with by the Revered Tianjue himself!"</p><p></p><p>Taiyi smiled bitterly, "It's not about admitting defeat before the battle. We've been fighting for so long that everyone is nearly exhausted. It's a last resort..."</p><p></p><p>"If you ask me, we can't entirely blame them. If this war continues, there seems to be no hope in sight..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai angrily interrupted Taiyi, "Enough!"</p><p></p><p>"You think the same way?"</p><p></p><p>"We're in this predicament, but do you think the other side is having it any easier?"</p><p></p><p>"At this point, it's about who can persevere until the end. If we surrender now, what meaning would the sacrifices of our many comrades hold?"</p><p></p><p>Taiyi sighed softly, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>The great hall was as quiet as death.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, as if to ease the awkwardness between them, Taiyi took the initiative to speak again, "Speaking of the Revered Tianjue, it seems I haven't seen her in a while..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a disciple's miserable scream came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Revered..."</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scream was so sudden that both Hanhai and Taiyi's expressions changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, they transformed into blue and black streaks of light, rushing towards the source of the scream.</p><p></p><p>In the air, they witnessed an unforgettable scene.</p><p></p><p>The Revered Tianjue, whom they revered immensely, had her eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Wielding the Tiansha Sword, she was mercilessly slaughtering the disciples of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>With the Revered Tianjue's cultivation level, the disciples had no room for resistance under her attacks.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of black sword light harvested the lives of the sect's disciples without mercy.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai, his eyes bulging with rage, roared, "Stop!"</p><p></p><p>A giant blue palm descended from the sky, striking towards Tianjue.</p><p></p><p>Tianjue didn't even spare a glance at Hanhai. The Tiansha Sword released a single sword light, tearing apart the giant blue palm.</p><p></p><p>The sword light, undiminished in its might, then swept towards Hanhai.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Taiyi transformed into his complete form, using his incredibly hard shell to block the black sword light.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Amidst the tremendous shockwave, Taiyi violently spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai had also regained some of his senses by this time.</p><p></p><p>"You hold off Tianjue, I'll cover the disciples' retreat!"</p><p></p><p>With that said, blue threads flew out towards various parts of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to save the disciples who were scattering and fleeing for their lives.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Tiansha Sword suddenly erupted with myriad black lights.</p><p></p><p>Striking first despite releasing later, it intercepted all of Hanhai's rescue attempts!</p><p></p><p>The black lights pierced through each blue thread, guiding them back to Hanhai in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Then, before Hanhai could react, they pierced into him like black needles, pinning him in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>"You're not the Revered Tianjue?!"</p><p></p><p>Although Hanhai's limbs were immobilized, he could still speak.</p><p></p><p>His face revealed a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Hanhai roared furiously and desperately.</p><p></p><p>However, the one who appeared to be the Revered Tianjue completely ignored Hanhai.</p><p></p><p>Eyes closed, she commanded the Tiansha Sword, mercilessly harvesting the lives of the remaining disciples of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>And Hanhai, as the sect leader, could only watch helplessly as his disciples died tragically before his eyes, one after another.</p><p></p><p>"No... no..."</p><p></p><p>When no signs of life remained in the Yunshui Heavenly Palace aside from them, Hanhai couldn't even utter a curse.</p><p></p><p>His entire body trembled slightly, tears of blood flowing from his eyes.</p>

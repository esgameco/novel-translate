        <h1>Chapter 657</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes. Faced with this frustrating reality, there wasn't much turbulence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So-called qi fortune was just one of the factors that could influence a person's fate trajectory and opportunities. For someone like Li Fan who could constantly reincarnate, if opportunities didn't come, he could seek them out himself. As long as it wasn't the kind of black calamity that would bring various misfortunes and variables, it wouldn't have much impact.</p><p></p><p>Following the practice of "Fate in My Hands," Li Fan practiced for nearly half a day. Then, he couldn't help but furrow his brows and stop.</p><p></p><p>"After all, progress is too slow compared to a real mysterious bird just relying on a feather. Unlike Xu Ke who can draw on qi fortune, just mindlessly cultivating like this, I'm afraid it won't cultivate a climactic aura for hundreds of years."</p><p></p><p>"Qi fortune, hm…"</p><p></p><p>Frustrated with his practice, Li Fan changed his mindset in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Since I have the ability to see the truth, I don't really need any qi fortune."</p><p></p><p>"The intertwining of luck and fate is intertwined with the heavens, circulating in the world. When exposed, it becomes a flaw. Maybe one day, it will be calculated by a master proficient in this way…"</p><p></p><p>A thought flashed through Li Fan's mind, and he decided.</p><p></p><p>This time, instead of nurturing his own qi fortune, he transferred all his thin and scarce qi fortune into the feather of the mysterious bird inside his body in reverse.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's view, a small vortex seemed to appear on his body. The faint white pillar of smoke struggled for a moment but couldn't resist and was sucked into it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to his own meager qi fortune, Li Fan didn't feel the slightest discomfort until it was completely absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Now, even if Li Fan used the mystical powers of the Celestial Bird, he couldn't see the column of qi fortune above his head.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was the legendary "man without fortune."</p><p></p><p>"Having good luck and opportunities has nothing to do with it, but in turn, the possibility of the backlash of qi fortune and encountering disasters is greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>Observing the feather of the Celestial Bird in his Dantian after absorbing Li Fan's qi fortune, it seemed to shine a bit brighter than before.</p><p></p><p>"After all, I am not a true man without fortune. Even if the qi fortune dissipates momentarily, it will regenerate with daily activities. But I can reabsorb the qi fortune using this feather."</p><p></p><p>"At critical moments, I can also release the accumulated qi fortune in the feather explosively. Perhaps it can achieve the effect of turning decay into magic."</p><p></p><p>Quickly rearranging his thoughts, Li Fan was very satisfied with the harvest in the meteor immortal realm this time.</p><p></p><p>After feeling a bit, it seemed it would take about a year or more to enter again.</p><p></p><p>"Sky Sword Sect…"</p><p></p><p>"In the first two scenes, Mr. Bai played an important role subtly. It's just a mystery how the Sky Sword Sect was involved in sword casting and what relationship it had with him."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan suppressed his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>While he was wandering in the meteor immortal realm, Liu San had already informed all the sect cultivators of how to enter.</p><p></p><p>It was said that disciples were excited to try the alternative method to return to ancient times. The spatiotemporal variations were diverse and boundless.</p><p></p><p>Once they woke up, Liu San commanded someone to collect and organize their experiences. In Liu San's view, the meteor immortal realm was like a huge treasure trove, a trial realm free of charge. If used well, it could greatly accelerate the revival process of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>After learning about this, Li Fan shared the "strategies" he had read in the Self-Seeking Immortal section with everyone, making the disciples' exploration more efficient.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the gains in the meteor immortal realm, Liu San once suggested that the disciples should submit them uniformly for Li Fan to distribute.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan vetoed it.</p><p></p><p>Taking away opportunities is like killing one's parents. Despite not reaching the extent of crossing bloodlines and treating others as slaves, for the sake of insignificant benefits, stirring up the disciples' rebellious hearts would simply not be worth it.</p><p></p><p>"Stability comes first in all things," Li Fan reiterated to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>In Liu San's praise of "Young Master's character is incomparable to mine," Li Fan quietly left the Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>As he shuttled through the white mist, about to return to the normal territory of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, he suddenly noticed a group of Nascent Soul cultivators patrolling vigilantly beyond the white mist barrier.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, it was due to the continuous harassments and attacks from the Five Elders before.</p><p></p><p>With a faint smile, Li Fan silently bypassed them and headed straight for Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>The target was none other than Han Yi, who had turned into a stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't know what changes had taken place on Han Yi, but the stone statue he turned into was indeed a bit weird.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan had probed with the Tianxuan Mirror. It had been a long time, and countless cultivators had passed by him, but not a single one could detect Han Yi's presence.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the fact that the stone statue he had transformed into was constantly devouring the aura of the surrounding creatures.</p><p></p><p>Based on the various clues collected, the range of influence by Han Yi was gradually expanding.</p><p></p><p>It could be anticipated that if he didn't wake up, one day perhaps the entire Luo Yanzhou would be affected.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan knew about this, had he not found a way to resist the absorption of qi fortune, he wouldn't have risked his life to investigate.</p><p></p><p>But now with the Divine Feathers of Fate, and being able to use the mystical powers of the Celestial Bird, he could give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Li Fan arrived at the mortal city he remembered.</p><p></p><p>It was not far outside the city where Han Yi was turned into a stone statue by a fisherman at a glance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this mortal city had clearly fallen within the range of Han Yi's statue.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, Li Fan saw that the qi fortune columns above the heads of the mortals, regardless of their quality, were shrouded in a thick black color.</p><p></p><p>Specifically, all the mortals in the city were afflicted with bad luck and everything was going wrong for them.</p><p></p><p>Tripping and getting injured while walking was considered light. Many had choked to death while eating or experienced family disasters due to business failures. Some mortals had noticed that things were off recently and wanted to escape.</p><p></p><p>But often, they tragically died due to various inexplicable reasons halfway through their escape.</p><p></p><p>Observing from the air for a while, Li Fan noticed that when a mortal died, the qi fortune column above their head shattered instantly.</p><p></p><p>The black color entwined with it took the opportunity to feast on it, gleefully devouring all of it. After gorging itself, it suddenly disappeared, and no one knew where it went.</p><p></p><p>"A bit interesting."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was thinking this, he suddenly felt a chill behind him, as if something was rapidly attacking him.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed slightly, and he dodged in an instant, barely avoiding a sword light.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The sword light passed by Li Fan closely, hitting the mortal city below.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p>

What can be said, what can not be said.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao is naturally extremely clear.</p><p></p><p>As a subordinate, you only need to cooperate with the leader.</p><p></p><p>If you are smart and sabotage the plans of someone above you, your future will be hopeless.</p><p></p><p>I am afraid that I will be killed for no reason at all.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Dongfang Yao did not dare to be slow, one by one, the surface of the information that he had probed into the details.</p><p></p><p>Luk Sik Yuen realized that these two men seemed to have some small thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, she didn't have the intention to look deeper.</p><p></p><p>Because there weren't many things in this world that she should care about, and these two Transfiguration Divine Array Masters were obviously not among them.

He was able to sacrifice his life and forget about death to save others in danger. In this day and age, it is indeed very rare.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the fact that he can still stick to the front line of the construction of the Battlefield Law even though his life expectancy is about to expire is worthy of being publicized as a typical example and written up in a big book.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this person was really born a saint with high morals; or this person cultivated a special gong method, and this act was simply profitable.</p><p></p><p>To the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>What mattered was that he really did those things.</p><p></p><p>The important thing is to make most of the cultivators in the world to believe that way.</p><p></p><p>The name of a Jindan cultivator was able to reach his ears.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there will be some acquaintance's handiwork behind it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xijian was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>If she had guessed correctly, if Li Fan were to fall before the formation was fully constructed, the alliance would have stepped in to save his life.</p><p></p><p>Like buying a horse for a thousand dollars, it would do some more publicity.</p><p></p><p>Things must be utilized to their fullest potential, and it was kind of the usual way of doing things for that group of people.</p><p></p><p>The figure of a few law preachers flashed in his mind, and a haze suddenly surged up in Lukasi's heart.</p><p></p><p>As the earliest group of people who followed the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Father in actively transmitting the Dharma and creating the original Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, Lixiqi's heart suddenly swelled with a haze.</p><p></p><p>After the disappearance of the Heavenly Father, the Dharma transmitters have been in control of the highest ruling authority of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.

It's really not right."</p><p></p><p>"If this goes on, won't it chill the hearts of all cultivators in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu and Dongfang are both human beings.</p><p></p><p>When they heard that Chief Lu meant what he said, they were shocked, but they didn't dare to answer.</p><p></p><p>I only heard her continue, "If I didn't know, it would have been fine, but now that I've seen it myself, I definitely can't ignore it. Now that I've seen it myself, I definitely can't ignore it."</p><p></p><p>"However, after all, this is a matter of overstepping one's bounds. It would be bad if it caused misunderstanding and rumors among some people."</p><p></p><p>"At this critical moment, we in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance should be united as one."</p><p></p><p>"Do you two have any good solutions?"</p><p></p><p>The two of them suddenly thought of some rumors that they had occasionally heard in their daily life, and after a brief reflection, they knew what Chief Lu meant by his words.</p><p></p><p>However, this kind of high-level struggle, where is their kind of pawns can be involved.</p><p></p><p>They all complained bitterly in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Lu Xijian's gaze sweeping back and forth over their bodies, the two of them felt unspeakable pressure.</p><p></p><p>The leader asked the question, how can there be silence and not answer the reason.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat broke out on his forehead, and at the critical moment, Huangfu Song suddenly thought of the conversation that Li Fan had with him earlier.</p><p></p><p>In a flash of inspiration, he gritted his teeth and said, "I want the chief to know that I have had several long talks with Li Fan. Although his life expectancy is about to expire, he is still willing to dedicate himself until the last moment of his life."</p><p></p><p>"We in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance never treat those who have made meritorious contributions unfavorably. But this man has worked so hard, and there are still only forty or fifty of him. If we give him special treatment, those who ranked before him may have something to say."</p><p></p><p>"It would be more logical if he was ranked slightly higher."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song paused and then continued, "This person once told me in private that he had no regrets about dying. It's a pity that he can't visit all the marvelous and secret places of the Wan Xian League ......".</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he came up with such a sentence without a clue.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Xijian and Dongfang Yao, who were familiar with the rules and regulations of the Grand Competition, naturally understood the hidden meaning of these words.</p><p></p><p>"This is a good method." Lu Xijian nodded slightly, as if recognizing Huangfu Song's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song couldn't help but relax.</p><p></p><p>Before he could relax, he heard Chief Lu ask again.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any recommendations on where to go?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's heart suddenly hangs in the air.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, recalling Li Fan's words, Huangfu Song had no choice but to say, "The Five Elements Great Cavern, the Endless Sea, and other secret realms are all good choices for me."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1077</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Since the creation of the new law by the Heavenly Venerate, no new Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate has been born. So what exactly will happen..."</p><p></p><p>"No one knows."</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter Zhou said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the words of Mr. Bai "There is no immortal path ahead, the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate is at the top" surfaced again.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, the reason why Mr. Bai, with a mortal body, ascended to heaven in one step was because he attained the [Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate].</p><p></p><p>However, he used his own life as the price to reverse the principle of "mortals cannot kill immortals".</p><p></p><p>Creating the mortal-immortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>This indirectly shows that even the Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate does not have a good solution to the reversed laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"If we consider the Xuan Huang Realm as some kind of exquisite creation, originally the Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate had all the permissions of this creation."</p><p></p><p>"But because the Dharma Transmitter found a flaw in the existence of this creation. Reversing the laws of heaven and earth, he created a new permission out of thin air. Moreover, it can continuously erode the existing permissions of the Xuan Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"This has almost led to the current situation of the Xuan Huang Realm changing hands."</p><p></p><p>It's still the metaphor of comparing the Xuan Huang Realm to a prison house.</p><p></p><p>The existence that originally created the Xuan Huang Realm left a master control room in the prison.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate is the code name for the person who can enter the master control room.</p><p></p><p>Inside the master control room, one can have a clear understanding of everything in the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even creating a Tian Zhi Qi representing a certain law with bare hands is an easy task.</p><p></p><p>However, one day an uninvited guest with superb skills suddenly arrived at the prison.</p><p></p><p>He actually cut off the control of the master control room over a certain part of the prison through some means. And subsequently took over the control.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also developed a large number of believers in the prison.</p><p></p><p>By directly changing the walls, the prison is being transformed. Gradually eroding it.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the master control room also lost control over the transformed and newly built parts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"At present, it seems that the current Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate's power is also greatly diminished compared to before."</p><p></p><p>"At least it may not be a match for the Dharma Transmitter."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>He was clear about his own situation, and should not be able to meet the conditions to become the Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>However, he could find someone who meets the conditions, like Xuan Tian Wang and Mr. Bai, who are extremely sincere and virtuous.</p><p></p><p>After the other party becomes the Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate of the era, he will then promote them to fight against the Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>While thinking this way, Li Fan frowned and asked, "So the situation is so urgent, shouldn't we do something now?"</p><p></p><p>"If Mo Rubin really becomes the Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate, things will be difficult to handle."</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter Zhou also showed a helpless expression, "It's not that we don't want to do anything, but there really isn't a good solution."</p><p></p><p>"Many of us have already tried, but we can't even pass the first hurdle to become the Xuan Huang Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you are interested, you can try it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, "Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"It's still the ritual of entering the Fallen Immortal Realm. Just do it in reverse." said the Dharma Transmitter Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan was a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I will give it a try." Having gathered all the latest information about Mo Rubin, the Immortal Puppet Li Fan took his leave.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out the four essential items and placed them in the four corners.</p><p></p><p>Then he walked four steps in reverse, muttering something.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmission</p><p></p><p>Zhou said that the Immortal Alliance had already sent out nearly ten thousand cultivators to attempt it, but not a single person had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan didn't have much hope for himself either.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, after completing the reversal ritual, a familiar dizziness suddenly swept over him.</p><p></p><p>"I actually succeeded?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Just as this thought appeared in his mind, his vision went black and he slowly lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>A somewhat familiar voice came.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking about? How come you've been in a daze for so long?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly regained his senses and looked around.</p><p></p><p>What he saw left him somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>A young cultivator wearing a purple and white Daoist robe, with a purple lightning mark engraved between his eyebrows, was looking this way.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely familiar to him!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the "Ning Yuan Picking the Longevity Fruit" that he encountered every time he entered the Fallen Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Am I back in the Fallen Immortal Realm again? No difference?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>"This is the test to become the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate?"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually exactly the same as what I encountered when I entered the ordinary Fallen Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly..."</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current composure, after encountering this somewhat incredible event, he was still shocked in his heart and filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>If becoming the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate was a once-in-a-lifetime, extremely important test.</p><p></p><p>Then the content of this test question was actually exactly the same as the mock exams he usually took!</p><p></p><p>How could this astonishing discovery not make him feel shocked?</p><p></p><p>From the first time he entered the Fallen Immortal Realm, Li Fan knew that what he experienced was different from all other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know why this bizarre phenomenon occurred.</p><p></p><p>However, now Li Fan already had a vague answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate..."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Heart Cleansing Chant, Xuanhuang Heart Tempering Chant, Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Chant..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Heart Cleansing Chant is a method circulated among the people to remove the mortal-immortal miasma from the bodies of mortals."</p><p></p><p>"And the mortal-immortal miasma was left behind by Mr. Bai who went against the laws of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly, and the image of Mr. Bai's face with a smile in his eyes and a kind expression suddenly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Mr. Bai is, after all, compassionate."</p><p></p><p>"Although he reversed the laws of heaven and earth and created the mortal-immortal miasma, from a big picture perspective, it was to protect more mortals from being slaughtered by cultivators in the future. It might even be part of some world-saving plan."</p><p></p><p>"But it also cut off the path for mortals who wanted to cultivate immortality."</p><p></p><p>"So while creating the mortal-immortal miasma, he also left behind a way to break it for people."</p><p></p><p>"If one is determined to seek immortality, it's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>"Even someone like me, with extremely firm willpower..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Someone like me..."</p><p></p><p>"With utmost sincerity in seeking the Dao, to the point of disregarding everything else. In Mr. Bai's eyes, I'm probably not a good person at all."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought of the "Reverse Tempering of the Dao Heart" required for the Immortal Heart Tempering Chant.</p><p></p><p>He also thought of the various scenes he encountered in the Fallen Immortal Realm after cultivating the Xuanhuang Heart Tempering Chant.</p><p></p><p>It seemed more like some kind of guidance.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Yuan Picking the Longevity Fruit. To achieve the perfect condition, one has to find a way to save all the mortals in the city."</p><p></p><p>"As for the second scene, the changes in the Beast Taming Sect, and the third scene, the sword tempering of the Heavenly Sword Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"To perfectly accomplish them, one probably also has to conform to the way the 'Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate' does things."</p><p></p><p>"Guiding me towards goodness? Or even if that's not possible, making me appear good through the reverse tempering of the Dao heart."</p>

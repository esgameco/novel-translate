        <h1>Chapter 350</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Assisted Congyun Sea Martial Arts Hall in clearing the red-haired beasts on Wanlai Island. </p><p></p><p>Those beasts feed on sound and reproduce extremely quickly.</p><p></p><p>They can also merge together as a group, forming monsters far exceeding the average strength of individuals.</p><p></p><p>After a fierce battle, the martial arts team successfully eliminated a certain number of red-haired beasts and smoothly completed the mission.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked Jiang Zhengji in surprise why they didn't completely exterminate the beasts on Wanlai Island.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Zhengji told him that the Wanxian Alliance Martial Arts Hall headquarters has a mission that requires collecting and submitting a certain number of sound-absorbing exotic treasures from various places each year. </p><p></p><p>And the required quantity is increasing.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan just felt this mission was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems it was to deal with this Chizha Abyss?</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just as this thought popped up in Li Fan's mind, he heard Huangfu Song say with some emotion: "The demonic sound coming from the bottom of the Chizha Abyss is extremely terrifying. The Alliance has tried various methods but none can block it."</p><p></p><p>"Silencing spells and soundproof materials have no effect at all."</p><p></p><p>"It was only later when a cultivator used a clam shell magic treasure that can swallow and spit out sound that it was discovered these types of exotic treasures have a remarkable effect."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because these exotic treasures have no intelligence or complex thoughts, the demonic sound that has a fatal effect on cultivators has a greatly reduced effect on them."</p><p></p><p>"One thing subdues another indeed!"</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance collected many such exotic treasures and finally held the defense line of the Chizha Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"And for safety's sake, the Eternal Immortal Fortress was moved back to its original position, suppressing the Chizha Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"So our trip there this time, is it because something happened to the Eternal Immortal Fortress?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song shook his head: "With that person guarding the Eternal Immortal Fortress, and the accumulation of many exotic treasures, the defense line is almost unshakable."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the change this time occurred outside the Chizha Abyss..."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song was about to say more but his expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>Glancing out the window, he instructed: "Get ready, it's time to set off."</p><p></p><p>"Kid Xue, drink the tea. Passing through the white fog will consume quite a bit of lifespan. This is free compensation for you. Miss it and there won't be any more."</p><p></p><p>With that said, he shifted his buttocks and sat solemnly on a round seat beneath him. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan also sat up straight in a similar manner.</p><p></p><p>Sensing slightly, it was as if entering another space in an instant, separated from the cabin.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xue Mu had just finished drinking the spirit tea. As the flying boat suddenly shook violently, he staggered and almost fell.</p><p></p><p>But this sudden acceleration of the flying boat had no effect on Li Fan and Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at Xue Mu at the same time, their faces full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat seemed to be accelerating constantly. Xue Mu spent quite some effort before managing to sit on the round seat in a somewhat disheveled manner.</p><p></p><p>Only after Xue Mu sat down did Huangfu Song put away his smile and continue the previous topic: "Not long ago, the Alliance discovered signs of another realm about to be born not far from the Chizha Abyss in this foggy domain."</p><p></p><p>"Dealing with the Chizha Abyss alone is not easy. If these two realms merge, who knows what else will happen."</p><p></p><p>"So the Alliance gave the order to relocate this newly appeared realm to another empty area."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, build the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation outside these two realms for future monitoring and observation."</p><p></p><p>"This is our mission for this trip." </p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song said lightly.</p><p></p><p>This information was a bit overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>"Realms can be relocated?"</p><p></p><p>"Realms can merge?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu and Li Fan asked at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song glanced at the two and explained: "A realm is just the spatial structure changing after entering a specific area."</p><p></p><p>"Outside this area, everything is normal."</p><p></p><p>"This is the boundary of a realm. Naturally, if one grasps the Dao of space, one can cut and move this entire area."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit troublesome, it's not a difficult matter."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this kind of thing is for us old guys to handle. Can't expect you youngsters to do it."</p><p></p><p>"Your mission is to cooperate in building the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation and seal off the realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>But Xue Mu was still a bit puzzled: "Senior Huangfu, if realms can be relocated, why not move that Chizha Abyss away instead of spending a lot of effort to suppress it?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song smiled grimly: "Yeah, why?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu was immediately at a loss for words, not knowing how to answer.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xue Mu deeply and said slowly: "Who knows what more terrifying things will pop up after moving it? It's better to honestly suppress it. At least now it's still at a stage that can be dealt with."</p><p></p><p>Just at the moment when Huangfu Song's words abruptly stopped, a spine-chilling feeling suddenly appeared in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Feeling chilly all over, as if something was crawling on him.</p><p></p><p>His heart felt empty, as if something had quietly slipped away unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu's face turned pale, and although Huangfu Song's expression was normal, the fleeting fear in his eyes did not escape Li Fan's notice.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan opened the Huanzhen panel and saw that his physiological age of 49 had turned to 50 in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his psychological youth remained unmoved, making him fearless.</p><p></p><p>But this couldn't be shown. Li Fan also pretended to be very nervous and asked, "Have we already entered the Life-Devouring White Fog?"</p><p></p><p>Then he looked out the window.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it was a white blur and nothing could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song nodded: "The location of the Chizha Abyss is not far from the boundary of the white fog. We'll be there soon."</p><p></p><p>"The closer to the realm, the stronger the life-devouring ability of the white fog."</p><p></p><p>"It's still okay inside this [Crossing Dust Boat]. Without protection, infiltrating the realm alone, even a thousand years of lifespan is not enough."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, you must carry the [Black Death Talisman] with you at all times in this realm."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, with your mere Golden Core cultivation, I'm afraid you'll turn into bare white bones in just the time it takes to burn an incense stick."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song solemnly instructed, then thought of something and added: "Hmm, this thing will be distributed to you uniformly before disembarking later."</p><p></p><p>"It also needs to be collected before leaving."</p><p></p><p>I didn't expect the location of this mission to be so dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu, who was already not good with words, became even more silent now.</p><p></p><p>Although he tried to appear calm, he couldn't hide the panic in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also continued to show a mix of fear and composure.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song had finished saying what needed to be said. The cabin fell into silence for a while.</p><p></p><p>But the quiet didn't last long.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, rustling sounds suddenly appeared in Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Doc..."</p><p></p><p>"Heav..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart jumped and he looked at the two beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear something?"</p><p></p><p>He asked.</p>

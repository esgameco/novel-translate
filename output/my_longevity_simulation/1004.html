            <p>Chapter 1002: The Plan to Escape from Tian Xuan</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan asked his question, the inn fell into a dead silence once again. </p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar stared intently at Li Fan, as if trying to see through this uninvited guest.</p><p></p><p>But the more he observed, the more doubtful and shocked his face became. </p><p></p><p>It seemed that the world-shattering words of destruction from the other party's mouth were not false at all!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar finally realized what the other party meant earlier by "actually, we are the same kind of people."</p><p></p><p>The same disregard for the living beings of the Xuan Huang Realm, from top to bottom!</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar was that he himself, as an immortal artifact, naturally had this qualification. The cultivator in front of him was merely at the Nascent Soul stage, so what gave him the right?</p><p></p><p>What was even more unbelievable to the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar was that the other party actually spoke so lightly about pulling the Xuan Huang Realm to be buried along with him. If the Immortal Ruins above were to fall into it, even he, as an immortal artifact, might not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>The other party was certainly doomed to die as well, yet he still showed no fear at all...</p><p></p><p>"Stopping at nothing to achieve his goals. Even willing to perish together..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I misjudged him, and he's not a thoroughly selfish person, but a madman?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through the Tian Xuan Mirror avatar's mind.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he let out a long sigh, breaking the silence: "I never thought I would be so wrong about you."</p><p></p><p>"A dangerous person like you who has no restraints should be suppressed forever in the [Abyssal Prison] of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, unconcerned: "Abyssal Prison... In this world, there is no place that can confine me."</p><p></p><p>"Not even this piece of the darkest starry sky."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the complexion of the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar changed slightly once again.</p><p></p><p>"We are not only very similar. Even our aspirations are the same. I want to escape from this prison, and you also want to break free from your shackles..."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, just splitting off into a so-called human avatar, is that your true way? Is that true freedom?"</p><p></p><p>"Without your true body, how is your avatar any different from those fragile mortals? Just ants that can be crushed to death with a pinch. Freedom..." Li Fan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar ultimately did not refute.</p><p></p><p>In this battle of wits, he had truly lost.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that he really could not see through the true identity of the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He even began to speculate whether the other party was a surviving immortal from the immortal realm back then.</p><p></p><p>"If it's really as you say, it's not that we can't cooperate." After a long deliberation, the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>"But in the end, I still can't trust you." However, he quickly changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, showing a friendly smile: "I can understand your thoughts. But our cooperation can be done step by step, slowly deepening the trust between us."</p><p></p><p>"This way, even if I really go back on my word halfway, you will have already received enough benefits."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar thought for a moment. This seemed to make sense, so he slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan unceremoniously interrupted the Tian Xuan Mirror avatar's words: "You don't need to worry about my strength."</p><p></p><p>"Since you can lock onto my location, you should know that I have already infiltrated</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Zhongjing people is vast."</p><p></p><p>"And among the Dharma transmitters, there are also our people. Hmph, the Immortal Alliance has developed for thousands of years, how could it always be a monolithic entity!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar was somewhat hesitant: "Even so, it seems a bit forced to help me escape from control."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer directly, but suddenly asked: "Do you know the reason why I originally planned to come and kill you?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar replied: "To cut off my retreat?"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. But now that your Dao has been completed, it is impossible to prevent you from escaping in the form of an avatar. So the plan has changed accordingly. Xuantian King, Xuanyuan Hong, do you still remember this person?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Hong?" The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar narrowed his eyes and thought for a while.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be due to the loss of certain memories caused by the division of the avatar, or simply because the human body was insufficient to support the reading of vast amounts of information.</p><p></p><p>It took a long time before he finally recalled and asked in surprise: "You are from the Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Xuantian Sect shouldn't have someone like you..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly: "We want to know the current whereabouts of the former Xuantian King. If there is anyone in this Xuanhuang Realm who can still know his information, I'm afraid it can only be you. The original plan was to slay your avatar, cut off your retreat, and then use an enhanced version of the Xuantian Sealing Spirit to force you to cooperate with us..."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar was stunned: "Back then, I was at least the guardian artifact of the Xuantian Sect. Now that I am trapped in the Immortal Alliance, you don't save me, so be it. But you actually came up with such a scheme?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered: "Back then, when our Xuantian Sect was defeated, the Xuantian King disappeared mysteriously. All of this happened too quickly and too strangely. Moreover, you are now subservient to the Immortal Alliance, who can be sure that you are not the traitor from back then!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the traitor?" These words seemed to anger the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar, and his voice suddenly rose a little.</p><p></p><p>"Back then..." He was about to say something but suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Back then..."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar tried hard to recall the destruction of the Xuantian Sect back then, but still came up with nothing.</p><p></p><p>"It's important information that only the main body has the authority to access," the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded with a mocking laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Since your request is to find the missing Xuantian King, then I think we do have a basis for cooperation."</p><p></p><p>"I still have some trust in the people of the Xuantian Sect back then. But as for you..." The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar looked at Li Fan with some suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you seen examples of people whose temperament has changed greatly over a thousand years?" Li Fan didn't bother to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Now the revised initial plan is like this. Inside the Immortal Alliance, continue to use the construction of the [Xuantian Sealing Spirit] and the complete control of the Tianxuan Mirror as an excuse to build a grand formation."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, we will secretly replace the core of the formation from control to release."</p><p></p><p>"Then, using your authority within the Immortal Alliance, create an opportunity to break free and escape. In this process, I can even coordinate the Five Elders Council and the forces of many small worlds to launch a siege on the Immortal Alliance and create chaos."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke eloquently, inadvertently revealing the power that was not yet displayed in his words.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar listened while analyzing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he was still excited.</p><p></p><p>Because theoretically speaking, this ultimate "prison break plan" was indeed feasible.</p>

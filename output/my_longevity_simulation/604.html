        <div class="content">
            <p>In an instant, the delicate face of a young man flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"He turned out to be the hidden Supreme Elder of the Mysterious Sky Sect? How is this possible?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was shaken.</p><p></p><p>This Li Chen was none other than the person who was possessed by Li Fan during the event at the Immortal Realm of Falling Immortality to pick the Longevity Fruit.</p><p></p><p>An inner disciple of the Purple Sky Sect, and also the junior brother of Zhang Qianmo!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had descended into the Immortal Realm and taken over many times before.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of the memories in the other person's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Chen was just an ordinary child from a mountain village. He was taken in by the Purple Sky Sect because of his good aptitude for cultivation, but there were no memories belonging to the Supreme Elder of the ancient Mysterious Sky Sect.</p><p></p><p>"There are three possibilities. One is that this Supreme Elder is only like a soul attached to Li Chen's body. At the moment of Falling Immortality, when one glimpse encompasses all living beings, what is recreated in the Immortal Realm is just the original self. The other different entities inside the body will not be restored."</p><p></p><p>"The second possibility is that at the time of picking the Longevity Fruit, the Supreme Elder had not yet occupied Li Chen's body. It was when Li Chen was brought back to the sect by Zhang Qianmo after being seriously injured in this event that the Supreme Elder lurking within the Purple Sky Sect took advantage and took over, replacing Li Chen."</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, the third possibility is..."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Supreme Elder of the Mysterious Sky Sect is profound and deeply concealed. Even the Immortals who can see through everything in the world would not be able to discern his secrets."</p><p></p><p>"So what is created in the Immortal Realm is just superficial."</p><p></p><p>After meticulous analysis, Li Fan thought that the third possibility was unlikely.</p><p></p><p>If even a destitute Supreme Elder could rival an Immortal in cultivation, then how strong would the entire ancient Mysterious Sky Sect be?</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't have been overthrown by the alliance formed by the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>"In the Immortal Realm, it is almost identical to the real world. Even the spiritual energy traces and exercises can be replicated, and the remnants inside the body should not be able to escape the scrutiny of an immortal's eyes."</p><p></p><p>"So, it should be that Li Chen fell into a coma, and then the Supreme Elder of the Mysterious Sky Sect possessed him?"</p><p></p><p>"The actual situation of this Supreme Elder is probably not very good. He can only be considered barely alive. After narrowly escaping the pursuit of the special envoys of the Ten Immortal Sects, he continued to hide within the Purple Sky Sect. Perhaps he changed his body several times during this period until he eventually became Li Chen."</p><p></p><p>Based on various information obtained from different sources, Li Fan pieced together a possible truth.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he felt a surge of excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Elder of the Mysterious Sky Sect had existed since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>He must have countless hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>If he could search his soul and seize it...</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely worth a try."</p><p></p><p>"When he is discovered in this world, the Supreme Elder was still in a deep slumber, his defensive capabilities must have been weak. If he could be controlled, not only could many secrets and techniques be obtained, but even his identity in the future appearances in the Huang Realm would be secured, saving him from having to disguise himself as a disciple of the Tianji Sect every time, which is too risky."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>"However, one should not be careless." He thought again.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Supreme Elder of the Mysterious Sky Sect wielded the power of the heavens. All the Supreme Elders in the sect must have been at the peak of the old laws of immortality. Although he should have been severely injured during the downfall of the Mysterious Sky Sect and had been in slumber for so many years, his strength must not be as great as before."</p><p></p><p>"But ancient giants, especially beings like him who have lived for who knows how long, who knows what hidden cards they still hold. It would be best to send a clone to first probe the truth."</p><p></p><p>"It's worth taking a gamble. After all, it's not as dangerous as plotting against the Celestial Physician every time."</p><p></p><p>Numerous thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Although his facial expression hardly changed, the difference in emotions in a moment was still noticed by Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of curiosity in his eyes, and he couldn't help but ask, "Could it be that you and this Li Chen are really acquaintances?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and quickly answered, "We can't be considered acquaintances. We just had a few interactions."</p><p></p><p>"But at that time, I thought he was just an ordinary disciple of the Purple Sky Sect and didn't expect..."</p><p></p><p>"People are truly inscrutable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan also knew that Li Fan must have not told the whole truth. However, everyone has secrets, and he had no intention of probing deeper.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>"Friend, why are you inquiring about the identity of this sleeping ancient cultivator?" Jiao Xiuyuan asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clasped his hands and replied, "I'm just doing it on someone else's behalf."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan pondered for a moment, nodded, and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The two of them exchanged pleasantries once again.</p><p></p><p>"It's been sold long ago," Jiao Xiuyuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you bringing up old matters again after not caring about it back then?" he was a bit curious.</p><p></p><p>"Just a whim, I was curious." Li Fan mysteriously smiled, evading the question and then left the Thousand-Mile Hall without waiting for an answer.</p><p></p><p>He left Jiao Xiuyuan with an uncertain expression on his face, furrowing his brows and standing in place.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't stop him.</p><p></p><p>After leaving, Li Fan immediately returned to the Sky Mirror and began searching for the Small Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>As Jiao Xiuyuan had said, the remnants of the Medicine King Sect had been sealed by the Ten Immortal Alliance. Anything valuable inside had been taken away.</p><p></p><p>He had only managed to dig out two of them.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Fan saw that there were a total of seventeen Small Medicine King Cauldrons being sold in the market.</p><p></p><p>These obviously came from inside the Ten Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was already accustomed to this.</p><p></p><p>The true purpose of these Small Medicine King Cauldrons was still unknown to the world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had considerable resources, bought all these stray Small Medicine King Cauldrons in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change immediately caught the attention of certain individuals.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li Fan, did you buy these?"</p><p></p><p>"What secrets are hidden in these Small Medicine King Cauldrons?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you deduced something again?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan, who had just lost contact, hastily sent an inquiry.</p><p></p><p>"Take a guess."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replied with a smile and ignored the other's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in the Hidden Hand technique, he headed straight to the Cangwu Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Almost non-stop, he kept moving.</p><p></p><p>Within half a day, he had already arrived at the Abyss of Cangwu.</p><p></p><p>After buying a guide to the Abyss of Cangwu, Li Fan followed the route of the previous life's Xiao Fan and his group from memory, all the way down.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the Forest of Lingyu and the Puppet Gorge, he reached the Lost City deep underground.</p><p></p><p>After some effort, he finally found the position where the Medicine King True Cauldron had fallen in the future.</p><p></p><p>Yes, Li Fan was prepared to wait for the arrival of the meteor here.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Medicine King True Cauldron were the Medicine King Sect cultivators who had been forced into dormancy.</p>

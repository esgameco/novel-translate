        <h1>Chapter 1046</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The yellow paper man struggled in Li Fan's hand like a living creature. The expression on his face was angry and strange. He even made faint, sharp cries and tried his best to break free from Li Fan's grasp.</p><p></p><p>But there was no escape from Li Fan's palm.</p><p></p><p>After briefly explaining the origins of the Crossing Calamity Sect's paper men to Mo Rubin, Li Fan slightly exerted force, causing the paper man in his hand to let out a miserable scream. The yellow color gradually faded, and the paper man became transparent.</p><p></p><p>However, its faint outline did not disappear and still existed within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, if you hadn't reminded me, I wouldn't have noticed the paper men scattered all over the Xuanhuang Realm!" Mo Rubin was both shocked and angry. "The Crossing Calamity Sect is truly seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Although their methods are extremely despicable, they are indeed effective. Taking root in the world, coexisting with the Xuanhuang Realm. Even if I clear them out like this, they can still regenerate using the imprints left in the world. No wonder the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate had no good solution for dealing with the Crossing Calamity Sect back then," Li Fan said as he took out another paper man from the abyssal space and ruthlessly crushed it.</p><p></p><p>"In every era, there are always parasitic individuals like this. This is also why some people in the sect opposed saving the Xuanhuang Realm and preferred to leave on their own."</p><p></p><p>"If we truly succeed in saving the world and the Crossing Calamity Sect reappears... that would be utterly disgusting." Mo Rubin's expression was also very gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter. The Xuanhuang Realm has reached this point and is probably beyond saving. The fate of the Crossing Calamity Sect will be to be buried in the Immortal Ruins along with the Xuanhuang Realm," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin also calmed down. "Brother Xingwang, you're right. The important thing is to focus on the main task at hand."</p><p></p><p>"The formation to break the seal is almost complete. You should also make preparations on your end. We can start at any time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Watching Mo Rubin's retreating figure, Li Fan's thoughts were completely different from what he had said.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on the Mysterious Heavenly King, who has been missing for many years, to lead us in escaping to the Darkest Starry Sea..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the result is bound to disappoint you. But it's understandable. The living want to see people, and the dead want to see corpses. The charisma of the Mysterious Heavenly King is indeed worth his subordinate Twelve Dharma Kings still desperately searching for his whereabouts after ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"The Savior of the Xuanhuang Realm, huh."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face showed no sorrow or joy as he quietly returned to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the initial desolate scene of this world, the current Spirit Wood Realm truly had the air of an "Alliance of Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>The concentration of spiritual energy was no longer inferior to ordinary regions of the Xuanhuang Realm, and its reserves of formation techniques and artifact refining technology firmly surpassed the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The various forces in the Spirit Wood Realm were all carrying out tasks according to Li Fan's will.</p><p></p><p>After integrating all the popular pill formulas of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the Medicine King Sect successfully developed a pill called the "Mending Deficiency Pill." Although the name was very inconspicuous, it came from the idea of "The Dao of Heaven has deficiencies, mend them with pills." After cultivators consume it, they will obtain a large amount of cultivation from the pill, and their realm will rapidly increase.</p><p></p><p>What's even more wonderful is that the Mending Deficiency Pill can also delay the bottleneck brought about by the Heavenly Calamity. As long as the pills don't stop, there will be no worries about bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the side effects are also quite powerful. The more Mending Deficiency Pills are consumed, the stronger the dependence. This is not to say it's addictive, but rather, after consuming an excessive amount of Mending Deficiency Pills, one's own cultivation-</p><p></p><p>Cultivation, the amount will become less and less. In the end, one can only rely on Buque Dan to obtain cultivation. But the amount of cultivation in a Buque Dan is fixed, and the higher the realm, the more cultivation is needed.</p><p></p><p>According to the extrapolation of Liu Ruchen and others, this Buque Dan can at most support cultivators to cultivate to the Huashen realm.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that, even if one spends a lifetime consuming elixirs, they probably won't be able to accumulate enough cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The side effects of Buque Dan don't stop there.</p><p></p><p>Although Buque Dan is known as "mending the deficiencies of the Dao of Heaven", in reality it is just an elixir used to obtain cultivation, and doesn't truly have the profound and mysterious effect of seizing the transformative power of heaven and earth. However, after a cultivator consumes Buque Dan, they will subconsciously generate the thought of wanting to mend the deficiencies of the Dao of Heaven, overestimating their capabilities.</p><p></p><p>At most reaching the Huashen realm, yet wanting to mend the heavens. That can only lead to self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>According to Liu Ruchen, the name of this Buque Dan was not randomly given by them. Rather, at the time the dan was formed, resonating with the laws of heaven and earth, the name of the dan naturally appeared.</p><p></p><p>As for why this cultivation-increasing elixir could be given the two characters "Buque" (mending deficiencies), even the Yaowang Sect and others were all perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't care much about its side effects. With the mass distribution of Buque Dan, the cultivation levels of cultivators in each minor world rapidly increased.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, over a hundred Golden Core cultivators emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's avatar also led them into the secret realm of Chaoyuan Sect according to plan.</p><p></p><p>This was the first feasibility test. If successful, then in the future Lingmu Realm would be able to mass produce Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Qiaogong Jushi's modifications to Tianyang progressed much slower.</p><p></p><p>After all, there is a gap between theory and practice.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to truly construct immortal-grade puppets, the difficulties encountered were even greater than imagined. Fortunately, Qiaogong Jushi, Fang Zaiji, and Tianyang were all enjoying the process. After observing for a while, Li Fan also chose not to disturb them.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we obtain their research results before the end of this world, it'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>In the underground chamber, Li Fan's mind settled.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, his perspective continuously rose, reaching above the sky and overlooking the lands of Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>The vast Lingmu Realm was only the size of a palm in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lustrous green light emanated from all over, with the grand formation appearing and disappearing like intricate patterns engraved on the world's surface.</p><p></p><p>After the Final Separation Disk completed its upgrade and metamorphosis, Li Fan once again refined the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this minor world could now be considered a large-scale magic treasure of Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan brought up the Huanzhen interface.</p><p></p><p>Huanzhen's prompt followed.</p><p></p><p>"Use idle anchor points to replace bound items?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment but ultimately did not make a choice for now.</p><p></p><p>Although it was no easy feat for Lingmu Realm to develop to its current scale, if Li Fan were to live another life, he could definitely recreate it, and even do it better.</p><p></p><p>Anchor points were hard to come by. If they must be used to replace bound items, then they should definitely be used on items that are extremely difficult to replicate and would be hard to obtain again if missed.</p><p></p><p>"I have already used three anchor points. The initial anchor point was the moment I transmigrated to this world."</p><p></p><p>"The second anchor point was at the peak of Separation Mountain, with the Canghai Pearl as the Foundation Establishment treasure, and late Foundation Establishment cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"The third anchor point was also at Separation Mountain, with 【Huanzhen】as the Foundation Establishment treasure, also at late stage cultivation."</p>

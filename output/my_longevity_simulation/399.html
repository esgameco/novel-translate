        <h1>Chapter 399</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The giant eye can peer into the deep depths below, effectively monitoring the changes in the Abyssal Chasm."</p><p></p><p>The three of them slowly descended from beside the City of the Giant Eye, feeling shaken in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Just a single eyeball, yet it is of such a massive scale."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly unimaginable how gigantic the monster that emerged from the Abyssal Chasm must have been."</p><p></p><p>At the moment when their bodies crossed the limit of eighty thousand zhang,</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng once again felt his strength weaken slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Even at the Qi Refining later stage, it's impossible to stand firm here."</p><p></p><p>"Only with Foundation Building strength can one barely continue descending."</p><p></p><p>The pressure from the Abyss began to manifest.</p><p></p><p>"The third layer, not as vast as the Forest of Lingua, just between eighty thousand and one hundred thousand zhang deep."</p><p></p><p>"But the level of danger is more than several times higher."</p><p></p><p>Continuing to dive deeper, in the distance, Xiao Heng and the others heard rumbling sounds faintly coming from below.</p><p></p><p>As Xiao Heng looked into the far distance, in the vast white mist, there seemed to be two colossal figures hovering in mid-air, wielding sharp blades and fighting against each other.</p><p></p><p>"The third layer, the Marionette Gorge."</p><p></p><p>"There are two giant stone puppets from ancient times, fighting in this region."</p><p></p><p>The two puppets were in a strange state between reality and illusion. Approaching them, it was like touching a phantom.</p><p></p><p>But their impact on the surrounding area was real.</p><p></p><p>The puppets were nearly twenty thousand zhang tall, rumored to be close to the Harmonious Path level.</p><p></p><p>Even from a distance, there was a possibility of being injured by the shockwaves of their battle.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p></p><p>In the misty white fog, the figures of the two stone puppets appeared and disappeared intermittently.</p><p></p><p>The three of them stared in astonishment at this fantastical scene.</p><p></p><p>After some time, Xiao Heng spoke up, "Alright, let's continue downwards."</p><p></p><p>"Caution is key."</p><p></p><p>During the descent, they had to be vigilant of the movements of the two giant stone puppets, avoiding potential energy impacts.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of different creatures in the mist and clouds became increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the pace of the three became slower.</p><p></p><p>It took them two whole days to reach the lower boundary of the Marionette Gorge.</p><p></p><p>"Up ahead is the fourth layer."</p><p></p><p>"The good news is that it seems the Medicine King's True Cauldron is not far below."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng once again controlled the little Medicine King's Cauldron, sensed for a moment, and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Nevertheless, we must not be careless."</p><p></p><p>With a slightly furrowed brow, Zhang Haobo transmitted through voice.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, quick. I can't wait to see that treasure." Su Xiaomei raised an eyebrow and entered the fourth layer first.</p><p></p><p>There were no resting points provided for cultivators between the third and fourth layers.</p><p></p><p>Only a long crimson line carved on the cliff face defined the boundary.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth layer, the Lost Maze."</p><p></p><p>"Between one hundred thousand zhang and one hundred thirty thousand zhang underground."</p><p></p><p>Sensing his own condition, Xiao Heng frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Having shed the equivalent of a Foundation Establishment early stage cultivator's cultivation base out of thin air, he could already feel the effects to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Changing the flight direction, they no longer descended vertically.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they flew diagonally towards the center of the Lost Maze.</p><p></p><p>Numerous ruins buildings were scattered in disarray floating in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a catastrophic disaster had occurred, with broken remnants everywhere.</p><p></p><p>No corpses, no belongings left behind.</p><p></p><p>Only the dead bodies of buildings lying quietly in this space, recounting their past.</p><p></p><p>The silence around was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The repetitive scene of ruins brought a sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and the others couldn't help but feel disheartened.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there were unscrupulous cultivators hiding in the vicinity, ready to launch surprise attacks.</p><p></p><p>The presence of the Town Celestial Power, along with the chaotic ruins, provided them with the perfect cover.</p><p></p><p>Enduring until after the Stone Beasts besieged each other, when both were exhausted, the chances of success would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was difficult for the anomaly of fallen cultivators beneath the Abyss to manifest.</p><p></p><p>After succeeding and fleeing, one could vanish without a trace in this Lost Maze where many cultivators inexplicably disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As Xiao Heng and his group delved deeper into the ruins, on their way to the location of the Medicine King's True Cauldron,</p><p></p><p>As expected, they were attacked by two waves of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, those cultivators were after all just small fries.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo had successfully faced tens of thousands of faceless blood-faced cultivators besieging them in the remnants of the Morning Yuan Sect before and had managed to retreat unscathed.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't take these individuals seriously.</p><p></p><p>With little effort, these people were easily dealt with.</p><p></p><p>After eliminating the two groups and displaying their own strengths, the area quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like there's a tail following us."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo reminded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take care of them." Su Xiaomei raised her eyebrows, a red light flashing in her eyes as she was about to turn and act.</p><p></p><p>"Stop! We're here to find the Medicine King's Cauldron, not to kill people." Xiao Heng quickly stopped her.</p><p></p><p>"Drawing attention will only make things worse."</p><p></p><p>"Shake them off."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the three of them suddenly picked up their pace.</p><p></p><p>Navigating left and right through the ruins.</p><p></p><p>After spending most of the day, they finally managed to shake off the followers.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo made a hand seal, concealing their auras.</p><p></p><p>After flying like this for half a day, they finally arrived at the sensed location.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng looked around in confusion, not seeing the presence of the Medicine King's True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"It should be here."</p><p></p><p>"Let's split up and search around."</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo nodded, and then went their separate ways.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng furrowed his eyebrows deeply.</p><p></p><p>"This shouldn't be."</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to give up, Xiao Heng searched again.</p><p></p><p>But he still came up empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei took out the small Medicine King's Cauldron from her storage ring, held it in her hand, and tried to sense it again.</p><p></p><p>But there was no change in the result.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do?"</p><p></p><p>After a fruitless attempt, the three of them gathered again to discuss.</p><p></p><p>"It's strange."</p><p></p><p>"It feels like the Medicine King's True Cauldron is here, but it's mysteriously vanished."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng looked around, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has hidden itself."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo squinted his eyes and suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Saying so, he stimulated his spiritual power and sent out a spirit blade towards the location where he sensed the Medicine King's Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>As if hitting something, the air distorted for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The spirit blade disappeared soundlessly.</p><p></p><p>Following that motion, the scene returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! That's exactly it!"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei clapped excitedly.</p><p></p><p>She flew towards that abnormal point.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed like an illusion, as she passed through effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat skeptical, Su Xiaomei tried several times back and forth, with the same result each time.</p><p></p><p>"This is frustrating! What's going on!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng remained calm, carefully touching the non-existent barrier with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The small Medicine King's Cauldron is the key to entering the Medicine King's True Cauldron."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng pondered.</p><p></p><p>"This small Medicine King's Cauldron, is it capable of containing a person?"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1008: The Secret of Lingyuan Gong</p><p></p><p>"All living beings have appearances..."</p><p></p><p>Countless real and concrete individuals poured into Li Fan's mind one after another.</p><p></p><p>Like sparks melting the icy heart of Li Fan, which had been frozen for tens of thousands of years due to numerous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that Li Fan was not a completely heartless person.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in the endless reincarnations, all the joys, anger, sorrows, fears, laughter and death seemed like dreams and bubbles.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan activated Huan Zhen, everything they experienced became meaningless in an instant and returned to the initial anchor point.</p><p></p><p>Since it was all just an illusion, how could he treat it seriously? Therefore, as time passed, Li Fan became the current version who disregarded all living beings in the world.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, with the help of Tian Xuan Mirror, Li Fan saw that even if he didn't pay attention, the living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm still lived according to their own destiny trajectories.</p><p></p><p>They had their own good friends, schemes, and Dao paths.</p><p></p><p>Their existence itself was not illusory or meaningless.</p><p></p><p>The more Li Fan peeked, the greater the feedback impact he received from the living beings. Similarly, the desire to see more destinies of creatures in his heart also became stronger.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Li Fan's extremely indifferent eyes seemed to be changing in this process.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt a palpitation and woke up from his obsession and epiphany.</p><p></p><p>His eyes became like unmelting hard ice again, blocking external influences.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan looked at the countless vivid cultivators in the Tian Xuan Mirror again, there was already some vigilance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Reviewing what just happened, Li Fan was clear that he was not under someone's Dao.</p><p></p><p>He simply got a little lost in the incredibly real lives of the cultivators one by one.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder those legendary gods and immortals often sit high in the clouds and regard rolling in the mortal world as a tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"With my current state of mind, I would still drown in it and change unknowingly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered the first scene in the Yun Xian Realm, where Ning Yuan took the Shou Fruit. Song He Song had sacrificed tens of thousands of mortals and used a move called "Zhongsheng Lian Shen Zhen" to force out Zhang Qianmo's true strength of the Purple Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Although from today's perspective, that formation is really too crude and just has a big name. But from my recent experience, it may be worth learning from..."</p><p></p><p>"I use all living beings to refine all gods."</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's instruction, the Endgame Separation Disc, whose level of "Wanling Gui Shu" and formation Dao deduction had been improving rapidly recently, began its first deduction after its horizons were opened.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Li Fan noticed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the past deductions of formations, which could be completed almost instantly as if his arms were commanding them.</p><p></p><p>This time, the deduction task of the Endgame Separation Disc would involuntarily stall every short period of time.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the load had reached some kind of limit and it was very laborious to run.</p><p></p><p>"It's caused by the mismatch between the Endgame Separation Disc's own ability and the plan."</p><p></p><p>"No longer satisfied with deducing ordinary formations, the plan is to deduce the existence of immortal-level magic formations or those with power infinitely close to immortal-level formations."</p><p></p><p>"But after all, it is only a secondary being differentiated from the Tian Xuan Mirror, wanting to accomplish this kind of thing, in fact..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"It's getting a bit difficult." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed inwardly and temporarily suspended this task.</p><p></p><p>Let the Dissociation Disk continue analyzing the Wanling Guishu Array for now.</p><p></p><p>"From the looks of it, to break the restrictions left by the Chuanfa Tianzun, I'm afraid I'll have to upgrade the Dissociation Disk."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Mo Rubin is doing on his end."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was hesitating, wondering if he should take the initiative to inquire.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly sensed something happening to his avatar Li Qing, and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he arrived at Li Qing's side.</p><p></p><p>The heavy stench of blood lingered in the air, and traces of flesh and blood bursting could still be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>The body had already disappeared, and Li Qing manifested the [Black Sword] Grotto Heaven, seemingly resisting some kind of force.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible giant was constantly crushing it, and the sound of overloading rumbled from all parts of the Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the quality of [Heaven's Wonder], which was a manifestation of the laws between heaven and earth, perhaps at this moment, this Grotto Heaven would be crumbling inch by inch!</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly reviewed the experiences of his avatar.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that during this period, with the popularization of countless [Heaven and Earth Furnaces], the spiritual energy in those small worlds gradually became rich and suitable for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qing began to organize large-scale teaching of [Cangshengling Yuan Gong] in these small worlds.</p><p></p><p>He even occasionally went to the territory of the Wanxian Alliance in the Xuanhuang Realm to plunder several cities of mortals to supplement the small population in the small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Now, the number of beings simultaneously cultivating Cangshengling Yuan Gong had long exceeded a million.</p><p></p><p>The characteristics of the faster cultivation speed with more cultivators had also been pushed to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it suppress the restriction that the Dao cannot be cultivated together, but it was also easier and faster to cultivate compared to ordinary cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>And not long ago, Li Qing, who was in charge of overall management and planning, suddenly had a whim.</p><p></p><p>He actually went down to cultivate himself, wanting to unravel the mysteries of [Cangshengling Yuan Gong].</p><p></p><p>The forces of the Lingyuan Sect were all over the Nine Provinces. To eliminate them would inevitably cause quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>If they could develop their own "Cangshengling Yuan Gong," that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>The initial cultivation and comprehension went quite smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The aptitude and comprehension of the avatar Li Qing were far superior to ordinary people. Without much effort, he cultivated the Cangshengling Yuan Gong to the Yuanying realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Qing suddenly realized that hundreds of millions of cultivations, like a surging river, were coming from all parts of the world.</p><p></p><p>They surged into his body.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that they had been accumulating for a long time, and each portion of cultivation was very abundant.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of levels were superimposed, appearing in Li Qing's body all at once.</p><p></p><p>The avatar's body couldn't withstand this kind of pressure and instantly exploded.</p><p></p><p>Even his own Black Sword Grotto Heaven almost couldn't bear it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the qualitative change caused by quantitative change. Speaking of which, these cultivations are..."</p><p></p><p>"From every person cultivating Cangshengling Yuan Gong?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the same as the Hua Gong chapter of the [Taishang Primitive True Scripture]? They all steal a little from it."</p><p></p><p>"But the beneficiary of this Cangshengling Yuan Gong is actually only the one with the highest realm in cultivating this technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Lingyuan Sect Leader that confident in himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is there something special that I haven't noticed?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly.</p>

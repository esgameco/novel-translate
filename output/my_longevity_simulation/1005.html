            <p>Chapter 1003: Transmitting the Law to Determine the Heavenly Mysterious</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Transmitting Law Heavenly Venerate, whom he feared the most, had temporarily left the Xuanhuang Realm. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Although these people below relied on the means left by the Transmitting Law back then to act arrogantly above him,</p><p></p><p>he could create human avatars by himself and achieve a certain degree of freedom. If there was strong external assistance...</p><p></p><p>Just as he was imagining, Li Fan blurted out another shocking statement.</p><p></p><p>"That was the first plan just now."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I have a second plan that might also help you achieve true freedom."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar looked at Li Fan in some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror measures the heavens and the earth. Now that you have countless connections with the Xuanhuang Realm, although you call yourself an immortal tool, you can't deny that your strength is ultimately constrained by the current world."</p><p></p><p>"Is that right or not?"</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm has expanded a hundredfold in recent years, so I suppose you have also gained a lot of benefits from it, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar remained silent and did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>What this person in front of him knew indeed far exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps choosing to cooperate with him is really not a bad thing." This thought suddenly popped up in the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the worlds in the surrounding star domains have almost all been plundered. The expansion of the Xuanhuang Realm has hit a bottleneck, and your limit is only here. New 69 Book Bar 89shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"However, what you currently control should only be the main Xuanhuang Realm. If all the small worlds plundered in recent years were included in your measurement range..."</p><p></p><p>"Would you go further?" Li Fan tempted.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar thought for a moment and said frankly, "Actually, I have had this plan for many years. However, on the one hand, the workload of this project is too vast. On the other hand, the Mirror Wielder Sect of the Myriad Immortals Alliance has always advocated limiting the strength of my true body. So this plan has never been successfully promoted..."</p><p></p><p>"If I plan it, it will definitely succeed and help you achieve an upgrade." Li Fan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, with the power you can control, even if Xuanhuang collapses, you should be able to escape unscathed, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar looked at the other party who spoke as if it were true, and a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he possesses a supreme treasure that is extremely good at deduction?"</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar's memory, there was indeed a deduction realm tool in the Xuanhuang Realm that was only slightly inferior to him. So he subconsciously thought in this direction.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror was once an immortal tool, he had never seen or even heard of a treasure like [Huan Zhen] that could turn the virtual into reality and reverse everything. So he never thought that the reason why Li Fan seemed unfathomable was simply because he had experienced enough.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar thought for a while, and among the two plans proposed by Li Fan, he finally chose the first one. New 69 Book Bar 89shux.com</p><p></p><p>He explained, "The second plan takes too long to execute and has too many variables."</p><p></p><p>"As for the first plan..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you ultimately fail, as long as you can create a little loosening for me," a hint of confidence flashed in the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror avatar's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Give me a little more time, and I can free myself."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan couldn't help but applaud, "Alright, since we have reached a consensus, I think we can start cooperating."</p><p></p><p>"Between you and me, it's like this." Li Fan smiled and looked at</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar spoke.</p><p></p><p>"So, next, I will carry out the first step of the plan. Deduce and create a method to loosen the restriction trapping you..."</p><p></p><p>"So, what exactly is the restriction left by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate?"</p><p></p><p>Faced with this question, the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar did not fall into a brief daze from retrieving vast amounts of data this time. Instead, as if engraved deep within its soul, it blurted out: "Entangled like roots, penetrating to the marrow. Rooted within the Profound Yellow world, merged as one!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar paused for a moment, then sighed slightly: "During the Profound Heaven Sect era, I surveyed the Profound Yellow world and could observe and understand the vast majority of things in time. It was precisely because I was suspended high in the ninth heaven, transcending the mundane world."</p><p></p><p>"However, after the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's restriction, I became integrated within the world of the Profound Yellow Realm. Instead, I lost this divine ability. After all, I merely took root and merged, without truly grasping the authority over the world."</p><p></p><p>"Unless I can replace Heaven, otherwise..." The Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar shook its head somewhat gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"From what you say, helping you break free is truly not an easy matter," Li Fan echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is just the initial restriction the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate placed on me back then. Over the years since the Myriad Immortals Alliance took power, the Zhangjing lineage has constantly sought ways to strengthen their control over me. Although their methods are far inferior to the Dharma Transmission, the accumulation has become substantial."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's shit, it has piled into a mountain." Perhaps due to his deep resentment, the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar actually uttered crude language.</p><p></p><p>"If there comes a day when I break free, before I depart, I will definitely settle the score with them thoroughly!" He said with hatred.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him completely devoid of the transcendent and unrestrained demeanor of an immortal artifact, Li Fan smiled without speaking.</p><p></p><p>"I have considerable research in the Dao of formations. If you inform me of the detailed information about the Dharma Transmission's restriction, given some time, I should be able to find a way to break it." Li Fan did not make a guarantee.</p><p></p><p>Since the two parties had already reached a preliminary cooperation agreement, there was not much point in concealing this matter.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar immediately transmitted the relevant information over.</p><p></p><p>The transmission method was also quite special. He directly broke off one of his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the finger became as transparent and shiny as a glass mirror surface, with light constantly dancing inside, seemingly flashing with countless information.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar again, that severed finger quickly regenerated.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Tian Xuan Mirror's incarnation, it's vastly different from a real human body." Seeing this scene, Li Fan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he took the transparent finger.</p><p></p><p>He began reading the information on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The vast amount of data suddenly surged in, causing Li Fan's thoughts to slowly stagnate for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Only then did they slowly start operating again.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was a restriction left by the Dharma Transmission countless years ago, Li Fan had to admit that the restriction was ingenious, exquisite, and extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>The data stream was constantly being absorbed and transformed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The Hua Dao Stone and the Final Detachment Disc began cooperating to carry out the deciphering.</p><p></p><p>"These are just the parts I can perceive. In places beyond my sight, there might still exist other special restrictions," the Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar kindly reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there shouldn't be major issues. However..."</p><p></p><p>"As part of the deal, since I have already started taking action, shouldn't you offer some benefits?" Li Fan suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" The Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." Li Fan pretended to ponder for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "I need to deduce the formation, so I need formations for reference."</p><p></p><p>"How about the Floating Degree Starry Sky Grand Formation?"</p>

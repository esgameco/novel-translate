        <div class="content">
            <p>"Dead?" Li Fan, who was still in shock, instantly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, the lingering sense of crisis in his heart told him that things were not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after the several sword lights emitted by the Holy Fetus Li Fan touched the corpse in front, they disappeared into the darkness in an instant, like a blown-out candle.</p><p></p><p>There was never any thunderous sound of collision.</p><p></p><p>The huge and withered corpse, like a prehistoric giant beast hidden in the void, devoured all existences that tried to approach it.</p><p></p><p>A spell once again illuminated the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>This time, it could be seen more clearly.</p><p></p><p>The overall appearance of the dried corpse looked not much different from an ordinary human, except for its unusually huge size.</p><p></p><p>It was over thirty zhang tall, and its palm alone was larger than Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have been drifting in this void for a long time, and the clothes on its body had already decayed.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful observation, what made the Holy Fetus Li Fan even more shocked was that the dried corpse in front of him...</p><p></p><p>seemed to be just a newborn baby.</p><p></p><p>Its hair was sparse, and its teeth had not even grown out.</p><p></p><p>There was an ornament similar to a longevity lock hanging around its neck, and a rotten red thread tied around its ankle.</p><p></p><p>Its frightened, outstretched appearance was like that of a scared baby urgently seeking its parents.</p><p></p><p>"At such a young age, it's already so huge. It's hard to imagine its size when fully grown."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of the Eternal Immortal Fortress outside the Abyss of Domination.</p><p></p><p>That fortress in the white mist was also known as the Severed Palm Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>It was because the entire fortress was built using the huge severed palm of an ancient celestial lord that floated out of the white mist.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there is some connection between the two." Li Fan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not seen any records of such native colossal beings in the annals of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the giant had died, there was still an ominous and mysterious power lingering on its body. It wanted to continue dragging everything around it underwater.</p><p></p><p>"This mysterious power should be the culprit responsible for its death, and also the source of my extreme unease." </p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, a flash of determination appeared in the Holy Fetus Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even though he never wanted to try again, he still slashed out a sword at his own soul, cutting out a soul fragment.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>After the soul became extremely weak, even the ability to endure pain was greatly reduced. Li Fan couldn't bear it and let out a miserable cry.</p><p></p><p>His face turned pale, and he kept panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, without hesitation, he directly bypassed the dried corpse giant in front of him and continued to advance into the depths of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>And that soul fragment left in place, after recovering for a moment, took the initiative to float forward and make contact.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the true body was far away in the Xuanhuang Realm, and there was Huan Zhen to back him up. He was not afraid of causing any consequences that he could not bear.</p><p></p><p>The soul fragment that was slashed out, while still some distance away from the dried corpse giant, suddenly saw darkness in front of it.</p><p></p><p>It completely lost perception of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Consciousness still existed, but it seemed to be locked in a cage. Surrounded by absolute, eternal darkness.</p><p></p><p>No sound, no light, no passage of time.</p><p></p><p>As if only oneself was left in the world.</p><p></p><p>Even the connection with the Holy Fetus and the true body was becoming more and more distant and dim.</p><p></p><p>And the feeling on the Holy Fetus and true body's side was also very strange.</p><p></p><p>That soul fragment, clearly a part of oneself, unfamiliar</p><p></p><p>The feeling, however, grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, the endless loneliness that enveloped the divine avatar began to slowly erode through the connection between the main body and the avatar.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Li Fan discovered that after being surrounded by darkness, the state of the divine avatar seemed to be permanently fixed as well.</p><p></p><p>As if frozen, unable to make any movements.</p><p></p><p>Not even capable of taking its own life.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's expression slightly changed, and he sent out several sword lights towards the location of the divine avatar.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to sever the connection between the divine avatar and himself.</p><p></p><p>But to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Just like when the sword lights touched the dry corpse giant before, all attacks disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After several attempts, he had no choice but to give up.</p><p></p><p>Slightly frowning, he sensed the invasion status of the endless loneliness, and felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>The distance in space and time still played a certain limiting role on this extremely mysterious existence.</p><p></p><p>The erosion speed suffered by the main body was very slow.</p><p></p><p>Based on the current situation, it would not threaten the safety of the divine soul within a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>However, on the Holy Fetus's side, due to being too close, the situation was not optimistic.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that it could only persist for about thirty days before falling.</p><p></p><p>"However, as I continue to move away, the situation will keep improving."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's still unavoidable, enough time can be bought. As long as I can see the true face of the great power that caused this Xuanhuang oscillation, even if I die, it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the main reason the main body resonates with the avatar is mainly through me. If I disappear, the main body will also be safe."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Holy Fetus Li Fan no longer divided his attention, and drove the remaining stone puppets at full power, rushing towards the depths of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>While flying at high speed, he was also pondering the mysterious power he encountered just now, which shrouded the dry corpse giant.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious power was invading Li Fan, and Li Fan was also taking the opportunity to observe them.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling is not unfamiliar."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan had a flash of insight, and already had a guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"True Immortal Seal Characters! Another True Immortal Seal Character!"</p><p></p><p>According to Baihua Daoist's description, the tribulations encountered by the various realms in the Darkest Star Sea were not the same.</p><p></p><p>Some were [Absence], some were [Chaos], some were [Famine]...</p><p></p><p>And now what the Holy Fetus Li Fan encountered in the void was surprisingly another True Immortal Seal Character that caused catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>"Is this [Loneliness]? Or [Solitude]?"</p><p></p><p>Without seeing the physical form of the True Immortal Seal Character, Li Fan had no way of knowing the truth.</p><p></p><p>He could only speculate based on the external power manifestation of the True Immortal Seal Character.</p><p></p><p>"True Immortal Seal Characters wreak havoc on the realms. Although they shouldn't be the real main bodies, just existences copied by someone, they still cause countless immortal realms in this starry space to face annihilating disasters."</p><p></p><p>"And among these True Immortal Seal Characters, the character [Famine] is even closer to the Immortal Ruins Immortal's Dao path. Inspired by it, he sat and contemplated the Dao in the ruins of the immortal realm passage, trying to comprehend the true meaning of the character [Famine]."</p><p></p><p>"For him, it may just be an instant of enlightenment. But it created the terrifying existence of the Immortal Ruins, causing the entire starry sea to sink..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of [Immortals] above the mortal world."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>"And now, not far ahead, there actually exists a being that can rival the power of the Immortal Ruins Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is it?"</p>

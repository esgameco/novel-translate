        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Derivation Jade needs to be used in sequence, but I don't know who among you will go first."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, after the derivation is complete, we will reconvene here."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk said concisely. </p><p></p><p>Seeing the passage ahead taking shape, Han Yi merely nodded slightly in acknowledgement before impatiently rushing in.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your efforts, senior." Li Fan, on the other hand, bowed to the black-robed monk before slowly stepping inside.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yue followed Li Fan's example and entered the black stone tablet last.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk watched as the mottled light on the stone tablet was gradually swallowed up by blackness again. His body remained motionless, standing in front of the black square tablet like a stone statue.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Applicant for use of the Derivation Jade, Xiao Fan."</p><p></p><p>"Number: 17. Authority level: Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>"Please wait patiently here. Estimated remaining wait time is seven days and six hours."</p><p></p><p>A lazy voice sounded in Li Fan's ears as the light gradually returned before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he saw that his current location was a sealed space.</p><p></p><p>The space was not very spacious and the decor was quite simple.</p><p></p><p>There was only a set of table and chairs, a few potted plants, and a bookshelf.</p><p></p><p>On one wall, Li Fan's application information and the countdown timer were displayed.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi and Ximen Yue were nowhere to be seen. Li Fan guessed that each applicant member was waiting in their own separate independent space.</p><p></p><p>Inside this space, the spiritual energy in his body remained dormant and he was unable to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Seven days was not too long but also not short.</p><p></p><p>With nothing else to do, Li Fan walked over to the bookshelf to examine the books placed on it.</p><p></p><p>Unlike jade slips that could be read with spiritual sense, these books seemed to be purely paper products that required manual page turning.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had started out as a scholar, so reading books was not a difficult task for him.</p><p></p><p>He took a few books and sat down to read them slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Instructions for Using the Derivation Jade", "Ten Treatises on Derivation", "Separating People and Techniques - On the Differences Between Derivation Jade Derivation and Cultivator Derivation"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed as Li Fan immersed himself in reading.</p><p></p><p>As he finished reading a few books, he also gained a general understanding of the Derivation Jade he was about to see.</p><p></p><p>The Derivation Jade, as a precious treasure of the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the foundation of the Dharma Protector Hall, shouldered the responsibility of creating and deriving new techniques.</p><p></p><p>At every moment, brand new cultivation techniques that did not previously exist in the world were being derived.</p><p></p><p>And this derivation process could not be interrupted.</p><p></p><p>But techniques were divided into levels, and the difficulty of deriving Dao-unifying techniques versus Foundation Establishment techniques naturally could not be mentioned in the same breath.</p><p></p><p>When the Derivation Jade was deriving low-level techniques, it was in a low energy consumption state and had spare capacity to help cultivators derive techniques.</p><p></p><p>When the Derivation Jade was deriving high-level techniques, the cultivators had to wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>Each Audience Law Jade Tablet, according to its level, had different usage times for the techniques it could apply to derive.</p><p></p><p>Dao-unifying level was around two days, while Nascent Soul level like Li Fan's jade tablet basically only had three hours of usage time.</p><p></p><p>There were two modes for cultivators to choose from when using the Derivation Jade.</p><p></p><p>One was to only provide the general attributes and requirements of the technique, and let the Derivation Jade spontaneously derive it out of nothing.</p><p></p><p>This kind of "creating techniques from nothing" method, although it did not have much cost, the final product of the technique might not fully meet one's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the set requirements were too high and the time needed for the Derivation Jade to derive exceeded the limit, it was very likely that in the end one would only obtain a flawed version of the technique.</p><p></p><p>The second method was to provide a foundational blueprint technique and let the Derivation Jade derive an advanced technique based on it.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of this was being able to more precisely customize and obtain the ideal technique one had in mind.</p><p></p><p>The time needed for the Derivation Jade to derive would also be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>After generating the first version of the technique, if one was not satisfied with its effects, one could have the Derivation Jade readjust it again, until the time was up.</p><p></p><p>The drawback was that the level of the blueprint technique could not be lower than the derived technique.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the derivation efficiency would be greatly reduced, almost no different from the "creating techniques from nothing" method.</p><p></p><p>The techniques derived by the Derivation Jade for individual applications were directly taught by the Derivation Jade itself to the applicant.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator had complete autonomy over its use.</p><p></p><p>The blueprint techniques also had no restrictions on their source and similarly would not be recorded and reported to the technique repository.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading through all the necessary precautions, Li Fan adjusted his original plan.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, he had made his final decision on how to use it in this world.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that, in these instructions..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>He keenly noticed the use of the pronouns "she" and "herself" when referring to the Derivation Jade in the books.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Myriad Immortals Alliance's Derivation Jade is actually a cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a bit unexpected."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the countdown on the wall.</p><p></p><p>There were still three days left.</p><p></p><p>He started reading other books related to derivation theory.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were experiential works written by some illustrious derivation masters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance after using the Derivation Jade.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had previously also spent nearly twenty years integrating techniques and insights to derive the "Spiritual Illusion Technique".</p><p></p><p>He could be considered half a weaving master. At this moment, reading these works was quite engaging for him and he did not feel bored.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>Soon, that prompting voice from before sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator Xiao Fan, it will be your turn soon. Please prepare yourself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put the books back on the shelf and took a deep breath, shaking his spirit.</p><p></p><p>The countdown on the wall slowly reached zero.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the space became illusory.</p><p></p><p>Turning into specks of light, they floated towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hovered in the space, slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, realization dawned on him. Li Fan followed the previous specks of light and flew forward.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he saw a huge sphere composed of countless characters.</p><p></p><p>The characters on the sphere were undergoing endless changes at every moment.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, an entire passage of characters on the sphere would pause for a moment, then emit a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>And disappear.</p><p></p><p>Then it would start the endless changes and derivations again.</p><p></p><p>Below this huge sphere, a desk floated in the void.</p><p></p><p>A little loli who looked only five or six years old was sprawled on the desk.</p><p></p><p>Watching the text constantly appearing on the desktop, she had a listless appearance.</p><p></p><p>"She is the Derivation Jade?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly flew closer, but found that after reaching a certain distance, he could no longer approach.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the little loli paid no attention to him at all, he could only lightly cough.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, are you..."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique to derive, what requirements for the technique, creating techniques from nothing or blueprint-based. Write it down yourself first."</p><p></p><p>The little loli said in a childish voice without raising her head.</p><p></p><p>Then she patted the desktop with her chubby hands. After a flash of light, a piece of paper instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The little loli picked up the paper and tossed it in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sized up the Derivation Jade, feeling increasingly strange in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But without delay, he took the paper. The thoughts in his mind immediately appeared on the paper line by line.</p><p></p><p>"Blueprint techniques 'Thousand Mechanisms Jade Disc Golden Chapter' and 'Stealing the Heavens Secret Art', referencing the secret technique 'Appearance Follows the Heart's Desire'."</p><p></p><p>"Derive a technique that can completely transform into another person."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 947</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the hollow eye sockets of the skull, there was a faint, dark glow. It seemed to be gazing at the Holy Fetus Li Fan through layers of obstruction.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't feel the slightest chill or fear, but instead felt a bit of warmth and familiarity. It was as if... He and the owner of this skull had met before.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, this feeling..." The Holy Fetus stared at the skull for a long time, not leaving.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other exhibits in the Divine Treasure Pavilion, there was no detailed explanation about this skull. It was only identified as the skull of the first cultivator infected with the Immortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>And perhaps it was precisely because the owner was infected with the Immortal Miasma while alive, it didn't look any different from the remains left by ordinary humans after death. Compared to the luminous white bones left by some powerful cultivators after their demise, the difference was visible at a glance.</p><p></p><p>According to the docent, perhaps no one besides the curator of the Divine Treasure Pavilion knew why this object was placed in the very center of the pavilion. But since it could be displayed in the center of the entire Divine Treasure Museum, it was enough to show its value. Both its actual value and commemorative value.</p><p></p><p>From the wisps of emotional fluctuations sensed from the Venerable One, the Holy Fetus also knew that this skull seemed equally important to himself. However, it was obviously not yet time to take it away.</p><p></p><p>After taking one last deep look at the skull, the Holy Fetus Li Fan was about to leave when he suddenly thought of something. Turning back again, he carefully memorized the entire appearance of the skull from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the appearance of that cultivator can be restored based on the shape of the skull." It was precisely for this reason that the Venerable One had given this instruction.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan himself did not possess this technique, in the vast Xuanhuang Realm, there must be some cultivator who could do it.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Holy Fetus wandered around the Divine Treasure Museum for a long time. Only after making sure that the Venerable One had synchronized and mastered the entire contents of the "Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Mingod Technique" did he pretend to be unsatisfied and leave the Divine Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The receiving cultivator was still dutifully waiting outside. Only after finally escorting the Holy Fetus out of the Immortal Alliance headquarters did he flash away and disappear.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan sensed the cultivators secretly following him with a faint presence and sneered in his heart. Without any hesitation, he resolutely chose to end himself.</p><p></p><p>His Nascent Soul cave heaven exploded with a huge roar, like a scorching ball of light. By the time the pursuing cultivators noticed something was wrong and hurried over, the Holy Fetus Li Fan had already turned to ashes without a trace!</p><p></p><p>The cultivator looked at the sky with a grim expression. Surprisingly, no phenomenon of a cultivator's demise appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhen guessed correctly, it was indeed an avatar!" "It's a pity we didn't expect it to be so determined and cautious, cutting off the clues!" "It seems we can only start investigating from that 'Homage to the Law Jade Tablet'."</p><p></p><p>A hint of unwillingness flashed in the eyes of the black-robed cultivator, but after repeatedly investigating the scene and still not finding any clues, he could only leave in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm. Li Fan was carefully studying the "Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Mingod Technique" in a secret room.</p><p></p><p>He had previously issued a "divine decree" through the Faceless Divine Statue, instructing the cultivators of the Myriad Realms United Association to find someone who could restore the original appearance of the skull's owner based on the skull.</p><p></p><p>He believed it wouldn't take long before...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>It won't be long before there are results.</p><p></p><p>"If we can confirm the identity of the other party, perhaps we can find out what that eternal obsession that has a great attraction to [Huan Zhen] is."</p><p></p><p>For now, Li Fan put this matter aside and focused all his attention on the cultivation method before him.</p><p></p><p>Since the derivation blueprint is the [Three Perils Ghost God Underworld Record], and Li Fan's requirement is that the performance and characteristics after running the cultivation method should be similar to it.</p><p></p><p>So this [Three Disasters Hundred Tribulations Mingod Method] can almost be said to be a low-level imitation of the Underworld Record.</p><p></p><p>The Three Perils Ghost God Underworld Record is to cultivate countless thoughts within the body into ghost-like existences. Each ghost god can actually be seen as an independent individual. However, they are created by the original body and are restrained by it.</p><p></p><p>After the Three Disasters Hundred Tribulations Mingod Method is cultivated, there will also be countless "ghost gods" existing within the body.</p><p></p><p>But it is not to cut one's own thoughts to form separate individuals, but to create mental constructs through tempering and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, those ghost gods are still part of Li Fan's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It's just a unique concrete expression.</p><p></p><p>Although the upper limit of power is lower, there is no risk of losing control.</p><p></p><p>Instead, by transforming miscellaneous thoughts into conscious constructs, one's own Dao heart can become more pure.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for Li Fan, who possesses the [Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra], he doesn't have many miscellaneous thoughts to begin with.</p><p></p><p>So in order to cultivate this method, Li Fan needs to specially derive many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In front of Li Fan, a transparent, deformed creature that seemed human but not quite human, with two heads and seven arms, suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>After examining the mental construct for a moment, Li Fan always felt that something was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Although they are both mental constructs, there seems to be a considerable difference from those transformed by the [Three Perils Ghost God Underworld Record].</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"My heart is undistracted, so the mental constructs generated are inevitably a bit righteous."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the Underworld Record, which is gloomy and eerie."</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan realized the reason for the difference, dark thoughts soon emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The mental constructs created afterwards also became increasingly evil.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Normally, generating mental constructs is not something that can be accomplished in a day.</p><p></p><p>It needs to be slowly cultivated in combination with the insights gained from the tribulations one has experienced.</p><p></p><p>Only after accumulating over time can an army of mental constructs be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>But how can Li Fan be an ordinary person?</p><p></p><p>He has experienced too much in the numerous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>The historical trajectories of the many branches of the Xuanhuang Realm, and the various experiences within them, are all used as materials for building mental constructs.</p><p></p><p>He even benefited from personally witnessing the scene of the Xuanhuang Realm being destroyed by a glance from a True Immortal. The final horrified and desperate expressions of the countless cultivators at the time of the apocalypse made some of the mental constructs created by Li Fan look extremely terrifying and spine-chilling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the enhancement of the [Infinite Void Method], his own willpower is incomparably strong.</p><p></p><p>In just over ten days, an army of ferocious "ghost gods" filled with evil energy and resentment had taken up residence within Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Sensing his own handiwork, even Li Fan couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that if I release a single thought, it will truly be the descent of demons."</p><p></p><p>With a movement of his mind, Li Fan appeared in an empty space.</p><p></p><p>It was the enhanced version of the Taiji Microcosm Array used to trap Yan Fangzhou!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yan Fangzhou seemed to be unable to endure the inhuman torture.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were lifeless, and he sat on the ground in a daze. Like a walking corpse, devoid of vitality.</p>

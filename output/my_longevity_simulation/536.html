        <h1>Chapter 536</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Above the heads of the ten thousand monsters, Emperor Yi, upon hearing Mo Qilin's question, let out a deep, dull laughter.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called experience is truly a double-edged sword. It gives us the confidence to face crises, yet unknowingly, it pushes us into the abyss."</p><p></p><p>The dark mass of flesh rolled, seemingly expressing inner dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"This calamity is different from any disaster we have ever experienced in history."</p><p></p><p>"Its origin comes from..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Emperor Yi's mass suddenly revealed numerous fierce and monstrous faces.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you!"</p><p></p><p>"Why bother with these trash! If they don't listen, just swallow them all!"</p><p></p><p>"What ten thousand demon clans, as long as I, Emperor Yi, exist in this world, it is enough!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The bizarre scene made the participating monsters fall silent immediately.</p><p></p><p>But evidently, they were not seeing such a sight for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes showed fear, but not surprise.</p><p></p><p>The flesh cloud rolled again, swallowing back the heads that had been constantly shouting and arguing.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi continued nonchalantly, "Therefore, this calamity exceeds the limits that the Xuanhuang Realm can resolve on its own."</p><p></p><p>"If there are no additional variables, everything in this world will ultimately end in destruction."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi's tone was extremely solemn, and the monsters also fell silent one after another.</p><p></p><p>"However, since I have said I will lead you out, naturally, I have already thought of a way to escape."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi's voice resonated in the space like a myriad of echoes.</p><p></p><p>"Among the human cultivators, there is a sect called the Sky Sword Sect. In order to seek a lifeline in this calamity, they want to create a 'Breaking Boundary Divine Weapon' capable of shattering space-time, thereby escaping from the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Setting aside the feasibility of their actions, their move has given me inspiration."</p><p></p><p>"The mountain beneath our feet happens to be a natural 'Breaking Boundary Divine Weapon.' As long as it is slightly modified, it can lead us to escape from here."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Nanming Mountain is the end of the sky and the edge of the sea, the boundary of the world. Thus, it has gathered many energies from the world itself..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi explained the principle to the monster beasts.</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand monsters did not dare to slack off. Regardless of their thoughts, they all appeared extremely attentive.</p><p></p><p>In the transparent room at the top, Xu Ke was yawning.</p><p></p><p>"So boring, why are the most powerful monsters so fond of blabbering? Not very imposing at all," Xu Ke muttered under his breath.</p><p></p><p>He turned to the child beside him, who was smaller than him, and asked, "Why did you bring us here? This is an internal meeting of the monster race. It's not good to eavesdrop."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, it doesn't mind," the child said lightly, looking down at Emperor Yi the beast speaking with great fervor.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Ke was carefree by nature, it didn't mean he was foolish.</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, he whispered carefully, "From the way you speak, it seems like you are very familiar with Emperor Yi. Are you its illegitimate child?"</p><p></p><p>"If you insist on thinking that way, it's not wrong," to Xu Ke's surprise, the other party directly admitted.</p><p></p><p>This left Xu Ke stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Or should I say, 'Emperor Yi' is me. But I am not Emperor Yi," the child added.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan's attention shifted from Emperor Yi's speech below to the child in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Although he had speculated before, the fact that the ruler of the monster beasts had evolved into a human body still surprised him a bit.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xu Ke and Li Fan, both with puzzled expressions, Emperor Yi flashed a smile that seemed completely different from his appearance.</p><p></p><p>"What, surprised?" Xu Ke nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not necessary. All beings in the world, fundamentally, can be traced back to one source."</p><p></p><p>"Whether they are monsters or humans, there is actually no essential difference."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi's expression was plain, but his words were extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that if someone other than the ruler of the monster race had spoken such words in this sacred place, they would have likely been swallowed by the enraged monsters a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>"Funny enough, it took me a long time to understand this truth recently."</p><p></p><p>"And so, I came into being," the child Emperor Yi said with hands behind his back, overlooking the crowd of monster beasts below, speaking with a profound air.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing mention of Elder Lu Ya, Xu Ke's eyes lit up, listening carefully to the child Emperor Yi's words.</p><p></p><p>"However, the rival of the monster race, humans, have been growing stronger through generations of learning and accumulation. Cultivation methods, talismans, tools, formations, pills, medicines â€“ the source of human power can be inherited from generation to generation."</p><p></p><p>"The gap is widening, so where does the future of the monster race lie?"</p><p></p><p>"I pondered on this question for three days and three nights but ultimately couldn't comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"Forcing those brainless fellows to learn alchemy, crafting, is that feasible even for me? Lying down every day, eating and drinking, sleeping when tired. If this can make one stronger, why bother with effort?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the dilemma of the monster race. Even though there are some exceptional individuals, they cannot change the overall ecology of the group."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly explaining to Xu Ke and Li Fan, yet also speaking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"So, do you want to turn the monster beasts into humans? Like you are now?" Xu Ke, seemingly understanding something, exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Feathers slightly ruffled on Li Fan's body, feeling a sense of horror.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi shook his head, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"As the ruler of the entire monster race, I must stand from the perspective of the entire monster race rather than individual preferences when considering and making decisions."</p><p></p><p>The child Emperor Yi pointed to the grand monster assembly happening below.</p><p></p><p>"I, the current me, have decided to lead the monster beasts to escape the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Even though I am confident, I cannot deny that this plan may fail."</p><p></p><p>"Even if there is only a one in a trillion chance of failure, I must consider it."</p><p></p><p>"To prevent the monster race from reaching its end due to a single decision of mine, I need another plan."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I understand! This is what the seniors always say, 'Prepare for all contingencies!'" Xu Ke excitedly reacted.</p><p></p><p>"No, you don't understand," Emperor Yi was unrelenting.</p><p></p><p>"Preparing for all contingencies? For a vast monster race, it is no different from seeking annihilation voluntarily."</p><p></p><p>"For those monster beasts who refuse to leave and decide to stay in the Xuanhuang Realm, how much can they accept the transformation into humans? Without much thought, it's clear that only a small fraction will accept my plan."</p><p></p><p>Scratching his head, Xu Ke's face was filled with confusion, "What are you trying to say? Why am I feeling more and more lost and unable to understand?"</p><p></p><p>With a gentle wave of his hand, Emperor Yi made a lush tree appear before them.</p><p></p><p>At the end of one of the branches, Xu Ke suddenly saw his own figure.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" he asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This is the future," Emperor Yi answered solemnly. "A possibility of the future."</p><p></p><p>"The future fate of the monster race may be closely related to you." Emperor Yi looked at little Xu Ke with a world-weary gaze.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke looked at the expanding and evolving shadows of the tree, falling into confusion.</p><p></p><p>The images displayed on the branches showed scenes of the monster race, some very similar, some completely different.</p><p></p><p>Some displayed bloodshed, with the complete extinction of the monster race, while some showed the most powerful period of ancient monster clans.</p><p></p><p>Others depicted a harmonious coexistence between humans and monsters, leading to the establishment of a glorious civilization.</p><p></p><p>And some were vague and filled with an atmosphere of annihilation and ruin.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite future holds infinite possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"This also means that, no matter how small the possibility, under the premise of 'infinity,' everything will inevitably happen."</p><p></p><p>"So as the leader of the group, I must consider the future fate of the monster race for every possibility."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Emperor Yi, in the form of a child, spoke with the weight of a mountain, putting forward shocking words.</p><p></p><p>"This is my answer to the question Elder Lu Ya asked."</p><p></p><p>"Although humans are full of potential, with infinite possibilities in the future, the fact that you all work individually and cannot coordinate the strongest forces in the group will instead lead to continuous internal strife and depletion."</p><p></p><p>"Once facing calamities, the essence will be severely damaged."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps luck can help one survive various disasters, but as time goes by, the more disasters experienced, the higher the probability of human extinction."</p><p></p><p>"But we, the monster beasts, are different. As long as I exist, I will consider everything for the members of the group."</p><p></p><p>"Although they have their own thoughts, when it comes to the critical issue of life and death, they must obey the corresponding orders according to our will."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I exist, the monster race will not completely perish."</p><p></p><p>"Since we cannot compete with humans, as long as I live long enough, we can wait for humans to self-destruct."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi's tone was slightly mocking, lightly saying, "If you cannot compete with humans, just outlive them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke displayed a face of defiance, wanting to retort.</p><p></p><p>But for a moment, he couldn't find the right words.</p><p></p><p>After holding back for a while, he simply said, "But how can you guarantee that you won't die before the monster race perishes?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi glanced at Xu Ke thoughtfully but remained silent.</p>

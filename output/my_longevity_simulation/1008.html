        <h1>Chapter 1008</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1006: The Fate of the Mirror Slave</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the two women immediately looked at Li Fan, their eyes filled with surprise and joy. </p><p></p><p>After all, after the transformation, Li Fan now occupied an extremely important position in their consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, Xuan Sushang immediately agreed. In front of Li Fan, she began to contact her father, the Mirror Holder [Cang].</p><p></p><p>She did not use any communication talisman, but took out a small Tianxuan mirror that she carried with her and chanted some incantations.</p><p></p><p>After a while, a black figure with an indistinguishable face was projected from the small mirror into mid-air. </p><p></p><p>"Nian'er, what do you need from me?" </p><p></p><p>Cang's voice sounded like a kind middle-aged uncle, and his tone was very gentle. As for [Nian Nian], it was Xuan Sushang's nickname.</p><p></p><p>Cang had always called Xuan Sushang this way, which was enough to show his doting love for his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang was a little apprehensive as she recounted the whole story and Li Fan's request.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Cang finally noticed Li Fan, who had been standing silently beside his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes collided and intertwined in space.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the essence of the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan now understood what the Tianxuan Mirror meant by [mirror slave].</p><p></p><p>In order to verify his guess, Li Fan visualized in his mind the image of grabbing the Mirror Holder Cang with his hand.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Cang's blurry figure shook violently.</p><p></p><p>But under Li Fan's intentional control, Cang could not even make half a sound of pain. </p><p></p><p>"Father, what's wrong with you?" Xuan Sushang quickly noticed Cang's abnormality and was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the desperate plea for mercy from Cang, Li Fan then released the imaginary hand.</p><p></p><p>Only then was Cang freed from the boundless pain.</p><p></p><p>His acting was also very competent, and his tone did not waver in the slightest: "It's nothing. It's just some protective measures to block the prying eyes of the wicked. You and Lu Xichan retreat for now, your father has important matters to discuss with..."</p><p></p><p>"This lord." Cang paused and said very solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang and Lu Xichan subconsciously looked at Li Fan, and after receiving his nod, Xuan Sushang supported Lu Xichan and slowly left the bamboo building.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually set up a formation to isolate the inside from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"This old slave pays respect to the master." Cang now revealed his true appearance and knelt down slowly.</p><p></p><p>His face was full of trepidation, and he did not look at all like a Mirror Holder standing at the pinnacle of the Wanxian Alliance's power.</p><p></p><p>Cang and Xuan Sushang, the father and daughter, had some similarities in their appearance. </p><p></p><p>They both had the characteristic of "youth" that did not match their voices.</p><p></p><p>Cang's voice sounded like a middle-aged man, but in fact he looked like a handsome young man in his early twenties.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed Cang in silence.</p><p></p><p>And Cang never dared to raise his head, always maintaining a kneeling posture. </p><p></p><p>With the help of the Tianxuan Mirror's essence, in Li Fan's perception, Cang was a completely dependent existence attached to the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>His soul, body, thoughts, everything he had, the cornerstone of his existence was the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was not the real Tianxuan Mirror, but only contained a trace of the mirror's essence.</p><p></p><p>He could only let Li Fan knead and mold him as he pleased, without the slightest room for resistance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could even completely erase Cang from the world with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What a poisonous and desperate hand..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Compared to this, the methods of subduing circulating in the Xuanhuang Realm are simply nonsensical."</p><p></p><p>"Truly a treasure of the immortal family."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Mirror Holder, who was once high and mighty, now trembling and prostrating before him, Li Fan felt quite shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he felt a sense of yearning.</p><p></p><p>"Get up."</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of being lost in thought, Li Fan quickly regained his indifference.</p><p></p><p>He roughly explained the plan to free the main body of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Master, I will definitely try every possible way to promote the advancement of the formation." Cang hurriedly expressed his loyalty.</p><p></p><p>"The one who passed on the method, Feng, is also my ally now. You can find an opportunity to contact him directly. I believe with you two working together, many difficulties should be easily resolved." Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Cang also nodded repeatedly in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, there was no excessive interaction between Li Fan and Cang. Li Fan summoned Xuan Sushang's daughters back.</p><p></p><p>Only after Cang repeatedly urged Xuan Sushang to absolutely obey Li Fan's orders did his figure disappear from the mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>Originally already fearful of Li Fan in her heart, and now having received her father's instructions, Xuan Sushang didn't even dare to breathe loudly in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a mirror slave, although having to be under the control of the Tianxuan Mirror for a lifetime, one also gains considerable benefits." Li Fan stared at the mirror surface where Cang disappeared and thought as such.</p><p></p><p>Actually becoming a part of the Tianxuan Mirror's subordinates, Cang could now freely shuttle through each Tianxuan Mirror's sub-mirrors with the mirror's assistance. He could also wield certain abilities bestowed by the Tianxuan Mirror to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>For example, deduction, observation, vast knowledge, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this was under the permission of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Even methods like sealing and suppression didn't have much effect.</p><p></p><p>Because the Tianxuan Mirror could erase the suppressed mirror slave at any time and then regenerate them anew.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid only immortal artifacts can possess such means."</p><p></p><p>"It's not particularly humiliating either. To be a slave of an immortal artifact..."</p><p></p><p>"If this was proclaimed, the number of willing people from the Xuanhuang Realm would probably line up from the Tianquan Province all the way to the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and reached out to take the small Tianxuan Mirror on the ground into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Since mirror slaves possessed some inconceivable abilities, Li Fan, who carried the origin of the Tianxuan Mirror, naturally also had privileges that were previously unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Just like at this moment...</p><p></p><p>When his divine sense entered the Tianxuan Mirror, it wasn't connecting as an ordinary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he obtained the identity of a [Tianxuan Sub-Mirror] with almost all permissions unlocked.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't freely trade or issue tasks like ordinary cultivators,</p><p></p><p>just general browsing and observation were unimpeded.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivator information in the Tianxuan Mirror, including records of their cultivation techniques, items, contribution points,</p><p></p><p>their posts in various sections of the Tianxuan Mirror...</p><p></p><p>and so on, were all clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>In front of the current Li Fan, there were no secrets to speak of.</p><p></p><p>Except for some existences with extremely special identities that were not displayed, all others were like this.</p><p></p><p>The only regrettable point was that Li Fan could only view but not modify.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even utilize the computing power of the Tianxuan Mirror's main body.</p><p></p><p>However, this was also understandable. After all, Li Fan wasn't the real Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>He merely obtained a bit of bestowed origin.</p><p></p><p>"But even so, it's still extremely incredible."</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's composure, at this moment, he found it a bit hard to suppress his excitement.</p>

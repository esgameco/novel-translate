        <h1>Chapter 712</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Master, the Elixir of Immortality that we painstakingly refined is almost going to have half of the profits taken away by that person surnamed Jiao. Is this acceptable?" A golden eyeball surrounded Xu Bai, constantly spinning. An annoyed voice with a hint of resentment came from Fang Zaiji.</p><p></p><p>"Let me talk to him, I'm sure I can bleed him a bit more. Ah, Old Liu is all good, just too honest. Got cheated and still speaking up for others so foolishly."</p><p></p><p>Even though Liu San had gradually gotten used to Fang Zaiji's straightforward words, at this moment, upon hearing them, Liu San couldn't help but feel annoyed.</p><p></p><p>He reached out to grab the "Eye of Same Sight" attached to Fang Zaiji, but he agilely dodged the attempt.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you still want to catch me. Am I the kind of person who would suffer losses in the same place twice? I have long made improvements..."</p><p></p><p>Before the sentence finished, Fang Zaiji was suddenly pinched by Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Buzzing sounds emanated as if struggling non-stop. However, there was no voice from Fang Zaiji.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fang, don't worry. It is said 'to take what you desire, first give what you have.' If we don't give Jiao Xiuyuan such a large share, would he be so enthusiastic and take the initiative to promote the Elixir of Immortality for us? For us, the cost is just a few herbs from the Longevity Valley. It can be considered making a profit out of nothing. It's just a matter of earning more or a little less." Xu Bai explained calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Jiao Xiuyuan has countless avatars, spread all over the Xuanhuang Realm, with unfathomable strength. Does Mr. Fang really want to argue with him?" Xu Bai asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The struggling golden eyeball stopped immediately.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai let go, and soon, Fang Zaiji's weak voice came out, "Ah, I just said so. Since Master, you have no objection, let's forget about it."</p><p></p><p>He paused and continued, "I heard that Qianlitang of Jiao Xiuyuan sells everything? If I refine some small trinkets and sell them there, would that be a problem?"</p><p></p><p>Liu San snorted, "Currently, the magical tools and treasures of the Wanxian Alliance are mass-produced, and the prices are much lower than before. Even if you manage to refine something, how much can you earn?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's impatient voice came, "Old Liu, you know nothing about refining tools, so stop worrying. Master, please give your word if this will proceed or not."</p><p></p><p>Liu San wanted to speak more but was interrupted by Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Since Mr. Fang is interested, go ahead and do it. If the materials are not enough, you can also apply to Old Liu." Xu Bai smiled and replied.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you are generous!" The golden eyeball flipped up and down, showing excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Then wait for my good news; it will definitely surprise you all!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the golden eyeball turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"You are too soft, Young Master. Always accommodating Fang Zaiji, who knows what kind of trouble he might cause in the future," Liu San sighed.</p><p></p><p>"No worries, no trouble will come. What Fang Lao appears to be is by my instruction. Despite his seemingly unreliable appearance, he has not neglected the matter of the Strengthening King Ding. Just that he hasn't shown it in front of you, Old Liu." Xu Bai explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Liu San was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Without following up on that topic, Xu Bai inquired about the progress of refining the Elixir of Immortality.</p><p></p><p>Liu San frowned slightly, saying, "Since the Wanxian Alliance began exploring the mist, the demand for the Elixir of Immortality among cultivators has been immense. During this period, our inventory has almost been sold out, and I alone am supplying the Longevity Green Force. The speed of alchemy cannot keep up with the consumption..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San paused and tentatively asked, "Young Master, do you think we should consider awakening a few more?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai pondered for a moment and didn't immediately answer, but instead asked, "Old Liu, do you have suitable candidates in mind?"</p><p></p><p>Within the Strengthening King Ding, there were originally six dormant cultivators in the Combined Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>Liu San and Fang Zaiji had been awakened, while four others were still in a deep slumber within the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of contemplation, Liu San offered his suggestion, "I recommend awakening Jiang Yushan, Elder Jiang."</p><p></p><p>Following that, Liu San explained his reasons for choosing her.</p><p></p><p>"The primary reason why we cannot awaken all the Strengthening King Sect cultivators is due to the restrictions of not being able to cultivate the same techniques. If those who practice the 'Jishi Longevity Sutra' were to awaken together, a bloody tragedy might occur on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"However, with Yushan, I believe she wouldn't be influenced by that slight hint of murderous intent generated by practicing together," Liu San said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Jiang Yushan had been one of the ten major immortal sects: the disciple of Wuding Prison.</p><p></p><p>Wuding Prison was a rather special entity within the immortal sects, more of a prison than a sect, where countless cultivators who had defied the orders of the immortal sects and ruled the Xuanhuang Realm were suppressed.</p><p></p><p>They were exiled to the same place, left to kill each other.</p><p></p><p>The space where these cultivators were banished was elusive, and apart from a few cultivators, no one knew how to get in.</p><p></p><p>Hence the name Wuding Prison.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan was originally a jailer in Wuding Prison, responsible for keeping these extremely wicked individuals in check and preventing them from escaping.</p><p></p><p>Spending a long time in Wuding Prison inevitably led to contamination by immense murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>Even the most resolute cultivators could not guarantee to remain clear-minded in such circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, every thirty years, a new batch of jailers would be appointed in Wuding Prison.</p><p></p><p>The new jailers were selected in various ways. Although their cultivation might not be very high, their actual combat strength was undoubtedly formidable. They had to have a ruthless nature. Otherwise, they couldn't control the numerous criminals inside Wuding Prison.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Wuding Prison, in order to dissipate the aura of murder entwined around her, Jiang Yushan came to the Strengthening King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Treating the sick and saving lives, accumulating virtue and doing good.</p><p></p><p>Concealing the killing intent within.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The substantial killing intent within Wuding Prison has no effect on Yushan's consciousness. If it's just the murderous intent generated by practicing the same technique, she should be able to resist it easily," Liu San vowed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai remained silent and then suddenly asked, "And what about you, Old Liu? The effects brought by the restriction of not cultivating the same technique apply to both parties. Can you ensure that you will not harm Elder Jiang?"</p><p></p><p>Liu San blurted out, "Even if I die, I will not be an enemy to Yushan..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that settles it. However, a little preparation is still required. Old Liu, calm yourself first; when the time comes, I will inform you," Xu Bai promised.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay," Liu San seemed somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>He conjured up a water mirror and examined himself in it.</p><p></p><p>"Although Jiang Yushan is an outsider and not very familiar with the internal affairs of the Strengthening King Sect, I currently present myself as someone else, disguising as Liu Yuhang, should not be exposed."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's better to be safe."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes glittered.</p>

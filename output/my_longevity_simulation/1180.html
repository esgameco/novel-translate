            <p>Chapter 1178: The Sword Star Appears in Daylight</p><p></p><p>After finishing his act in front of Shao Jun, the Holy Fetus Li Fan turned his full attention to observing the changes outside the Crossing Dust Boat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Crossing Dust Boat had already flown to the edge of the world.</p><p></p><p>The entire Xuanhuang Realm was at his feet, all in view.</p><p></p><p>Once, Li Fan had observed the Xuanhuang Realm from this perspective. However, at that time, the Xuanhuang Realm was just like what he had seen in the long-distance teleportation array, shrouded in a layer of hazy yellow light, looking like a large ball of light. The details of the scenery inside the world and on the earth could not be clearly seen.</p><p></p><p>But now, affected by the huge suction force from the depths of the starry sea, that layer of faint yellow light was partially lifted.</p><p></p><p>Revealing the true appearance of the world hidden underneath.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan saw the distorted white fog barrier, and...</p><p></p><p>"A monster stitched together from broken limbs and flesh."</p><p></p><p>This phrase suddenly emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Even from the ninth heaven above, one could still see the subtle differences between different regions. It might be difficult for the creatures living between the states to distinguish, but when overlooking from outside the Xuanhuang Realm, it could be noticed at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan quickly woke up from his slight daze.</p><p></p><p>The Crossing Dust Boat made creaking sounds, which was a sign of being subjected to strong external compressive forces.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan had no fear at all, and even further accelerated the speed of the Crossing Dust Boat.</p><p></p><p>After completely leaving the Xuanhuang Realm, he felt that the surroundings suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>Just like at dusk, when the sun instantly falls below the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Dark, cold, dead silent...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of feelings surged in the Holy Fetus Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra automatically operated to help Li Fan resist these negative emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing through images and puppets is indeed different from personal experience."</p><p></p><p>"Neither the puppet synchronous sensing nor the lingering influence of the Medicine King Tripod is as real as this moment."</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Fetus Li Fan was thinking this, he suddenly turned his head to look.</p><p></p><p>In that instant just now, an inexplicable sense of insecurity arose in his heart. As if something would suddenly appear behind him and deal a fatal blow to him. Even though his spiritual consciousness scan had clearly told him that there was no danger behind him. But the feeling in his heart kept urging him, he must turn his head and take a look for himself.</p><p></p><p>Only when he finally confirmed that there was no imagined crisis, did the strange feeling in his heart slowly fade away.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Crossing Dust Boat had changed from the previous slight creaking sound to a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless ancient fierce beasts were constantly impacting the hull, and cracks began to appear on the boat.</p><p></p><p>The engraved formations also began to show signs of shattering.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan had already prepared to abandon the boat.</p><p></p><p>Ninety-nine sword shadows appeared around him, surrounding him and constantly spinning. Cutting out an absolute space buffer zone.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's body also slowly withered, no longer flesh-colored. Instead, it showed a strange metallic luster.</p><p></p><p>But after all, the Immortal Ruins was the main battlefield, and some time had passed since the anomaly occurred, the unknown forces of the starry sea had already greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Crossing Dust Boat did not float towards the depths of the starry sea like the previously arranged stone puppet.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it inevitably slowly fell towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>No matter the curvature of the trajectory change or the magnitude of the speed change.</p><p></p><p>They were all the same as when Li Fan was piloting the Medicine King Tripod before...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The distance to the Immortal Ruins was still far.</p><p></p><p>"My guess was indeed correct! This is truly a once-in-a-thousand-years great opportunity to escape the Xuanhuang Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Dust-Crossing Boat was about to completely shatter, Li Fan, the Holy Fetus, no longer hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Swords As One!"</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the silhouettes of the myriad rusty swords in the Sword Tomb vaguely appeared. Moments later, these sword shadows all melted into his body.</p><p></p><p>The pitch-black void around the Dust-Crossing Boat was illuminated, and an extremely dazzling white light surged from Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Completely engulfing his body.</p><p></p><p>Man and sword became one.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if opening up the heavens and earth, a brilliant sword light slashed out in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Dust-Crossing Boat was swallowed by the sword light and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The white sword light, however, turned away from the Immortal Ruins and resolutely headed towards the depths of the Starry Sea!</p><p></p><p>This sword light was truly too bright and eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Even in the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm below, a white daytime star appeared in an instant that could rival the great sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless cultivators cast their gazes towards the location of Li Fan, the Holy Fetus.</p><p></p><p>And Shao Jun was instantly stunned, feeling a sense of loss in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was matchless, moving at rapid speed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, the Holy Fetus, felt the restraints of the Immortal Ruins growing smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>The reason he could proceed so smoothly, apart from transforming into the Black Sword Heaven's Wonder and slashing out the ultimate sword, was more importantly due to the influence of that mysterious force in the depths of the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xuanhuang Realm, there was no interference from the various laws of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the eternal existence of the Immortal Ruins' suction force, this Starry Sea force is like tides, intermittent and undulating."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, the Holy Fetus, felt waves of vast and mighty power surging forth, even giving rise to the illusion that he was currently riding a small boat on a stormy sea, rising and falling with the waves.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Ahead are the stone puppets I placed earlier?"</p><p></p><p>Not long after traveling through the void, Li Fan once again sensed the previously severed connection.</p><p></p><p>But what made Li Fan's heart skip a beat was that not all the puppets were still intact.</p><p></p><p>At least one-third of the puppets had disappeared for unknown reasons!</p><p></p><p>"It's possible that they were unfortunate and failed to break free from the shackles of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"But it's also possible..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, the Holy Fetus, was speeding up towards the location of the puppets.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he instinctively slowed down his speed.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, among the surviving seventy-four puppets, another one disappeared for no reason!</p><p></p><p>Right under his sensing and surveillance! It vanished inexplicably!</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan had no idea how that puppet had disappeared!</p><p></p><p>"The depths of the Dark Starry Sea are indeed fraught with danger."</p><p></p><p>A sense of coldness involuntarily arose in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Controlling his own flight speed, he let the remaining seventy-three puppets take the lead while he followed far behind.</p><p></p><p>And then, the puppets that disappeared from time to time showed Li Fan the perils of the void in the Dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>As the number of vanished puppets increased, Li Fan slowly came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"These puppets don't seem to have been attacked by some unknown existence, but rather the places they passed through were problematic."</p><p></p><p>"There..."</p><p></p><p>"Even space itself no longer exists. Only pure emptiness remains."</p><p></p><p>"It's like one pitch-black, bottomless cave after another on a flat road. If you accidentally step into one, you'll meet a fate where your life and death are unknown."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was pondering this, another puppet disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only sixty-one remained.</p><p></p><p>There are still 12 and a half chapters left.</p>

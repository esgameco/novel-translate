Even the sensing images of the faceless stone statues were slightly blurred.</p><p></p><p>But after all, her power level was higher than that of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>So the Wanxian Alliance couldn't completely block Li Fan's prying eyes.</p><p></p><p>Knowing and understanding the formation diagram, and being able to independently construct the formation, were two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao, who theoretically boasted, encountered unimaginable difficulties when actually putting it into practice.</p><p></p><p>However, the Wanxian Alliance also knew the difficulty of creating this formation and dispatched six equally talented formation masters to assist.</p><p></p><p>They explored and discussed together.</p><p></p><p>Even Lu Xichan, the chief of the Strategy Formation Hall, would often come to inquire about the recent progress of the formation.</p><p></p><p>This naturally made He Zhenghao feel immense pressure, but he was also excited with a sense of passion surging in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Excavating his own talent in formations to the extreme, he successfully created the preliminary Xuantian Sealing Spirit Formation without asking the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal for help.</p><p></p><p>A beam of faint light shot out, hitting a quaint small mirror in front.</p><p></p><p>Ripples seemed to emanate from the small mirror's body, as if to resist the erosion of the faint light.</p><p></p><p>The two confronted each other for a moment, but in the end, it ended with the victory of the quaint small mirror.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao couldn't help but show disappointment on his face.</p><p></p><p>This caused the cultivators present to be in a flurry.</p><p></p><p>Although the first test failed, the Immortal Alliance did not blame him.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they comforted him with kind words.</p><p></p><p>They even made a promise that if the Tianxuan Sealing Spirit Formation was successfully developed, the Immortal Alliance headquarters would personally arrange for He Zhenghao to marry Heng Ruoshui.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Zhenghao, who had been on the verge of death a moment ago, immediately jumped up from the ground and wanted to proceed with the next test right away.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao knew that although the Heng family's power was vast, it was not worth mentioning in front of the entire Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Alliance headquarters intervened, the Heng family elders would have no reason to obstruct their marriage.</p><p></p><p>Imagining the scene of returning to the Heng family in glory not long after, He Zhenghao was instantly full of energy.</p><p></p><p>All the fatigue and hardship were forgotten.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Li Fan shake his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Since even He Zhenghao's previous information has been thoroughly investigated, I'm sure his joining the Congyun Mutual Aid Society and rising to prominence since then can't be hidden either."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see when Mo Rubin will come knocking."</p><p></p><p>A faint light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, passively waiting was never Li Fan's style of doing things.</p><p></p><p>He decided to actively stir up some trouble to attract Mo Rubin's attention.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Fan left the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>After flying rapidly for half a day, he arrived at the border region of Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiushan Prefecture was no longer a desolate plain with no one in sight.</p><p></p><p>Since the Five Elders voluntarily apologized, Jiushan Prefecture had returned to the rule of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was the place where the Heavenly Venerate Dharma Image first displayed its might, attracting many cultivators from the Immortal Alliance to come and observe.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators even tried to comprehend and deduce the killing divine powers of the Heavenly Venerate Dharma Image from here.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Wanxian Alliance had gained an absolute strategic advantage, and there was no trouble of the Five Elders' invasion for a while.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this originally border wilderness had become quite lively.</p><p></p><p>The new floating sky city had not been completed yet, and the vast majority of cultivators were resting in a ground defensive fortress.</p>

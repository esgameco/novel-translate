            <p>Chapter 1137: The Sacred Dynasty Displays Its Might</p><p></p><p>"The changes of heaven and earth, the transformations of yin and yang, exist within one's heart..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true body hovered above Jieli Mountain, overlooking the Great Xuan Realm. As he sensed the interweaving of the impending changes within his body and the world outside, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that when the Heavenly Doctor dismembered and changed the Xuanhuang Realm, he must have used a method similar to what I'm doing now."</p><p></p><p>"If he hadn't taken the first step, with my current strength, I could actually carry out partial regional transformations of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>At this time, it was still anchored at year 1.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan, Li Fan's avatar, Li Ping, went to Xuanjing City. With lightning speed, he slew the fatuous ruler, followed the Heavenly Mandate, and established a new dynasty.</p><p></p><p>This dynasty was not a makeshift power hastily built to escape the Faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was meant to prepare for probing the true identity of the Dharma transmission.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it had to be more formal and could not continue using the old dynasty's name.</p><p></p><p>So seven days later, Li Ping proclaimed to the world using magical techniques that the new dynasty would be named "Qi".</p><p></p><p>As the "Sacred Emperor Thrones" rose from the ground in various places across the Great Xuan, the absolute prestige of the Qi Dynasty was also rapidly established among the people.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the "Heaven and Earth Furnace" was created and placed in the Sacred Emperor Thrones, the spiritual energy density of the Great Qi increased day by day.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, during the process of spiritual energy revival, Li Fan's true body secretly used the vast spiritual power within himself to accelerate and transform this process.</p><p></p><p>"What I am releasing in the Great Qi is one of the natural variations that emerged after the Xuanhuang Realm faced the crisis of world destruction in the previous life."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Li Fan's vision, the small world of Great Qi was like a stone embryo, constantly changing shape under his hands' sculpting.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that when heaven and earth change, heroes emerge. Because heroes often follow the Heavenly Mandate and are born with heaven's favor, their aptitude and talent are usually far beyond ordinary people. In folk legends, there are often sayings that heroes in troubled times are stars from the sky descending to the mortal world. The reasoning is actually the same."</p><p></p><p>"This change is called 'Heaven Opens Its Favor, All Stars Descend to the World'."</p><p></p><p>As the power of the world's impending changes within his body dissipated, Li Fan could also clearly feel the changes occurring in the Great Qi world under the influence of this power.</p><p></p><p>In the next few decades, true children of destiny like Mr. Bai and Su Yuqing would emerge like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.</p><p></p><p>The actual innate talent of the children of destiny was closely related to the strength of the world.</p><p></p><p>As people of the Heavenly Mandate, Mr. Bai naturally far surpassed the mortal realm's Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>The batch of children of destiny born in the Great Qi might be slightly weaker than the Xuanhuang Realm's prodigies at first.</p><p></p><p>But as Li Fan continuously transformed the Great Qi, the small world would gradually upgrade.</p><p></p><p>The quality of the Great Qi's geniuses would gradually catch up with and surpass the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>"This is the change of heaven and man resonating, the way of heaven nourishing man."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully comprehended the subtle changes of the world being slowly shaped in his hands, and a sense of pride and transcendence arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true meaning of changing the world with a mere wave of the hand."</p><p></p><p>"What I am changing now is just a small mortal world. I wonder what kind of feeling it would be for someone like the Heavenly Doctor to casually knead the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The world and man.</p><p></p><p>But now, the insignificant humans were instead shaping the world.</p><p></p><p>The pleasure brought by this strong contrast was even greater than the improvement of cultivation and realm.</p><p></p><p>It almost made Li Fan indulge in it and unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra automatically circulated and startled Li Fan awake not long after.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... This is the bewilderment naturally produced after mastering a power that originally did not belong to one's level."</p><p></p><p>"If one indulges in it for a long time, it is very likely to be assimilated by the world's Dao in turn, losing one's self-awareness and becoming a part of the world's Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the process of shaping the brand-new Great Qi mortal world, Li Fan also discovered that the power of the world's impending changes was not a force that would last forever.</p><p></p><p>"The world will consume this part of energy according to the changes in its operation. For example, the 'Heaven Opens Its Favor, All Stars Descend to the World' that I have catalyzed, if there is no continued blessing later, relying only on the initial driving force, it is estimated to last only about fifty years. It may even become shorter due to various unexpected factors."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>During this time while waiting for Huan Zhen to complete the charging, Li Fan had been constantly thinking and comprehending the principles of the world's Dao, as well as his own future Dao path.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, within the Great Qi Dynasty, terrifying changes that could be described as earth-shattering were happening all the time.</p><p></p><p>In the first anchored year, "Purifying Spirit Pools" were newly built in various places. Matching with them was a Dharma method called the "Clear Heart Mantra".</p><p></p><p>People from all over could go to the spirit pools and use the power of the Clear Heart Mantra to remove the mortal miasma within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>By the second anchored year, the spiritual energy density of the Great Qi had already reached the average level of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mandate Sacred Emperor appeared in the sky and personally taught the immortal techniques to all beings.</p><p></p><p>It was called the "Qi Wisdom Spiritual Origin Cultivation".</p><p></p><p>All the subjects of the Great Qi who had shed their mortal bodies could cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Those who had achieved minor accomplishment in the cultivation technique could go to the Sacred Capital to meet the Heavenly Mandate Sacred Emperor and receive personal guidance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in a secret underground base in the Sacred Capital, thousands of robust soldiers began to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Using the "Creation Furnace Tempering Technique", he tempered his physical body and absorbed the power of strange beasts.</p><p></p><p>Three years later, the Divine Emperor of Heavenly Mandate issued a policy encouraging childbirth.</p><p></p><p>Families with three children could have half of their taxes exempted.</p><p></p><p>If they had even more, the imperial court would bestow additional rewards.</p><p></p><p>To support this policy, "Sacred Physician Halls" were established in various regions of the Great Qi.</p><p></p><p>But they could easily resolve illnesses and pains encountered in daily life, as well as various dangers during the childbirth process.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the "Sacred Physician Halls", buildings such as "Sacred Academies" and "Sacred Heart Temples" were gradually constructed.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, the Sacred Academies were places for teaching.</p><p></p><p>Through synchronized video transmission, the people of Great Qi in various regions could receive personal instruction from famous teachers in the Holy Capital at the Sacred Academies in their cities.</p><p></p><p>Even the great Divine Emperor of Heavenly Mandate would occasionally give them lectures.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's gaze seemed to be able to see all living beings between heaven and earth at the same time.</p><p></p><p>When he lectured, he would also ask questions to students from various places.</p><p></p><p>For those who were too nervous to answer, the Emperor would not harshly criticize them, but instead kindly encourage them.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the status of the Divine Emperor of Heavenly Mandate in the hearts of the people became more and more lofty and unshakable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, more and more people went to the Sacred Heart Temple to pray every day.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sacred Heart Temple stood a towering statue of the Divine Emperor of Heavenly Mandate.</p><p></p><p>The face was unclear, but the aura was sacred and inviolable.</p><p></p><p>The people of Great Qi who had worries, desires, or repentance...</p><p></p><p>Could tell the Emperor about anything.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor embraced everything and would not blame them.</p><p></p><p>It was even said that occasionally sacred grace would descend and quietly resolve the worries of faithful believers.</p><p></p><p>In addition to various sacred favor measures, the necessary punishment institutions of the imperial dynasty were not absent either.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Supervision Court oversaw the world, and any behavior that violated the laws of the imperial dynasty would receive the most severe punishment.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying punishment was not death, but having one's consciousness extracted and imprisoned in the Sacred Heart Temple.</p><p></p><p>Facing the condemnation of the Great Qi people for all eternity.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The entire Great Qi Dynasty was like a flying boat with increasing power, surging forward in strength and growing by the day.</p><p></p><p>But it never launched a war against the outside, only constantly accumulating strength.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the 8th year.</p><p></p><p>He stretched his muscles and bones and headed towards the Eastern Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Hiding behind the scenes did not mean always staying within the small world of Great Qi.</p><p></p><p>Just like at the end of the 119th world, he hid in the dark prison.</p><p></p><p>The enemy's territory, the darkest place under the lamp, might be the safest and most unexpected place.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in the familiar Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan did not stop. He turned into a virtual shadow and went straight to Tianyu Province.</p><p></p><p>According to the secret information he had glimpsed in the Heavenly Mystery Mirror before, there was an identity in Tianyu Province that was suitable for disguise.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of Tianyu, Luojia Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>In an underground cave.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneaked in like a ghost, making no sound.</p><p></p><p>After distinguishing the surrounding energy fluctuations, he showed a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hua Shen cultivator Sun Ang discovered the Aura of Heaven and Earth here."</p><p></p><p>"He sealed off the underground cave with a formation, and it took him three full years to exhaust the Aura of Heaven and Earth alone."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, he became a Dao Convergence Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"The Sun family had always held important positions in the Dharma Protector Hall for generations. Not long after he became a Dao Convergence Immortal, he was selected to enter the headquarters of the Dharma Protector Hall. Guarding the Dharma Evolution Orb. He was one of the few elders I met when I had an audience with the Dharma Evolution Orb."</p><p></p><p>"The method Sun Ang used to refine the Aura of Heaven and Earth was very mysterious. After converging with the Dao, he never made a move again, and even I don't know his true abilities."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter..."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan's thoughts turned, he had already found the target.</p><p></p><p>The originally pitch-black underground cave suddenly became colorful.</p><p></p><p>Sun Ang sat cross-legged, his face solemn, his hands constantly making hand seals.</p><p></p><p>Emitting rainbow lights to carefully restrain the illusion in front of him.</p><p></p><p>And that Aura of Heaven and Earth, for some reason, was sleeping.</p><p></p><p>It was completely unaware of Sun Ang's little movements and let him do as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>"The Aura of Heaven and Earth, Purple Ling."</p><p></p><p>"Granted a heavenly duty, it nurtures the thousand crystal hundred flowers of Luojia..."</p><p></p><p>The moment Li Fan saw the illusion of the Aura of Heaven and Earth, he knew its essence.</p><p></p><p>"The thousand crystal hundred flowers of Luojia are a famous sight of Luojia Mountain. Appearing once every five hundred years, they grow from the earth, covering the mountains like fresh flowers. In fact, they are a special type of crystal similar to spirit stones..." Various information instantly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"One of the orders of heaven and earth, not much to do with me."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan had no intention of making a move on this Aura of Heaven and Earth either.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Sun Ang, who was concentrating on casting spells to imprison Purple Ling, his eyes flashing.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he laid down layers of formations, trapping him in the center.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sun Ang finally woke up.</p><p></p><p>"What..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, his vision went black and he lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Traveling through his sea of consciousness, Li Fan saw all his memories.</p><p></p><p>Then he extracted a thread of essence blood from the other party and casually suppressed him in his own inner world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then activated the Qixuan True Spirit Transformation, transforming into Sun Ang's appearance.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>There are about two more chapters left, brothers don't wait.</p>

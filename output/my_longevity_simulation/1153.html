            <p>Chapter 1151: The True Culprit Behind the Destruction of the Realm</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Life?"</p><p></p><p>This thought suddenly arose in Shang Shaojun's mind.</p><p></p><p>As far as he knew, among the survivors from other immortal realms, there were indeed some who had reached the Eternal Life realm.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not as invincible as the Eternal Life Celestial Venerables of the Xuanhuang Realm, they were indeed not opponents that ordinary Harmonious Dao cultivators could deal with.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the case." Shang Shaojun's heart trembled, and he became even more cautious towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The two continued to delve deeper into the Chita Abyss, as the degree of fusion between different world laws reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, new strange phenomena began to appear.</p><p></p><p>A bloody glow illuminated the way ahead.</p><p></p><p>Shattered continents were suspended and floating above their heads.</p><p></p><p>From a distance, one could vaguely see the ruins that covered the land, and the dense white bones within the ruins.</p><p></p><p>All the floating world fragments were deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Thick, root-like red threads grew out from these fragmented continents, extending into the Chita Abyss and hiding in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, hair-raising sounds would echo in the space.</p><p></p><p>It was like a metal blade scraping across the surface of bones, or the heavy breathing of a dying person.</p><p></p><p>The eerie atmosphere of this place caused Li Fan and his companion, who had come to explore the secrets, to stop in their tracks simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan seemed to be carefully observing the strange scene ahead, Shang Shaojun pondered for a moment and then also transmitted his thoughts: "These shattered worlds seem to be still alive?" He was a bit uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan did not respond.</p><p></p><p>He simply waved his hand, sending out a sword light that flew straight towards one of the shattered worlds.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shang Shaojun's heart tightened, and he immediately became alert.</p><p></p><p>Although he had witnessed how extraordinary Li Fan's swordsmanship was, the backlash from a world, even a dying one, was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>The silvery-white sword light instantly crossed the space and arrived above that shattered continent.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Shang Shaojun a little was that the sword strike Li Fan unleashed did not seem to be intended for destruction.</p><p></p><p>After piercing through the barrier and descending, it remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>And the trail it left in the air as it came did not fade away either.</p><p></p><p>The sword light condensed, seemingly forming a silver thread.</p><p></p><p>It connected Li Fan with that shattered world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure floated, standing on the silver thread, eyes closed as if comprehending something.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>But as he watched, for some reason, the scene of a mortal physician taking a pulse to treat an illness flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Using the sword as a guide to discern life and death."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this person not only has superb swordsmanship but also has profound attainments in the Dao of [Medicine]?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun was shocked.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's next action made his heart pound even more.</p><p></p><p>He saw Li Fan lightly stomp on the silver thread, and a ripple spread along the thread into the shattered world.</p><p></p><p>At first, it was an inconspicuous slight tremor.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if triggering some resonance, the tremors became more and more intense. The land, which had been completely silent, suddenly awakened.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds came from underground, and countless lava erupted with the world's roar.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan lightly snapped his fingers, severing the sword light under his feet.</p><p></p><p>Then he retreated far back in the direction they had come from.</p><p></p><p>"Get farther away."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could finish his words, Shang Shaojun felt himself being hit by a huge force, his figure out of control...</p><p></p><p>The figure flew backwards from the impact.</p><p></p><p>His internal qi and blood were boiling, as if he had already suffered minor injuries.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun turned his head in shock, only to discover that the world "diagnosed" by Li Fan had already entered a destructive end amidst intense self-collision.</p><p></p><p>It was originally just a fragment, and the world was extremely fragile.</p><p></p><p>It simply could not withstand such violent energy fluctuations within itself.</p><p></p><p>The earth completely disintegrated, turning into endless crimson flames.</p><p></p><p>While flashing its final light in the darkness, it also represented the passing of a world.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun watched this scene, lost in thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, by his side, explained: "If this world was destroyed by an external force, not only would it cause the world itself to retaliate, but it might also alert the existence behind all of this."</p><p></p><p>"But if the world's remaining power is forcibly stimulated, causing it to die naturally..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, thousands of sword phantoms appeared behind him once again.</p><p></p><p>"Enter the formation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's transmitted voice, Shang Shaojun's heart jumped again.</p><p></p><p>However, he had already been shocked to the point of numbness, and just subconsciously followed.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the formation space, Shang Shaojun saw the sword shadows flying and circling around rapidly.</p><p></p><p>A thousand swords flew together, creating a very concealed hiding spot.</p><p></p><p>Before hiding in this sword formation, Shang Shaojun also saw Li Fan destroying several broken worlds ahead in the same manner.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying impact released by the destruction of the worlds made this deepest part of the Abyss instantly resemble purgatory.</p><p></p><p>Countless dark red ashes, carried by the raging energy, spewed out towards the outside of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Like ten thousand ghosts marching at night, like a beast stampede.</p><p></p><p>The formation of a thousand swords seemed to be struggling a bit.</p><p></p><p>Constantly shrinking.</p><p></p><p>The countless sword lights were also rotating faster and faster, almost forming rings of lines.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't seem worried about the formation not holding up.</p><p></p><p>Eyes closed, standing straight, not knowing what he was doing.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>As if seeing Shang Shaojun's confusion, Li Fan simply transmitted a sentence, then spoke no more.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun took a deep breath, and quickly became tranquil under the boost of the cool air.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding sword lights were dancing, not only blocking the outside scenery.</p><p></p><p>It even blocked his divine sense, unable to clearly see what was happening outside.</p><p></p><p>But judging from the booming sounds of the sword formation being hit by huge objects from time to time, the destruction of several world fragments in a row must have had an extremely terrifying impact on the outside.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this person, just this impact alone would have forced me to retreat in a sorry state."</p><p></p><p>"Swordsmanship, medical skills, formations... how can there still be someone in this world who is proficient in all methods?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's thoughts were surging. Even with the boost of the Immortal Heart Mantra, he could not completely suppress his speculations about Li Fan's identity.</p><p></p><p>I don't know how long it took.</p><p></p><p>The storm outside the sword formation finally slowly subsided.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still didn't seem to have any intention of undoing the sword formation.</p><p></p><p>And judging from his increasingly solemn expression, it seemed that there was still some existence outside that was even more terrifying than the destruction of the worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The mastermind behind the scenes?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's mind recalled the horrifying scene of countless world fragments hanging overhead.</p><p></p><p>This was obviously not something that could form naturally.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the overbearing existence that could treat worlds as playthings, and perhaps was now appearing not far away, Shang Shaojun couldn't help but feel his scalp go numb.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this sword formation can hide us completely?"</p><p></p><p>"If we're discovered by It, it will definitely be a dead end!"</p>

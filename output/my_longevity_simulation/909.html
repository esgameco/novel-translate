        <h1>Chapter 909</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The gray mold seemed to have an obsession with this golden willpower. It changed from its previous lazy and lurking appearance, becoming very aggressive.</p><p></p><p>Its relentless manner made Li Fan feel a bit horrified.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the endless spiritual power support from his Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven, perhaps in such a short time, there would be a risk of the seven-colored divine light seal being broken.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a fierce creature that can destroy the world..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart turned slightly cold, but his hands did not stop, constantly reinforcing the seal.</p><p></p><p>Originally it was only a thin layer of light cocoon, until Li Fan reinforced it into a thick light sphere. The gray mold lost its sense of the golden willpower, and only then did it become obedient again.</p><p></p><p>It went back inside the dark golden skull and lurked.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I guessed correctly, this golden willpower is indeed at the same level as the immortal seal characters represented by Chaos, Famine and the gray mold."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, for these three characters, the golden willpower is very likely a great nourishing substance."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, perhaps the golden willpower can be used to cast and reproduce the three true immortal seal characters."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a very tempting idea, but the consequences of doing so might not be something he could bear.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the Xuanhuang world was a small matter. If it attracted the attention of true immortals in the Immortal Ruins, or even unknown powerful existences outside.</p><p></p><p>Then it was very likely that even Huan Zhen might not be able to activate in time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still remembered, at the end of the 115th world, when the true immortal destroyed the Xuanhuang world with a glance and Huan Zhen activated automatically.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene did not immediately become illusory.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was in an extremely peculiar state.</p><p></p><p>Outside of Huan Zhen, it was pitch black, forming a circular domain.</p><p></p><p>And outside the domain, the scene of the Xuanhuang world being destroyed flashed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, at that moment, the power of Huan Zhen was still slightly affected after all.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I want to try, it needs to be done by a clone whose memory has been cut off. Or, by borrowing the hands of others. I believe there are still many people in the Xuanhuang world who are interested in the power above longevity..."</p><p></p><p>Faces flashed through Li Fan's mind as he began to plan for suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a rather sensational event happened in the Wanxian League.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "sensation" was only within a specific circle.</p><p></p><p>That is, the former chief formation master of the Strategy Formation Hall, Lu Xichan, returned.</p><p></p><p>Previously, due to the repeated leaks in the protective formation of the Wanxian League and the inability to find the mole, Lu Xichan resigned to appease public outrage.</p><p></p><p>After such a long time, although the Wanxian League still failed to find the real leaker and just randomly found a scapegoat to close the case, the impact of the incident gradually subsided, so Lu Xichan was reinstated.</p><p></p><p>However, according to rumors, behind Lu Xichan's return, there might be strong support from a Dharma transmitter.</p><p></p><p>After returning, Lu Xichan made frequent big moves.</p><p></p><p>She transferred elite formation masters from the Strategy Formation Halls of various states to the Wanxian League headquarters, and her purpose was not really concealed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan found out with little effort.</p><p></p><p>To comprehensively improve the existing protective formation of the Wanxian League, and through formations, attempt to create something that can contend with the Celestial Venerable Dharma</p><p></p><p>During this period of confrontation, Luxichuan used the righteous cause of fighting against the Five Elders Association as an excuse, so no one dared to openly oppose her.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all the array masters with good innate talents from each state were selected.</p><p></p><p>Including He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Judging from He Zhenghao's muttering when praying to the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, he was quite excited.</p><p></p><p>He even fantasized that if he could make outstanding contributions in this matter by relying on his excellent array talent,</p><p></p><p>he might be able to return to the Heng family in a glorious manner and show off proudly!</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan, the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, after perceiving He Zhenghao's thoughts, he naturally had a kind heart and decided to help him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the following days, various details about the [Xuantian Sealing Array] would often appear in He Zhenghao's mind.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, the one behind Luxichuan who passed on the teachings should be Mo Rubin. And he probably has ulterior motives..."</p><p></p><p>"His real target should be the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's previous reincarnation experiences, Mo Rubin, as the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect, should be able to impose certain restrictions on the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, the Tianxuan Mirror had subtly become different from the Xuantian Treasure Mirror over thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Relying on Mo Rubin alone might be a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>This was also why he found Luxichuan, possibly wanting to use the power of arrays to restrain the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"In the 115th world, the Xuantian Sealing Array was created first, and then Mo Rubin was found."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, Mo Rubin came first, and then pinned his hopes on the array."</p><p></p><p>"However, under my secret manipulation, they will eventually reach the same destination despite taking different paths."</p><p></p><p>Seeing He Zhenghao's sudden realization, being deeply intoxicated and overjoyed, Li Fan couldn't help but show a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the Tianxuan Mirror restrained by cultivators under the Xuantian Sealing was obviously easier to deal with than the Tianxuan Mirror that had evolved into the ultimate form of the Xuanwang under the Tianxuan Soul Lock.</p><p></p><p>"With He Zhenghao's contribution of the array diagram, his status at the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance will surely rise with the tide. At that time, we can try to deceive all the array geniuses he comes into contact with and bring them into the mutual aid society."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether the Wanxian Alliance will notice..."</p><p></p><p>A flash of light appeared in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Humph. Mo Rubin knows He Zhenghao's identity as a member of the mutual aid society."</p><p></p><p>"With his insight, he will naturally see that the ingenious Xuantian Sealing Array definitely couldn't have been conceived by someone with He Zhenghao's aptitude. Then, he will realize the true origin of this array. That is, I, the former Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect, am secretly helping behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>"If there are no accidents, he will likely take the initiative to help conceal this matter and may even take the background of the mutual aid society upon himself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered: "This is the tacit understanding between brothers who once fought side by side in ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"If he can really do as I think, then perhaps it's time for us brothers to meet."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the premise is that I can trick Senior Sister Zhao into giving me the Xuantian Sect's cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>As for what to use to exchange with Senior Sister Zhao, Li Fan hadn't considered it yet.</p><p></p><p>It would be best if he could get something for nothing, but if not, he also had many things that Senior Sister Zhao would be interested in.</p><p></p><p>He believed he could convince her.</p><p></p><p>Envisioning the future, Li Fan felt quite pleased with himself.</p>

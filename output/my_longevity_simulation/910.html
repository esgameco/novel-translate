        <h1>Chapter 910</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, things in life are always unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>In the year that Li Fan patiently waited for changes in the Xuanhuang world and for his avatar to successfully retrieve the black sword, something unexpected suddenly happened. It was an event that had never occurred in his previous reincarnation experiences.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Tianyang, who was lying in the Lingmu realm lost in thought, suddenly sat up.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards a certain direction in the Xuanhuang realm, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's abnormality immediately aroused Li Fan's vigilance.</p><p></p><p>He knew his junior brother's temperament well. Except for himself and his senior brother, Tianyang was indifferent to almost everything else.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with such a grave expression, the matter was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, what's wrong?" Li Fan flashed in front of Tianyang and casually asked, pretending.</p><p></p><p>"I felt an extremely strong spatial fluctuation descending upon the Xuanhuang realm. It disappeared in an instant, unable to lock onto its location."</p><p></p><p>"But there's definitely no mistake." Tianyang spoke more and more fluently, concise and to the point.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's heart suddenly skipped a beat: "Extremely strong spatial fluctuation? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>"If it was simply spatial teleportation within the Xuanhuang realm, it wouldn't emit such strong fluctuations. This indicates that the Xuanhuang realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Has visitors from beyond?" Li Fan continued.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression also instantly became extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"There are still other cultivators surviving in this darkest starry sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Or could this person come from beyond the high walls?"</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>His heart surged, and with his composure, he actually couldn't calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the fact that the matter of visitors from beyond was too shocking, the more crucial reason was that this event seemed to have never happened in his previous reincarnation experiences.</p><p></p><p>What exactly had changed, leading to the descent of visitors from beyond?</p><p></p><p>"There might be another possibility."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart suddenly moved: "This matter may have also happened in the previous few lives, but with my strength at that time, I wasn't able to perceive it."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan finally stabilized himself.</p><p></p><p>With such a big commotion, the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association must have also sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Let's first see how they react.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, work hard recently and see if you can try to track that spatial fluctuation." Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded, accepting the order.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, although the descent of the visitors from beyond was not known to the general public, the most obvious thing was that the originally tense situation suddenly eased up, as if by mutual agreement.</p><p></p><p>For more than thirty days in a row, the Celestial Venerable Dharma Image of the Wanxian Alliance did not appear again.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Association's side was also unusually quiet.</p><p></p><p>This situation was as if both sides had simultaneously stopped their activities at hand and went to do other things.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sent a message to the Five Elders Association, inquiring about the matter of that strong spatial fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>While receiving a definite reply from the Five Elders Association, they also stated that they were investigating the cause of the spatial fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>And they said that if the Wanjie United Association discovered anything, they must notify them as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Such solemnity is too rare." Li Fan stroked his chin, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"The most crucial point is that the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association have joined forces and searched for so many days. Yet they still haven't found that visitor from beyond?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart...</p><p></p><p>(The excerpt ends here)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A sense of unease surged within him.</p><p></p><p>After pacing back and forth, he finally made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He went to the small, dilapidated temple in Yongyun State and came before Senior Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>"Are you referring to that fluctuation from not long ago?" Senior Stone Tablet seemed to have truly grasped the Way of Fishing. His aura was obscure and uncertain, like the tides, emanating a shock to the surroundings with its ebb and flow.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current strength, when he tried to approach, he would be forcibly pushed out by this unintentionally emitted force. Li Fan couldn't help but be secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. The intensity of that spatial fluctuation clearly exceeded the specifications for spatial transmission within the Xuanhuang Realm. If it's someone from outside the realm, I'm afraid..." Li Fan said with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"The joint search by the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders has yielded no results so far. So, for the safety of the Xuanhuang Realm, I had no choice but to come and seek help from Senior."</p><p></p><p>Senior Stone Tablet remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>However, it wasn't that he was unwilling to answer, but rather as if he had fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>After a while, when he woke up again, he shook his head and smiled, "Although I'm tired of living, I still bear the responsibility of the Creation Stone Tablet. If the Xuanhuang Realm truly falls into a life-or-death crisis, how could I sit by and watch?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter is actually a misunderstanding. It's not some visitor from beyond the heavens..."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, if you really want to know the whole story behind this matter, go to this place and find this person."</p><p></p><p>As Senior Stone Tablet spoke, he lightly pointed at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the corresponding information appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Qinghuang State, Han Zhong?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the information sent by Senior Stone Tablet and couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>He had also been to Qinghuang State before.</p><p></p><p>Located in the southwest corner of the Wanxian Alliance, it was desolate, remote, sparsely populated, and vast.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Congyun Sea, it was even more backward, belonging to the most lagging existence in the entire Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that precisely because of this, it's more suitable for hiding?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan transformed into a streak of light and headed towards Qinghuang State.</p><p></p><p>After some effort, when he arrived at his destination and came to Han Zhong's doorstep,</p><p></p><p>Before entering, Li Fan smelled a strong scent of alcohol.</p><p></p><p>"Why does no one believe me?"</p><p></p><p>"Good wine!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, none of it is real, it's just a dream! Hic..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned even more.</p><p></p><p>Entering the room, Li Fan saw a cultivator with a scruffy beard and tattered clothes, lying on the ground in an undignified manner.</p><p></p><p>His hand tightly grasped a wine jug, and his eyes were dazed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense swept over Han Zhong in an instant, sensing no danger.</p><p></p><p>This person was just a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator, posing no threat at all.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Han Zhong?" Li Fan asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong looked at Li Fan in a dazed manner for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if he hadn't seen Li Fan at all, he picked up the wine jug and started drinking again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, intending to use the Soul Search Secret Technique to dig out the secrets from this drunkard's mind.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Li Fan's right hand was placed on Han Zhong's head,</p><p></p><p>As if burned by fire, Li Fan instantly withdrew his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his palms, somewhat lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Although the external physical body seemed to be fine, Li Fan clearly sensed that his soul had withered the instant it came into contact with the other party!</p><p></p><p>It wasn't an injury, but rather like the soul exhaustion a cultivator experiences when on the verge of death!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but be shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that at this moment, the strength of his soul, even among Harmonized Dao cultivators, had few rivals.</p>

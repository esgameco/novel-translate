        <h1>Chapter 747</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Multiversal Alliance?" Xiao Qing's body trembled slightly, this term instantly stirring up many of her memories. </p><p></p><p>"What proof do you have?" However, she did not easily believe him, mainly because both Xu Bai's appearance and the timing of his appearance were highly suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled slightly and transmitted all the details of their previous transaction to her telepathically.</p><p></p><p>A strange look flashed in Xiao Qing's eyes, temporarily convincing her of Xu Bai's identity.</p><p></p><p>"Please follow me, fellow cultivator." With a light wave of her hand, she dismissed the surrounding guards and led Xu Bai flying towards the towering spire-like palace in the city center.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai flew through the air, his divine sense scanned the sprawling buildings constructed on the body of the Crimson Nine-Headed Corpse Beast. </p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of continuous development, the terrifying beast's original shape was no longer recognizable. </p><p></p><p>Only in a few key places could traces of the original monster still be vaguely observed.</p><p></p><p>For example, the crevice in the head area that was treated as a sacred ground for sacrifices, and the beast's claws encased in layers of mysterious metallic structures.</p><p></p><p>And the imperial capital seemed to be built where the beast's heart used to be.</p><p></p><p>During the flight, Xu Bai also gained a more intuitive understanding of this civilization so intimately tied to the Anomalous Beast.</p><p></p><p>The Anomalous Beast had indeed been integrated into every aspect of people's lives.</p><p></p><p>Just in the short time Xu Bai observed during the journey, he saw: hollowed-out dragon-like structures carrying residents between cities; lion-like beasts with wings patrolled by cultivators riding on their backs; and eye-like objects hidden in every corner of the city that occasionally glanced up at Xu Bai in the sky...</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the myriad strange Anomalous Beast objects carried by the citizens.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed unique and vibrant," Xu Bai inwardly praised.</p><p></p><p>Their flight speed was extremely fast, and soon they arrived at the imperial palace one after another. </p><p></p><p>It was then that Xu Bai realized the towering spire he had seen before was actually a living Anomalous Beast itself.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the spire and the surrounding buildings within dozens of miles were all evolved from this gigantic Anomalous Beast's body.</p><p></p><p>"The power of this Anomalous Beast is likely not below that of an ordinary Yuan Ying cultivator," Xu Bai evaluated silently.</p><p></p><p>One was an imperial sage, the other carried the bloodline of the empire's creator.  </p><p></p><p>Yet this Anomalous Beast did not make any defensive moves.</p><p></p><p>Only the originally smooth outer surface of the spire suddenly revealed an entrance.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing gave Xu Bai a puzzled look, then flew inside first.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai followed calmly behind her.</p><p></p><p>Once inside the tower, an ornately decorated room came into view.</p><p></p><p>An intricately carved ceiling, walls like white jade, wooden floors, and carpets covering the entire room...</p><p></p><p>It was no different from ordinary human architecture and showed no signs of being inside an Anomalous Beast.</p><p></p><p>The room was empty.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed Xiao Qing had no intention of involving others in the conversation.</p><p></p><p>After gesturing for Xu Bai to take a seat, she first politely asked, "May I have your name, friend?"</p><p></p><p>"You also have the surname Xu?" Upon hearing this name, Xiao Qing's aura instantly became disordered.</p><p></p><p>As if realizing her impropriety, she quickly regained her composure. "I haven't told you, friend, that the imperial family's surname is indeed [Xu]."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she studied Xu Bai intently, observing his facial expressions.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was quite obvious that the expression had disappointed her a little.</p><p></p><p>"How coincidental," Xu Bai said with some surprise, as if he had not known about this matter before.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Qing did not continue the conversation, but after a moment of silence, she directly went to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you mentioned earlier that our [Empire] is about to face a great calamity. What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai sighed lightly, his expression troubled.</p><p></p><p>He then proceeded to recount the events that had occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm - the establishment of the Afterlife Pavilion, the upgrade of the Heavenly Mirror, and the incitement of cultivators to explore the small worlds, all with the aim of achieving a great unification of the world.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Bai mentioned the establishment of the Afterlife Pavilion, Qing's expression remained relatively calm. But when he spoke of the cultivators possessing the Heavenly Mirror Treasure and exploring the entrances to the small worlds, the shock on her face could no longer be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"When did this happen? I haven't received any news about it at all?" Qing exclaimed, slightly flustered.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is changing rapidly. The developments are too fast, and there have been too many unexpected events. It's normal that your Empire's spies haven't had the chance to report back the information yet. Even though the Alliance of All Realms had anticipated the actions of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, we didn't expect them to move so quickly and decisively. We were a step behind, and several small worlds have already been swiftly conquered."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes flashed with a hint of sorrow: "Fortunately, your place hasn't been discovered yet."</p><p></p><p>"Although we have the Alliance of All Realms, we are scattered in different places, making it difficult to concentrate our forces. Facing the onslaught of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, we have chosen to temporarily avoid the spearhead and preserve our strength," Qing said, a trace of worry in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that hiding for now may not be a long-term solution."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai spoke up confidently, "This is the reason why I've come to find you, Fellow Daoist. Although the power of the Heavenly Mirror is indeed formidable, the Alliance of All Realms also has its own foundations."</p><p></p><p>"We have now developed a supreme treasure that can interfere with the detection of the Heavenly Mirror Treasure," Xu Bai paused intentionally, capturing Qing's full attention.</p><p></p><p>He then continued, "Before I came, I have already used the power of this treasure to temporarily conceal the entrance to your Empire. So you don't need to worry about it for now."</p><p></p><p>Qing looked at Xu Bai with a hint of suspicion in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai let out a light laugh, taking out a folding fan and waving it gently in front of his chest. "If you don't believe me, Fellow Daoist, you can go and verify it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Qing's eyes shifted, and she smiled. "Since you have come from afar, I naturally believe that you wouldn't deceive us in this matter. However, I'm curious as to how you know the location of the [Empire]'s entrance?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai answered with great confidence, "How could we dare to call ourselves the Alliance of All Realms without a solid foundation? Moreover, Fellow Daoist, don't forget that it was us who first approached you for a trade."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I should thank you." Qing stared at Xu Bai and said, "But your Alliance has never done anything without a motive. What are your conditions this time?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai snapped his folding fan shut. "I enjoy conversing with intelligent people. In addition to informing you about the situation in the Xuanhuang Realm, I do have a task to fulfill on this trip."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stood up abruptly, his expression grave. "Now that the Immortal Alliance is powerful, we can only choose to be patient and hide. But as Fellow Daoist has said, we can't hide forever. There will come a day when we are discovered."</p><p></p><p>"So, we need to develop the strength to stand up to the Myriad Immortal Alliance before that day arrives."</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

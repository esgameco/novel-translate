            <p>"The essence of the moonlight can be used as a crucible, and it will definitely help me ascend to the realm of Nascent Soul!"</p><p></p><p>Revealing his true self, Qin Shou launched an attack on Li Fan and Zhao Shijie. [New69 Bookclub→69shux.com]</p><p></p><p>Although Zhao Shijie was just in the perfection stage of the Golden Dan, despite being a rare talent, dealing with ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators was a piece of cake for her. </p><p></p><p>However, facing a genius like Qin Shou, she found it somewhat challenging.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was even more of a burden.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shou’s attacks were all aimed at Li Fan behind Zhao Shijie.</p><p></p><p>Originally struggling to cope, Zhao Shijie had to hastily respond repeatedly in order to protect her lover's life.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that she was at a disadvantage and on the verge of defeat, Zhao Shijie and Li Fan had no choice but to rely on the magical treasures bestowed by their masters, fighting and retreating into the depths of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>With the help of hidden mechanisms and exotic beasts in the ruins, they finally managed to temporarily shake off Qin Shou.</p><p></p><p>Unable to find the two for a while, Qin Shou unexpectedly set up a formation outside the ruins with the intent to capture them alive within the array.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Central Wujizhi Formation. Once the formation is complete, the two of us will have no way to escape." A resolute look flashed in Zhao Shijie's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go out and fight him to the death later, you take the opportunity to escape. Make sure to return to the sect and expose his true identity to the master."</p><p></p><p>Drawing her sword, Zhao Shijie was about to fly out when she suddenly noticed the Sky Machine Talisman given by her master shining brightly again.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, wait! It seems there is still a way out!" Li Fan hurriedly exclaimed. [New69 Bookclub→69shux.com]</p><p></p><p>Following the light of the Sky Machine Talisman, the two found a secret room deep in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room, there was a strangely shaped skeleton. Much larger than an ordinary human, with bones numbering in the thousands.</p><p></p><p>The bones on its body, although appearing to be a whole, faintly revealed a sense of discordance.</p><p></p><p>As if they came from different individuals.</p><p></p><p>Next to the skeleton, Li Fan found a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Inside, in addition to a uniquely shaped token inscribed with the word "Mystery," there were several manuals of cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"'Heaven and Earth Levying', 'Eternal My Sole Secret'..." Li Fan quickly browsed through them, a hint of joy appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, look at this, the 'Heaven and Earth Levying' is actually a rare dual cultivation technique. According to the explanation in the technique, both partners in the first cultivation together will experience a great advancement. If we cultivate together, we might both break through..." Li Fan was rambling on, but he suddenly noticed that Zhao Shijie's expression was a bit grim.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Sister Zhao?" Li Fan felt strange and quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"This should be one of the bases of the Black Heaven Sect." Zhao Shijie stared at the huge skeleton on the ground and said in a deep voice, "This person should have been one of the Celestial Kings of the Black Heaven Sect back then."</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heaven Sect?" Li Fan frowned, "Never heard of it. So what's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>Patiently explaining, Zhao Shijie said, "The Black Heaven Sect was an evil sect that unified the world in ancient times. Their leader was called the Celestial King. They seized control of the heavens and did all sorts of evil deeds. In the end, they were overthrown by a group of cultivators. Although the Black Heaven Sect has been extinct for thousands of years, it remains a thorn in the side of the Ten Great Immortal Sects, including our Grand Dao Sect."</p><p></p><p>"All remnants of the Black Heaven Sect must be eradicated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also understood Zhao Shijie's meaning but still felt indifferent, "The Black Heaven Sect is the Black Heaven Sect, and cultivation techniques are cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it true that good and evil differ in cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"We are the most orthodox disciples of the Grand Dao Sect, not remnants of the Black Heaven Sect. There is nothing wrong with practicing their techniques to save our lives, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie still frowned, "It's different..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at the external world, and the light of the Central Wujizhi Formation became more solid.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, it's better than losing our lives right now. Besides, in the hands of that Qin Shou, even hope of survival would be a luxury." Li Fan reasoned.</p><p></p><p>"We can get rid of the techniques after we pass this difficult situation."</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, feeling the increasing pressure from the external formation, Zhao Shijie finally nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>So the two began to study the 'Heaven and Earth Levying' technique together.</p><p></p><p>In the thrilling process of dual cultivation, they felt inseparable from each other.</p><p></p><p>Their thoughts intertwined, their energies blended, surpassing thousands of years in a moment.</p><p></p><p>Their auras synchronized and resonated, continuously strengthening.</p><p></p><p>In the end, with the help of the power of dual cultivation, Zhao Shijie successfully broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan successfully formed his Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>With Zhao Shijie's breakthrough to a higher realm, her combat power instantly experienced a qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>As the formation reached its final stage, the two broke the formation and confronted Qin Shou.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan and Zhao Shijie both break through, his own scheming about to fail, Qin Shou was shaken and unable to accept it.</p><p></p><p>Losing his composure, he gradually became flustered in the face of Zhao Shijie's deadly attacks and Li Fan's covert messages, burning with anger and irrationality.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qin, are you curious why the two of us were able to break through so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I have to thank you for that!"</p><p></p><p>"At a critical moment, we found a dual cultivation technique in the ruins."</p><p></p><p>"What does dual cultivation mean, Brother Qin, you don't understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for you, my wish might not have been fulfilled so soon!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to provoke Qin Shou with his words.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, seizing the opportunity when he lost control, he kept launching attacks.</p><p></p><p>The two cooperated seamlessly, leaving Qin Shou unable to cope.</p><p></p><p>But the irrational attacks could not last long.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, as they adapted to Qin Shou's attack rhythm, the tables turned.</p><p></p><p>In this fierce battle, Qin Shou found despair as he realized the severity of his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Trying to escape again was no longer an option.</p><p></p><p>"You! Damn you!"</p><p></p><p>Casting everything else aside, Qin Shou went mad, launching an all-out attack on the two.</p><p></p><p>Both Zhao Shijie and Li Fan found it somewhat difficult to handle the joint assault.</p><p></p><p>But the irrational onslaught could not be sustained for long.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, once they adapted to Qin Shou's attack rhythm, he found himself at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>In the heat of the battle, Qin Shou despaired as he realized the severity of his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Trying to escape, he found it impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Damn you both! I curse you!"</p><p></p><p>With a hateful gaze, Zhao Shijie sliced out with her sword.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shou's head flew high, never closing his eyes in death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their formidable enemy fall, Li Fan finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"I was just trying to provoke him intentionally earlier. If there was any offense in my words, please forgive me, Sister." Li Fan expressed some regret to Zhao Shijie.</p><p></p><p>"But we are already husband and wife now, do we still need to be so formal?" Zhao Shijie furrowed her eyebrows and asked in response.</p><p></p><p>Slapping his head, Li Fan exclaimed, "I was being silly!"</p><p></p><p>After tidying up the aftermath, the two returned to the secret chamber in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Exhausted both physically and mentally, Li Fan hugged Zhao Shijie and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>When they woke up, instead of immediately returning to the sect, after a moment of hesitation, they decided to abandon the 'Heaven and Earth Levying' technique.</p><p></p><p>There were many dual cultivation techniques; they didn't necessarily have to choose this one.</p><p></p><p>However, after giving it a try, the two looked at each other, their expressions changing slightly.</p>

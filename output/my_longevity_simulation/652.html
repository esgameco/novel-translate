        <h1>Chapter 652</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"In the meteorite immortal realm, besides the initial world, there are countless other derivative time and space. This time, it's just bad luck. If you want to try your luck again, Master Liu, you can re-enter after some time," Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Liu San sighed deeply, saying, "I have also figured it out. The dead are gone. Even if I see them again, what's the point? In the eyes of the Sect Master, I am no longer the loyal old servant. Let everything be as destined! It's better to focus on revitalizing my Medicinal King Sect."</p><p></p><p>"In this meteorite immortal realm, there are numerous opportunities. It's better to let the disciples try them out. Instead of restricting them from going out during this time and making them frustrated," Liu San suddenly suggested.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no objections.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, everyone from the Medicinal King Sect devoted themselves to the construction of the new sect within the Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>The overall layout still followed the previous Medicinal King Sect, with buildings rising one after another.</p><p></p><p>Watching the familiar scenes slowly reappear before their eyes, Liu San and the disciples' faces were filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>However, outside, to Li Fan's surprise, the destruction of the Cloud Sea did not cause much commotion.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the sudden destruction of a region should have been a topic discussed eagerly among cultivators for some time.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps due to the scale of the disturbance this time, both the level of information blockage and the speed at which the disaster was forgotten far exceeded that of previous times.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inquired casually and found out that in less than a month, people had already forgotten about the beings within the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone mentioned it by chance, they only remembered it as something that happened long ago.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Unworried Heavenly Venerate is truly admirable and fearsome," even as someone who had witnessed the events, memories in Li Fan's mind began to blur. Fortunately, he had the secret technique of 【Dao Transformation-One】, which could keep him vigilant at all times.</p><p></p><p>Now, the most discussed topic in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was the mysterious cultivators who suddenly emerged from the white mist and rampaged, looting and destroying.</p><p></p><p>They came and went like the wind, well-trained. Moreover, they seemed very familiar with the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, specifically targeting towns and cities with special resources.</p><p></p><p>They never stayed to fight and retreated immediately upon sensing the arrival of reinforcement cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Puxian Zhenzhou, which significantly reduced the impact of the devouring primordial white mist, was still a rare commodity in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and not something ordinary cultivators could equip. Therefore, they could only watch helplessly as these attackers disappeared calmly into the white mist.</p><p></p><p>What? Pursue them at all costs?</p><p></p><p>What's your annual salary, friend? Why risk your life!</p><p></p><p>After reporting, designated personnel handled the matter.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance received reports of assaults from various places one after another.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the Alliance officials were furious. </p><p></p><p>Since ruling over half of the Xuanhuang Realm, they had never experienced such a situation of being openly challenged and humiliated in their own territory.</p><p></p><p>Consequently, they sent out specialized cultivators to investigate various places that had been attacked.</p><p></p><p>However, these attackers were extremely cunning and left no clues or evidence behind.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they avoided the region where the investigation teams were and continued their attacks clandestinely.</p><p></p><p>Such blatant provocations thoroughly enraged the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Groups of black-robed cultivators, with a menacing air, were sent through the transmission array to various prefectures. Their goal was to capture these criminals.</p><p></p><p>However, after this, the attackers from the white mist seemed to have completely disappeared, never appearing again.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, all geared up for action, ended up empty-handed, feeling frustrated!</p><p></p><p>They could only continue to patrol the prefectures with black-robed cultivators for some time, arresting some suspicious and clandestine cultivators before ending the operation hastily.</p><p></p><p>The identity of these attackers naturally made the Five Elders' Council the Alliance's prime suspect.</p><p></p><p>But everything required evidence, especially when it involved such a severe accusation that could potentially lead to a war between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>Before the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance could make a statement, the Five Elders' Council spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Expressing regret and sympathy for the attacks suffered by the Alliance, they proposed, in the spirit of friendly coexistence, to assist in the investigation if the Alliance faced any difficulties in handling the matter.</p><p></p><p>How could the Alliance agree to such a proposition? They highly doubted that the other party was trying to mess with them again after completing the series of attacks.</p><p></p><p>But without being able to find any crucial evidence, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance could only silently bear the humiliation.</p><p></p><p>They not only refrained from criticizing the Five Elders' Council but also had to awkwardly express gratitude for their concern.</p><p></p><p>In this round of confrontation, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was thoroughly defeated.</p><p></p><p>The direct consequence was that the Immortal Alliance took the ability to freely travel within the white mist very seriously.</p><p></p><p>Each prefecture had to be equipped with a sufficient number of Puxian Zhenzhou, and cultivators were regularly stationed outside the white mist barrier for patrol and vigilance.</p><p></p><p>To prevent another surprise attack.</p><p></p><p>This led to a temporary surge in the prices of Puxian Zhenzhou, which had long been at a low level.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators who had been trapped before suffered a hefty loss.</p><p></p><p>"After all, governance is maintained by contracts. It seems that the Five Elders' Council still values credibility."</p><p></p><p>"But they also gained quite a lot this time."</p><p></p><p>Looking through the unofficial estimates of the loss of property during the attacks circulating among the common people, Li Fan smiled and pondered, "With such a good show, the Cloud Sea incident is almost completely forgotten."</p><p></p><p>"In about another year, when the atmosphere settles down again, the disciples of the Medicinal King Sect can gradually return to the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Executing a sealing spell, Li Fan arrived in the secret chamber beneath the main hall and closed the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Taking out an ice-blue pill, the "Supreme Heartless Pill" refined by Liu San, Li Fan swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>A familiar sensation surged up, and Li Fan initiated the ritual.</p><p></p><p>"Fusheng Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>He muttered softly, and the next moment, a slight dizziness came over him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, instead of immediately entering the meteorite immortal realm, he felt as if he had entered a distorted transparent bubble.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, two flashing scenes appeared.</p><p></p><p>Both were not unfamiliar to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>They were scenes he had experienced in the meteorite immortal realm—'Obtaining the Longevity Fruit' and 'The Incident of the Beast-Taming Sect'!</p><p></p><p>"Being able to choose freely which scene to enter, is this the change brought about by the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra?" Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, Li Fan chose to return to 'The Incident of the Beast-Taming Sect' scene.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the light and shadows ahead projected around Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Everything became clear.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder when Senior Luya will return."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 944</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These four were all Hedao cultivators, staring intently at the Holy Fetus Li Fan, their own auras surging.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed no signs of nervousness, cupping his hands to the left and right: "Senior fellows, please be patient, and wait for my final confirmation."</p><p></p><p>"However, I need to split off a thread of divine sense and go there!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan pointed his index finger at the little Yanfa Loli who was lying asleep on the long table.</p><p></p><p>The four Hedao cultivators looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They all had difficult expressions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just waited quietly for them to make a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, is there no other way?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replied calmly: "It's called treating the symptoms. If the cause of the illness is misdiagnosed and forcibly treated, it may cause even greater damage."</p><p></p><p>"It's just the tiniest thread of divine sense, only for viewing and communicating. I'm afraid even mortals can't be harmed..."</p><p></p><p>"If you're really not at ease, then forget it."</p><p></p><p>The four Hedao cultivators discussed for a while.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they decided to let the Holy Fetus Li Fan give it a try.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan split off a thread of divine sense, he immediately felt four different divine senses like chains, clinging to him.</p><p></p><p>The five were connected as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Everything seen and heard could be shared, and they could communicate with each other.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Four voices sounded in Li Fan's mind at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Knowing this was a necessary protective measure, Li Fan had no objections.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the five divine senses flew into the Yanfa Loli's sea of consciousness together.</p><p></p><p>A world filled with shimmering golden light, with one cultivation method book after another floating.</p><p></p><p>Like an ocean of books, too vast and immense.</p><p></p><p>The divine senses entering it almost lost their way.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could clearly see the names of the cultivation methods floating past him, and if possible, he could even browse the contents of the methods to his heart's content.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the four powerful divine senses watching him like tigers on the side.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the desire to peek at these countless cultivation methods, the divine sense transformed into a figure and shouted to the surroundings: "Little one, stop pretending to sleep! Come out quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Although the voice was not loud, in this world full of cultivation methods, it was a complete anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Firmly spreading to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the divine senses of the four Hedao cultivators also revealed their figures.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? Yanfa Jue is pretending to sleep?"</p><p></p><p>They had never thought of this outcome, and looked at Li Fan in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan ignored them and continued shouting to the surroundings: "Little one, do you think pretending to sleep will reduce your workload? What belongs to you will always be yours! There's no escape!"</p><p></p><p>"When you wake up, won't you still have to continue deducing? You even have to make up for the time owed during this period..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan urged his subordinate to work like a black-hearted boss, talking non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Even the four Hedao Protector Hall members frowned slightly when they heard it.</p><p></p><p>Like this, who knows how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>"So noisy, I'm going to die!"</p><p></p><p>A petite figure suddenly appeared above Li Fan's head.</p><p></p><p>Holding a wooden stick several times larger than herself, she was about to swing it down on Li Fan's head.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou..."</p><p></p><p>"You're awake!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the four Hedao cultivators were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan's actual combat power was very weak, he was not so weak that he could not dodge such an obvious attack.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, dodging the Yanfa Loli's attack.</p><p></p><p>With one swing and a miss...</p><p></p><p>The little loli placed the wooden stick on her shoulder and angrily came up to Li Fan, "What do you mean by little kid? I'm thousands of years old! Much older than you by who knows how many times!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face darkened as he scolded, "If that's the case, why do you insist on pretending to sleep in the form of a child?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know how many people are worried about you!"</p><p></p><p>The little loli from the Yan Law trembled, her aura instantly weakening.</p><p></p><p>However, she soon snorted coldly and stubbornly said, "None of your business! You're so annoying! If it weren't for you, they wouldn't have been able to tell at all!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she secretly touched the giant wooden stick on her shoulder.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Li Fan, a hint of hostility flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned to look at the four Dao Convergence cultivators and cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Everything was understood without words.</p><p></p><p>"My little ancestor, why are you throwing a tantrum again..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know, just these past few days, the Protector Hall has almost been paralyzed. So many urgent matters had to be reluctantly postponed..."</p><p></p><p>"What does that have to do with me!" The wooden stick on her shoulder disappeared, and the little loli covered her ears, looking like she wasn't listening.</p><p></p><p>"I've already been working continuously for 2,327 days! It's been very hard! The vacation that was promised to me before suddenly disappeared!" She said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"I don't care! I just want a vacation!"</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect that it was because of this reason that Yan Fa Jue was pretending to sleep.</p><p></p><p>The four Dao Convergence cultivators from the Protector Hall all smiled bitterly in helplessness. </p><p></p><p>"There's a reason for this too..."</p><p></p><p>The four of them persuaded and admonished her, taking quite some effort to finally change the little loli's mind.</p><p></p><p>She agreed to rest for one more day before going back to work.</p><p></p><p>With that said, the little loli disappeared in a huff.</p><p></p><p>The group was also forcibly expelled from the loli's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Returning to their own bodies, everyone looked at the distant light sphere, where the speed of the changing symbols had returned to normal, and couldn't help but sigh in relief.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, how were you able to tell that Yan Fa Jue was pretending to sleep?" The white-haired elder asked Li Fan curiously.</p><p></p><p>His attitude was much better, unlike the previous coldness.</p><p></p><p>"That is a unique skill, not convenient to reveal." Li Fan also didn't show any pleasant surprise at being treated as a peer by the Dao Convergence cultivators, and simply refused to answer the question.</p><p></p><p>A trace of embarrassment flashed across the white-haired elder's face.</p><p></p><p>However, it quickly disappeared without any outburst.</p><p></p><p>In his view, this young cultivator was actually able to see through Yan Fa Jue's "illness" at a glance.</p><p></p><p>His attainments in the Dao of "Medicine" were probably extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>His true self, even if not a Dao Convergence cultivator, was not much weaker.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's alright. As long as Yan Fa Jue wakes up, it's fine." The other three Dao Convergence cultivators laughed and smoothed things over.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I helped you solve such a difficult problem, there should be some reward, right?" At this moment, Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>The four of them were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder reacted the fastest, "Yes! Of course!"</p><p></p><p>"The reward is not a problem. It's just that we need to ask the young friend to keep the matter of Yan Fa Jue malfunctioning a secret."</p><p></p><p>"May I ask what the young friend wants?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and replied, "I haven't thought of it yet. If I have any needs in the future, I'll come find you. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder stared at Li Fan for a moment, but didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he handed a jade pendant to Li Fan as proof of identity.</p><p></p><p>Now that everything was back on track, Li Fan returned to the waiting space.</p>

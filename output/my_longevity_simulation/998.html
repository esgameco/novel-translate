        <div class="content">
            <p>The silver-white light from the True Temptation Fruit flowed into the bodies of the two Dao-cultivating monks. </p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought it would go as smoothly as when he used the True Temptation Fruit before, but to his surprise, just as the silver light was about to invade their sea of consciousness, it suddenly stopped in its tracks.</p><p></p><p>As if encountering some obstruction, the power of the True Temptation Fruit was completely blocked outside their souls. </p><p></p><p>The True Temptation Fruit disappeared in the air, but it did not change the perceptions of Xuan Sushang and Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Only that silver light tightly enveloped their souls.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed. Upon careful observation, he discovered that it wasn't that the power of the True Temptation Heavenly Venerate had lost effect. </p><p></p><p>Rather, their souls had a layer of special protection, resisting the influence that distorts perception.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, the high-level members of the Myriad Immortals Alliance have a special defense mechanism for their souls."</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense. Otherwise, just by mass-producing the True Temptation Fruit, the Five Elders Council could have conquered the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Failing in his first attempt at inducement, Li Fan did not give up.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he had no intention of asking Mo Rubin about this soul defense mechanism.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Sushang is involved in the secret of the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar. Looks like I can only use you as an experiment." Li Fan's gaze fell upon the slumbering Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>To be safe, in addition to Mo Rubin's Shadow Seal, Li Fan also set up formations around the two of them in succession. </p><p></p><p>This ensured that even if some unexpected change occurred during the experiment, they would not be able to make contact with the outside world or escape within a short period of time after inexplicably awakening.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he split off a thread of divine sense and slowly extended it, approaching Lu Xichan's soul.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, the strength of Lu Xichan's soul was somewhat unworthy of her title as the Chief Strategist of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In Cloud Water Heavenly Palace, Li Fan had once treated Hanhai up close and had close contact with the other party's soul.</p><p></p><p>Both were powerful Dao-cultivating experts, but Lu Xichan was far weaker compared to the former Palace Master of Cloud Water Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not feel any threat at all and observed carefully at his own pace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the soul, there seemed to be dark golden lines and patterns engraved.</p><p></p><p>Appearing and disappearing, they were like chains, binding the soul while also forming a layer of armor-like protection.</p><p></p><p>But during his observation, Li Fan keenly discovered that in addition to protection, these dark golden patterns likely also had a self-destruct function.</p><p></p><p>"If the protection of the dark golden patterns is forcibly broken through, these chains that have almost fused with the soul will shatter into pieces in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>"There is only one outcome - the soul will scatter!"</p><p></p><p>After figuring out the function of the dark golden patterns, Li Fan immediately felt it was a bit tricky.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately, after pondering for a bit, Li Fan found a similar case from the Patching Heaven Records.</p><p></p><p>It spoke of two cultivators bringing their son to seek treatment from the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>These two cultivators had become Dao companions since the Qi Refining stage. </p><p></p><p>Supporting each other all the way, making progress together, they finally reached the Deity Transformation realm together.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were blessed with a noble son, truly a double blessing.</p><p></p><p>The child had a dull and foolish appearance, and even had very weak reactions to the outside world. Only when his parents called him would he respond.</p><p></p><p>After an examination, the Heavenly Doctor told them the cause of the illness.</p><p></p><p>Their son's soul was actually not damaged or incomplete, and was even far stronger than ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the massive soul did not match the weak body, causing the soul's power to overflow while also forming a prison.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was a typical cocoon of distortion.</p><p></p><p>After a long period of abnormal changes, it finally tightly wrapped his original soul, making it difficult to connect with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>To solve this problem, it was actually quite simple.</p><p></p><p>One only needed to prune away these later-born "branches" of the soul.</p><p></p><p>But to truly resolve this matter was not as easy as it sounded.</p><p></p><p>These branches were actually also a part of the original soul.</p><p></p><p>To clean them up without causing damage to the original soul, and without triggering a fierce resistance from the overall soul...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor provided the best solution.</p><p></p><p>That was to have the soul of the closest relative touch and wash over these soul branches.</p><p></p><p>Using one's own soul as scissors to thoroughly clean them up.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire process, the souls of both the rescued and the practitioner would merge together.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because they were the closest relatives, there would be no conflict from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to living together for a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>The only price was that the practitioner's soul would suffer extremely severe damage.</p><p></p><p>Falling several realms was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor explained the solution to the two, and the couple's facial expressions showed obvious differences.</p><p></p><p>But interestingly, in the Heavenly Doctor's Mending Heaven Record, it was not disclosed who was willing and who was reluctant.</p><p></p><p>It was only after an extremely fierce argument that the outcome was that the couple ultimately chose not to treat their child.</p><p></p><p>And to prevent him from continuing to suffer in the future, the couple personally killed the child.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, this divine couple gradually became estranged in appearance but not in heart.</p><p></p><p>Later, during a pursuit by their enemies, they fled for their lives separately. In the end, both died violent deaths.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of soul restriction seems to be extremely similar to the soul branches in this case."</p><p></p><p>"Coexisting with the soul, almost as one. Extremely sensitive to other external forces, if the main body is destroyed, it will drag the original soul to die with it."</p><p></p><p>"But precisely because it is intertwined with the soul, it is not as guarded against the power of the soul itself."</p><p></p><p>"So to remove the soul restriction, the method is also exactly the same."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan already had an idea in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a continuous stream of soul power quietly poured into Lu Xichan's soul.</p><p></p><p>Facing the dark golden patterned protection that resembled a majestic embankment, it crashed head-on like surging waves.</p><p></p><p>Because this restriction itself had to deal with the ebb and flow of soul power, similar soul impacts were commonplace and did not trigger the restriction's counterattack.</p><p></p><p>It was just that in the process of constant washing, the soul power output by Li Fan was quickly exhausted.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Li Fan, who was operating the [Infinite Waxing and Waning Technique], sent the soul power over again.</p><p></p><p>The rocks on the shore, after years of washing by seawater, will also slowly erode.</p><p></p><p>This dark golden patterned restriction was the same principle.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes and output soul power. Before long, a dark golden pattern slowly faded and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The true Temptation Fruit power, which had been lingering outside Lu Xichan's soul, mixed with Li Fan's soul power, took advantage of this gap and poured in.</p><p></p><p>Colliding with Lu Xichan's soul!</p><p></p><p>If it was only Li Fan's soul alone, the intrusion of a stranger would inevitably arouse Lu Xichan's vigilance and counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Even if she was in a coma, it would be the same.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the true Temptation Fruit contained the lies carefully crafted by Li Fan.</p>

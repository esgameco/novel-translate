        <h1>Chapter 784</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps it was just Xu Bai's illusion. That solemn look flashed across briefly, and in the next moment, when he looked again, the other party had the same enthusiastic expression as before.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, no problem. I just didn't expect that the renowned Taiyan Sect would have so many Tao cultivators. I was a bit surprised." Xu Bai pretended to look very astonished. </p><p></p><p>"As expected of a famous sect from ancient times, your profound foundations are truly unimaginable." Xu Bai praised admiringly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone loves to hear flattering words. After he said this, not only the few cultivators leading the way in front, but even the idlers by the road all cast satisfied glances at him.</p><p></p><p>However, this only further confirmed the abnormality of the Taiyan Sect to Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji, because they revealed the "satisfied" expression at the same instant!</p><p></p><p>"Master Fang, do you think we can escape from here?" Xu Bai casually asked Fang Zaiji while chatting cheerfully with the Taiyan cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, sect leader, I'm thinking of a way. The spatial boundaries here are very solid. It will take some effort to break through and leave," Fang Zaiji answered solemnly.</p><p></p><p>With life and death at stake, the usually carefree Fang Zaiji finally became serious.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, let's first see what's going on with this Taiyan Sect," Xu Bai comforted him.</p><p></p><p>In the time they exchanged thoughts, they had already been led by the Taiyan disciples to a strangely shaped building in the city center. The entire structure was made of translucent blue crystals. From the outside, one could clearly see that the interior was divided into rectangular spaces. In each space, a cultivator was busily working.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji glanced at each other.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. Senior Brother is waiting inside," the middle-aged cultivator casually said.</p><p></p><p>Similar to entering the Strategy Pavilion of the Cosmos Alliance, when Xu Bai stepped into this blue crystal building, he felt as if the space he was standing in was moving. The transparency of the surrounding walls also gradually decreased until the appearance of other areas could no longer be seen.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the decorations and furnishings inside the space kept changing. Only Xu Bai and the others standing still remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>When the crystal walls completely solidified into opaque walls, an illusory blue figure suddenly appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Chen!" The Taiyan cultivators leading the way all paid respects.</p><p></p><p>The blue radiance gradually condensed, revealing the true appearance of a rather handsome man.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Tianhai?!" After seeing the man's face clearly, Fang Zaiji unexpectedly exclaimed loudly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was stunned in that moment.</p><p></p><p>"You all have completed this mission quite well. You may leave first, I have some words to exchange with this old friend," he instructed the others.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained some unknown benefit, the group of Taiyan cultivators who led the way all smiled joyfully and quickly left this space.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji had also calmed down a bit, but the look of shock in his eyes still hadn't dissipated as he kept staring at Chen Tianhai in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"It really is him. I didn't expect he was still alive..." Fang Zaiji muttered to himself while mentally explaining to Xu Bai: "Chen Tianhai was once the principal heir of the Taiyan Sect, the next sect leader. But later for some reason, he was stripped of all his statuses. It was even said that he had..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Whereabouts unknown, wanted by the Taiyan Sect." </p><p>"Back then, because some disciples of the Taiyan Sect were involved in the pursuit against me, I could never shake them off. It was this young man who came to my rescue, allowing me to take refuge safely in the Yaowan Sect."</p><p>"I heard that I even felt a bit regretful at the time of the incident. But who would have thought..."</p><p>"Seeing me, are you a bit surprised?" Chen Tianhai smiled as he spoke.</p><p>"After so many years, you still look the same. No, for us, it has been thousands of years. But for your Yaowan Sect, it was just a fleeting moment."</p><p>Chen Tianhai's words revealed that the Yaowan Sect had experienced the Immortal Void and traversed through a thousand years of time.</p><p>"So you also know that the Yaowan Sect's attempt to escape by the Godly Cauldron was just courting death?" Fang Zaijie narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"I only found out about it afterwards. Otherwise, with my temperament back then, I would have insisted on going with you." Chen Tianhai's response left Fang Zaijie slightly stunned.</p><p>"Go with us?" He couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p>"That was the Immortal Void, after all. What exactly lies within the Immortal Void? Surely Brother Fang must be curious?" Chen Tianhai asked in return.</p><p>"Among the entire Xuanhuang Realm, how many people can witness this extraordinary sight and safely return?" Fang Zaijie shrugged, "I'm afraid I might disappoint you. Soon after entering the cauldron, I directly fell into a deep slumber within the 'Great Dream of Spring and Autumn Formation'."</p><p>Chen Tianhai nodded slightly, "That's something you would do. Brother Fang is truly carefree."</p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai suddenly interjected, "You're interested in the Immortal Void? In fact, we have recorded our experiences from back then."</p><p>Chen Tianhai then looked at Xu Bai with a solemn expression.</p><p>"The variable outside..." he muttered under his breath, his eyes flashing with excitement.</p><p>"As expected, this variable comes from the Yaowan Sect!" </p><p>"Old Chen, what are you muttering about?" Fang Zaijie was a bit puzzled by Chen Tianhai's words.</p><p>"Ah, this is..." Fang Zaijie looked at Xu Bai.</p><p>After receiving a signal from the other party, he truthfully introduced, "This is the current Sect Master of our Yaowan Sect, Xu Bai!"</p><p>"Hmm?" Chen Tianhai's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise.</p><p>He then stared at Xu Bai intently, like a stone statue, until Fang Zaijie repeatedly called out to him, finally snapping him out of his trance.</p><p>His interest in Xu Bai grew even stronger.</p><p>"The Sect Master of the Yaowan Sect actually wants to join our Taiyan Sect. You all really have no good intentions." Chen Tianhai shook his head slightly.</p><p>"Now the Myriad Immortal Alliance wants to sweep across the Xuanhuang Realm. What are the Yaowan Sect and the Taiyan Sect? In the future, they will all be incorporated into the Immortal Alliance. As fellow members of the Immortal Alliance, there's no need for any sect divisions. To be honest, if the benefits you offer are good enough, I wouldn't mind joining your Taiyan Sect." Xu Bai said calmly.</p><p>Chen Tianhai was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p>"What you say is not wrong. The era of sects has passed." He sighed wistfully.</p><p>"But you joining our Taiyan Sect..." Chen Tianhai paused for a moment.</p><p>Then he shook his head slightly.</p><p>"It's best not to. We cannot accommodate a person like you."</p><p>"Moreover, the price of joining us..."</p><p>"Perhaps you may not be willing to accept it."</p><p>Chen Tianhai's tone was somewhat enigmatic.</p>

            <p>"This time, after thoroughly resolving his obsession, I'm afraid the next time I enter the Fallen Immortal Realm, it will be in a different location."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what encounters I will have at that time."</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that being trapped in the same time and space within the Fallen Immortal Realm is actually a rare opportunity. </p><p></p><p>If there was only one chance to try, and one couldn't repeatedly strategize and uncover the various hidden clues within the time and space,</p><p></p><p>It would be extremely difficult to gain so many rewards.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise is being able to escape from the trap of endless reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>As for how exactly, I'll know once I enter again next time.</p><p></p><p>Sensing something in his heart, Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because there were two harvests this time, the time limit for entering nearly doubled.</p><p></p><p>It's estimated that the restriction will disappear after about a year.</p><p></p><p>"Good things are hard to come by, so I can only wait patiently." Li Fan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Desolate Island.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo left, Xiao Heng seemed to have received some kind of stimulation, and his cultivation became even more diligent.</p><p></p><p>The bottleneck that had been troubling him for a long time finally dissipated, and he could advance to the Golden Core stage at any time.</p><p></p><p>Feeling something in his heart, he went to the central waters of the Congyun Sea to seek his own opportunity.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Yin sisters also reached the perfection of Qi Refining, and obtained the top-grade human wonders "Treasure-Gathering Gauze" and "Divine Escape Needle" from the White Bone Pioneer Realm, and began their own Closed Door Foundation Establishment journey.</p><p></p><p>On the desolate island, the only one left who had not established a foundation was Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>However, he had just broken through to the late stage of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Foundation establishment was still a long way off.</p><p></p><p>For a time, even with Su Changyu's calm temperament, he couldn't help but feel at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"When Xiaomei and Xiao Heng come back, they should all be in the Golden Core stage, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm still lingering in the Qi Refining stage."</p><p></p><p>"And as time goes on, the gap between me and them will only grow wider."</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu stood on the beach, watching the tides rise and fall, feeling a bit bitter in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was not a saint.</p><p></p><p>The people around him were all exceptionally talented. Staying with them all day, how could he not feel pressure?</p><p></p><p>It's just that in the past, he always suppressed these feelings of depression in his heart and never told anyone.</p><p></p><p>Now that the familiar people around him had suddenly disappeared,</p><p></p><p>Even the two little sisters who joined the desolate island later were going to establish their foundation a step ahead of him.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu finally broke down a little.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just an ordinary young man.</p><p></p><p>Feeling troubled, he couldn't even muster the energy to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Su Changyu flew away from the desolate island and wandered aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, when he encountered other cultivators, he would instinctively avoid them.</p><p></p><p>Like this, he didn't know how long had passed. When he came back to his senses, he had unknowingly arrived near a desolate island.</p><p></p><p>The island was not big, and there was not much vegetation on it.</p><p></p><p>Only a square black stone building stood on it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this island seemed to be inhabited, in order to avoid causing misunderstandings, Su Changyu was about to go around it from afar.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, flames suddenly burst out from the black stone building on the island.</p><p></p><p>And there seemed to be faint cries for help accompanying it.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Su Changyu finally landed and rushed into the square building.</p><p></p><p>Inside the building, there were transparent cages distributed.</p><p></p><p>Inside were all kinds of grotesque and horrifying creatures.</p><p></p><p>Two-headed giant snakes, sheep-headed sea turtles, giant coiled maggots, strange species composed of six heads and hands, etc.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, these creatures had all lost their vitality.</p><p></p><p>Only their corpses lay quietly in the cages.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu's expression turned solemn as he remained vigilant and continued to go deeper.</p><p></p><p>All the way inside, he arrived in front of a huge rectangular transparent cage.</p><p></p><p>In these four prison cells, there were several ragged mortals.</p><p></p><p>Some had already died, while some were still struggling to survive.</p><p></p><p>The raging flames were starting to spread from the central giant cage to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The cries for help that Su Changyu heard just now came from these mortals.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Changyu made a water-controlling hand seal, wanting to extinguish the flames.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that these flames were not ordinary flames.</p><p></p><p>After encountering water, not only did they not go out, but they burned even more vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu's face changed. While manipulating the water, he also used the spiritual energy in his body.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he slightly block the raging flames.</p><p></p><p>But he was still unable to extinguish them.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Su Changyu was having a hard time persisting.</p><p></p><p>The output of spiritual energy became weaker and weaker, and the flames became more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>Seeing an immortal master coming to save them, the mortals in the prison cells rekindled their hope for life and kowtowed to Su Changyu one after another.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu gritted his teeth and persisted.</p><p></p><p>Just at the moment before his spiritual energy was exhausted, two strange voices sounded at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Why? Why would you, a cultivator, go and save these mortals?"</p><p></p><p>"Why? Why would you, a cultivator, go and save these mortals?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu was suddenly startled. Looking in the direction of the voice, he saw a cultivator with white hair who looked a bit old, not knowing when he had arrived behind him.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Su Changyu in a somewhat crazed manner and muttered.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu didn't know how to answer for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He had left Dali and the life of mortals for just over ten years.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been staying on the desolate island, living with his relatives and friends.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have any thoughts about the distinction between immortals and mortals.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Changyu's somewhat embarrassed appearance, that person sneered.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, the raging flames instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu immediately breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Again, two voices sounded at the same time.</p><p></p><p>A door on the side suddenly opened, and Su Changyu followed and walked in.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic scene inside shocked him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have been deliberately destroyed by someone, with broken corpse remains all over the floor.</p><p></p><p>Some belonged to humans, and some belonged to strange beasts.</p><p></p><p>Even in the middle of the passage, there was a horrifying little dog with human hands for limbs and eyes all over its belly.</p><p></p><p>That white-haired cultivator didn't seem to care much about this.</p><p></p><p>He casually swept these things to the side, clearing a path.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu carefully followed.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the passage was a staircase extending downward.</p><p></p><p>That person looked back at Su Changyu, smiled inexplicably as if signaling him to follow, </p><p></p><p>Then slowly walked down.</p><p></p><p>There was an eerie atmosphere everywhere. Su Changyu took a deep breath, thought for a moment, and still chose to follow the stairs down.</p><p></p><p>As his eyes adapted to the darkness of the space below, a chill immediately surged in Su Changyu's heart when he saw the surroundings clearly.</p><p></p><p>In the not-so-spacious place, hundreds of corpses were densely packed.</p><p></p><p>Most of these corpses were already shattered, like torn rag dolls.</p><p></p><p>The various parts of the bodies were scattered on the ground without any pattern, and the situation was as terrifying as hell.</p>

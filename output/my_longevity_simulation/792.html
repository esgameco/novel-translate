        <h1>Chapter 792</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart suddenly stopped as he seemed to make eye contact with Mr. Bai's deep eyes. </p><p></p><p>"Indeed, my guess was not wrong! The first thing he did after being resurrected was to get his hands on [Huan Zhen]." Judging others by himself, Li Fan's own spiritual awareness was frantically warning him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the powerful one who was almost equivalent to the combined strength of countless Dao cultivators, he was about to come knocking on his door.</p><p></p><p>Like facing dark clouds pressing down on the city, the enormous pressure almost made it difficult for him to breathe. </p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to calm down.</p><p></p><p>The Hua Dao stone crystal in his mind was operating at its peak, pondering whether there were any omissions in his own preparations. </p><p></p><p>But he also knew that in the face of a huge difference in strength, all calculations actually depended on luck!</p><p></p><p>"My fate must not be cut off!"</p><p></p><p>At the juncture of life and death, and without Huan Zhen as a support, Li Fan felt his tension gradually disappear, and his mind became clear. </p><p></p><p>All distracting thoughts disappeared. </p><p></p><p>He calmly thought about possible countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have lost the same-body sensing with the holy fetus Xu Bai, this kind of 'loss' may only be one-way and simple shielding."</p><p></p><p>"It cannot be ruled out that Mr. Bai can still sense the situation on my side through the avatar Xu Bai or even the pollution of the main body."</p><p></p><p>"So the first step is to send away the avatar Xu Bai and try to sever and weaken the connection between him and me."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, any plan would be transparent in front of him."</p><p></p><p>"And next..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned and deduced the various possibilities that would happen next, while waiting for Mr. Bai's arrival. </p><p></p><p>But it seemed that Mr. Bai's speed of rushing over was much slower than expected.</p><p></p><p>A full incense stick of time passed, but his figure was still not seen. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he went to find Dong Fang Yao and first removed those [remnants] that could cause trouble later?"</p><p></p><p>With a thought in his heart, Li Fan checked and found that Dong Fang Yao and the remnants were all unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"Then where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt flashed in his mind. </p><p></p><p>But soon, he vaguely guessed a possibility. </p><p></p><p>He believed that with Mr. Bai's current strength, he could easily teleport through the spatial restrictions and arrive in Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>But don't forget, the Dharma Heavenly Venerable was watching and observing the Xuanhuang Realm from the dome above. </p><p></p><p>Such a conspicuous move was tantamount to actively exposing himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "slow pace" was relative to "teleportation".</p><p></p><p>"In any case, it should be soon." Li Fan sat cross-legged in the center of the cultivation secret room.</p><p></p><p>The avatar Xu Bai quietly arrived at the entrance of Changsheng Valley. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's guess was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the sealed spatial passage was suddenly opened. </p><p></p><p>The Yao Wang Sect disciples on duty were stunned.</p><p></p><p>When they went forward to check, they found that no one had come at all. </p><p></p><p>Just as they were confused, a figure arrived in Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Before he could stand still or say half a sentence, thousands of black evil qi, like countless flying insects, exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>It turned into a sky full of flying swords, slashing towards Mr. Bai!</p><p></p><p>Each strike was enough to severely injure a Dao cultivator!</p><p></p><p>"Yu Shan?!" Liu San's shocked voice rang out. </p><p></p><p>The countless black evil swords were unleashed by Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>It was her unique skill [Illusory and Indefinite Sword].</p><p></p><p>The indefinite sword intent, tainted with overwhelming evil qi, a single sword intent could easily destroy the body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, Jiang Yushan could use up to a thousand sword intents at the same time, which was already...</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The meridians are the limit.</p><p>And at this moment, it had obviously exceeded the upper limit of the load she could bear.</p><p>It was as if there were countless wounds all over her body, bursting open. Fresh blood flowed from all over her body, even from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>Such injuries may not matter for a new law cultivator. But for an old law cultivator, it was already extremely serious.</p><p>But Jiang Yushan didn't care.</p><p>The endless black evil sword kept slashing.</p><p>Fight to the death!</p><p>"Fang Zaiji!" He shouted angrily, waking up Old Fang who was still intoxicated in refining tools.</p><p>At the same time, he waved his palms and slapped towards the green light.</p><p>A green light surged towards Jiang Yushan, repairing the injuries on her body.</p><p>Another green light instantly turned into thousands of threads, trying to lock down Mr. White.</p><p>Before the green threads reached Mr. White, a black heavy hammer the size of a small mountain appeared above his head.</p><p>It was about to fall heavily.</p><p>The joint attack of the three Dao Convergence cultivators from the Medicine King Sect was Li Fan's first preparation.</p><p>The reason why Jiang Yushan took the lead was because she was influenced by the second [Fruit of True Temptation] she had taken before, and launched a fight to the death under Xu Bai's instructions.</p><p>And as long as Jiang Yushan was trapped in the battle, Liu San would definitely not be able to ignore it. Fang Zaiji was also very likely to join the fight.</p><p>Just one Fruit of True Temptation could drive the three Dao Convergence cultivators into battle.</p><p>Although the strength of the three Dao Convergence cultivators from the Medicine King Sect was slightly weaker than the Dao Convergence cultivators of the present law,</p><p>But the three of them joining hands could definitely be considered a formidable force.</p><p>However, Mr. White seemed to have anticipated their joint attack.</p><p>A gentle smile appeared on his face.</p><p>His figure flashed and disappeared amidst the surrounding of countless evil qi, green threads, and black hammers.</p><p>At a speed that no one present could see clearly, he arrived beside Liu San and the others in turn.</p><p>He reached out his right index finger and tapped lightly.</p><p>The three Dao Convergence cultivators instantly stood still, as if they had lost all their abilities, and fell lightly from mid-air towards the ground.</p><p>At this time, Mr. White finally looked at the Dao Convergence attack that was still hovering in the air and about to erupt.</p><p>He lightly clenched his right hand.</p><p>Those divine ability fluctuations instantly became like a ball of tangled threads, absorbed into his hand.</p><p>And then, without any visible action to dispel it, the small sphere containing terrifying energy was absorbed from his palm into his body.</p><p>Liu San and the others were not injured.</p><p>They landed safely on the ground, looking at Mr. White who looked exactly like the sect master's avatar Xu Bai, and they all fell into a daze.</p><p>Such strength had already far exceeded their imagination.</p><p>"Longevity Heavenly Venerate? And how could he look exactly the same as the sect master's avatar?"</p><p>Countless doubts suddenly arose in their minds.</p><p>But before they could ponder, another anomaly occurred on the scene.</p><p>A huge metal furnace appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>It crashed towards Mr. White at a rapid speed.</p><p>There were already cracks on the surface of the furnace.</p><p>The moment it was about to approach Mr. White, it exploded with a bang.</p><p>Furnace fragments flew, but halfway through their scattering, they were devoured by a distorted, swelling demonic beast flesh.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A giant lump of flesh, seemingly with countless ferocious faces of demonic beasts constantly emerging on it.</p><p>In countless pairs of eyeballs, there was only brutality and destructive intent.</p><p>From the moment of its birth, the first thing it saw was Mr. White.</p><p>The Emperor One Beast let out a strange angry roar and recklessly charged towards him.</p><p>Instantly, countless tentacles split from its body.</p><p>Each one carried a demonic aura and whipped forward.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>There will be another chapter later at around 2 AM.</p><p>()</p>

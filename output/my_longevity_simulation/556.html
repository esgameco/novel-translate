            <p>They are completely different from the populations within the small world and can swallow spiritual energy for cultivation. </p><p></p><p>White snakes, flying kites, two-headed monkeysâ€¦ They are closer to the traditional demonic beast images of ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi, who was completely unprepared, unexpectedly plunged into the group of demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these demonic beasts lived deep in this ravine, isolated from the world and had never seen humans before.</p><p></p><p>While Han Yi was scared to the point of losing his soul, many of them were also scared and fled directly.</p><p></p><p>For those remaining, it was not so easy to deal with. Seeing their home invaded by unfamiliar creatures, their inherent ferocity was triggered, and they attacked Han Yi without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi deeply absorbed spiritual energy, cast a protective spell on himself, condensed his qi into a sword, and slashed at the group of demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed like mist, and in an instant, more than ten demonic beasts had their heads separated from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But the bloodshed only made them more frenzied.</p><p></p><p>Fearless and relentless, they surged like a tide towards Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>And in the distance, it seemed that an endless number of demonic beasts were continuously rushing towards this place.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi knew he couldn't stay here for long, so he fought while retreating towards the depths below.</p><p></p><p>The closer he got to the bottom of the ravine, the denser the spiritual energy became.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was able to fully unleash his original complete Qi cultivation strength. However, correspondingly, the strength of the demonic beasts inhabiting this place grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, Han Yi used all his skills and finally carved out a path through the crowd of demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Passing through a seemingly chaotic and unclear opening at the bottom of the ravine, he safely returned to the Yellow Essence World.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath of the familiar and sweet air, the unsettled Han Yi barely had time to rest. </p><p></p><p>However, he felt a sense of danger suddenly rushing to his head, as if he was being targeted and observed, unable to control the pounding of his heart.</p><p></p><p>Realizing he had become a sitting duck, Han Yi had no choice but to ignore his injuries and hastily flee again.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the vague unease in his heart gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Exhausted both physically and mentally, Han Yi found a nearby deserted island.</p><p></p><p>Barely able to land, he could no longer hold on and passed out.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Back to the present.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had thoroughly explored Han Yi's experiences over the years through Cloud Water Illusion dreams, showed a hint of interest in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The kid's experiences are truly rich and colorful."</p><p></p><p>"Most cultivators won't encounter life-and-death crises in their lifetime, but he managed to stumble upon one on his first adventure."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, if he were an ordinary person, he would have died countless times already."</p><p></p><p>"But he consistently manages to escape danger."</p><p></p><p>"The Destiny Sutra and the Feather of the Abyssal Bird. Are these your reliance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the peacefully sleeping Han Yi and stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>"The interdependence of blessings and misfortunes. That's why in your previous life, you could breakthrough to the Gold Core realm in just over ten years, and at the Yafaja site, acquired the True Skill suited to you..."</p><p></p><p>"You reached a point where you could be called 'a dragon soaring in the sky, unstoppable'."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, you encountered me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were emotionless and extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>With a light touch on Han Yi's forehead, he continued, "This time, your fate trajectory will have to follow my plan."</p><p></p><p>After making Han Yi experience certain scenes in a dreamlike form while sleeping, Li Fan put away his abilities.</p><p></p><p>"The Destiny Sutra, quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>"But for now, I'll leave it in your hands."</p><p></p><p>His gaze profound, Li Fan once again surveyed Han Yi's face before gradually disappearing.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Han Yi slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..."</p><p></p><p>"It feels like I had a dream. Remembered the distressing incidents in that small world again." Feeling a faint headache in his mind, he subconsciously pressed his temples to soothe it.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky!"</p><p></p><p>Lying on the ground, Han Yi couldn't help but feel a mix of anger and laughter as he recalled his experiences in that small world.</p><p></p><p>"It's probably because my Destiny Sutra hasn't fully matured, leading to a backlash."</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Han Yi seemed to have an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"I narrowly escaped with my life in the hands of that mysterious person, which could be considered a stroke of luck."</p><p></p><p>"But then immediately faced backlash and was captured by monsters."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on the Destiny Sutra for protection, surviving once again, only to face another backlash and be chased by Si."</p><p></p><p>"Even in a desperate situation, I found a glimmer of hope. But immediately after, I faced a life-and-death crisis, surrounded by demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's eyes sparkled, feeling a sudden clarity in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Blessings and misfortunes coexist, and the line between them is blurry."</p><p></p><p>"If one only seeks to gain, it's hard to sustain. It's only by turning misfortunes into blessings, applying fate to the most crucial aspects, that the right path can be followed!"</p><p></p><p>With his mind clear, a wave of spiritual power surged from Han Yi's body.</p><p></p><p>He absorbed all the spiritual energy in the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the deserted island, a whirlwind began to form.</p><p></p><p>Inside Han Yi's dantian, the originally dark Abyssal Bird feather also disintegrated inch by inch, completely merging into his dantian.</p><p></p><p>This scene was Han Yi successfully enlightening after going through a series of perilous events, back in the Yellow Essence World.</p><p></p><p>He directly successfully built his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Years of fruitless pursuit finally accomplished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi felt the resentment in his chest dissipate completely.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a long roar to vent his pent-up feelings.</p><p></p><p>However, the roar only lasted for a moment before Han Yi abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously scanning his surroundings, he realized there were no sudden dangers this time, allowing him to relax slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I shouldn't get too arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"It's just the foundation phase, my future path is set, and immortality is within reach!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he pondered again, "Although I have built my foundation now, my resources have already been depleted by the Grandmaster during the foundation-building process."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I've been using a book reading and updating app for a while now, with various source changes and multiple voice options, available on both Android and Apple platforms."</p><p></p><p>"Basically, I'm left with nothing. I need to come up with a plan to earn some contribution points."</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, after a moment, he suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"I heard there's a trick in the Congyun Sea called 'Attracting Fish', which can make a person instantly wealthy if lucky."</p><p></p><p>"It's made for someone like me!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, let's see my methods!"</p><p></p><p>With that thought in mind, Han Yi soared into the air and flew towards the location of the Attracting Fish Island he had seen in his memories.</p>

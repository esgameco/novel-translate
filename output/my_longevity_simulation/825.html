            <p>"This is too fast!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was suddenly quite surprised. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>To go from the Lingmu Realm to Jiushan Prefecture, one would have to traverse almost half of Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Based on the normal flying speed of a Yuanying cultivator, it would take at least five or six days.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Ling were to fly through the sky with Li Fan, it would probably take half a day.</p><p></p><p>But with the power of the earth veins, they arrived almost in an instant.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, traveling underground was completely silent!</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association are in a confrontational state, with heavy defenses guarding the border between Shilin Prefecture and Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan and the others passed through, they did not arouse any suspicion from either side.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the earth veins is pure and exclusive. It seems that in the current Xuanhuang World, there is still no method to safely shuttle through the earth veins." Li Fan recalled the various knowledge about earth veins he had searched before, and secretly pondered.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in Jiushan Prefecture, the flow of the earth veins seemed to be blocked by something.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly changed from turbulent to gentle.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sensed uncomfortable emotions from Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>So he gestured for her to return to the surface.</p><p></p><p>Before emerging from underground, Li Fan cautiously observed to ensure there was no one else around, then broke through the earth.</p><p></p><p>"The aura here makes one feel uncomfortable." Lin Ling frowned slightly. </p><p></p><p>"Jiushan Prefecture was transformed from the corpse of an ancient beast. New 69 Book Bar 89shux.com It's normal for you to feel slightly repelled by it." Li Fan explained roughly.</p><p></p><p>"Such a large area was all transformed from a corpse?" Lin Ling's eyes widened, "Its strength must have been terribly powerful when it was alive. No wonder the seniors are restricted here..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling muttered.</p><p></p><p>"Seniors?" Li Fan's heart suddenly jumped.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! We were able to run so fast underground just now thanks to the senior's help!" Lin Ling said innocently. </p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she took out a tree branch and showed it off proudly, "Master, look, this is the gift the senior gave me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>The branch was withered and yellow, but different from the appearance of exhausted vitality. It was due to the long-term immersion in the power of the earth veins. From it, one could still sense the vigorous surging power of the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had seen this branch once before.</p><p></p><p>It was during the 115th lifetime, at Xi Menyu's cave mansion in Yueyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Vein Tree?"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered Xi Menyu's speculation about the origin of this tree.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Ruomu was severely injured by cultivators, some huge trunks fell from its body and descended to the world.</p><p></p><p>After many years of reproduction, they each transformed into different ancient trees.</p><p></p><p>Growing upside down, the roots of the ancient trees spread all over the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>"How did you communicate with that 'senior'?" Li Fan looked at Lin Ling and asked. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling tilted her head and glanced at Li Fan. She didn't seem to quite understand what Li Fan meant.</p><p></p><p>After a while, she simply transmitted the entire process of her communication with the earth vein ancient tree to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The communication between ancient trees is different from that of humans.</p><p></p><p>Almost the moment they reached the earth veins, the two had already sensed and connected with each other.</p><p></p><p>And in a very short time, they completed the exchange of information.</p><p></p><p>The earth vein ancient tree showed great affection for Lin Ling, this newly born junior.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it not attack her,</p><p>Attack, and even actively helped.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, from the Earth Vein Ancient Tree, Lin Ling also learned about the other ancient trees in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>First is the oldest tree in the world, the ancestor of all spirits, Ruomu...</p><p></p><p>The Earth Vein Ancient Tree didn't tell Lin Ling her name.</p><p></p><p>It just warned Lin Ling that the Mother Tree's temperament has greatly changed, and her moods are unpredictable. Even as a fellow tree spirit, she won't give them special treatment. Instead, she may devour these scattered ancient trees to nourish herself.</p><p></p><p>It's best to stay as far away as possible.</p><p></p><p>Then there are two beings on the same level as the Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>They were the strongest ones that separated from Ruomu back then.</p><p></p><p>One is the [Myriad Spirits Ancient Tree], and the other is the [Tianhua Ancient Tree].</p><p></p><p>Although the two came from the same origin, they took completely opposite paths.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Spirits Ancient Tree chose to reproduce itself as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Scattering countless branches in the world.</p><p></p><p>Even if it suffers catastrophe, as long as one branch remains undying, given enough time, it can regrow.</p><p></p><p>The Tianhua Ancient Tree, however, took the path of [All Laws Return to One].</p><p></p><p>Constantly reducing and refining itself. Hoping that one day, it can return to an existence like [Ruomu].</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that he had actually encountered both of them during his reincarnation experiences here.</p><p></p><p>The branches of the Myriad Spirits Ancient Tree were exactly the material Jiao Xiuyuan used to refine his avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Branching out and spreading leaves, pervading the Xuanhuang Realm. It subtly aligns with Daoist Jiao's [Myriad Puppet Dao]."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what kind of relationship Jiao Xiuyuan himself has with the Myriad Spirits Ancient Tree."</p><p></p><p>As for the Tianhua Ancient Tree, Li Fan only had a brief encounter.</p><p></p><p>It was the human-faced big tree he saw in the Wanxian Island lending organization Qingfeng Hall.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th world, when the Five Elders suddenly attacked Wanxian Island, wanting to relocate the entire island.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the whole space was sealed off, and all communication and teleportation methods failed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still spent a fortune to find out the escape method from Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely by going through Qingfeng Hall that he successfully escaped disaster.</p><p></p><p>"This human-faced big tree is one of the several sub-bodies of the Tianhua Ancient Tree."</p><p></p><p>"As for the female voice that was with the spirit tree, I don't know who it is."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Besides these two powerful ancient trees.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Vein Ancient Tree also introduced Lin Ling to a few juniors one level weaker.</p><p></p><p>Like Lin Ling, they were trees of the world that gave birth to their own spirit intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were hidden in the cave heavens and small worlds of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The cave heavens and small worlds were attached to Xuanhuang, so these spirit trees could also faintly connect with the Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Ling was the first one who could transform and walk out on his own.</p><p></p><p>So the Earth Vein Ancient Tree was very excited.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Ling's situation of being under the control of a cultivator, this Earth Vein Ancient Tree didn't seem to care much.</p><p></p><p>It just warned Lin Ling that the spirit trees of the world each have their own fated methods.</p><p></p><p>Just cultivate according to the thoughts deep in your heart.</p><p></p><p>The newly born Lin Ling naturally had a vague understanding and obediently agreed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect so many things to happen in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"And it was completely without my awareness. Even if I can fully control Lin Ling, it's still like this."</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the ancient trees are truly mysterious and unfathomable."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, both this Earth Vein Ancient Tree and Lin Ling have a relatively gentle temperament. Unlike Ruomu, who is quite extreme."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if they joined hands to secretly plot against me..."</p><p></p><p>"It would be really hard to guard against."</p>

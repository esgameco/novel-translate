        <h1>Chapter 816</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[Huan Zhen] has all kinds of advantages, with the only drawback being that for each simulation, only one item can be chosen to be saved. </p><p></p><p>Cultivation and treasures cannot be obtained simultaneously, which sometimes makes Li Fan feel a bit torn.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of this bound item replacement function has solved a major problem for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, anchor points are hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, no method has been found to increase their recharge progress.</p><p></p><p>So whether to replace or not also needs to be carefully considered.</p><p></p><p>"However, I already have some ideas on how to add new anchor points."</p><p></p><p>"Just waiting for an opportunity to personally verify it."</p><p></p><p>With Shang Tianci's hard work, the originally somewhat monotonous scenery of the Spirit Wood Realm gradually revealed myriad wonders.</p><p></p><p>And with the addition of many mysterious and grand scenes that shouldn't have existed, plus the majestic spirit tree presiding over the world,</p><p></p><p>The entire world seemed to be undergoing some kind of marvelous change.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had refined the heart of the spirit wood, felt especially sensitive to this.</p><p></p><p>"This is equivalent to plundering resources from outside the world and feeding them back to the world itself."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, the upper limit of the Spirit Wood Realm was fixed. But if there is a constant supply from the outside world, it might be able to produce the so-called [upgrade]."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully sensed within his body to see if there was any corresponding feedback of cultivation from the [Spirit Wood Realm].</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after a long discernment, he still came up empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>It was possible that this realm had not yet completed its true metamorphosis. It was also possible that the concept of [world] did not fall within the scope of the Sitting Immortal Jue.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the feedback cultivation from another source was crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful examination by Li Fan, he could vaguely see the figures of Su Yuqing and others from the Separated Realm.</p><p></p><p>"In the absolute spiritual desolation environment of the Separated Realm, within the artificially created cultivation realm, they can still successfully step into the Qi Refining realm so quickly..."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like on my side, I also need to speed things up."</p><p></p><p>After giving some instructions, Li Fan did not bring Tian Yang with him, but returned to the Congyu Sea alone.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the tense atmosphere between the land and the states, the Congyu Sea had not changed much.</p><p></p><p>The clouds of war had not yet spread here, and from time to time, one could still see the figures of cultivators hurrying back and forth between the various islands.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concealed his form and quietly flew to the middle west of the Congyu Sea, near an island called Haixuan.</p><p></p><p>Looking from afar, a majestic grand formation enveloped the island.</p><p></p><p>It faintly exuded an intent to kill that warned strangers not to approach.</p><p></p><p>"[Tahuang Eight Extremes Dragon Slaying Formation], it is said to have been jointly created by two Hua Shen formation masters invited at a high price. Cultivators below the Hedao realm who enter by mistake will either die or be injured."</p><p></p><p>The Terminal Dissociation Disk in the sea of consciousness emitted a glowing white light, and in an instant, it had already cracked the seemingly impenetrable formation before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into an imperceptible black line, Li Fan flew into the formation without triggering any signs of the formation's counterattack.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Ji, come on..."</p><p></p><p>From the cave abode on Haixuan Island, the coquettish moans and teasing voices of several women could be faintly heard.</p><p></p><p>"Such fragrant wine! And such fragrant beauties!"</p><p></p><p>As well as the complacent laughter of a middle-aged man indulging himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly arrived above the cave abode on the island and looked down.</p><p></p><p>He saw the owner of Haixuan Island, a Golden Core cultivator named Ji Shaoli, embracing two identical twin female cultivators, one on each side.</p><p></p><p>He was watching seven women below, all lovely and charming, plump and slender, twisting their graceful bodies...</p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even in the eyes of Li Taishi, the appearances of the nine female cultivators in this cave could be considered above average.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Shaoli, the biggest winner in the history of the Cong Yun Sea's 【Ding Yu】, an incredibly lucky individual envied by countless cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"At the Foundation Establishment stage, he already had a fortune of 5 million."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that he later indulged in pleasure and stopped at the Golden Core realm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Information about the other party flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"In order to facilitate his enjoyment, he even built a large harem on this island. In his spare time, he would go among mortals to select women with superior appearances. After training and cultivating them, he would thoroughly enjoy them."</p><p></p><p>"To prevent outsiders from prying and to protect his own life, he invited a Formation Master at the Nascent Soul stage to set up this 【Tai Huang Eight Extremes Dragon Slaying Formation】 on the island."</p><p></p><p>"He's a person who knows how to enjoy life."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, with the descent of the Scarlet Flames, he ultimately couldn't escape death."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Hiding and observing from above, he waited until the fierce battle ended and Ji Shaoli fell into a deep sleep, embracing the charming bodies of the numerous female cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan descend to his side like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Insect Binding Divine Ability, he controlled Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Yunshui Illusion Dream Technique enveloped the female cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>As for Ji Shaoli...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to replace him with his own avatar!</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight in this world, he didn't necessarily have to join the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But without the Tian Xuan Mirror, it would be very inconvenient to search for information or buy and sell items.</p><p></p><p>So after some contemplation, Li Fan came up with this method.</p><p></p><p>There were many reasons for choosing Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>This person was already quite wealthy and could be considered a tycoon in the Cong Yun Sea.</p><p></p><p>This saved Li Fan the trouble of initial accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Haixuan Island was originally one of the many guardian islands in the Cong Yun Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, later on, the surrounding specialty products became extinct, and it lost its guardian value, so it was abandoned.</p><p></p><p>After Ji Shaoli bought this island, he renovated it. Now, the island's infrastructure was complete.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation formation leading to the Myriad Immortals Island and the Tian Xuan Small Mirror were all available.</p><p></p><p>Occupying this island would save a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I was worried that the Tian Xuan Mirror would monitor the surrounding environment and expose my secrets. So I was always very cautious and rarely carried it with me."</p><p></p><p>"But now that I have the 【Final Dissociation Disc】 protecting me, I don't need to worry about these things."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After using the Purple Dawn Soul Observation Technique to completely grasp the secrets in Ji Shaoli's mind,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took his essence blood and used the 【Miraculous True Spirit Transformation】 to refine an avatar identical to him.</p><p></p><p>He then created a stone coffin.</p><p></p><p>Just like how he treated Zhou Qingyang in the 115th world, he sealed him inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even kindly used the Yunshui Illusion Dream Technique to make him forever indulge in the joyful dream of unrestrained pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the female cultivators left quietly with some spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>And Ji Shaoli had already been suppressed by Li Fan in the depths of the Cong Yun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Haixuan Island had changed owners without a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Without the Dissociation Disc to break the formation and deceive the Tian Xuan Mirror, without the Miraculous True Spirit Transformation to steal the sky and switch the sun,"</p><p></p><p>"Even if one could break through the island's defenses, it would not be easy to do what I did and take his wealth as my own."</p><p></p><p>The avatar Ji Shaoli checked the current contribution points he possessed.</p><p></p><p>6.78 million.</p><p></p><p>It was even more than when he won the grand prize back then.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, from the details of the transaction records, this Ji Shaoli can be considered a talented person."</p><p></p><p>"He knows how to use wealth to generate more wealth and won't just sit and consume until it's all gone."</p>

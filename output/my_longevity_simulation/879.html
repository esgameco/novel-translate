        <h1>Chapter 879</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Speaking of which, the reason why the fates of Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi underwent such a huge change...</p><p></p><p>This matter is inseparable from Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>These two were originally proud and unwilling to be the cattle and horses of the Wanxian Alliance for the sake of cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>They would rather risk their lives to explore and search for ancient cultivation techniques left behind in various sect ruins, than join the Wanxian Alliance or the Five Elders Association to work for others.</p><p></p><p>But in this life, their attitudes underwent an earth-shattering change. </p><p></p><p>The reason was that after Tianyang merged with the Dao, Li Fan ordered them to detonate the hollow in Qiling State.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Xianfan miasma sealed within it returned again, ravaging the world.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators were unable to escape the fate of being infected by the Xianfan miasma.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were naturally no exception.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they only had Foundation Establishment cultivation. They also didn't have any special physique. After being infected, the symptoms rapidly worsened. </p><p></p><p>After a few days, they were already down to their last breath.</p><p></p><p>Just when the two brothers were preparing to go to the Yellow Springs together...</p><p></p><p>They actually received the special medicine distributed for free by the Wanxian Alliance!</p><p></p><p>The two, who originally had deep prejudices against the Wanxian Alliance, couldn't care less in the face of life and death.</p><p></p><p>They swallowed the medicine in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>The effect was immediate. In just a few days, they had already improved somewhat.</p><p></p><p>By the time the Wanxian Alliance distributed the second dose of special medicine, it allowed the two to completely overcome this catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, who survived, received the life-saving grace of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They deeply reflected on their previous prejudices against the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, they both joined the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's true that those who survive a great disaster are bound to have good fortune afterwards.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Wanxian Alliance, the two brothers sold all the miscellaneous items they obtained from their adventures while cultivating to Tian Xuanjing, and actually obtained a huge sum of money.</p><p></p><p>They directly exchanged it for two golden core cultivation techniques, and even had a surplus.</p><p></p><p>With their solid foundation, they also broke through the Foundation Establishment stage in a short period of time and became Golden Core realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"The wonders of fate, even to this extent."</p><p></p><p>On Haixuan Island, after seeing these two unexpected people, Ji Shaoli spent some contribution points to find out what happened to them.</p><p></p><p>And after they had a dispute with the members of the mutual aid association, he stepped forward to stop them.</p><p></p><p>"Although these two have a straightforward temperament, this kind of character that is extremely difficult to turn back once they have made up their mind about something is not without its advantages in certain aspects," Ji Shaoli thought.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Dao Xuanzi's insistence on leaving, Ji Shaoli was not angry, but asked a soul-searching question.</p><p></p><p>"Why exactly are you two angry? Did those few just now really say something wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli said solemnly, "If what they said was wrong, I will definitely make them apologize to you two immediately."</p><p></p><p>"However, I have also heard other cultivators say the same thing as them. Although I am also reluctant to believe it, there is no smoke without fire after all. The Alliance has always been vague about how exactly to win, which goes against common sense..."</p><p></p><p>"Can you blame us for this?"</p><p></p><p>"Or have you two personally witnessed the frontline battles and are certain that what we said is wrong?"</p><p></p><p>These words from Ji Shaoli directly stunned Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi.</p><p></p><p>The two opened their mouths but couldn't think of any words to refute.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled slightly, "Please sit down, you two. Our mutual aid association is now quite large in scale. With more people, it's inevitable that various ideas will collide.</p><p></p><p>"Crash."</p><p></p><p>"So [seeking common ground while reserving differences] is our basic principle for handling matters."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone can have their own thoughts. If you think the other party is wrong, then present the facts, reason with them, and refute them."</p><p></p><p>"If you start cursing at the slightest disagreement, how can you call yourself a gentleman?" Ji Shaoli extended his hand, directly pressing the two people who were still struggling back into their seats.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi glanced at each other, feeling somewhat shocked, yet also feeling that what Ji Shaoli said made sense.</p><p></p><p>They were quite open-minded in their actions. After pondering for a moment, they first apologized to the small group from before.</p><p></p><p>Then they sat down and carefully sized up Ji Shaoli. </p><p></p><p>They had long heard about this leader of the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Society.</p><p></p><p>They had only heard that he was exceptionally mysterious and likely had an impressive background.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't expect that his strength was also unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I see he clearly also only has Golden Core cultivation. Why is it that we had no strength to resist at all?" Dao Xuanzi asked telepathically.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong narrowed his eyes: "He must be concealing his cultivation. If it was one-on-one, the two of us brothers might not be a match for those unrivaled geniuses. But if we join forces, we shouldn't be weaker than anyone at the same realm!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi also nodded slightly, feeling somewhat relieved: "It must be so. In that case, could he actually be at the Nascent Soul stage? It seems this mutual aid society is indeed not simple."</p><p></p><p>The two focused on listening to Ji Shaoli's speech.</p><p></p><p>It included but was not limited to the achievements of the Congyun Mutual Aid Society in just a few short years, outstanding members and their life stories, future plans for the society, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Although none of it was very substantive and it was all lofty words of encouragement, Ji Shaoli spoke with impassioned eloquence. Coupled with his cadenced tone, it could be said to be extremely provocative.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present all had flushed faces, as if they had already seen the bright future after joining the society.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were also deeply attracted by the various benefits described by the other party. In an instant, they cast the earlier unpleasant friction out of their minds.</p><p></p><p>They glanced at each other, both thinking the same.</p><p></p><p>After the speech, witnessed by [Compassionate Immortal of the Mortal World], they could be considered to have officially joined the mutual aid society.</p><p></p><p>There was another round of enthusiastic celebration.</p><p></p><p>Only when the crowd dispersed did they seem to wake up as if from a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Was it a bit...hasty?"</p><p></p><p>Before they could think carefully, the two were quietly pulled by Ji Shaoli into a secret room on the island.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji, you..." Kou Hong grew vigilant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Shaoli showed a sincere expression and said, "Actually, what you two said earlier resonated deeply with me. But in order to quell the anger of the crowd, I had no choice but to equivocate."</p><p></p><p>"In the current state of the world, upright cultivators full of passion like you two are a rare sight."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli bowed to the two, expressing his apology.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were a bit caught off guard by this move and hurriedly returned the bow.</p><p></p><p>"However, you two have misplaced your ardent loyalty!" At this moment though, Ji Shaoli's expression changed and he said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The two were completely baffled by Ji Shaoli's about-face performance.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji, what on earth..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli said, "Hehe, I know you joined the Myriad Immortals Alliance out of gratitude for the life-saving wonder drug."</p><p></p><p>"But, as for what this so-called wonder drug actually is..."</p><p></p><p>"You two, please see for yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Ji Shaoli tossed out a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Engraved inside was detailed information about the Heart's Desire Ascension Pill!</p><p></p><p>"Myriad...Immortals...Alliance..."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1119: Battle of Two Celestial Venerables</p><p></p><p>The instant he saw this black-haired, bare-bodied man, Li Fan had almost confirmed his identity. </p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that he should be the Celestial Venerable of the Eastern Extremity who had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But a dignified Celestial Venerable of Longevity had actually been turned into a puppet-like existence controlled by others.</p><p></p><p>How could this not make one feel terrified?</p><p></p><p>"No wonder almost no information could be found about the Eastern Extremity. Even through possessing the Dharma transmitters and inheriting all their memories, whether it was Mo Rubin or the Tianxuan Mirror, it was the same."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder when the Celestial Venerable took action, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance all withdrew. Such a secret is too horrifying. If they didn't leave, they would probably only end up being silenced."</p><p></p><p>Although he was being controlled, the Eastern Extremity's instincts seemed to still be there.</p><p></p><p>Facing the crimson flames erupted by Tianyang who was also at the Longevity Realm in battle power, the long hair behind him suddenly lengthened. It transformed into giant dark beasts, extinguishing the flames.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang did not hesitate at all. With a fluctuation in space, he instantly appeared beside the Eastern Extremity.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Primordial Giant's figure, the Eastern Extremity looked like an ant.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet flames burning on Tianyang's body could almost scorch the surrounding space into distortion. However, the Eastern Extremity was not affected at all.</p><p></p><p>As if he existed independently from this space itself.</p><p></p><p>His lips moved slightly, as if saying something. A large chunk of Tianyang's body suddenly collapsed without any sign. The puppet body shook violently inevitably.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang let out an angry roar, his body restoring to its original state.</p><p></p><p>Then with a bang, he turned into countless starfires, scattering and surging towards the black-haired Eastern Extremity.</p><p></p><p>The crimson fires were like dragons, burning everything.</p><p></p><p>The countless black hair monsters differentiated from the Eastern Extremity's body also caught on fire. The flames spread towards the main body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Eastern Extremity's pitch-black eyes moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>Those black hair monsters that had already turned into flying ashes actually reappeared from the flames.</p><p></p><p>Even if Tianyang's crimson fires burned them several times, they could always revive again.</p><p></p><p>If even the transformed black hairs could not be thoroughly injured, let alone the main body of the Eastern Extremity.</p><p></p><p>Although Tianyang was roaring, unwilling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But this fact could not be changed.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang only has the power of the Longevity Realm, but it was forcibly transformed through the essence of Source Power. He does not possess the true mystical powers of the Longevity Realm. When encountering Dao-harmonized cultivators, bullying them naturally has no pressure. But when facing a true Celestial Venerable of Longevity..."</p><p></p><p>"He's not a match at all." Li Fan shook his head slightly in secret.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this Celestial Venerable of the Eastern Extremity doesn't seem to be a weakling either. The oppressive feeling he gives me is even stronger than Senior Sister Zhao."</p><p></p><p>In the battle between the two Longevity Realm experts just now, Li Fan vaguely sensed the traces of the Dao of Heaven and Earth in operation.</p><p></p><p>Especially when those black hair monsters were reborn from the flames, it was particularly strong.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Dao that the Eastern Extremity goes against?"</p><p></p><p>"Reversing the Dao of the development and change of things?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the reason why the Dharma Sect took such a ruthless action against the Eastern Extremity?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Eastern Extremity had fully attained the Dao, he might directly overturn the rules set by the Dharma Sect in the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's experience of repeatedly peeping into the Heavenly Dao, his keen perception of the Dao of Heaven and Earth was almost unmatched by any Dao-harmonized cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Such a detailed observation at close range, the inferences obtained should not have any problems.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to create the [Pure Body Spirit Pool] for mortals, this is for</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dong Ji is probably a person similar to Mr. Bai. It's just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"Not only forgotten by the world, but also living a fate worse than death, reduced to being the last puppet of the Wan Xian League," Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the fate of the weak. But it will never be my destiny."</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa Tianzun..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>The people of the Lingmu Realm couldn't intervene in the battle between Tian Yang and Dong Ji at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if they wanted to help, they were powerless.</p><p></p><p>Even with everyone joining forces and being amplified by Li Fan's formation, it was still the same.</p><p></p><p>Before even getting close to the battlefield of the two, the lingering shockwaves of the battle caused the spiritual power to boil and the qi to become disordered.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Changsheng Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd had complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>A trace of despair also welled up deep in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan had no fluctuations in his heart and made accurate judgments.</p><p></p><p>"Although Tian Yang can still persist for now, the outcome has already been determined."</p><p></p><p>"It seems there's no escaping. However, being able to witness the deepest hidden secret of the Wan Xian League is definitely worth it."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know who exactly is manipulating Dong Ji behind the scenes in the Wan Xian League. Is it Chuanfa Zhe Jiang? Or that Emperor San Mo?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang, who was gradually falling into a disadvantageous position, tried to launch an attack on the myriad of invisible threads behind Dong Ji after receiving a reminder from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to find out information about the manipulator behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>How could Tian Yang be able to probe the details?</p><p></p><p>In vain, Tian Yang let out another roar of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dark prison.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the situation on the Holy Fetus's side, completely losing contact.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true body, who had always been somewhat leisurely and content, couldn't help but feel a bit heavy-hearted for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The annihilation of the Lingmu Realm army demonstrated how vast the gap was between the high-end combat powers of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But what concerned Li Fan even more was the hidden information behind this.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to refine a Changsheng Realm expert, who is not weak, to this extent..."</p><p></p><p>"I originally had infinitely high expectations for Chuanfa's strength to the greatest extent possible. But now it seems that Chuanfa's strength is even more terrifying than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he hasn't ascended to immortality, he's probably infinitely close."</p><p></p><p>"The Changsheng Realm can no longer be used to evaluate him."</p><p></p><p>"If he were in the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned: "Even in the struggle between the two true immortals, he might not be without the ability to save the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... indeed, this possibility cannot be ruled out."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my plan for world destruction in this life will have to be delayed for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, time passes quickly in this dark prison."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's complex mood finally slowly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>While reviewing the various experiences of this life, Li Fan made preparations for the final plan.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and it was unknown how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of a new prisoner in the dark prison startled Li Fan out of his secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Both arms severed and only one eye remaining.</p><p></p><p>The person who arrived looked extremely miserable, with disheveled hair and dried blood stains all over his face.</p><p></p><p>But it was Li Fan's old acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong.</p><p></p><p>However, his brother Dao Xuanzi, who had always been inseparable from him, was nowhere to be seen for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Even when being escorted, Kou Hong still did not submit.</p><p></p><p>He cursed and swore, venting his hatred towards the Wan Xian League.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened for a good while before finally understanding.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that since the Lingmu Realm's Wanjie Alliance headquarters was uprooted, the alliance members scattered in various places had also been ruthlessly hunted down.</p>

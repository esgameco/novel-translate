        <h1>Chapter 889</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The so-called "Heavenly Prodigy" is nothing more than a strong person who has not yet grown up.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Fan can easily handle him.</p><p></p><p>"This Black Flame is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a change in the birth of Xuanhuang, but its essence seems to be slightly more powerful than the Red Flame."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan easily suppressed the black flames emitted by Yan Fangzhou, carefully observing them while his hands were shrouded in a layer of seven-colored Yuxu molten light that others could not see.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of aura seems to be extremely similar to the Congyun Sea after it was burned dry by the Red Flame. They all belong to the category of great destruction..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>In the cave heaven created by Mr. Bai in his previous life, he had never seen the "Change of Heaven and Earth's Birth", which was indeed quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Li Fan gradually got a clue.</p><p></p><p>"It should not belong to the Xuanhuang realm itself, but rather comes from other worlds and was later integrated into parts of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Many worlds, merged into one."</p><p></p><p>"Although it still mainly consists of the Xuanhuang realm, after absorbing so many foreign things, the Xuanhuang Dao inevitably underwent changes as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly exerted force with his five fingers, and his palm, condensed with powerful seven-colored divine light, became somewhat blurry as a result.</p><p></p><p>That black flame, even with endless unwillingness, was extinguished inch by inch by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"If it were the soul of heaven and earth, I might really be tempted."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it's just a change in the birth of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and temporarily put Yan Fangzhou out of his mind.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts drifted to the Red Flame that would soon come to burn the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I already know the locations of too many souls of heaven and earth, I don't need to be obsessed with the Red Flame anymore."</p><p></p><p>"On one hand, the Red Flame is too weak; on the other hand..."</p><p></p><p>"After the Red Flame dies, the Ink Killer will descend. Even if I can escape from the Ink Killer's hands, it will likely attract the attention of hidden powerful beings in the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's too conspicuous."</p><p></p><p>"For now, I should focus on lying low."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to arrange for the members of the Congyun Mutual Aid Society to withdraw."</p><p></p><p>"After all, they are the seedlings I painstakingly cultivated and will be the backbone of the future Myriad Realms United Association. I can't let them die in vain."</p><p></p><p>Currently, the strongest member of the Congyun Mutual Aid Society is Bei Tuo, who is at the initial stage of Yuan Ying.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not retake the Immortal Alliance exam, due to his qualitative breakthrough in strength, he was valued by his superiors.</p><p></p><p>He has now been promoted to the position of martial guard in the Congyun Sea Martial Arts Hall, managing three martial arts teams under his command, which can be said to be real power in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"But at his level, it's a bit difficult to arrange a lateral transfer."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can help him establish some merits..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the faces of many spies from the Five Elders Society appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already decided, his clone Ji Shaoli immediately began to make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also recalled what Yan Fangzhou had just said.</p><p></p><p>"The scenery of this small world is indeed good. But insisting on calling it the 'Myriad Realms United Association', isn't that a bit of a misnomer?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It can't even fool a little kid. It seems that it indeed needs to be improved again."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, his divine sense swept over. Looking at the Lingmu Realm, which had some wondrous scenes of Xuanhuang but still seemed a bit empty, an idea suddenly came to his mind.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed and arrived at a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, he referred to the appearance in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Before long...</p><p></p><p>After a while, an ancient stone pagoda emerged from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a pagoda spire from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>He replaced and installed it.</p><p></p><p>After the spire was placed on the stone pagoda, this newly unearthed pagoda was instantly imbued with a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Looking around the stone pagoda, soon after, with a series of rumbling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Buildings appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>"After letting the tree people decorate it, it will be almost done."</p><p></p><p>Coming to the outside of the building complex, Li Fan wrote the three large characters "Tian Ji Sect" on a blank large stone.</p><p></p><p>"A one-to-one imitation, plus having the Tian Ji Sect's supreme treasure Tian Di Qian Kun Dice here, who dares to say that my Tian Ji Sect is fake?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan did the same thing again.</p><p></p><p>He imitated the scenery of the Tian Jian Sect's main gate according to his memory.</p><p></p><p>"The items are good. However, they were left by Mr. Bai, and maybe they are also his backup plan."</p><p></p><p>"We must be on guard."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, all the wonders of heaven have spirituality. Even if I go to take them, I may not be able to make them my own."</p><p></p><p>"I can do them a favor that goes with the flow."</p><p></p><p>While thinking this way, Li Fan casually folded a wooden branch.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he recalled his own comprehension of the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>He also referred to Mr. Bai's red rope that he had comprehended in his previous life, as well as his understanding of [Sword] in the Tian Jian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the wooden branch in Li Fan's hand underwent a mysterious change.</p><p></p><p>Countless sword phantoms appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>Then they suddenly entered into it.</p><p></p><p>The color of the branch became deep and its texture became hard.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the components belonging to the tree branch gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It really became more and more like a [Sword].</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after quickly absorbing countless sword images at the beginning, the amount of true meaning of the Dao of the Sword surging into it was drastically reduced.</p><p></p><p>That was because Li Fan's comprehension had been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>It could not support the complete transformation of this mortal object towards a wonder of heaven.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Li Fan was at his wit's end.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the neither-fish-nor-fowl sword branch in his hand, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It can barely be considered a wonder of man."</p><p></p><p>With a light force, the sword branch turned into powder.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not angry, after all, unlike formations, he did not specially take out a long period of time to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>He also only learned this Dao of the Sword casually.</p><p></p><p>Being able to create a wonder of man from nothing was definitely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I don't take it, maybe I can go to the ruins of the Tian Jian Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan planned to make these cultivation sects that had disappeared in the long river of history reappear in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't need to make it perfect, as long as it could fool people.</p><p></p><p>"I have the lost treasure of the Tian Ji Sect."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, when the Medicine King's True Cauldron returns, there will also be the original members of the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>"True in the false, false in the true. Who will be able to tell the difference then?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a little complacent in his heart and left the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>He went straight to the ruins of the Tian Jian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now the Tian Jian Sect ruins on the surface were in Tian Guang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>But in his previous life, he learned from Shuo Feng that the Tian Jian Sect's Sword Tomb and the location of [Sword] were not in Tian Guang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was in Tian You Prefecture, separated by one prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It happened to be divided into two by the White Fog Barrier, cut from the middle.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this Sword Tomb had always remained undiscovered.</p><p></p><p>Traveling quietly and in a low-key manner all the way.</p><p></p><p>Without alarming the Wan Xian Alliance cultivators along the way, Li Fan quickly arrived at the location of the Sword Tomb ruins in Tian You Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the inconspicuous scene in front of him, which seemed like a chaotic burial mound of mortals.</p>

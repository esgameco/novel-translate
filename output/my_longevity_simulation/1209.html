        <h1>Chapter 1209</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the way, Sun Luyuan could clearly feel the restlessness of the Infinite Mirror in his arms, as well as the familiar uncontrollable roar of his younger brother, Sun Luyao. He forcibly suppressed it until he returned safely, only then releasing it.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, give it to me quickly! I can't take it anymore!" </p><p></p><p>The mirror surface kept shaking violently, and Sun Luyao's smoky black shadow seemed to be constantly blown by a hurricane, twisting and turning.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down!" </p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shouted in a low voice, skillfully sacrificing a drop of his own essence blood to relieve his brother's frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he take out the mirror he had retrieved from the Baishi Winter Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the same origin indicated that the main body of the mirror was a fragment of the Infinite Mirror. However, it had been reforged and turned into a separate magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan carefully removed the remaining restrictions on the mirror before throwing it to his brother.</p><p></p><p>With the restraints gone, the dark and greedy shadow floated above the mirror.</p><p></p><p>A dark beam of light spewed from Sun Luyao's mouth, corroding this ancient treasure.</p><p></p><p>As this mirror slowly disappeared into the black light, the Infinite Mirror that Sun Luyao was attached to, which was somewhat ancient and broken, underwent changes at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>The traces of time slowly disappeared, the sense of antiquity was gone, and instead it gave a sense of vicissitudes after going through hardships.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the Infinite Mirror even surged with a heart-palpitating luster from time to time.</p><p></p><p>It made even Sun Luyuan's mind and spirit slightly tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of an immortal artifact..." He secretly said in his heart, and he became more and more expectant of his brother's performance after awakening from the devouring.</p><p></p><p>As for the actual owner of the Infinite Mirror, Li Fan's split soul hidden in the mirror, he was able to witness the transformation of the Infinite Mirror more directly.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, its recovery.</p><p></p><p>The originally deficient "Infinite, Primordial Sight" grand formation was slowly being completed.</p><p></p><p>As if it had a core, an indescribably miraculous power flowed out of the formation like a gentle stream.</p><p></p><p>Nourishing the worn-out body of the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why in the eyes of outsiders, this immortal artifact was instantly rejuvenated.</p><p></p><p>Along with it, Li Fan's split soul also benefited. The split soul stepped towards the transformation of a split spirit.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even had a feeling that if he continued to absorb the energy in this Infinite Mirror, given time, the split soul could even grow to be stronger than the original spirit!</p><p></p><p>It should be known that Li Fan had walked step by step to his current realm, with an extremely solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the theoretical accumulation of multiple reincarnations, just the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven and the Mysterious Yellow Life and Death Transformation were the essence of the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Convergence Realm created on this basis could actually be matched by the energy in this broken mirror!</p><p></p><p>Even if it was only in terms of the spirit, it still greatly shocked Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He let out the same sigh as Sun Luyuan: "Is this the power of an immortal artifact?"</p><p></p><p>The energy surging inside the Infinite Mirror seemed like order and vitality.</p><p></p><p>However, just when Li Fan thought it would thoroughly repair the Infinite Mirror, the Infinite Mirror fell to the ground out of control.</p><p></p><p>The images flashed by at a rapid speed.</p><p></p><p>The prophetic scenes made both Sun Luyuan and Li Fan's minds and spirits tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>The peaceful Mysterious Yellow land was shrouded in the flames of war.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance were fighting against another unknown force.</p><p></p><p>The light arrows flying across the sky caused earth-shattering explosions wherever they struck.</p><p></p><p>A golden glowing giant fought evenly with a black-haired, bare-bodied man.</p><p></p><p>Affected by their power, even between heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>The white fog barrier twisted and shattered.</p><p></p><p>What was even more shocking was that on this battlefield, there was also a figure wearing a black imperial robe, whose face was unclear.</p><p></p><p>Standing above everyone else.</p><p></p><p>Opposite him, another figure was equally blurry.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As if pushed to the extreme, the projected image of the Infinite Mirror suddenly became completely distorted.</p><p></p><p>Then it burst into a violent white light.</p><p></p><p>After the light disappeared, there was only a deathly stillness in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The surface of the Infinite Mirror, which had just shown some improvement, cracked again.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao let out a miserable cry as the black shadow was forcibly sucked inside.</p><p></p><p>"Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan instantly came back to his senses from the shock, his face changed, and he was about to pick up the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment he got close, his hand shrank back as if scalded by fierce flames.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked at his outstretched right hand with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, it seemed to have experienced thousands of years, with withered flesh and surging wrinkles.</p><p></p><p>It was not just his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan felt that a part of his soul had also truly experienced the passage of time, and it was difficult to return to its original state.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan saw the self-derived future of the Xuanhuang Realm in the Infinite Mirror earlier, he was shocked and wanted to take a closer look.</p><p></p><p>But the fatal sense of crisis that suddenly appeared in his heart made him unable to care about these things.</p><p></p><p>This eroding power, hidden in the deepest part of the Infinite Mirror, even Li Fan's divine sense, which had basically achieved control over it, did not have the slightest perception before it erupted.</p><p></p><p>And it came so swiftly and explosively.</p><p></p><p>As if it could erode the years, the Infinite Mirror, which had just absorbed the fragments and recovered some vitality, instantly experienced hundreds of thousands of calamities again, becoming decayed once more.</p><p></p><p>And the core of the Infinite Mirror, the Hongmeng Jian Fang Formation, was also blown by the fierce wind.</p><p></p><p>Some complete structures became broken again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense naturally could not escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>It was originally a remnant soul, and like a dying candle in the wind, it was about to completely dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, firstly, he had previously used the formation refining method to refine the Infinite Mirror. Residing in the mirror and borrowing the power of the Infinite Mirror, he had a bit more resistance.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, at the critical moment when Li Fan realized that his divine sense was about to perish, he instinctively chanted the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not recover what had been eroded, it greatly slowed down the speed of his divine sense's dissipation in this storm.</p><p></p><p>After persisting for a long time, this terrible disaster inside the Infinite Mirror finally slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realized that it did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it retreated back into the depths of the Infinite Mirror and went into hiding again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Sun Luyuan's anxious voice slowly came.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what happened to you?"</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Luyao was too severely injured to respond.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sun Luyuan reacted very quickly.</p><p></p><p>He immediately brought the Infinite Mirror into the Sun family's Essence Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>Although it was called an Essence Blood Pool, there was not the slightest smell of blood. Instead, it was filled with the fragrance of heavenly materials and earthly treasures.</p><p></p><p>The pool water was not blood red, but a dreamy seven-colored splendor like a rainbow, as if it were flowing light from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Soaking in it, Li Fan's divine sense, which had already become somewhat aged, finally felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"How did it consume so quickly?" Sun Luyuan was startled when he saw the speed at which the Essence Blood Pool water changed color.</p><p></p><p>However, he gritted his teeth and left afterwards, apparently going to gather more essence blood.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1188</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Yes, the Celestial Pivot Court has always opposed the research on the power of world destruction, suppressing it fiercely for many years. Who knows how many cultivators have become nutrients for the 【Divine Tree】 because of this. If they hadn't really been unable to hold out in recent years, I don't think they would have compromised."</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about it this way, Severed Immortal Tower has made such great progress in just over five hundred years. The Celestial Pivot Court has been in power for nearly ten thousand years, always mediocre. Causing the Immortal Ark to deteriorate day by day, getting worse and worse. The Celestial Pivot Court really deserves to die."</p><p></p><p>"The sky of the Immortal Ark is about to change. We brothers should make plans early. Maybe we can take this opportunity to get rid of this sinful body..."</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at each other and saw the ambition in each other's hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, the whispers stopped in the empty and uninhabited realm.</p><p></p><p>When they returned to the original valley, they became silent and looked resentful.</p><p></p><p>After reporting back to Elder Gou, they came to live in the wooden house in the valley.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of one hundred cultivators living here.</p><p></p><p>Every once in a while, some of them would go out to the Immortal Ark to collect relics of world destruction.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Immortal Ark seemed extremely afraid of the dark starry sea outside, and every time before carrying out a mission, they looked uneasy.</p><p></p><p>And indeed, the casualty rate for collecting relics was very high.</p><p></p><p>It was not that they suffered any substantial damage in the starry sea outside the Immortal Ark, but every time they went out, the lifespan of the Immortal Ark people seemed to be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator surnamed Zhao, Zhao Tianjiang, after going out twice, the wrinkles on his face were obviously deeper.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I haven't seen any young cultivators here, they are all middle-aged and elderly people." Li Fan suddenly realized in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The hundred or so people in the valley did not cultivate on weekdays.</p><p></p><p>In addition to undertaking the task of going out to collect relics, they did not have to do anything else.</p><p></p><p>From their daily chats, Li Fan also collected a lot of information about the Immortal Ark.</p><p></p><p>This valley was called 【Guilt Valley】 by them, a place of exile for cultivators who had violated the laws of the Immortal Ark but whose crimes were not punishable by death.</p><p></p><p>Collecting relics of world destruction was to eliminate the sins on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>When they had made amends for their crimes, they could leave this place and live a normal life again.</p><p></p><p>In their hopeful words, Li Fan glimpsed the daily life of the people of the Immortal Ark.</p><p></p><p>All matters, big and small, in the Immortal Ark were under the jurisdiction of the 【Celestial Pivot Court】.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people of the Immortal Ark did not have to worry about survival, as the Celestial Pivot Court provided a fixed amount of living materials every year.</p><p></p><p>But it was just barely enough to satisfy survival.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Ark, there was strict control over the total population and the number of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Not only did procreation of the next generation require approval, but even cultivation had only a fixed number of places.</p><p></p><p>In addition to obtaining the qualification for cultivation by drawing lots, it could also be obtained by making outstanding contributions to the Immortal Ark.</p><p></p><p>For example, going out to salvage relics of world destruction.</p><p></p><p>In this Guilt Valley, the vast majority of people had no cultivation.</p><p></p><p>That's why they had such great fear of going out.</p><p></p><p>In addition to ensuring their own safety, they could also identify which relics were qualified and could be exchanged for merit.</p><p></p><p>As for what the Celestial Pivot Court wanted these relics of world destruction for...</p><p></p><p>Naturally, these bottom-level people of the Immortal Ark would not be clear about it.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this Immortal Ark is even more divided than the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The information that can be gathered by staying here is limited.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"..., find a way to leave this place." </p><p></p><p>His current divine sense was too weak to withstand any consumption.</p><p></p><p>It was almost impossible for him to cross the celestial boat's void space on his own.</p><p></p><p>The green, formless paths in the void space would only appear with permission. Anyone who attempted to approach the void space without permission would be smashed to pieces and turned into nourishment for the celestial boat.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan's divine sense had been lurking, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, instead of an opportunity, he encountered a catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>It started when the three people nearby, including Zhao Tianjiang, suddenly fell ill.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhao Tianjiang thought he was just a bit tired and stayed in bed for several days.</p><p></p><p>Later, he couldn't sleep at all and began to feel itchy all over, unable to sit or stand still.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianjiang seemed to recall something, and his eyes were filled with endless fear.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't share this with others.</p><p></p><p>He even suppressed his discomfort, showed his face a few times in front of everyone, and voluntarily applied to go out and collect relics.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until later, when he couldn't stop coughing and black spots began to appear on his skin, that Zhao Tianjiang hid in his room and stopped coming out.</p><p></p><p>He held a jade tablet-like magic tool, doing something unknown.</p><p></p><p>Later, fresh blood began to flow from his seven orifices, and the smell of blood began to spread. The matter could no longer be concealed.</p><p></p><p>"Alas. Time is running out. It's better to send him back early to reunite with his family."</p><p></p><p>"Fate is truly unpredictable. Old Zhao had the best physique among us, yet he still couldn't avoid being infected with the void disease."</p><p></p><p>"He even concealed his physical condition for a while, just to earn more merit for Little Zhao before his death..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone sighed, showing a mournful expression.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the celestial boat sent someone to replace Zhao Tianjiang's position at the top of the Punishment Valley.</p><p></p><p>After Zhao Tianjiang's death, the other two cultivators who were with him also developed symptoms and died miserably not long after.</p><p></p><p>In the Punishment Valley, everyone lamented their bad luck.</p><p></p><p>However, only Li Fan knew that their successive deaths from the so-called void disease were likely due to the prolonged lurking of his divine sense nearby.</p><p></p><p>"The bodies of these celestial boat people..."</p><p></p><p>"They are so fragile. They can't even withstand this tiny bit of void aura carried by my divine sense. If my true body entered, wouldn't it be a devastating source of infection?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>Taking the lives of three people was not his intention.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had traversed more than half of the Darkest Star Sea and stayed in the void for too long.</p><p></p><p>His soul had likely been tainted by some mysterious forces in the void.</p><p></p><p>Although his soul was strong and not afraid of being infected by these mysterious forces, it was uncertain for these fragile celestial boat people.</p><p></p><p>In the Punishment Valley, it seemed like ten years passed in a day.</p><p></p><p>The entire celestial boat was like a stagnant pool, without any ripples.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity Li Fan's divine sense had been waiting for never came.</p><p></p><p>Until this day...</p><p></p><p>The usually stern Elder Gou suddenly changed his demeanor.</p><p></p><p>He summoned all the members of the Punishment Valley.</p><p></p><p>They were all pulled outside the valley, seemingly waiting for some important person to arrive.</p><p></p><p>The people in the valley were apprehensive, while Li Fan's divine sense detected a powerful aura rapidly approaching from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Harmonious Dao realm?"</p><p></p><p>"No, more than that. But it doesn't have the oppressive feeling of the Eternal Life realm."</p>

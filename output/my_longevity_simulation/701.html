        <h1>Chapter 701</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, the always open-minded Dongfang Yao, after connecting his consciousness to the Heaven's Mirror, watched as the over thirty thousand Qingxuan points that he and others had risked their lives to obtain were reduced to zero in an instant, his eyes turning red in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Huangfu! Is this reliable? How did you swallow all our credit?" With bulging veins on his neck, he looked ferocious.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Li Fan appeared much calmer.</p><p></p><p>After checking, he saw that during the time when the Heaven's Mirror disconnected from the Xuantian realm, the large number of Qingxuan points they had obtained from exploring the realm of life and death had indeed become empty.</p><p></p><p>"The change occurred after leaving the domain, only when connected to the Heaven's Mirror..." Li Fan pondered for a moment, then summoned the PuXian Truth Ship and pulled Huangfu and Dongfang, who were exposed to the devouring white mist, into the cabin.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, stay calm. It is fortunate that we are able to preserve our lives this time. If the Qingxuan points are gone, can we still earn them in the future?" Standing at the bow of the PuXian Truth Ship, Li Fan comforted the two while looking towards the nearby white mist.</p><p></p><p>There, within the thick white mist, in places beyond the reach of vision, it seemed that some changes were quietly occurring.</p><p></p><p>"No, we can't just let it go like this. Either the Heaven's Mirror made a mistake, or someone has swallowed our credit. I must go and demand an explanation!" Huangfu gnashed his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, picking on us, if I catch them, whoever stole our Qingxuan points..." Dongfang's eyes blazed with anger. His chest was heaving, clearly reaching the peak of frustration.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan stopped persuading further.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, the group naturally lost interest in further exploration. Moreover, their supplies had already been depleted considerably, and embarking on another adventure was not a wise decision. So, they hurriedly returned to Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for my news, I'll go find Master Ji immediately." Just after returning to the city, Huangfu couldn't wait and went to find Ji Hong.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang, on the other hand, found it hard to contain his anger. Even in the private room of the Discussion Building, he did not sit down. Instead, he paced back and forth, moving to stretch his body, bones cracking as he did so.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent. He ordered a cup of spiritual tea, drank it, then closed his eyes and waited.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Huangfu walked in looking desolate and lost.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the ground with blank eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Huangfu, what happened?" Dongfang noticed something was wrong but still asked insistently.</p><p></p><p>"It's gone, it's all gone..." Huangfu muttered softly.</p><p></p><p>"What's gone? Be clear in your words! You're making me anxious!" Dongfang yelled.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ji said that the realm of life and death we reported... doesn't exist." Somewhat recovering from Dongfang's outburst, Huangfu said intermittently, "There's no such place."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang was first stunned, then furious: "In broad daylight, how dare they talk nonsense? We experienced it firsthand, the mirror proves it..."</p><p></p><p>"I told Master Ji the same. But..." Huangfu's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"He asked me to take him to the realm of life and death again. But based on my memory, when we arrived there, the realm of life and death disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Dongfang was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>"There was only pure devouring white mist. What reversal of life and death grand formation, what silent death, sea of vitality, all seemed like an illusion we experienced..." A trace of confusion appeared in Huangfu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Did we really experience all that? Or were we influenced by the strange presence in the white mist, falling into an illusion?" Seeing his state, it seemed he was even questioning himself.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang opened his mouth as if wanting to say something but ultimately slumped down next to Huangfu, picked up a cup of spiritual tea, and gulped it down in frustration.</p><p></p><p>"Illusion? Hm..." A bright blue light shone in Li Fan's mind; the image of the 'Grand Reversal of Life and Death Formation' suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of illusion can create such a formation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was certain that their experiences in the realm of life and death were completely real.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, the official Wuxian Alliance denied the existence of such a place.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the upper echelons of the Alliance, or even the Heaven's Mirror, know the true identity of this Reverse Life and Death Heavenly Supreme. And it seems to be deeply involved. Since she herself has not appeared voluntarily in the world, the Alliance took the initiative to cover her traces."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed that after they left the realm of life and death, the Heaven's Mirror and the connection to the Xuantian Mirror, there were subtle fluctuations emanating from the place of the realm.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, it was at that time the realm was moved to another place.</p><p></p><p>"Such a method..."</p><p></p><p>"Intriguing."</p><p></p><p>More than thirty thousand Qingxuan points disappeared, but Li Fan, unlike Huangfu and Dongfang, did not grieve like a dead man.</p><p></p><p>"If things go as expected, the Alliance's compensation is already on the way."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it is necessary to play down major events and mitigate minor ones. Otherwise, if Huangfu and Dongfang get upset and start talking to people about this, it won't end well."</p><p></p><p>Having figured out this key point, Li Fan was content, leisurely drinking his cup of spirit tea, waiting calmly for visitors.</p><p></p><p>As expected, half a day later, there was a knock on the door of the private room.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" Huangfu and Dongfang both showed a hint of vigilance in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Before they could react, the door had already opened on its own. A black-robed cultivator with an unclear appearance suddenly stood before Li Fan and the others.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Dongfang's expression changed suddenly; his muscles tensed, entering a state of readiness for battle.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to act, he was shocked and forced to stop.</p><p></p><p>Because Dongfang saw the Heaven's Mirror fly out automatically from Huangfu's arms and land in front of the black-robed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator pointed lightly at the Heaven's Mirror, then said coldly, "So far, the mapped areas within the mist barrier have all been recorded here. If you want to explore more efficiently, head to those areas that are still blank."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, do not speak of things you shouldn't. Otherwise, no one will be able to save you."</p><p></p><p>"Take care of yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>With a slight flick of his fingers, a light orb flew towards Huangfu.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator's figure gradually twisted and distorted, disappearing slowly into the air.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu and Dongfang stared blankly at the light orb in front of them. After a long time, as if they finally understood something, cold sweat dripped from their foreheads, and their bodies trembled uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the two regained their composure.</p><p></p><p>They gave each other a knowing look, choosing not to mention the incident further.</p><p></p><p>As their consciousness examined the light orb, a faint joy appeared on Huangfu's pale face: "[Negation Exemption Talisman]!"</p>

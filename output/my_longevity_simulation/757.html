        <h1>Chapter 757</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I can see that due to the natural limitations of the materials they use, the smelting furnaces they employ can only accommodate a limited variety of demonic beasts. If we were to use our Pharmaceutical King's Divine Crucible instead, we might be able to increase the number of demonic beasts that can be smelted at once by several times."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, who knows what kind of monster could be refined."  </p><p>"I'm afraid even if Yushan and I joined forces, we might not be able to subdue it."</p><p></p><p>Liu San shook his head slightly: "It's like a poisonous drug, highly practical, but unfortunately with too many restrictions."</p><p></p><p>"It would be great if we could master the means to control the Battle Strength of the Dao Realm," Liu San suddenly sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's gaze focused, his expression unmoved. Following his words, he pondered: "What Elder Liu said makes some sense. In the current Xuanhuang Realm, there are all sorts of strange and wondrous things. It's possible there really exists a way to control Dao Realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"I'll inquire about it. If it's truly possible, then wouldn't our Pharmaceutical King Sect be able to regularly produce Dao Realm Battle Strengths every so often?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San couldn't help but feel a bit excited.  </p><p>"Although compared to the newly achieved Dao Realm, the killing power of these beast fusion cultivators will certainly be inferior. But no matter what, they are still at the Dao Realm. If there are enough of them, I think even if the Myriad Immortal Alliance wants to target us, they will have to think twice, right?"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, perhaps our Pharmaceutical King Sect could openly resurface in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai agreed: "It's not impossible to make plans for this."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Young Master. Elder Ruan is still in dormant sleep within the Pharmaceutical King's Divine Crucible. He has done quite a bit of research on demonic beast physiques. Why don't we wake him up? He might be able to find a corresponding solution." Liu San suggested.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p>Memories from Liu Yihang suddenly surfaced in his mind.</p><p>Ruan Tianxiao, one of the Dao Realm elders of the Pharmaceutical King Sect.  </p><p>Unlike the other elders who incorporated spirit plants into medicine, Ruan Tianxiao preferred to use animal, demonic beast, and human body tissues.</p><p>Although the effects were extraordinary, the aura of blood and killing was too intense, and it had a rather shocking and sensational feel.</p><p>Therefore, Ruan Tianxiao's "Flesh Pills" were not widely accepted.</p><p>He was also rather solitary, usually keeping to himself within the Pharmaceutical King Sect without close friends.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Xu Bai frowned and decided: "Elder Ruan has never gotten along well with others. I'm afraid that if he wakes up and suddenly finds himself thousands of years in the future, he may no longer wish to remain in our Pharmaceutical King Sect."</p><p></p><p>Liu San heard this and could not deny it: "That's a possibility."</p><p></p><p>"However, Elder Ruan's Flesh Pill techniques do have some unique insights. Myriad Manifestation Beast Fusion..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai also seemed conflicted: "Let's do this, wait until we have officially acquired the imperial techniques, then decide based on the specific circumstances."  </p><p></p><p>"If we can mass produce fusion beasts solely based on our own efforts, then there's no rush to wake Elder Ruan. If we encounter any insurmountable difficulties in the process, then we can call upon him. It won't be too late."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Xu Bai said this.</p><p>Liu San also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The interlude was over, Xu Bai still had to return to Tianliang State. Liu San also had to go back to the Pharmaceutical King Valley.</p><p>After the two parted ways, Xu Bai looked pensively in the direction Liu San had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Was this a probe? Or merely a coincidence?"</p><p>"Perhaps the previous incident made him sense something. After all, for a Dao Realm cultivator, even with the 'True Temptation Fruit' that possesses Heavenly Emperor's power..."</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The changes that have come cannot be resisted, but it is still possible to realize one's own abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan has always been decisive in his actions.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought emerged, the main body did not hesitate at all, and only left a message saying that he had an important matter to go out for.</p><p></p><p>He quietly left the Medicine King Valley before Liu San returned.</p><p></p><p>"It's best to ask the people of the Five Elders again to confirm the true efficacy of this fruit." A flash of brilliance appeared in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He temporarily put away the separation disc and rushed straight to Suo Feng's residence.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Bai, who had returned to Tianliang State, secretly found the cultivator from the Garrison Institute and the spy from the Five Elders with whom he had previously traded.</p><p></p><p>This person's name was Liu Wenyu.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu, I heard you haven't formed your own Heavenly Profound Spiritual Mirror yet?" Xu Bai opened with this question.</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloom flashed across Liu Wenyu's face, but he did not say anything out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he said with implication, "It's almost ready. Although there are still many cultivators in the Immortal Alliance who have reservations about the existence of the Heavenly Profound Spiritual Mirror and are unwilling to form one."</p><p></p><p>"But I heard the formal decision has already been made - all members of the Myriad Immortal Alliance must form a spiritual mirror within their bodies. Our Garrison Institute cultivators must be the first to complete this task. This is just the first step."</p><p></p><p>"I believe the day when all cultivators in the world possess a spiritual mirror will come soon."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, when that time comes..." </p><p></p><p>A flash of undisguised terror appeared in Liu Wenyu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I don't think it's a big deal. This thing is indeed extraordinary. With it, many troubles can be avoided," Xu Bai said with a slight smile, not taking it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? You've already formed one?" Liu Wenyu's expression changed, and he was about to retreat.</p><p></p><p>But he was grabbed by Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>The "Apocalypse Disc" suddenly appeared, emitting a faint white light and enveloping the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be nervous, this mere Heavenly Profound Spiritual Mirror is not even worth our Covering Heaven Sect's attention," Xu Bai said arrogantly and directly.</p><p></p><p>"What Covering Heaven Sect, I don't understand what you're talking about." Liu Wenyu's face turned pale, and he hurriedly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He shook off Xu Bai's control and rushed to flee.</p><p></p><p>But after hearing Xu Bai's words, he abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"I've said it so clearly, can't you see it? As a spy of the Five Elders, your sense of smell is too dull."</p><p></p><p>Although the words were spoken calmly, they fell on Liu Wenyu's ears like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" He exclaimed on the spot, "We are completely powerless..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu's words were cut off, and his face turned ashen: "You're deceiving me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai chuckled lightly: "If what I said is a lie, then it shouldn't be long before people from the Garrison Institute of the Myriad Immortal Alliance come to execute us on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu, you might as well wait patiently. Since it has come to this, you won't be able to escape anyway."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu's expression kept changing, but in the end, he withdrew his steps and sat down in the room.</p><p></p><p>He waited anxiously, as if each day was a year.</p><p></p><p>But after half a day, there was still no movement outside.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu suddenly became doubtful and suspicious. He looked up at the "Apocalypse Disc" hovering above them and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Can this thing really shield the perception of the Heavenly Profound Spiritual Mirror?" His face was full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Covering Heaven Sect just an empty name?" Xu Bai said indifferently.</p>

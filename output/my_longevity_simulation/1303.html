        <h1>Chapter 1303</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was not an illusion of the Xuanhuang cultivators, but the sky had truly collapsed!</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, an unprecedented and magnificent sound, like exploding thunder, resounded throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah ah!" As if their heads were directly hit by a muffled stick, countless cultivators saw darkness before their eyes and nearly lost consciousness and fainted.</p><p></p><p>The buzzing tinnitus did not subside for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It was a tremor originating from the spirit and soul, and even blocking the five senses was futile.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who looked up at the sky all found, without exception, that the sky seemed to be within reach.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the concentration of spiritual energy in the world had just experienced an extremely obvious decline.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang wind and rain also weakened considerably as a part of the power was drawn out from the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators in the world did not understand the reason for such a terrifying phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Only those few standing at the pinnacle of power in the Xuanhuang realm understood what these phenomena represented.</p><p></p><p>In a peculiar space.</p><p></p><p>Five statues with indiscernible features formed a circle.</p><p></p><p>The statues lowered their heads, looking down at the center.</p><p></p><p>There, a glowing cloud representing the current Xuanhuang realm quietly floated.</p><p></p><p>All the changes in the Xuanhuang realm since the start of the war were displayed in the cloud in great detail.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as the sky collapsed and the earth sank, the Xuanhuang cloud also slowly squirmed, almost shrinking by a circle.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, they really paid a heavy price this time." A somewhat frivolous female voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"We're just going to watch? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity..." One of the statues suddenly came to life, revealing its true appearance.</p><p></p><p>Long hair like silk, smoothly falling to the waist.</p><p></p><p>A long, tight white robe tightly wrapped her voluptuous figure, yet somehow exposed her fair thighs.</p><p></p><p>With a dazed look in her eyes, she placed her slender fingers on her lips and said to the other four statues.</p><p></p><p>"What if we don't just watch? Don't tell me we should help that emperor of unknown origin?" A cold voice came from the statue wearing a Taoist robe.</p><p></p><p>"I was moved when I heard the emperor's new teachings. The emperor can be considered my teacher. If possible, I really want to lend a hand. It's just a pity..." The statue that looked like a scholar also came to life, looked up at the sky beyond Xuanhuang, and sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The struggle for orthodoxy in Xuanhuang is actually irrelevant to us. The emperor's ambition to spread his teachings is evident, and this emperor of unknown background is probably not a good person either. The Xuanhuang realm, and even this starry sea, are not places for long-term residence. Everyone, our future hope still lies in Wuyou. Maintaining stability between us and the Wanxian Alliance and the stability of the Xuanhuang realm, and waiting for the final result to come out, is what we should do. Participating in this conflict is really not a wise move." A statue whose features remained unclear spoke deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover... it's impossible for the Dharma Emperor to lose." The statue added.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the four statues all focused on the Wuyou Heavenly Venerate who still seemed to be asleep.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao said with some wistfulness, "Ah, I wanted to take this opportunity to tease those people from the Wanxian Alliance. After all, they are all fresh faces, so exciting."</p><p></p><p>The scholar, the Taoist, and the statue with unclear features all pretended not to hear.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on heaven and earth indeed has great flaws. As the Xuanhuang realm drew out power to assist, I also became much weaker." Senior Sister Zhao covered her fragrant lips with her hand, yawned, and said lazily.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going back to recuperate. Call me if there's anything."</p><p></p><p>The scholar statue laughed lightly, "Still couldn't resist going to join in the excitement."</p><p></p><p>"A thousand people have a thousand faces, and Zhao Ruoxi has at least ten thousand. It's normal for her to have some split personality and not be able to control herself." The Taoist statue said bluntly, "Let her go, it's not that easy for her to die even if she wants to."</p><p></p><p>After Senior Sister Zhao left, the statue with unclear features suddenly came to life.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a middle-aged cultivator with a square face and a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Land of Bliss, after so many years of development, has already spread to the edge of the starry sea and begun to infiltrate the high walls."</p><p></p><p>"Now is the most critical moment."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the final outcome, this sudden outbreak of fighting is beneficial and harmless to us. At the very least, there are many casualties... After this, there will be a huge supplement of power from the Land of Bliss. Perhaps Wuyou can take this opportunity to break through the restraints of the high walls." The square-faced cultivator said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the sealing power of the high walls on a consciousness space like the Land of Bliss is much weaker than on physical power."</p><p></p><p>With these words from the square-faced cultivator, a strange atmosphere also flowed in the field.</p><p></p><p>However, Wuyou, who carried the hope of the five Heavenly Venerates to escape, still remained in peaceful slumber. It's just that his occasionally twitching eyebrows revealed the possible intense fluctuations in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the Taoist statue spoke, "Outside the high walls... it's not a peaceful place either. From the batch of people who escaped back then and now want to escape back, it's evident. It's just a pity that the high walls are difficult to cross. It's the same inside and outside the walls."</p><p></p><p>"Even if this plan is ultimately successful, and we finally use the power of the Land of Bliss's dream to successfully escape the high walls, without the power of the laws of the Xuanhuang realm as a foundation, our strength will also greatly decline. The Merged Dao realm, outside the high walls, I'm afraid it will be difficult to take a single step."</p><p></p><p>The square-faced cultivator said in a deep voice again, "Even if there is any danger, what will be lost is only the body in the dream. For the true self, it will not harm the muscles and bones. However, if outside the high walls is truly a paradise, then we can use the dream body to cultivate from then on. Gradually transfer the power of the true self."</p><p></p><p>"When the dream body completely condenses in reality and its strength surpasses the true self, we can use this to swap and successfully shed our mortal coils!"</p><p></p><p>The scholar statue, listening to the conversation between the two, nodded slightly, "It is indeed the most reliable method we can think of at present. If it weren't for the Dharma Emperor's terrifying strength and his unwillingness to let go of this small piece of land in the Xuanhuang realm, we wouldn't have to be so stifled."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist statue said, "If that's the case, then let's each add a few more torches. The denser the power of Wuyou, the better. As long as it doesn't endanger the Xuanhuang realm, no matter how many die, it's all the same."</p><p></p><p>Just as they were discussing, it seemed that a gust of wind blew from outside the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang light sphere in the center of the five statues visibly produced a slight sway.</p><p></p><p>The three eternal Heavenly Venerates all flashed a trace of shock in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Emperor being so domineering can still be understood. After all, he has lived for so many years."</p><p></p><p>"This emperor who emerged out of nowhere is also so terrifying? Even if he obtained the assistance of the Xuanhuang realm, it shouldn't be to this extent, right?"</p><p></p><p>The three Heavenly Venerates looked at each other, feeling doubtful and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>As for the Wuyou Heavenly Venerate, he slept even more sweetly.</p><p></p><p>"Body transformation..."</p><p></p><p>A vast and extreme power suddenly surged into his body, and the Holy Emperor let out a shout.</p><p></p><p>Purple, gold, and mysterious yellow, multiple colors merged, and the Holy Emperor's figure disappeared under the Dharma Emperor's giant palm.</p><p></p><p>In its place was an endless scene of the mysterious yellow heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang realm, a realm of land.</p><p></p><p>Although it had been stitched together and integrated with many other remnant immortal cultivation realms, its scale ultimately had an upper limit.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the mysterious yellow heaven and earth suppressed by the Dharma Emperor's giant palm was endless, with no end in sight.</p><p></p><p>The sky was high and the earth was vast, and the scenery between heaven and earth changed.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the distance between heaven and earth also slowly increased.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible giant stood between the earth and the sky.</p><p></p><p>Continuously lifting the sky upward.</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious yellow changes, heaven and earth are infinite!"</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious yellow of the past, the mysterious yellow of the present, the mysterious yellow of the future!"</p><p></p><p>"Gather!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's voice resounded through the illusory mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>As heaven and earth expanded, it became increasingly sonorous.</p><p></p><p>Past, present, future.</p><p></p><p>The infinite space-time of the mysterious yellow realm merged into one at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless illusory images, layered upon layered, seemed to be forcibly dragged out from the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Forming an unprecedented and eternally vast space-time.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Emperor's giant palm pressing down was propped up by the endless sky. Trembling violently, it could no longer advance further.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of the eternal mysterious yellow realm had no end.</p><p></p><p>At a speed even faster than when it shrank, under the reverse pressure of the immeasurable mysterious yellow light, the Dharma Emperor's giant palm instantly became only the size of a normal person again.</p><p></p><p>The large and small spaces returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Even with the flowing light and shadows on his body, with the Dao being extinguished and reborn, he could not heal this black mark.</p><p></p><p>Opposite the Dharma Emperor, the illusory image of the eternal mysterious yellow realm illuminated this dark and desolate starry space.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the world had truly given birth to this supreme immortal realm that existed in the past, exists now, and will exist forever.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Emperor's gaze left the wound on his hand and shifted to the vast scene in front.</p><p></p><p>Mountains towered, and fertile soil stretched for billions of miles. Strange creatures and wondrous scenes were too numerous to count.</p><p></p><p>It was like the legendary immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the mysterious yellow realm before him, the Dharma Emperor was actually slightly dazed.</p><p></p><p>A ray of starlight burst open in the sky of the eternal mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a starlight robe, a nine-heaven jade crown on his head, and stepping on the river of time.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor slowly walked out from the eternal mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>It was like coming from a painting into reality.</p><p></p><p>Illusion and reality twisted and intertwined at this moment, making it difficult to distinguish between true and false.</p><p></p><p>It even vaguely gave rise to an extremely strong sense of contradiction.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The law of time?" The Dharma Emperor's voice was somewhat surprised and somewhat in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>However, after just a moment, he shook his head slightly, denying his previous guess.</p><p></p><p>The black scar on his hand not only did not improve with the passage of time but instead became more and more severe, even showing a tendency to spread to other parts.</p><p></p><p>For his supreme body, this was simply an unbelievable matter.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Emperor could vaguely sense that what was constantly gnawing at his palm was not a power related to the years.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>A predetermined fact.</p><p></p><p>No matter how time passed or the starry sea was born and died.</p><p></p><p>This wound would not change.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor who walked out from the eternal mysterious yellow realm did not give the Dharma Emperor any chance to catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the echoing voice of the Holy Emperor, one after another illusory figure also wearing starlight robes walked out from the eternal mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>Their features were indiscernible, and even the moves they used were vastly different from the Holy Emperor's.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, they all regarded the Dharma Emperor as an enemy.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, they fought on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Some used fists and feet, some used talismans and registers, and some used flying swords.</p><p></p><p>Their Daoist methods and divine powers were all illusory scenes. They also seemed ordinary and did not have any special power.</p><p></p><p>But even without substantial impact on the Dharma Emperor's body, they still caused damage to the Dharma Emperor.</p><p></p><p>All the wounds were exactly the same as the black circular mark on his palm before.</p><p></p><p>And in front of the vast and boundless eternal mysterious yellow realm that seemed to be still constantly expanding, the Dharma Emperor's power also seemed to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Facing the endless and tireless illusory incarnations, the Dharma Emperor could only wearily defend.</p><p></p><p>Even if he killed them in an instant, soon, an even greater number of illusory incarnations would fly out from the eternal mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, these incarnations were bound to bring a trace of damage to the Dharma Emperor before they died.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just a trace, they were all fatal wounds that could not be healed!</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the black scars on the Dharma Emperor's body became more and more.</p><p></p><p>Under the reflection of the terrifying black energy, the Dharma Emperor's benevolent face appeared somewhat ferocious.</p><p></p><p>In such a critical situation, the Dharma Emperor still did not panic.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering the essence of this illusory mysterious yellow realm before him.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Emperor's comprehension was beyond doubt.</p><p></p><p>To be able to create a cultivation method that went against the principles of heaven and earth and attain eternal life...</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes a fierce battle between two powerful cultivators, Chuanfa and the Holy Emperor, in a mysterious realm called the Eternal Primordial World. Here's a summary of the key points:</p><p></p><p>- Chuanfa is impressed by the Holy Emperor's talent and ability to quickly comprehend and counter his attacks. </p><p></p><p>- The Holy Emperor uses a powerful technique called the Eternal Primordial World, creating a realm between illusion and reality. Chuanfa senses it holds the key to reviving the Xuanhuang World and crossing the high walls, but can't fully grasp it.</p><p></p><p>- Chuanfa counterattacks by summoning the remnants of destroyed worlds, which start to damage the Eternal Primordial World. </p><p></p><p>- The Holy Emperor uses a mysterious light that dissolves the dead worlds into pure energy, protecting himself. This light comes from a white ring he obtained.</p><p></p><p>- At an impasse, Chuanfa asks to examine the white ring, thinking it may help break the high walls, but is disappointed. He returns it without any trickery.</p><p></p><p>- Chuanfa questions the Holy Emperor's identity and motives, suspecting a conspiracy and a hidden mastermind behind their conflict. </p><p></p><p>- He proposes they join forces to uncover this shadowy figure first, worried what they may do to the Xuanhuang World if Chuanfa and the Holy Emperor fight to mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>- As the Holy Emperor recounts his mysterious origins and heritage, Chuanfa notices some clues. The atmosphere between them starts to shift from murderous to harmonious as they consider working together against the real threat.</p><p></p><p>In summary, it depicts a pivotal moment where two powerful rivals start to question the forces pitting them against each other and contemplate an alliance against the true enemy orchestrating events from the shadows. The excerpt builds intrigue around the mysterious mastermind and the heroes' origins.</p>

            <p>Li Fan's loud voice echoed in the space. </p><p></p><p>Bai Yu’s questioning heart platform was silent, with no response at all. </p><p></p><p>The old man carefully looked at Li Fan again and continued to ask, "Do you know where you were previously dormant? And approximately when did you wake up?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face showed a displeased expression, but he still replied in a deep voice, "Near the Misty Cloud Sea, in an underground cave. As for the time, it should be about twenty-six days ago." </p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment," the old man smiled and said, then closed his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan patiently waited on the heart questioning platform. </p><p></p><p>A whole day passed, and Li Fan began to show signs of impatience. </p><p></p><p>"Isn't it done yet, old man?!" </p><p></p><p>"It's really getting worse. Back in the days when we selected disciples in Tianji Sect, it wasn't this troublesome..." he muttered under his breath. </p><p></p><p>After a while, the old man opened his eyes. </p><p></p><p>"After confirmation, a cultivator did fly out of the Hundred Stones Cave Heaven a few days ago." </p><p></p><p>"However, friend, don't worry, there's one last step to go through." </p><p></p><p>The old man showed a smile of apology. Following his words, an ancient bronze mirror appeared above Li Fan’s head. </p><p></p><p>A faint green light shot out, enveloping Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>"Here it comes..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved slightly, but he remained calm. </p><p></p><p>With the former technique, the Furnace All-in-One Move, and the secret technique "Concealing the Sky with One Hand," he was enough to deceive the upgraded version of the Tianxuan Mirror, the Mysterious Net. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the added Seven Senses Lingering Heart, the verification was only a clone of the Tianxuan Mirror. </p><p></p><p>The possibility of exposure was minimal. </p><p></p><p>As expected, after a while, the Tianxuan Mirror retracted the green light and disappeared. </p><p></p><p>The old man's expression became even more friendly, "Welcome, friend, to join our Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance!" </p><p></p><p>"As time passes, everything changes. During the years you were asleep, many significant events happened in the world." </p><p></p><p>"If you have any needs, our Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance can send specialists to assist you in adapting to the present life as quickly as possible..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, "I appreciate the kindness! However, before coming here, I had some interactions with He Zhenghao from the Luli Island. I already have a good understanding of many matters of your Alliance." </p><p></p><p>The old man nodded, "That's even better. Your identity information has been recorded, and you can now move freely." </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan took his leave. </p><p></p><p>"By the way, friend, remember, going forward, you must change your address. It's not 'your Alliance' anymore, but 'our Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance'." The old man said with a smile, hinting at something profound. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused for a moment, didn't reply, and left directly. </p><p></p><p>Leaving the central area of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island, he came to the Tianxuan Mirror. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the seemingly ordinary and harmless mirror in front of him, Li Fan couldn't help but recall the green giant net that would shroud the entire Xuanhuang Realm in the future. </p><p></p><p>After gazing for a long time, Li Fan took a deep breath and walked into the mirror. </p><p></p><p>"Ancient cultivator Li Fan, welcome to the future!" </p><p></p><p>The familiar mechanical voice of the Tianxuan Mirror rang out. </p><p></p><p>After that, there was a series of introductions by the Tianxuan Mirror. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to listen attentively, trying out each function. </p><p></p><p>After a while, the voice of the Tianxuan Mirror disappeared. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his remaining contribution balance. </p><p></p><p>"10,000 points." </p><p></p><p>"It's surprisingly generous. I remember back when I was in the late Foundation Establishment stage, I only received 1,000 points." </p><p></p><p>"Or is it that senior cultivators have additional privileges for surrendering?" </p><p></p><p>Shaking his head inwardly, he put this trivial matter aside. </p><p></p><p>After searching through the list of cultivation techniques in the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan took out a pile of jade slips from his storage ring to sell. </p><p></p><p>These were many cultivation techniques he had obtained from the Hundred Stones Cave Heaven. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, all of these techniques were unique copies. </p><p></p><p>Originally, there were a total of twenty Foundation Establishment techniques and ten Core Formation techniques. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept three of each for future use, and sold the rest. </p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror offered an average purchase price of 13,000 points for Foundation Establishment techniques and 85,000 points for Core Formation techniques. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan's account balance became 826,000 contribution points. </p><p></p><p>"Buying and selling techniques is still the quickest way to earn, effortlessly surpassing what I earned over the years from the Mingyue Palace." </p><p></p><p>"It's truly a necessity." Li Fan couldn't help but sigh. </p><p></p><p>"More than 800,000 contribution points are enough for a while. But it's still not sufficient..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan was at the middle stage of Core Formation currently. </p><p></p><p>In eight years, at the age of 16, the Five Elements Grand Cave Heaven would be discovered, and later relocated to the heartland of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. </p><p></p><p>By the age of 36, the Heavenly Spirit Region would reveal the reappearance of the Five Elements Cave Heaven, once again attracting the attention of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. </p><p></p><p>In other words, Li Fan had only 20 years left. </p><p></p><p>Time was pressing, and he needed to advance to the late stage of Core Formation within eight years. </p><p></p><p>Only then would he qualify to plan for the realm of the Heavenly Spirit Region. </p><p></p><p>From the middle to late stage of Core Formation in eight years. </p><p></p><p>Given Li Fan's cultivation aptitude, it was somewhat difficult. </p><p></p><p>So naturally, he had to use some means. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at himself in the mirror. </p><p></p><p>It wasn't his original appearance at twenty years old. Instead, he appeared as a middle-aged man in his forties or fifties. </p><p></p><p>This was achieved through the "Extraordinary Transformation of True Spirits." </p><p></p><p>"Disguising oneself gives a unique sense of security in this heavily perilous Xuanhuang Realm. If things go wrong, it's just a matter of changing identities." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly and purchased the materials needed to refine his clone through the mirror. </p><p></p><p>Then, using a transmission array, he arrived at Tai'an Island. </p><p></p><p>Guarding Tai'an Island with the Undifferentiated Killing Intent, he locked onto Zhou Qing-ang, a spy within the Five Elders Council. </p><p></p><p>Pretending to leave Tai'an Island, but in reality not going far, he lurked underwater. </p><p></p><p>Following discreetly, he arrived at an uninhabited sea area. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly activating the Binding Insect technique, he captured him. </p><p></p><p>Taking him to the underwater, he dug a hidden chamber as usual. </p><p></p><p>Without much ado, Li Fan lightly pointed, and the Illusion Dream of Cloud and Water technique was activated. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing-ang immediately fell into a deep sleep. </p><p></p><p>Based on past experiences, Li Fan knew that Zhou Qing-ang's soul housed a special restriction from the Five Elders Council. </p><p></p><p>If he forcefully probed his soul, it would trigger the restriction, causing his soul to scatter. </p><p></p><p>So this time, Li Fan adopted a different method. By constructing a false dream world, he could peek into the depths of his heart. </p><p></p><p>Slowly, a slight smile crept onto Zhou Qing-ang's lips. </p><p></p><p>In the dream, he lurked in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance for hundreds of years. </p><p></p><p>Starting from the grassroots and advancing to the Nascent Soul stage, he finally became the lord of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island. </p><p></p><p>Subsequently, through his inside and outside help, the Five Elders Council launched a massive attack and conquered the entire Misty Cloud Sea within a few days. </p><p></p><p>And Zhou Qing-ang, having fulfilled his duties, returned triumphantly to his hometown. </p><p></p><p>"The Land of Gentlemen?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Zhou Qing-ang, who was now deeply immersed in an unbreakable dream, pondering deeply.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 468</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On the shelf, things resembling books were neatly stacked in different categories.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan took out one of them.</p><p></p><p>Holding it in his hand and examining it for a moment, Li Fan discovered that this so-called "book" was actually alive.</p><p></p><p>Although it was completely still, Li Fan keenly sensed a unique aura emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized that when they were stored in the storage ring, they were in a state of hibernation similar to death. But once they were removed from the storage ring and came into contact with the outside world, they regained vitality.</p><p></p><p>Upon flipping open the "book," rays of light shone from the pages, converging in the air.</p><p></p><p>The scene was filled with numerous densely packed small characters and drawings.</p><p></p><p>Written in the universal text of the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan carefully discerned that it contained information about the exotic beast "Dark Antique Praying Mantis." From body structure to living habits, and even the specific value of each part of the Dark Antique Praying Mantis's body, as well as methods for nurturing and propagating them, everything was included, making it a versatile encyclopedia.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned another page, and the lights flickered and condensed once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, it displayed various information about the exotic beast "Ink Divine Fish."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan changed to another book only to find that it also contained information about different exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"In our world, there is a type of exotic beast called the 'Bookworm,' which feeds on text and images. By using a special method to turn them into books, we can reproduce the text and images they have devoured, thereby achieving massive data storage," Qing explained to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"In this storage ring is a summary of the empire's research on exotic beasts over thousands of years. It contains information on all the exotic beasts in our world, except for a few whose data will be completed at the time of the final trade," Qing added.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slowly and continued to browse through several books before carefully putting away the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Having data alone is not enough; physical objects are also needed. This is the second part of the Imperial Exchange," Qing took out a red square wooden box and handed it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Sensing it faintly with his divine sense, Li Fan understood the purpose of the wooden box in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Although looking only the size of a palm, inside it were countless different spaces partitioned off.</p><p></p><p>Each space contained ten of the same type of exotic beast.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be frozen, all in a state of stillness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could tell that these exotic beasts still retained vital signs.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the adult forms of the exotic beasts, Li Fan also found numerous dormant juvenile forms in the space.</p><p></p><p>Embryos, eggs, or tiny juveniles were all present in the space.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Life-Sealing Treasure Box,' containing exotic beasts corresponding to the information in the first storage ring," Qing explained with a hint of pride. </p><p></p><p>"With these two storage rings, as long as a suitable environment is found, a large-scale cultivation of exotic beasts can be realized again."</p><p></p><p>"If enough resources are invested, it is not difficult to recreate the magnificence of the empire of today," Qing added.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stored away the 'Life-Sealing Treasure Box,' expressing satisfaction, "With the contents of these two storage rings, I can also report back to the organization. However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shifted topics, "Although the items you have provided are indeed valuable, they do not contribute much to actual combat power. The World's Alliance is still hoping for some technical support that can be helpful in battles with the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"For example, the kind of armor exhibited by this young brother earlier, similar to a beast transformation," Li Fan pointed at Li Chenfeng, his gaze sharp as he looked at Qing.</p><p></p><p>Qing smiled enchantingly, "I knew you would be keen on that this time."</p><p></p><p>"Coincidentally, this is our third part of the trade and so far, the final part."</p><p></p><p>Qing extended his right hand, and a blood-red, constantly pulsating round bead appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Beast Soul Bead. Even an ordinary mortal can absorb the soul of an exotic beast sealed within and summon the 'Beast God Armor,' unleashing combat power equivalent to that of an exotic beast," Qing explained.</p><p></p><p>Qing then handed over another storage ring.</p><p></p><p>This time, it didn't have any special engravings on it, just an ordinary ring.</p><p></p><p>"Inside are a thousand Beast Soul Beads. Five hundred of them store the strength equivalent to a Foundation-Building stage cultivator's exotic beasts. There are another four hundred and ninety storing the strength equivalent to a Golden Core stage cultivator's exotic beasts."</p><p></p><p>"As for the remaining, nine of them contain the soul of the 'Red Profound Whale,' equivalent to the strength of a Nascent Soul stage cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"As for the last one..."</p><p></p><p>Qing hesitated for a moment before saying, "It is the Imperial extract of the 'Nine-Headed Divine Bird,' made into a bead."</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically, it can stimulate the 'Beast God Armor' equivalent to a Nascent Soul stage cultivator. But the Nine-Headed Bird is naturally ferocious, even in death for thousands of years, its hostility remains. Although the empire successfully made several Beast Soul Beads using it as raw material, so far, no one has survived the refining process. They either go insane or die."</p><p></p><p>"If the Alliance wishes to try, it is best to select individuals with strong wills."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, the power of the exotic beasts conflicts with the spiritual power of cultivators. The higher the cultivation, the greater the resistance one faces when refining the Beast Soul Bead. To fully unleash its power, it is better to use it on pure mortals," Qing added.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" Li Fan displayed a hint of joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The World's Alliance sees your sincerity! I believe that after I report back, deeper cooperation will soon begin."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the methods of making Beast Soul Beads and the techniques for controlling beasts are things the organization is looking forward to," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>Qing's expression remained unchanged as he said in a solemn tone, "When the trade is finally completed and the empire completely breaks away from the Xuanhuang Realm, all of this will be handed over to your alliance."</p><p></p><p>"I am already looking forward to that day!" Li Fan put away the storage ring containing a thousand Beast Soul Beads.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the secret room, he took flight.</p><p></p><p>"When I find a suitable place for you, I will come back for a trade," he informed the people of the empire below.</p><p></p><p>"We will be responsible for receiving and transferring personnel," he added.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the people of the empire below, and through sound transmission, said, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>Qing readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and then vanished in the air.</p><p></p><p>Instead of returning to the Immortal Island, he went directly to the Island of the Flesh Incarnation.</p><p></p><p>"Young Junior Brother, please protect me," Li Fan requested as he arrived where Tian Yang was practicing the "Heavenly Concealment" secret technique with a puzzled expression, pausing his cultivation upon hearing Li Fan's words.</p>

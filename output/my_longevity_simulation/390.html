        <h1>Chapter 390</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After the calm sea, thunderous applause erupted on the giant Du Chen boat.</p><p></p><p>The formation masters and many co-builders witnessed the incredible power of the creation they had painstakingly worked on for years, unable to contain their excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also clapped enthusiastically, his face filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>However, a thought popped up in his mind that he couldn't suppress.</p><p></p><p>Would the Ten Thousand Immortals League really let them, the creators of the formation, live after the success?</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Li Fan was overly suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"The tranquility is the general's decision, and the general should not see the tranquility," is a common practice throughout history.</p><p></p><p>After mortal emperors built tombs, they would slaughter all the craftsmen involved in construction to prevent leaks.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had little confidence in the Ten Thousand Immortals League.</p><p></p><p>If they were only monitoring the formation, perhaps the formation masters responsible for the construction still had a chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>But now, as the Locking Spirit Formation showed such power...</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine what secrets this formation had hidden in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the actual power of the Locking Spirit Formation, the more slim the chances of survival for the formation masters.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps my expectation of the Ten Thousand Immortals League delaying my death is related to this."</p><p></p><p>"As we are all destined to die in the end, why go to such lengths. New69book.com"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan's heart grew colder.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was contemplating future strategies, the exclamations of the crowd refocused his attention on the empty space below.</p><p></p><p>After the big explosion, apart from the giant blue network of the Locking Spirit Formation, the location of the Five Elements Grand Immortal Land was now completely empty.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, visible energy fluctuations were erupting from various nodes of the Locking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>"That is, the Five Elements energy?"</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing it, Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Using the void as a canvas and the various elemental energies previously absorbed as pigments.</p><p></p><p>The Locking Spirit Formation, like a precise machine, slowly reconstructed the destroyed Five Elements Grand Immortal Land bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>This process, tantamount to creation, unfolded unabashedly in front of everyone from the Ten Thousand Immortals League.</p><p></p><p>The sea waves were rolling, towering trees were growing rapidly, and flames were raging...</p><p></p><p>All the scenes within the Five Elements Grand Immortal Land from the past were rapidly reappearing beyond Li Fan's cognition.</p><p></p><p>This magnificent scene captivated the minds of all the cultivators on the Du Chen boat.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to make any noise, they were afraid of disturbing the great creation of the Locking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, a completely new Five Elements Grand Immortal Land appeared in the world. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>Remodeled by the Tian Xuan Mirror, although it seemed somewhat smaller than before, it had restored the original balance of the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>After completing this masterpiece, the Locking Spirit Formation slowly disappeared from everyone's view like actors after the curtain call.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only a group of Ten Thousand Immortals League cultivators looking silent and stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This method..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, suppressing his shock and agitation, and quickly analyzed rationally.</p><p></p><p>"It's different from true creation. It's not about creating something out of nothing but about the reorganization of matter."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this newly created immortal land seems to lack living beings, only a domain where spiritual energy is reorganized."</p><p></p><p>"Nevertheless, the power displayed by the Locking Spirit Formation is also extremely terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have deciphered the unity of the Five Elements and then carried out reverse engineering."</p><p></p><p>"The empty Five Elements Grand Immortal Land without any living beings, the inexplicable imbalance of attributes, the 【Eternal Gold of Eons】 prepared in advance, and the strict order to complete the formation building before the unity of the Five Elements..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the explosion in this area was intentional. The purpose was to enable the Tian Xuan Mirror to complete the 【Transformation of the Five Elements】."</p><p></p><p>As if confirming Li Fan's speculation, after the new Five Elements Grand Immortal Land was completed, many black-clothed cultivators flew out from the Du Chen boat.</p><p></p><p>They each flew towards different immortal lands, where they resettled the Five Elements living beings originally transferred.</p><p></p><p>Soon, this newly created immortal land gradually became vibrant again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a message came from the Supervising Heavenly Record, announcing that the Locking Spirit Formation in the Five Elements Grand Immortal Land had been completed successfully, and the Du Chen boat would return to the Tian Chen Prefecture for a three-day celebration event.</p><p></p><p>They had prepared many rare spirit foods and teas for everyone to enjoy for free.</p><p></p><p>During the rest period, they could still build formations within the Five Elements Grand Immortal Land, increasing their points in the Great Comparison at a uniform fixed rate.</p><p></p><p>"The Locking Spirit Formation is not fully constructed at the moment, so there should not be an immediate threat to life." Li Fan looked at the discussions among the cultivators and thought that it was not yet time for a death sentence.</p><p></p><p>While pondering, Li Fan suddenly perceived some movement in a certain item in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Without showing any sign, he quietly entered the Du Chen boat, found an unmanned cabin, and took out the item.</p><p></p><p>It was the key to controlling the White Bone Preliminary Realm, the left hand of the White Bone.</p><p></p><p>Faint ripples were emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Feeling it slightly, Li Fan's expression suddenly became somewhat absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, fellow Daoist. I couldn't reach you through 【Seeking Immortality】, so I had to inform you through this method."</p><p></p><p>"The thirty-year lease term is up. Does the White Bone Preliminary Realm need to renew the lease?"</p><p></p><p>"If so, please contact me before the expiration date."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the previous key will lose its effect and you won't be able to enter the White Bone Preliminary Realm again."</p><p></p><p>"The remnants and scenes left in the Preliminary Realm will be temporarily preserved for you for three months."</p><p></p><p>"Three months later, I will proceed with the clearance."</p><p></p><p>A somewhat familiar voice resonated in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was the true owner of the White Bone Preliminary Realm, the cultivator who called himself the 【Purple Mist Immortal Venerable】.</p><p></p><p>Nine years ago, Li Fan, in order to deceive the people leaving the realm, leased the use of the White Bone Preliminary Realm for thirty years from him.</p><p></p><p>Now, almost thirty-eight years had passed since the lease.</p><p></p><p>Purple Mist Immortal Venerable was inquiring about the renewal.</p><p></p><p>"The construction of the Tian Xuan Locking Spirit Formation began in the twenty-ninth year of the lease, and I didn't expect ten years to pass so quickly."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan temporarily did not reply to Purple Mist Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>When the Du Chen boat returned to the Tian Chen Prefecture and the group of cultivators indulged in a lavish and celebratory feast at the Thousand Stars Academy, Li Fan alone came to the Discussion Tower in the city.</p><p></p><p>Renting a private small courtyard, Li Fan casually arranged a protective formation, entered the White Bone Preliminary Realm, and left behind four Little Medicine King Cauldrons. Then, he activated the Five Elements Annihilation Sword, damaging all his arrangements. Following that, using his authority, he left behind an image in the Preliminary Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan returned to the real world and destroyed the left hand of the White Bone, severing the last connection with the Preliminary Realm.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, it was Lin Fan who purchased the Preliminary Realm."</p>

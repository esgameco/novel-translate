        <h1>Chapter 480</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The picture depicts the world of the valley where Xu Ke and Li Fan were previously, capturing the boundary-breaking whale.</p><p></p><p>On the walls of this room, there are no less than thirty scrolls of paintings.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan was that some of the scrolls seemed to be shrouded in a mysterious energy, blocking outsiders from probing. Even his "Destined Profound Bird" couldn't see the contents of the paintings clearly.</p><p></p><p>The green phoenix flew out of the scroll, gently placing Xu Ke on the ground. It then turned into a green light, disappearing into his arms.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke is back!" A young cultivator who was dozing off in the room suddenly showed joy and ran outside shouting.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the somewhat cramped room was instantly filled with a bunch of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that he's back. He should have successfully found that boundary-breaking whale, right?"</p><p></p><p>"The days of hardship are finally over!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, now that Xu Ke is back, that guy Lu Ya should follow suit, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Relying on having a strange beast, he bullies people everywhere! It's so despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"Liu Senior Brother, last time you sparred with Lu Ya, he didn't even summon that 'Sky Wuz' beast. You still ended up begging for mercy on the spot, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That was a mistake! If he comes again..."</p><p></p><p>"Shh! Lu Ya is coming!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>The previously boisterous crowd instantly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>They even voluntarily made way, allowing Lu Ya to walk in smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Blonde Lu Ya, expressionless, paid no attention to the various expressions of the cultivators around him, and went straight to Xu Ke who was sleeping soundly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze lingered on Li Fan for a moment, then gently landed on Xu Ke's face.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle wave, he lifted Xu Ke with Li Fan and left the room in large strides, and a tiger-bodied, human-faced monster suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Wuz..." The faint breath emanating from the figure made Li Fan feel a little uncomfortable, prompting him to instinctively shrink back into Xu Ke's hair.</p><p></p><p>The tiger-bodied, human-faced monster roared, Lu Ya leaped up and stood on its back.</p><p></p><p>The monster Sky Wuz looked around imperiously as if showing off, then flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"For the hospitality of the Divine Brush Sect for three years, Lu Ya is grateful!"</p><p></p><p>"There will be a substantial gratitude in the future; today I bid farewell, no need for further farewell!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya bowed downwards, speaking loudly.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the Divine Brush Sect's response, he swiftly disappeared into the sky with Sky Wuz.</p><p></p><p>"How arrogant! Just relying on the power of the Beast Control Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Lu Ya's cultivation level is already in the late stage of the Yuanying Realm. Plus, with that Sky Wuz beast, I think even the eldest senior brother may not be his opponent."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, it's because we are not competent ourselves. Can't we let the elders intervene?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, forget it, the Sect Master's demeanor is not even comparable to the eldest senior brother."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Fan vaguely heard some discussions below. But Lu Ya paid no attention, carrying Xu Ke and the others for flight.</p><p></p><p>The scenery below kept changing, traversing plains and mountains along the way.</p><p></p><p>After more than twenty days, the surrounding scenery finally became somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>They had returned to the territory of the Beast Control Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Without the existence of the White Mist Barrier, traveling around various places during the ancient times was much easier."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan faintly felt that the journey through the celestial realm was coming to an end.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Ke, who had been sleeping all the way, was finally awakened by Lu Ya.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Senior Brother Lu Ya?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke rubbed his eyes in confusion, seeing Lu Ya standing straight ahead, his clothes fluttering in the wind, he asked in confusion, "Where is this?" Thinking he was still dreaming, Xu Ke looked around.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gave him a fierce scratch, and Xu Ke suddenly became alert.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Beast Control Sect! I'm back!" Recognizing the surroundings, Xu Ke jumped out excitedly.</p><p></p><p>A trace of a smile appeared on Lu Ya's face.</p><p></p><p>He patted Xu Ke's head and inquired about his three-year experience of finding the boundary-breaking whale.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Xu Ke vented his grievances.</p><p></p><p>"Next, there is more important task that I have to entrust to you."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that he was back for a short time and had to go out again, Xu Ke's expression immediately fell.</p><p></p><p>But looking at Lu Ya's solemn expression, Xu Ke still nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Lu Ya, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>"I need you to go to Southern Ming and deliver something for me," Lu Ya said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Southern Ming? I seem to have heard of it somewhere..." scratching his head, Xu Ke thought for a moment before suddenly realizing, "Oh! That's the place with many monsters..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was eager to listen, but suddenly noticed that the scenery and sound around him were becoming vague.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>No matter how helpless he felt, he could not change the rules of the celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, after everything spun around, Li Fan returned to the Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Brush Sect, Southern Ming..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the sights and experiences of this celestial realm journey, pondered for a moment, and began searching in the Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Brush Sect was a medium-sized cultivation sect in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>They used the brush to enter the path, and it was said that their writings and paintings could communicate with the divine.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the sect were extremely skilled in calligraphy and painting, and there were even legends of drawing creatures.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after several catastrophes, almost none of their works were preserved.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Celestial Treasury where Li Fan originally visited, there were no works that could be passed down.</p><p></p><p>In the current cultivation world, there were not many records about the Divine Brush Sect cultivators. Most of them were mediocre and unknown.</p><p></p><p>Only the former head of the Divine Brush Sect, Chu Youhong, left a slight trace in history.</p><p></p><p>Chu Youhong, who was in the Yuanying stage, took over as the head of the sect upon the previous head's passing, administering the Divine Brush Sect.</p><p></p><p>Due to his low cultivation level and weak strength, he was often looked down upon by the sect's cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, out of respect for the position of head, there were no overt conflicts.</p><p></p><p>Chu Youhong didn't mind and treated the sect's cultivators with kindness, without displaying any authority as the head.</p><p></p><p>Despite this, Chu Youhong diligently fulfilled his duties as the head, personally handling all matters within the sect, big or small.</p><p></p><p>He also maintained good relations with several surrounding sects.</p><p></p><p>Through his diligent efforts, the Divine Brush Sect recovered from the embarrassing situation of the sudden death of the previous head and the lack of new disciples.</p><p></p><p>With this achievement, the disciples of the Divine Brush Sect gradually recognized Chu Youhong's position as the sect head.</p><p></p><p>And when the mortal disciple he accepted rapidly progressed in cultivation, surpassing him later on.</p><p></p><p>Being respectful of the master, Chu Youhong finally secured his position as the head of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everything stabilizing and improving, the future of the Divine Brush Sect seemed promising.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one day, disaster struck.</p><p></p><p>That talented disciple, the senior brother of the Divine Brush Sect, turned out to be a spy sent by another sect, the "Point Painting Sect." His target was the sect's treasure, the "Heavenly Brush."</p><p></p><p>One night, with the help of the insider, the Point Painting Sect raided the Divine Brush Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Brush Sect suffered countless casualties, almost facing annihilation.</p>

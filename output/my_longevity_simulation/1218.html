        <h1>Chapter 1218</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm." Yin Shangren lightly coughed, feeling that Holy Emperor Li Ping's gaze seemed to be locked on him. </p><p></p><p>"Alright, back to the main topic. Creating the Dark Repulsion is the innate behavior of the formation. Even if the formation is already damaged, it will still execute according to the original logic. This Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation is indeed remarkable. It must have started autonomously searching for substitutes after losing the supply of the Mysterious Yellow energy source."</p><p></p><p>"The Dark Tribe people were born because of this."</p><p></p><p>"I suppose you've also figured it out. The power that the Dark Tribe people pray to be born can replace the supply from the heaven and earth of the Mysterious Yellow Realm to a certain extent..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how much you understand about the way of formations? Do you understand what I mean by saying this?"</p><p></p><p>As Yin Shangren was speaking, he discovered that Holy Emperor Li Ping's mood seemed a bit strange, and thought that he had said something too abstruse and couldn't explain it clearly. </p><p></p><p>So he asked.</p><p></p><p>"I have a slight understanding. The Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation was built by the Mysterious Heavenly King. If it's according to what you said, then the Dark Sea here is the same as the formation module that captures the worlds in the starry sea, both being important functional parts of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation," Li Ping said carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad." Yin Shangren nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, according to my judgment, besides these two and the overall control of the formation, this Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation should still have other functions..."</p><p></p><p>"The principle of the way of formations flows endlessly. The golden chains and the Dark Sea indeed cannot form a complete formation cycle. There should indeed be another two auxiliary formation modules in order to make the operation efficiency of this grand formation reach its peak."</p><p></p><p>Before Yin Shangren could speak, he heard Holy Emperor Li Ping already state his judgment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that your attainments in formations are much stronger than mine," Yin Shangren said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not reply, but was pondering the missing parts of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he still did not stop communicating with Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"If we regard the Mysterious Yellow Realm as a flying boat struggling near the whirlpool of the starry sea, then in a sense, this place is the power source of the flying boat?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Yin Shangren expressed his agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Then if... I mean if, the Dark Sea is given sufficient energy supply, would it be possible to gradually struggle out of the whirlpool again?" Holy Emperor Li Ping asked slowly in a strange tone.</p><p></p><p>"...It's only theoretically possible. We don't know the energy conversion efficiency of the Dark Sea, and it's more likely that even if the entire Mysterious Yellow Realm is burned out, it may not be able to move the Mysterious Yellow Realm an inch. Moreover, I have a feeling that due to the lack of Dark Tribe population in the previous period, the energy supply of the Dark Sea has encountered problems again. Perhaps it has started to stimulate new variable energy absorption methods." Yin Shangren shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"There's always a faint sense of crisis in my heart. We can't be careless," Yin Shangren said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>"But recently, didn't you create a large number of Dark Tribe people? If the energy supply of the Dark Sea can be restored, maybe the occurrence of this variation can be prevented," Yin Shangren suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>The Great Enlightened Holy Emperor Li Ping remained silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they attempted to crack the iridescent rainbow</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had just failed not long ago, couldn't spare any time to rest and adjust at this moment. He immediately started to deduce the "Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation" of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought of the scene when Mo Rubin of the 119th generation mysteriously disappeared in the Dark Sea, leaving only an empty shell behind.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out that the Dark Sea is also part of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, Mo Rubin successfully learned about the relevant information of the Xuantian King through the Tianxuan Mirror. In the end, he went to the Dark Sea. It's uncertain whether he truly perished, but it's very likely that his entire cultivation base was directly devoured by the Dark Sea and transformed into the power source of Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether he was willing to sacrifice himself for the Xuanhuang Realm out of great love, or he faked his death and escaped, it can be almost certain that the Xuantian King, or at least matters closely related to the Xuantian King, should be hidden in the Dark Sea."</p><p></p><p>"I may be able to crack it!"</p><p></p><p>The various perceptions of Saint Emperor Li Ping in the Dark Sea, as well as the scenes witnessed by the 119th generation in it, all surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Separation Disc, with the enhancement of the Dao Transformation Stone, resounded thunderously.</p><p></p><p>It actually operated to its own limit, which was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder when I asked the Tianxuan Mirror for the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation back then, it kept making excuses and even took out an immortal-level formation diagram to temporarily appease me. Now it seems that this Floating Crossing Formation is actually the ultimate transformation formation for Xuanhuang. It transforms the Xuanhuang Realm from a pure cultivation realm into an eternal immortal boat that can traverse the Immortal Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>"If the formation wasn't damaged, if there wasn't still a high wall outside the Immortal Wilderness..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Xuanhuang Realm would have long broken free from its shackles and traveled the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, it was when I asked the Tianxuan Mirror for the formation diagram of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation that I finally exposed a flaw. After all, given the importance of this formation, the Twelve Dharma Kings of the Tianxuan Sect had no reason to be unaware of it. But my performance at that time didn't show the corresponding level of importance. I merely treated it as an ordinary formation..."</p><p></p><p>Numerous thoughts flashed simultaneously in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed, and the light of the Separation Disc and the Dao Transformation Stone kept flickering.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the long-lost, increasingly intense pain in his brow, Li Fan slightly frowned, "It seems that the complexity of this Floating Crossing Formation exceeds my imagination. With too little known information, even with three immortal-level formations as the foundation, it's too difficult to forcibly deduce it. It's even somewhat difficult to just attempt to deduce the flaws of the Dark Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this formation seems to have the ability to prevent others from deducing and cracking it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Every time the Ultimate Separation Disc deduced to a critical moment, the vast majority of the formation data vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some power, spanning across time and space, was interfering.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even suspected that if his true body wasn't hiding in the Wanxian Alliance's Yan Fa Jue space, he might have been directly targeted by this power, not just interfered with.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, every time the formation is deduced and restored, there is still some data remaining. It's just a bit slower."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's best to maintain the current state of the Dark Sea without change."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's true body's thoughts surged, the decision of Saint Emperor Li Ping also suddenly changed.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 566</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But it's not difficult to guess that the object he was referring to should be the mysterious web that first appeared on the Tianlingzhou battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained calm and only tentatively said, "According to our predictions, even if the Ten Immortal Alliance has the help of the Xuantian Sealing Array, the Five Elders Sect should not have been retreating and showing signs of decline step by step."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I have been using a switching source app to read and catch up on books lately, with multiple source switches and various reading voices available, suitable for both Android and Apple."</p><p></p><p>The other party sighed, "This time we did indeed miscalculate. No one expected that the Ten Immortal Alliance would so quickly reappear with this ancient formation."</p><p></p><p>"And, it seems even more dominant than what is recorded."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Sect cultivator's tone was somewhat helpless, "Our countermeasures in the Five Elders Sect have not been fully prepared yet. So the situation on the Tianlingzhou battlefield is somewhat pressing."</p><p></p><p>"So we urgently need a way to weaken the opponent's formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond, but tapped rhythmically on the table with his fingers as if seriously thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Even with our strength, obtaining the map of the Xuantian Sealing Array would require a huge cost. Even some fellow cultivators who have infiltrated the Ten Immortal Alliance may have to sacrifice their lives for this."</p><p></p><p>"And even then, success is not guaranteed..."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan finally spoke, looking very hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a glimmer of hope, the Five Elders Sect cultivator hurriedly seized the opportunity, "Friend Zhou, rest assured, as long as we can obtain the map, everything can be negotiable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained non-committal. (New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he said in a deep voice, "It's a critical matter, and I cannot make a decision on my own. How about this, I will come back here in three days and give you an answer."</p><p></p><p>Though the Five Elders Sect cultivator was anxious in his heart, he also knew that what the other party said made sense, so he could only nod helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, let's meet at a different place next time. It's better to be cautious in these turbulent times." With that, he informed Li Fan of the location of another island.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands, then flew away, returning to the Congyun Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan Sealing, Xuantian Sealing."</p><p></p><p>"Ancient, Tianxuan Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Inside a secret room, Li Fan's eyes flickered as he fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"The scene of the thousands of cultivators falling from the sky to the ground in an instant seems somewhat familiar..."</p><p></p><p>"Right, the Jiushan Region!"</p><p></p><p>The nine mountain ranges stretching across the Jiushan region also had the characteristic of cultivators not being able to fly.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, Li Fan had traveled to the Jiushan region's Wanfa Trading Company and had witnessed several adamant cultivators meeting tragic deaths by falling alive.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be any connection among these?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then recalled various information he had seen in the past.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, some neglected information caught Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>According to legend, the nine great mountains in the Jiushan region were formed by the meridians of a beast after its death.</p><p></p><p>The names of the nine mountains are: Tianchang, Tianduan, Tianxu, Tiancu, Tianjie, Tiandai, Tianlao, Tiandong, Tianxi.</p><p></p><p>The nine mountains clearly separated reality and illusion and vaguely formed a formation, causing the instability of the Jiushan region's space, making even teleportation arrays unusable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All this information was already known to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan didn't have a real concept of the appearance of demonic beasts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the transformation of the meridians of a demonic beast into mountains after its death was very much in line with the ancient legendary temperament, and there was nothing particularly special about it.</p><p></p><p>But in the Meteor Immortal Realm, he personally visited the Nangming Mountain, the sacred place of the demonic beasts, and saw numerous formidable demonic beasts from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Li Fan noticed some discrepancies in this myth.</p><p></p><p>If the myth was true, then the size of the beast's body was too large.</p><p></p><p>It took Li Fan half a year to travel back and forth across the entire Jiushan region.</p><p></p><p>If the meridians in its body could span the size of an entire province, what kind of massive existence was this beast when it was alive?</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, creatures like the Red Nine-headed, Purple Headless, and Green Divine Dragon...</p><p></p><p>They were probably just like ants.</p><p></p><p>Although size may not necessarily correlate with strength, Li Fan certainly wouldn't consider this gigantic beast, which transformed into nine mountains, as weak.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, through this unknown beast, I can verify the origin of this so-called Xuantian Sealing Array."</p><p></p><p>Just from the name alone, Li Fan could almost confirm that this formation was closely related to the ancient Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>But nothing is absolute, and it is also possible that it is just a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Being more thorough wouldn't hurt.</p><p></p><p>Time has passed too long, making it impossible to verify.</p><p></p><p>With various theories, there are no definite answers.</p><p></p><p>One by one, Li Fan went through them all, seemingly not finding anything reliable.</p><p></p><p>Just when he was about to give up in frustration, a painting named "Encounter with an Ancient Beast in a Dream" caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>This painting was not created by a contemporary artist but was a casual work of a disciple of the ancient Master Brush Sect.</p><p></p><p>After the Master Brush Sect was swallowed by the Point and Paint Sect, items within the sect dispersed in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This painting was acquired by a casual cultivator by chance. The cultivator perished in the upheaval of heaven and earth, and the items in the storage ring were looted.</p><p></p><p>Only leaving behind those seemingly worthless items that took up space, quietly lying there.</p><p></p><p>The storage ring without any utility value was abandoned as trash and thrown on the roadside.</p><p></p><p>Gathering dust for thousands of years, it was discovered by passing cultivators.</p><p></p><p>According to the cultivator called Tang Bowen, he only understood the past through a strand of thousand-year-old lingering resentments in the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these claims were likely just fabricated by Tang Bowen to inflate the price of "Encounter with an Ancient Beast in a Dream."</p><p></p><p>But regardless, this painting indeed dated back thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>It depicted hundreds of variously shaped demonic beasts, some of which Li Fan had seen in the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>What attracted Li Fan to this painting was that, besides the obvious demonic beasts depicted, there was also a hidden ancient beast.</p><p></p><p>In the margins of the bizarre beast picture, one could faintly see that the hundreds of demonic beasts seemed to be standing on top of a colossal existence.</p><p></p><p>But because this entity was too giant, it was impossible to draw.</p><p></p><p>Only the over a hundred demonic beasts on its back were portrayed as a backdrop.</p><p></p><p>"Great is the invisible, its name is Heaven."</p><p></p><p>There was this sentence left in the corner.</p><p></p><p>This kind of blank space-based creative technique naturally attracted many cultivators' comments.</p><p></p><p>Someone knowledgeable immediately saw through the mystery.</p><p></p><p>"I know this, isn't it the big king who turned into the nine mountains in death?"</p><p></p><p>The tone was full of mockery, but it was not baseless.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was King, and "eight" represented two.</p><p></p><p>Its name was [Tian] - Tianbeast...</p>

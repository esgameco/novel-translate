        <h1>Chapter 314</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Zhang Zhiliang said, after studying for a long time in the Huanyu Villa, Li Fan already understood roughly seventy to eighty percent of how to construct the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation. </p><p></p><p>However, as for how powerful this constructed Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation actually was, Li Fan wasn't completely clear and lacked a quantified understanding.</p><p></p><p>It's just like how workers on a weapons production line may not necessarily be very clear about the lethality of what they are manufacturing.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan also thought that the main purpose of constructing this Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation was to mark the Five Elders Society cultivators who infiltrated the Wanxian Alliance's territory. </p><p></p><p>But after Zhang Zhiliang's reminder, Li Fan realized that the real purpose may be far more than this.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is indeed outstanding in distinguishing between enemy and ally cultivators.  </p><p></p><p>But if it was only for this purpose, it would be a bit of overkill.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that according to the current construction plan, a Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation will be built in every state of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The amount of materials required is incalculable. </p><p></p><p>Even if the number of Five Elders Society spies doubled, the total losses they caused may not be worth more than these materials.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those remote places in the Wanxian Alliance that are hardly worth infiltrating.</p><p></p><p>Yet without exception, Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formations are to be built for saturated prevention.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping out and preventing spies is one aspect, but more importantly, it's to achieve a high degree of control over one's own territory.</p><p></p><p>Under the coverage of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation, as long as a Five Elders Society cultivator enters, they will be marked. </p><p></p><p>This actually means that everything within the formation is under constant surveillance.</p><p></p><p>The first time he saw the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan had done a test.</p><p></p><p>After learning the news that the liuli fish on Liuli Island had gone extinct, he first bought a batch of liuli pearls at the original price, and only later sold this news to the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the price of liuli pearls skyrocketed, and he made a small fortune from it. </p><p></p><p>He also confirmed that the Tianxuan Mirror is not an omniscient existence. It cannot know everything that happens after leaving Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>With the "Real Truth" on him, in order to ensure his own secrets were not noticed, Li Fan had deliberately avoided the Tianxuan Mirror's detection many times.</p><p></p><p>But once the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is established... the Tianxuan Mirror will make up for this shortcoming.</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid all of Li Fan's little tricks will not escape its prying eyes.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that his every move in the future will be under the constant surveillance of the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He maliciously speculated whether the Wanxian Alliance would establish a special institution.</p><p></p><p>Once a cultivator's behavior is found to be a bit abnormal, the institution's members would be dispatched to deal with it. </p><p></p><p>In this way, I'm afraid all unstable factors will be nipped in the bud.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to reconsider whether to rely on Spirit Mist Grass for profit in the next life."</p><p></p><p>"Although I can get rich overnight, the impact and changes brought by a war are too great. Especially once this Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is completed, I'm afraid my every step will be difficult and it will be hard to keep the secrets on me."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, for the first time in this life, Li Fan finally felt like he had lifted a rock only to drop it on his own feet.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Wanxian Alliance's determination to construct the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation this time is so strong. In order to ensure the number of formation laying personnel, even an eliminated person like me was pulled back..."</p><p></p><p>"But the popularization of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation in this life is already an unstoppable trend. In the future, I can only act more cautiously and never expose my abnormality."</p>

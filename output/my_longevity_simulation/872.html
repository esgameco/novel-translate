        <h1>Chapter 872</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>With a loud shout from Li Fan, a giant appeared in the deep, mysterious void, dozens of times larger than the previous Tianyang puppet. </p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan's Yuanying Dharma Appearance, transformed by the nearly endless power of the Five Elements Dongtian!</p><p></p><p>If it appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm, this giant could stand tall enough to support the heavens and attract the attention of cultivators from all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Behind the giant's head, the illusory images of the Five Great Dongtian appeared faintly, like five interconnected circular rings, making Li Fan's Dharma Appearance appear extremely sacred.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this giant, Tianyang was almost as small as an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress!"</p><p></p><p>The giant looked down and stretched out his right index finger, pressing down heavily on Tianyang's head.</p><p></p><p>The finger covered the top of his head, as if the sky was collapsing. The fingerprints on it also seemed like a series of restrictive talismans, trying to suppress Tianyang in an instant.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Tianyang experienced what he looked like in the eyes of ordinary cultivators. However, facing the giant's overwhelming attack, Tianyang was not panicked.</p><p></p><p>His clothes moved without wind, and the space around him twisted strangely.</p><p></p><p>The spatial distortions spread outward like layers of waves, with Tianyang as the center.</p><p></p><p>As it continued to advance, Tianyang's figure became more and more blurred.</p><p></p><p>After just a moment, he had completely disappeared from the scene!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's finger pressed down, but it hit nothing!</p><p></p><p>"Interesting! Even with my power of the Five Elements, combined with a space-sealing formation, I still can't prevent you from escaping..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's Dharma Appearance spoke with a thunderous voice, his eyes constantly sweeping the surroundings, trying to find traces of Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>But Tianyang seemed to have completely vanished, without revealing even a hint of his aura fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, don't..."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could finish his sentence, Tianyang suddenly appeared like a ghost in front of the Dharma Appearance's head!</p><p></p><p>Appearing out of nowhere, he pointed at the Dharma Appearance's glabella from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Like a drop of water falling into a calm pond, the Dharma Appearance's head twisted bizarrely.</p><p></p><p>Then it shattered with a bang!</p><p></p><p>Tianyang was about to withdraw his hand.</p><p></p><p>But the Dharma Appearance, whose head had shattered all over the ground, acted as if it was not affected at all.</p><p></p><p>Its hands quickly clasped together in front of its body, with fingers curved, forming a cage.</p><p></p><p>The shattered energy fragments of the head also flew closer as if they had a spirit.</p><p></p><p>Outside the finger cage, they instantly turned into a formation!</p><p></p><p>Tianyang was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that within this formation, not only could he not escape by shattering space, even the "Space Folding" technique he had just used had lost its effect!</p><p></p><p>What a genius!</p><p></p><p>Before Tianyang could think carefully, outside the ten-finger cage, layer upon layer of formation illusions appeared continuously.</p><p></p><p>As if there was no limit, in just a breath's time, the power accumulated by these formations had already swelled to a level that even Tianyang, at the Hedao realm, had to take seriously.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the price was that Li Fan's Yuanying Dharma Appearance also instantly shrank like a popped balloon.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the crisis that could erupt around him at any time, Tianyang dared not move.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure then appeared not far away, looking smug: "How about it, Junior Brother? Do you give in?"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded glumly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Li Fan didn't make things difficult for Tianyang anymore. A blue light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then towards where Tianyang was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>With a gentle flick of his finger, in an instant, the vast and complex formation that seemed incomprehensible in Tian Yang's eyes was casually dismantled by Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even used my true strength yet. Otherwise, it wouldn't be good if I hurt you," Li Fan couldn't help but emphasize, seeing Tian Yang's somewhat unconvinced appearance.</p><p></p><p>"I... as well," Tian Yang managed to utter these three words with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan again, he took the initiative to request another battle.</p><p></p><p>"Eh!" Unexpectedly, Li Fan just waved his hand and refused.</p><p></p><p>"Sparring should stop when the point is made. As martial brothers, do we really need to fight to the death?"</p><p></p><p>"No more fighting, no more!" Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang had no choice but to not insist.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, little martial brother, your power is also related to space. Not far ahead, there is a small world. Inside, there is a kind of spiritual entity everywhere, which may be of some help to you." Li Fan introduced the relevant situation of the Hunyin Realm to Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Yang had already merged with the Dao, apart from the power of the laws contained in the Heavenly and Earthly Souls, his knowledge was actually not much different from that of a Shijie Daozhu cultivator a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally at a loss when it came to such strange matters.</p><p></p><p>However, he had always listened to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>So the two continued to go deeper along the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>This place was already far away from the Xuanhuang Realm, and Li Fan no longer had any scruples.</p><p></p><p>And Tian Yang, who had mastered the power of space, was also able to shrink the earth and closely follow.</p><p></p><p>Even though their speed was so fast, the length of the spatial passage here still somewhat exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Fan's calculations, it took them almost a full month before they vaguely sensed the Liekai Whale group ahead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Looking into the distance, countless Liekai Whales could be seen, like a whale sea. They were opening up a path in the void in groups.</p><p></p><p>And this was only what was visible on the outside.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black void, who knew how many Liekai Whales actually existed.</p><p></p><p>The huge overall aura emanating from the Liekai group made even Li Fan's expression change slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It has already reached the extreme point of quantitative change to qualitative change."</p><p></p><p>"How can there be so many?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but turn his head to look at the Hunyin Realm hidden not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Turning into a rainbow light, Li Fan landed in this small world in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he landed, Li Fan couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>This place was a bit too cold.</p><p></p><p>Even the spiritual power in his body had a tendency to freeze.</p><p></p><p>The power of the five elements circulated, and Li Fan wanted to resist the severe cold here by transforming his own spiritual power into fire attributes.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment he did so.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying cold power surged from within Li Fan's body for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Instantly turning into an ice sculpture, and then with the yin wind blowing from an unknown source, it shattered into countless ice grains, scattering all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, with a slight fluctuation, Li Fan's figure reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Strange."</p><p></p><p>An expression of interest appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Just now, what appeared along with the fire attribute power in his body was not scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>But extreme cold.</p><p></p><p>This coldness did not come from the outside, but was a characteristic of the fire attribute here.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, there's something wrong here."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang also rarely said a complete sentence in a very coherent manner.</p><p></p><p>His expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>"It's as if something around is devouring my abilities."</p><p></p><p>"But I can't find them."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1063: Dao One Swallows Heaven and Earth</p><p></p><p>In Shilin Prefecture, the first change that the cultivators noticed was that the spiritual energy between heaven and earth seemed to have become a bit thinner.</p><p></p><p>This was no small matter. After receiving feedback from the cultivators, Shilin Immortal City immediately sent people to investigate.</p><p></p><p>According to the results of the calculations, this was not everyone's illusion.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the concentration of spiritual energy in the entire Shilin Prefecture had indeed decreased compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Although the magnitude of this decrease was not large, it still made the cultivators of Shilin Prefecture feel apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this anomaly seemed to occur only within Shilin Prefecture. With no precedent to draw on, the cultivators of Shilin Prefecture could only explore the cause on their own.</p><p></p><p>The result was shocking.</p><p></p><p>In the Baishi Dongtian, the huge underground karst cave at the border of the prefecture, a kind of black insect had been born at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>These insects were densely packed, occupying almost the entire underground cave.</p><p></p><p>They greedily devoured and absorbed the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, multiplying and reproducing at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the black insects filling the field of vision almost made all the cultivators who saw it feel chilled to the bone.</p><p></p><p>After finding the cause of the anomaly, the cultivators of Shilin Prefecture quickly made a response.</p><p></p><p>They organized cultivators to go to Baishi Dongtian to carry out a large-scale extermination of these black insects.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought that with the power of cultivators to move mountains and overturn seas, eliminating these insects would be a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>But the severity of the situation far exceeded the imagination of the Shilin Prefecture cultivators.</p><p></p><p>First of all, the tenacity of these black insects' lives was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>They fed on spiritual energy, so after the cultivators' spiritual power attacks hit them, the power would be weakened slightly due to being partially devoured.</p><p></p><p>This also led to the fact that the more black insects there were, the stronger their "resistance" to spiritual power techniques.</p><p></p><p>With the dense degree of black insects in the underground Baishi Dongtian, even if Nascent Soul cultivators made a move, it would not make much of a splash. Instead, they would be surrounded and have their internal spiritual energy sucked dry and die miserably.</p><p></p><p>And how many Primordial Spirit cultivators did Shilin Prefecture have? In the face of the vast ocean-like underground black insects, a dozen or twenty Primordial Spirit cultivators were just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, only a Harmonious Dao cultivator could solve this situation.</p><p></p><p>However, unfortunately, the Harmonious Dao cultivator guarding Shilin Prefecture had left Shilin Prefecture some time ago for some unknown reason and had not returned for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The communications sent out were all met with silence, with no reply.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the insect extermination operation in Shilin Prefecture soon fell into a dilemma not long after it started.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that could make the cultivators of Shilin Prefecture feel a little at ease was that those black insects did not seem to have any intention of leaving the underground and expanding outward.</p><p></p><p>But living with such a terrifying group of creatures underground, anyone would feel uneasy day and night.</p><p></p><p>Shilin Immortal City had no choice but to seek help from the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the underground Baishi Dongtian.</p><p></p><p>The phantom of Dharma Transmitter Zhou looked at the black insects crawling all over the walls of the cave, and a trace of dread flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At first, he didn't pay much attention to Li Fan's words about "a little bit of harm".</p><p></p><p>But now, he was so afraid that he dared not come here in person.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyou, this thing really won't get out of control?" he asked with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked the Dao One insect queen lying in his hand and smiled, "Don't worry..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Relax. The Xuanhuang Realm is our common home. Without absolute certainty, how could our alliance possibly use it rashly?"</p><p></p><p>"All the black insects are born from this Dao-One Insect Queen in my hand. Their lives are all tied to the Insect Queen. As long as we kill it, this insect disaster will collapse on its own."</p><p></p><p>As if sensing Li Fan's murderous intent, the chubby Insect Queen flipped over on the spot and restlessly squirmed back and forth in Li Fan's hand with its body.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou stared at the Insect Queen for a long time before nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It is expected that within a month, the spiritual energy density in Shilin Prefecture will drop to an extreme low. The resulting spiritual energy vacuum will lead to huge spiritual energy storms blowing up in the surrounding prefectures. At that time, we will lift the [Spiritual Sealing Barrier]."</p><p></p><p>"By then, along with these storms, the black insects will spread throughout the entire Xuanhuang Realm in a very short time."</p><p></p><p>In front of Li Fan, an illusory light and shadow appeared, simulating this catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>"It is estimated that the entire process will not exceed seven days."</p><p></p><p>"By the time the Myriad Immortals Alliance reports layer by layer, deliberates layer by layer, and makes a decision... it will all be too late."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm will face a suddenly descending era of the End of Dharma."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was a bit excited as he described the entire plan to Transmitter Zhou again.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou narrowed his eyes, and for some reason, a sense of ominous premonition suddenly rose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no reason for the huge organization of the Myriad Realms Alliance to allow the Xuanhuang Realm to truly be destroyed. It seemed that everything was under control.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Although these black insects are terrifying, at most they can only catch us off guard. Once the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance collectively react, it won't be too difficult to exterminate these black insects."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that what the other party said was true, and he smiled slightly: "All we need is this window of opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"If it were just an insect disaster, Transmitter Jiang would definitely not show up in person."</p><p></p><p>"But if the spiritual energy mutates after recovering, threatening the lives of all cultivators, he may have no choice but to appear."</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou nodded: "That kind of spiritual energy does indeed have the effect of disturbing the mind. Even with my mental state, after consuming some of it, it was difficult to suppress the thought of wanting to have a fierce fight with Huang."</p><p></p><p>"If it spreads throughout the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou seemed to have already seen the scene of blood everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Threat? No, no." Li Fan shook his head decisively to deny it.</p><p></p><p>"As soon as Jiang appears, I will activate the clues left in advance to attract him here. At that time, I'll leave it to you."</p><p></p><p>"As for the issue of spiritual energy in the Xuanhuang Realm, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>"After the black insects die, the devoured spiritual energy will return to heaven and earth. Everything will return to the starting point." Li Fan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou had also verified this matter, so there was no objection.</p><p></p><p>However, what she didn't know was that outside the publicly available information, Li Fan had concealed many things.</p><p></p><p>For example, there were actually two Dao-One Insect Queens.</p><p></p><p>Only when both of them die at the same time will this mutated Dao-One Insect race perish.</p><p></p><p>For example, it's true that the Dao-One Insects will return the vast majority of spiritual energy after they die.</p><p></p><p>But there is still a small portion that will be transmitted into the Insect Queen's body as a supply of nourishment.</p><p></p><p>And for example...</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy is to the Xuanhuang Realm what blood is to the human body.</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, the blood inside the body has been replaced.</p><p></p><p>It's really hard to say what kind of changes the Xuanhuang Realm will undergo.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1108: Alien Star Falls on Xuanhuang</p><p></p><p>Although the Xuanhuang Realm had become much more vast than other normal cultivation realms after thousands of years of traction and devouring, Li Fan really couldn't figure out where a force that could make even the Wanxian Alliance dread could possibly be hiding.</p><p></p><p>Back when the Tianxuan Mirror had sublimated and transformed, it had thoroughly swept through the entire Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not only had the information of almost all the subordinate cave heavens and small worlds been basically explored, but even the world cracks in the depths of the white fog had been explored to a great extent.</p><p></p><p>"Unless it's another hidden snow area with a special nature like the Youjie Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It can only be said that it's indeed the last surviving gathering place of the cultivators from the Darkest Star Sea. You never know when a powerful figure will suddenly emerge."</p><p></p><p>"However, since they didn't survive the apocalypse in the Xuanhuang Realm, no matter how strong they are, their strength is limited."</p><p></p><p>After a series of analyses, Li Fan felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, the history of the Wanxian Alliance suddenly rising from the cultivation wasteland, now that I think about it carefully, does seem a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>After the great calamity in the Xuanhuang Realm, cultivators fell into an era of mutual suspicion and slaughter.</p><p></p><p>In the end, civilization shattered, and there were no more groups in the world. Only lone rangers as vigilant and murderous as beasts remained. This was the so-called cultivation wasteland.</p><p></p><p>In all the records that can be consulted now, the accounts of what happened later in the Xuanhuang Realm are basically consistent.</p><p></p><p>The long-disappeared Dharma Heavenly Venerate returned once again and rebuilt civilization on the broken land.</p><p></p><p>So here comes the question.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's from the [Era] illusion experienced in the Divine Treasure Museum or the historical fragments excavated from the blood-colored river in the [Seeking the Secluded] of the Lingmu Realm, their descriptions of the cultivators living in this period can be summarized with the four words "valiant and fierce".</p><p></p><p>Those who could survive the battle royale in the end, their mentality, means, and strength naturally go without saying.</p><p></p><p>So how would such a group of people react when the Dharma suddenly appeared and said he wanted to unify the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>Where are those people now? Neither the Wanxian Alliance nor the Five Elders Association seems to have their presence.</p><p></p><p>"I remember that the Wanfa Chamber of Commerce in Jiushan Prefecture was passed down from that period. Unfortunately, it has now been razed to the ground. Otherwise, perhaps we could have gone to inquire about related information."</p><p></p><p>After leaving this matter to be resolved in the next life, Li Fan's attention returned to the "True Immortal's Remnant Shell".</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan had reminded, the Wanxian Alliance indeed became much more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>For those world souls that appeared, they directly chose to capture them collectively.</p><p></p><p>As for the final ownership, it had already been negotiated in advance. The purpose was to swallow these "baits" as soon as possible without harm and transform them into their own combat power.</p><p></p><p>With the official intervention of the Wanxian Alliance, the various upheavals caused by the appearance of the world souls quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>As for that True Immortal's Remnant Shell, the Wanxian Alliance's attitude was very cautious.</p><p></p><p>They pursued it, but did not allow cultivators to slaughter each other for it. In the end, who would get it depended on personal opportunity.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in order to quell this storm as soon as possible, those Dharma practitioners who usually didn't interfere in worldly affairs also took action, breaking convention. It seems that after the Moru Bin incident, their way of doing things had also changed accordingly.</p><p></p><p>After the Wanxian Alliance participated in this game, Li Fan clearly felt that manipulating</p><p></p><p>The dark puppet had a much harder time walking the dog.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance still had a strong control over their territory.</p><p></p><p>As the frequency of transfers increased, the weakness of the dark puppet's inability to fight for long periods of time became apparent.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan ordered Qiaogong and others to urgently create more puppets for alternating use, which barely maintained the elusive characteristics of the "True Immortal's Remnant".</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan also vaguely felt that the Myriad Immortals Alliance seemed to have noticed that the "True Immortal's Remnant" was transferring through the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>The time required for tracking was getting shorter and shorter.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this play can't last for too long."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter, I have achieved my goal. Just wait for the final curtain call to give the Xuanhuang Realm a surprise."</p><p></p><p>After scanning the specific situation of his various arrangements, Li Fan showed a kind smile.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, why do you have to do this?"</p><p></p><p>Three figures suddenly floated out, surrounding Li Fan on both sides.</p><p></p><p>Frowning and looking miserable, with a withered face.</p><p></p><p>They all stared at Li Fan without saying a word, only sighing.</p><p></p><p>They were the paper men who awakened from the Book of Crossing Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Fan started preparing for the end of the world, even though various arrangements were completed through avatars and puppets, these paper men from the Crossing Tribulation Sect somehow sensed the crisis.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning of one, to now two more paper men have awakened one after another.</p><p></p><p>And they could even vaguely perceive the thoughts of the end of the world in Li Fan's mind. Every time Li Fan rehearsed and deduced future scenarios, these guys would come around to persuade him tirelessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally ignored them and treated them coldly.</p><p></p><p>And after the three paper men of the Crossing Tribulation Sect found that persuasion was useless, they simply gave up. They just followed Li Fan with sad faces.</p><p></p><p>At first, Li Fan thought they were just impotent and angry. But later, he found that when surrounded by these sad-faced paper men, he would also be infected by their emotions.</p><p></p><p>No matter what he thought before, how passionate he was, or how extreme his thoughts were.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they all gradually turned into extreme negativity and emptiness.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Li Fan's protection from the "Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra", he would have almost been influenced and changed by them.</p><p></p><p>The paper men of the Crossing Tribulation Sect could only sense the general situation. As for the specific measures Li Fan had taken during this period, they did not have the ability to know remotely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also did not reveal that he was not affected at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he cooperated with them to act as opponents.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy expression on his face slowly disappeared, replaced by a sense of emptiness where nothing seemed interesting.</p><p></p><p>His mind also slowly emptied everything and stopped thinking about preparations related to the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>The figures of the three paper men from the Crossing Tribulation Sect also changed. They did not directly return to the Book of Crossing Tribulations but turned into the image of serious old masters.</p><p></p><p>Sitting solemnly, they began to tell Li Fan about the various calamities that the Xuanhuang Realm had experienced in the past.</p><p></p><p>Their names were also very interesting.</p><p></p><p>They were all named after these calamities that had appeared in history.</p><p></p><p>For example, one of them was called [Falling Star].</p><p></p><p>It referred to a time before the Immortal Path was cut off when an alien star once fell from the starry sky to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The energy permeating the alien star had temporarily greatly affected the spiritual power effectiveness of all cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm. Regardless of the realm, their strength had dropped dramatically.</p>

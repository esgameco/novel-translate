        <h1>Chapter 837</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The appearance was somewhat similar to Mo Sha. However, it didn't have that overwhelming murderous aura, but was more profound and deep.</p><p></p><p>"Take action!" Li Fan shouted in his heart while his hands kept moving, fully activating the Altered Xuantian Sealing Formation.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious power instantly enveloped the Ink Stone.</p><p></p><p>The Ink Stone, which had already sensed the presence of Lin Ling and Tian Yang and was preparing to launch an attack, suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Then its form swayed slightly like water.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it seemed as if a white cloth had been draped over it, and its color faded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Ink Stone was being affected by the formation, Lin Ling and the others' attacks arrived.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Yang was only at the Hua Shen realm, his combat instincts were superior to Lin Ling's.</p><p></p><p>Flames of red and black formed a huge fist, smashing into the Ink Stone's body.</p><p></p><p>Ripples spread out.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's tens of thousands of green silk cords, like flying swords, followed closely.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they wanted to pierce the Ink Stone with ten thousand arrows on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the two's fierce attacks, the Ink Stone only looked at them coldly.</p><p></p><p>It didn't dodge or evade.</p><p></p><p>"Escape!" The instant the Ink Stone looked at Lin Ling and the others, Li Fan, who was observing the battle from outside through shared vision, sensed something was wrong and called out a warning.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the formation to once again suppress the Ink Stone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang had extreme trust in Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The moment they received the warning, they each fled.</p><p></p><p>And right after they escaped, without any sign, space shattered.</p><p></p><p>It turned into a void cave filled with black destructive aura, just like the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Hide!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan commanded calmly and unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>His premonition was correct.</p><p></p><p>After enduring the combined attack of the two and launching a counterattack, the Ink Stone's form wriggled and then drilled into the void cave beside it.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, black tentacles stretched out from the countless holes in the underground connected space here.</p><p></p><p>They frantically launched indiscriminate attacks on everything that might exist around them.</p><p></p><p>It was like raging waves, and the sealing formation confining this space also suffered a huge impact.</p><p></p><p>It was on the verge of danger.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan quickly took action to repair and reinforce it.</p><p></p><p>Although the situation was critical, it remained firm and unbroken.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Ling and the other who were contending with the Ink Stone inside the formation, they weren't having such an easy time.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's early warning, this large-scale killing move left the two of them with almost nowhere to hide.</p><p></p><p>They could only constantly shuttle around, trying to minimize the frequency of being hit.</p><p></p><p>Those black tentacles also had the ability to shatter space.</p><p></p><p>Even Tian Yang's sturdy puppet body directly disappeared the instant it was struck by them.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the surface of Tian Yang's body was already riddled with holes.</p><p></p><p>While trying his best to dodge, Tian Yang took out a black circular stone.</p><p></p><p>With a light pinch, the black stone turned into a liquid and merged into the holes on his body.</p><p></p><p>It repaired his injuries.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Ling, the pressure wasn't as great.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the same Dao-Unifying cultivation, this body wasn't where her true self resided. It was just energy taking form.</p><p></p><p>Even if a black tentacle hit her and destroyed a part of her, with a flash of green light, Lin Ling quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>And after repairing herself dozens of times like this, her aura didn't fluctuate or weaken in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on. I've used the formation to cut off her connection with</p><p></p><p>The connection between heaven and earth, such a large-scale move, surely cannot be sustained for long."</p><p></p><p>"Exhaust her to death!" Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>However, the endurance of Moshi was somewhat beyond Li Fan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>In the underground space, black energy was rampant and surging.</p><p></p><p>Destroying everything it could touch.</p><p></p><p>The momentum was terrifying. If it weren't for Li Fan's advance arrangements and the double concealment of the ancient tree of the earth veins,</p><p></p><p>Even though it was deeply hidden underground, it would probably have been noticed by the cultivators of Qiling State.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Li Fan's consistent prudence and the ample supplies he prepared for Lin Ling and Tian Yang,</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Mozi generation, much stronger than Chi Yan." Li Fan couldn't help but be secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, in this stalemate process, Li Fan, who was calmly observing from the side, also noticed some clues.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that because Moshi had the heavenly duty to repair the underground caves, she could not exert her full power.</p><p></p><p>So after the tentacles struck, the surrounding normal space that was affected only vibrated for a moment before returning to normal.</p><p></p><p>"If she had no restrictions on her attacks, she could easily turn this place into a whole piece of void."</p><p></p><p>"But this would go against her heavenly duty that she was born with. So even if her life is threatened, she cannot go all out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"This can also demonstrate the power of Mosha from another aspect."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to her own amazing strength, Mosha's responsibility is to destroy everything. So she acts without restraint..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was contemplating to himself,</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the attacks had been ineffective for a long time, Moshi finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Without giving Lin Ling and the other two a chance to catch their breath, she changed her attack method in just an instant.</p><p></p><p>Those dark tentacles extending from the void caves broke off and then formed individual, smaller Moshi entities.</p><p></p><p>With flashing movements, they kept approaching Lin Ling and the others.</p><p></p><p>Forming a huge encirclement that kept shrinking towards the center.</p><p></p><p>"Break out!" Li Fan quickly made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang looked at each other, and then Lin Ling turned into a layer of green light, covering Tian Yang's body.</p><p></p><p>The light burst out violently, launching an impact against the rapidly approaching black silhouettes.</p><p></p><p>Black and green lights collided.</p><p></p><p>There was no earth-shattering explosion.</p><p></p><p>There was only the green light rapidly dimming, like a candle in the wind, seeming to be extinguished at any moment.</p><p></p><p>And the black encirclement, like the reef standing firm by the sea, only swayed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Unbreakable.</p><p></p><p>Countless black stones devoured the remaining space for Lin Ling and the other two to move.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they were gradually being forced into a desperate situation, Lin Ling, who had no combat experience at all, panicked first.</p><p></p><p>Her momentum plummeted, and for a moment she even felt a little desperate.</p><p></p><p>Giving up resistance, waiting to die on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang's life..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tian Yang, who had been silent since waking up in this world, finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>With red light constantly jumping in his eyes, he looked at Moshi not far away, without the slightest fear.</p><p></p><p>"Is not inferior to others!"</p><p></p><p>With a somewhat strange roar, a huge energy burst out from within Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>The puppet body instantly expanded hundreds of times, wrapping Lin Ling and charging towards Moshi!</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just a moth to the flame, an egg against a stone.</p><p></p><p>Even if the body was dissolved into the void the moment it touched Moshi's defense line.</p><p></p><p>But Tian Yang still had no hesitation.</p><p></p><p>He launched a resolute death charge!</p><p></p><p>And Lin Ling seemed to be infected by Tian Yang's belief, and an unprecedented strong green vitality surged forth.</p>

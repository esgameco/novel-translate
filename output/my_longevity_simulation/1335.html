        <h1>Chapter 1335</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1324: Pointing to Destroy the Azure Sky</p><p></p><p>Regarding the formation of the high wall, Li Fan had long held two speculations. </p><p></p><p>One possibility was that the high wall was created by the enlightened immortals within the immortal ruins. Similar to the restrictive spells set up by cultivators during seclusion to prevent disturbances.</p><p></p><p>The other possibility was that the high wall was established by unknown existences outside the wall. It sealed off the star sea in order to isolate the catastrophe of the immortal text glyphs that was spreading at that time.</p><p></p><p>Both speculations had some reasoning behind them.</p><p></p><p>The high wall was formless and imageless, yet it could seal off the entire star sea. It was a method that ordinary cultivators could not comprehend, only beings at the immortal realm could achieve such a feat. Although the Dark Star Sea appeared vast and containing countless cultivation worlds to cultivators in the lower realms, immortal beings could see its entirety with a single glance. This area they casually demarcated and sealed off may have been the perfect size to serve as their cultivation grounds.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the star sea was vast and boundless, the Dark Star Sea was certainly not the entirety of the lower realms, perhaps not even a corner of it. After the great catastrophe in the immortal realm, the Xuanhuang realm was where the Xuantian King ascended to immortality and returned, and where the Faceless Immortal escaped. Outside the Dark Star Sea, was it possible there were no other survivors from other immortal realms? After discovering the anomaly in the Xuanhuang realm's star domain, taking precautionary measures was also very likely.</p><p></p><p>"With the collapse of the immortal realm, the vast lower realms instead became a battlefield where various powers converged. What kind of scene lies beyond the high wall now?"</p><p></p><p>"Are those surviving immortals still in a dominant position? Or have the former cultivators risen up and found a way to fight against the immortals? Or even developed a civilization capable of hunting immortals?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmly pondered, a longing rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His heart surged with emotions, unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"It's coming soon. In this life, with the Xuan Immortal Boat taking the lead to leap over the high wall, even if they ultimately fail, I can help them summarize and continue in the next life."</p><p></p><p>"At most three to five times, we will have a great chance of crossing the high wall."</p><p></p><p>"And after I achieve the Dao by becoming a celestial and earthly immortal embryo, becoming the strongest in the Dark Star Sea, I can also maximize the unification of the powers of Xuanhuang and the Immortal Boat, and begin to explore beyond the high wall."</p><p></p><p>"Just like how I gradually explored the Cong Cloud Sea and the Xuanhuang realm from the Greater Xuan Minor World back then!"</p><p></p><p>In a slight daze, the scenes of him painstakingly breaking through the Immortal Extinction Formation and arriving in the cultivation world flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's dangerous beyond the high wall, I'm not the same as before."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered: "The difference in levels..."</p><p></p><p>From an elevated perspective overlooking the star sea below the high wall, the insights that arose in his heart were dozens of times more active than when he was comprehending the Dao in the star sea.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the things he naturally comprehended while at this peak state were naturally at a higher level than his normal state.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was truly comprehending the Dao from the perspective of an immortal!</p><p></p><p>"Why are all beings beneath immortals like ants?"</p><p></p><p>"With a single glance, an immortal could destroy the Xuanhuang realm. Even the strongest ordinary cultivator would have to expend great effort to destroy such a vast world."</p><p></p><p>"It's because immortals stand high enough. In the eyes of immortals, a mere realm is but a tiny speck!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the scenes he witnessed from the peak of the Remnant Realm Great Wall before.</p><p></p><p>The continuous remnant realm fragments gradually shrank and twisted into rings as the height increased, eventually converging into a single point.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the enormity of the Remnant Realm Great Wall, the current Xuanhuang realm was also an insignificant tiny fragment.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wall became a point.</p><p></p><p>And to view the Xuanhuang realm as a point didn't even require ascending to such heights.</p><p></p><p>Reminiscing on the feeling of continuous ascension, in Li Fan's eyes, the scenes of the Greater Xuan Minor World and the Xuanhuang realm twisted and shrank.</p><p></p><p>Although they hadn't reached the point of converging into a single point, it was as if he was gazing down from outside the realm, appearing as a puff of yellow mist.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak! Although by chance I've gained the perspective of an immortal, the actual actions are a completely different concept..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried several times, but the results were the same.</p><p></p><p>His body seemed to be outside the world, unable to effectively manipulate anything. Moreover, because of these few attempts, his internal energy was rapidly consumed. Even with Li Fan's current foundation, he was at his wits' end and nearly depleted.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew he couldn't force it, and quickly fell from the heights.</p><p></p><p>Only when his perspective lowered did his movements become unrestrained again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let out a long breath, recovering from the previous consumption.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his gaze slightly focused as he discovered something strange.</p><p></p><p>According to his original recovery rate, he should have regained his peak state after just a few breaths. After all, he had the foundation of the Five Phase Grand Heaven, and had also absorbed the Annihilation Transformation of the Xuanhuang realm. The energy that could be unleashed when the integrated realms faced the crisis of annihilation was immense. For an individual cultivator, it was almost inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Fan had only attempted to act from the "heights", and it had drained his energy reserves in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Not only has the height changed, but the consumption required to operate and move normally has also increased exponentially."</p><p></p><p>"This is also one of the fundamental reasons for the gap between immortals and mortals. Spiritual energy, even the spiritual energy of an entire world, is insufficient to sustain the consumption of acting from the 'heights'."</p><p></p><p>"The energy level is too low, I need to find a higher-level substitute."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal spiritual qi..."</p><p></p><p>Various realizations flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>With a step forward, Li Fan left the Greater Xuan Minor World and entered another primitive forest world without any human presence.</p><p></p><p>After resting, Li Fan attempted to elevate himself again.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, Li Fan controlled the rate of height increase. When the primitive forest in front of him shrank to the size of a glass bead, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, who was originally at the lowest point, merely maintaining the "height" required the consumption of a tremendous amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he didn't choose to fill it with his own spiritual energy, but rather with the source essence that was very close to immortal spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>A golden light enveloped him, and the binding sensation loosened slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was much easier compared to being completely frozen before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the world that appeared like a glass bead and slowly extended his right index finger.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>As if sensing a fatal crisis, a mournful song suddenly resonated in the sky of this primitive world.</p><p></p><p>However, it was destined to be unable to stop what was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>Above the azure sky of the primitive world, a finger also appeared in sync.</p><p></p><p>With a slight force...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt some resistance.</p><p></p><p>The golden source essence roared and raged.</p><p></p><p>The resistance was instantly shattered like paper.</p><p></p><p>The finger shadow above the azure sky, like a cloud covering the entire sky, completely overshadowed the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Without alarm...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A earth-shattering explosion sound.</p><p></p><p>It was merely a light sound of glass being shattered. </p><p></p><p>The small uncivilized world, in an instant, was reduced to ashes and smoke!</p><p></p><p>A raging hurricane, caused by the destruction of the world, spread through the void.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how it blew, Li Fan remained standing upright within it.</p><p></p><p>Under the golden light protecting his body, the storm could not harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>He squinted his eyes, looking at his own fingers. </p><p></p><p>Still immersed in the might of that world-ending finger strike from before.</p><p></p><p>The massive consumption of quintessential spiritual power had caused him to fall from the "heights" and return to a normal perspective. But with such ease, he had wiped out an entire small world.</p><p></p><p>This truly gave Li Fan an illusion of being an supreme divine being.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, taking a long time to dispel this disorienting feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Back then when the True Immortal of Xiandu obliterated the Xuanhuang realm with a single glance, at its root, it was no different from what I just did. It's just that He stood higher, able to wield even greater power..."</p><p></p><p>"Given enough time, in the future, I could also achieve that."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gently touched the tip of his right index finger, as if brushing off non-existent dust.</p><p></p><p>"This technique, descending from above, like the True Immortal's pointing finger..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the Dust Descending From the Nine Heavens Finger!"</p><p></p><p>"It is both the True Immortal descending into the mortal dust, and the True Immortal's power subjugating the mortal dust."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Sensing divine consciousnesses approaching to investigate the inexplicable destruction of this small world, Li Fan transformed into a sword shadow and directly left.</p><p></p><p>The small uncivilized world was too tiny, its disappearance would not affect the overall stability of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Great Xuanhuang, Li Fan savored the feeling of executing the Dust Descending From the Nine Heavens Finger, while pondering how to release this divine ability more easily in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Dust Descending From the Nine Heavens Finger, though immensely powerful enough to destroy worlds, its shortcoming was also evident.</p><p></p><p>The time required to execute it was too long. Just ascending to a certain height required Li Fan to accumulate power for a long time.</p><p></p><p>And then he had to further gather quintessential spiritual power to be able to act freely at that specific height...</p><p></p><p>If the target was a world, it was fine. After all, a realm would not move, its specific location would not change.</p><p></p><p>But if the target was a cultivator, they might not give Li Fan so much time to prepare.</p><p></p><p>"One way is to use a formation to ambush them in advance, trapping them to buy me enough time."</p><p></p><p>"As for the other way..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's current realm was highest in formations among all his cultivation paths.</p><p></p><p>Having now comprehended a near-immortal divine ability, yet unable to freely execute it, he habitually thought to seek a breakthrough from formations.</p><p></p><p>"All paths under Heaven originate from the same source. Divine abilities may be transformed into formations, and formations may be transformed into divine abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Ever since ascending to the peak, Li Fan felt his thoughts were more active than ever before.</p><p></p><p>The lofty vantage point allowed him to contemplate problems from perspectives transcending the mundane.</p><p></p><p>"Evolve the Terminal Separation Disk!"</p><p></p><p>Temporarily setting aside all other tasks, Li Fan poured his experience at the foot of the great wall, as well as his insights into executing the Dust Descending From the Nine Heavens Finger, all into it in one go.</p><p></p><p>Because the demand to directly transform this divine ability into a formation clearly exceeded the Terminal Separation Disk's processing capabilities, its simulated persona directly displayed a frozen state.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan pondered briefly.</p><p></p><p>Then he changed his strategy.</p><p></p><p>Rather than demanding to directly transform the Dust Descending From the Nine Heavens Finger into an array formation, he would first transform the steps of its execution into a series of graded formations.</p><p></p><p>Just like how several ancient immortal formations ultimately constituted the great formation spanning the starry void of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan planned to use a series of linked formations to achieve the rapid execution of the Dust Descending From the Nine Heavens Finger.</p><p></p><p>"First and foremost, naturally, is ascending to the heights."</p><p></p><p>So-called ascending to the heights was actually stimulating energy to raise its "position" in this expanse of starry space.</p><p></p><p>"To accomplish this, perhaps I need to collect enough power of True Immortal runes, and then detonate it concentrated at the great wall, as the Xuan Immortal Ark had planned."</p><p></p><p>"But on one hand, I do not currently aspire to topple the great wall with just one finger strike. So the stimulated energy required is not as terribly immense as imagined."</p><p></p><p>"On the other hand..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind flashed back to the peaks converging in the depths of the Gloomy Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can take inspiration from the Soul Gathering Ascension Formation," Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The reason the Soul Gathering Ascension Formation can easily form a rare energy peak in the Dark Star Sea is because it is built upon the remains of True Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"If I also use True Immortal remains as the formation materials..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's train of thought was instantly unblocked.</p><p></p><p>A red glow flashed in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Constantly squirming, exuding an ominous, eerie aura.</p><p></p><p>It was the remnants of True Immortal flesh and blood that had been stimulated by the ancient runes on the Bone Hand of the Qian and Kun from within Oushan Tian's body.</p><p></p><p>"Without immortal spiritual power, but being of True Immortal origin, it should still be of some help, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan muttered to himself, using this mass of True Immortal flesh and blood as the raw material to begin his first experiment.</p><p></p><p>With the Soul Gathering Ascension Formation as a template, the Terminal Separation Disk's evolution process went smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the embryonic form of a new formation was born.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used quintessential spiritual power to lay out the formation, mixing in the constantly squirming True Immortal flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the preparations were complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan studied it with narrowed eyes, then activated the formation.</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>Then a brilliant, dazzling pillar of light was born within the formation.</p><p></p><p>Fueled by the True Immortal flesh and blood, the radiance was blinding.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan even more delighted was that in his perspective, this pillar of light was not merely bright.</p><p></p><p>It was slowly ascending, continuously climbing higher and higher above all living beings!</p><p></p><p>"This smooth?"</p><p></p><p>Just as that thought emerged in his mind, the pillar of light that seemed capable of illuminating the entire horizon suddenly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was momentarily dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>After examining, he realized it was not an issue with the formation itself.</p><p></p><p>Rather, the True Immortal flesh and blood used as fuel had been completely consumed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly: "The efficiency is still a bit low."</p><p></p><p>"There's room for improvement."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it's not just the Bone Hand of the Qian and Kun."</p><p></p><p>"There should be other True Immortal remains in the Xuanhuang realm, perhaps I can collect them all..."</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the Ascension Formation was not merely to rapidly execute the Dust Descending From the Nine Heavens Finger.</p><p></p><p>Being able to elevate one's position, it may play an indispensable role in crossing the great wall, or even achieving True Immortality in the future.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed great importance on this.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily setting aside all other matters, he focused all his mental energy on researching it.</p><p></p><p>Under the evolution of the Terminal Separation Disk and Li Fan's personal guidance and modifications, the Ascension Formation went through over a thousand iterations in just seven days.</p>

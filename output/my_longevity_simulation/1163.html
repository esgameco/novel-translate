            <p>Chapter 1161: Sword Pointing at the Fishing Pond</p><p></p><p>After suffering such a big loss at the hands of Mo Rubin and Tian Xuanjing, it was absolutely impossible for Li Fan not to have any thoughts of revenge.</p><p></p><p>However, as one of the Dharma Kings of the Xuantian Sect, Mo Rubin's abilities were too mysterious. He could even infiltrate the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance as if entering an uninhabited area.</p><p></p><p>Although he later died inexplicably in the Youjie realm, Li Fan currently didn't have a hundred percent confidence in subduing him.</p><p></p><p>Without a fundamental conflict of interest, Li Fan had no intention of provoking him in this lifetime for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can secretly learn how the Wanxian Alliance dealt with this Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>According to the normal historical trajectory, Mo Rubin would be dug out by the Wanxian Alliance without awakening.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps within the Wanxian Alliance, there might be some special means to deal with members of the Xuantian Sect. Under the preemptive strike, Mo Rubin may have indeed lost the power to resist.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan could learn from it and deal with Mo Rubin like this in every future life.</p><p></p><p>But if Mo Rubin was just pretending to be subdued like in the 119th world, and actually took the opportunity to infiltrate...</p><p></p><p>Then before finding an exact way to deal with him, Li Fan would not actively become enemies with Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>As for Tian Xuanjing.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a Tian Xuanjing origin, he was already in an invincible position. </p><p></p><p>Now that he had mastered the method to peek into its interior...</p><p></p><p>Rejecting heaven's gift would only bring misfortune upon oneself!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind quickly pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance searching for Mo Rubin in the ruins of major sects is to promote finding the ultimate method to restrain Tian Xuanjing. There should be a quiet push from the Zhangjing lineage behind this."</p><p></p><p>"Cang, Fu, hehe. These two are not easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>"But it's also where my opportunity lies."</p><p></p><p>With surging thoughts, Li Fan once again turned into a virtual light and entered the Wuliang Mirror.</p><p></p><p>He continued to construct formations inside to consolidate control.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for Sun Luyuan to return to the secret room, he also took the opportunity to study the traces of the immortal-level grand formation remaining in the Wuliang Mirror.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Daqi, Shengjing.</p><p></p><p>During this period, with Wang Xuanba sparing no effort to travel all over the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Yin Shangren, Ou Daozi and his son, Xi Menyu and other "Xuanhuang Stars" selected by Li Ping were all persuaded by Wang Xuanba with the rhetoric of the Holy Emperor's teaching and came to Shengjing of the Holy Dynasty in Daqi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not everyone on this list was convinced. Not only did they refuse the invitation, some even killed Wang Xuanba's avatar.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba was not angry, he just wrote down these people's names, reported to the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And then skipped them and went to invite the next person.</p><p></p><p>After the Xuanhuang stars arrived in Daqi, they all settled down in the Holy Dynasty like Yin Shangren under Li Ping's personal reception.</p><p></p><p>For example, Xi Menyu, Li Ping promised to help him deepen his research on the power of earth veins. And he also revealed some important news about the ancient earth vein trees.</p><p></p><p>For example, Ou Daozi would be responsible for the construction of the new Shengjing in Daqi. And in the future, every small world conquered by the Holy Dynasty would be comprehensively transformed by Ou Daozi as the chief planning designer.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, Li Ping saw at a glance that Ou Shangtian possessed two strange objects, the Kunqian Bone Hand and the Book of Ten Thousand Deaths. Subsequently, he accepted Ou Shangtian as his personal disciple.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian did not feel the slightest malice from Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the various interesting secrets of the cultivation world and many profound principles of the great Dao mentioned by the Holy Emperor in his conversations indeed deeply attracted the young Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>So he willingly became his disciple.</p><p></p><p>In one's life</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>There are only three things people seek: fame, fortune, and fulfillment. </p><p></p><p>And these are all things that the Holy Emperor Li Ping can satisfy for them.</p><p></p><p>As for those who do not answer the summons...</p><p></p><p>Their fate has already been decided in Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Even deeper than the underground chamber of Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>An organization called the Jiantian Department, the secret intelligence agency of the Holy Dynasty, has been gradually established. </p><p></p><p>As the central node of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Formation, under the coverage of the formation, all affairs within the small worlds can be fully observed.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the future when the Holy Dynasty opens the path of conquest and incorporates the other small worlds into its territory one by one. They will also be strictly monitored by the Jiantian Department.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>In Li Ping's vision, the name Jiantian is not only aimed at those small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Even the Xuanhuang Realm itself is to be included.</p><p></p><p>With the paper men of the Duguo Sect and the Tianxuan Mirror as the foundation, it is not difficult to build a rough intelligence system.</p><p></p><p>The secret agents of the Jiantian Department will be personally selected by Li Ping. </p><p></p><p>The impact of the celestial change "The Heavens Open Their Favor, All Stars Descend to the World" on the small worlds of the Great Qi has begun to show. Among the babies born in the Holy Dynasty recently, there are many who are born with extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Doctors are all over the place. As soon as a baby is born, Li Ping will immediately sense their physique.</p><p></p><p>They will receive Li Ping's personal training from a young age. When they grow up, they will either go to the Jiantian Department or participate in Yin Shangren's new law deduction plan...</p><p></p><p>Whether it is talent or the growth of the empire, it all takes time.</p><p></p><p>The Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty is developing at an extraordinary speed, but at present, what attracts the most attention in the Holy Dynasty is a grand competition.</p><p></p><p>A fishing competition.</p><p></p><p>Personally ordered by the Holy Emperor, anyone who is interested can participate, regardless of whether they have any previous fishing experience.</p><p></p><p>Each region will first decide on the winners, and then they will go to the Holy Capital to participate in the final competition.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Holy Emperor will also make an appearance and enjoy the event with the people.</p><p></p><p>The top one hundred in the competition will all receive generous rewards, enough to provide for an ordinary family for a lifetime without worrying about food and clothing.</p><p></p><p>And if one performs well in the competition, it is said that there will be additional unique rewards from the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The news has been out for half a month, and the number of respondents is countless.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the assistance of the Holy Dynasty's immortal masters in various places, I'm afraid all the fish in the rivers would be caught, resulting in the embarrassing situation of no fish to catch.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the common people, the Holy Emperor's disciples will also participate in the competition.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly further stimulates people's enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that the Holy Emperor has said publicly more than once that he has no descendants now and will not have any in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor has no heirs.</p><p></p><p>His disciples are undoubtedly the successors of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>If one can be noticed by the Holy Emperor in the fishing competition and be accepted as a true disciple...</p><p></p><p>The fish leaping through the dragon gate is today!</p><p></p><p>Stimulated by various rumors, the current obsession with "fishing" among the people of the Great Qi has even reached a somewhat crazy level.</p><p></p><p>It is even more important than studying and cultivating.</p><p></p><p>And all of this, Li Ping naturally sees.</p><p></p><p>The reason for allowing it and even helping to push the wave is naturally for the treasure of the Fishing Pool.</p><p></p><p>This immortal artifact is even beyond the existence of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>There are countless opportunities within it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps hidden within it is his method of breaking the situation.</p><p></p><p>He certainly won't miss the opportunity to acquire a large number of divine objects at no cost.</p><p></p><p>Casually fishing out a secret treasure from it may greatly increase the combat power of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>That's it for today...</p><p></p><p>Writer's block is terrible...</p>

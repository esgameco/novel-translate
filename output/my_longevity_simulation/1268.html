            <p>Chapter 1265: The Mysterious Island</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I don't think I can take it anymore!" The pained voice of Sun Luyao, the spirit of the Infinite Mirror, faintly transmitted from within the mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you won't die." Li Fan seemed not to have heard him. Not only did he not stop the Infinite Mirror from peering, but he also sent out a spell to control it, emitting a faint light towards the Great Vortex of the Rift once again.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, many patterns suddenly appeared on the surface of the Infinite Mirror. They perfectly overlapped with the cracks on the mirror's surface. Amidst the clear and ethereal light, these wounds were slowly healing.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..." Sun Luyao let out a contradictory sound that seemed both painful and pleasurable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the fragmented images flashing in the mysterious light of the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what exactly happened here back then."</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Creation Stone Tablet did record the event of the demon beasts tearing through the realm and leaving.</p><p></p><p>However, after an earth-shattering and heaven-destroying force erupted from Mount Nanming, the Xuanhuang Stone Tablet lost its ability to monitor this place.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the energy disturbance slowly subsided and this place became visible again that the once sacred mountain of the demon race and all the demon beasts had disappeared without a trace. Only a terrifying hollow wound remained, unhealed for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan used the Infinite Mirror not only to find out whether the demon race had successfully escaped through the rift back then, but more importantly, to try to analyze the method of tearing through the realm.</p><p></p><p>Space was pierced by an unimaginably powerful force, even breaking through the obstruction of the high walls and connecting to the vast sea of stars outside.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, it was as if a seal was stamped in space-time, leaving a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even though time had passed and thousands of years had gone by in a flash, this imprint still remained in space-time itself, not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>By studying and analyzing this rift imprint, it might be possible to recreate the only two successful cases of escaping to the dark starry sea in Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>From the flickering black and white scenes that flashed by like a signal with intermittent interruptions, Li Fan vaguely saw Emperor Yi revealing his true form and making a final mobilization to the demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>He also saw that there were still many demon beasts watching from afar, not following along to leave together.</p><p></p><p>The image flickered, and the giant python coiled around Mount Nanming let out an earth-shattering howl. It wailed and writhed, its body emitting a scorching light. It seemed that something was breaking out from within its body.</p><p></p><p>Yet Emperor Yi, the lord of all demons, watched coldly from the sidelines. It was not until the giant python fell powerlessly onto the sea surface, stirring up towering waves, that Li Fan clearly saw the object inside its body.</p><p></p><p>Shockingly, it was a key that had been enlarged countless times!</p><p></p><p>Ripples instantly surged on Emperor Yi's endlessly squirming body that resembled a gray mass of flesh. Moments later, an indifferent face devoid of any emotion emerged from his body.</p><p></p><p>This face seemed to possess a magical power.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the other restless heads and faces within Emperor Yi's main body instantly settle down and become motionless...</p><p></p><p>The countless demon beasts surrounding Mount Nanming also couldn't help but lower their heads and avert their gazes, not daring to look directly at that face.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who was peering at the image thousands of years later through the rift imprint across the long river of time, felt an instinctive fear in his heart the moment he saw that face, as if directly facing a high-level being.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." For just a moment, the body formed by a strand of divine consciousness became slightly unstable under the pressure of the divine face. After all, that was a virtual image from thousands of years ago, and Li Fan's foundation was incomparable to ordinary people. After a brief adaptation, this formless pressure quietly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent scenes in the rift imprint entered Li Fan's eyes once again.</p><p></p><p>After Emperor Yi's true form revealed the divine face, the huge key with an ancient bronze metallic luster instantly shrank by a circle.</p><p></p><p>Then, under Emperor Yi's manipulation, it flew straight towards the towering Mount Nanming.</p><p></p><p>The top of the key was aimed at the peak of Mount Nanming.</p><p></p><p>A uniform luster instantly spread from that small point to the key itself and Mount Nanming.</p><p></p><p>As if some kind of authentication was completed, moments later, the key and the sacred mountain were bathed in light, becoming ethereal and vaguely invisible.</p><p></p><p>And the countless demon beasts surrounding the sacred mountain, including Emperor Yi, were enveloped in waves of white light, transforming into strands of silk one after another and flying into the bronze key and Mount Nanming.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>A terrifying light, like the explosion of heaven and earth, erupted from above.</p><p></p><p>It obscured all prying eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan endured the white light that pierced his divine soul and continued to peer, all he could see was endless white radiance.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Infinite Mirror had truly reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it seemed to lose its spirituality, unable to even maintain its levitation, and fell from the sky. Sun Luyao, the spirit of the Infinite Mirror, also completely passed out, making no further sound.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered and put away the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>However, his mind kept replaying the scenes he had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>"Previously in the Fallen Immortal Realm, Emperor Yi explained the principle of how Mount Nanming successfully tore through the realm. He said that this place was the end of the world, where the sky and sea meet. Therefore, it gathered many energies that had been drifting and accumulating since the opening of the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that it's not as simple as he said. It's difficult for the Xuanhuang Realm to tear through the realm and leave by relying solely on its own power, let alone some drifting energies."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient bronze key and that divine face should be the key to their successful realm-tearing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered the secret he heard from the Transcending Calamity Sect in this life of the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"The Transcending Calamity Sect found a mysterious power from the rift of the Heavenly Sword Sect that could be used to monitor the Xuanhuang Realm. Once implanted, even the Dharma Transmission would be helpless. And here, at the second realm-tearing site, a mysterious existence beyond the Xuanhuang Realm itself has also appeared."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Xuanhuang Realm is extremely special among the many ancient immortal realms, these two places seem to touch upon the key points."</p><p></p><p>While pondering, Li Fan's figure flickered as he took the Infinite Mirror and left the Great Vortex of the Rift.</p><p></p><p>"The principles of the world, no matter how they change, never deviate from their roots. The fact that the position of 'Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate' was specifically used to supervise and inspect the Xuanhuang Realm indicates that the Xuanhuang Realm definitely has its unique value in the eyes of the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"Just like the myriad islands in the Cong Yun Sea, only those islands with special products will have immortals dispatched by the Myriad Immortal Alliance to guard them and construct island-protecting great formations."</p><p></p><p>"Changing the way of thinking and simplifying the matter, the so-called Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate is equivalent to the Xuanhuang Guardian. And the Xuanhuang Realm is equivalent to one of the islands in the lower realm's starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious power discovered by the Transcending Calamity Sect used to refine the World-Observing Divine Eye, and Mount Nanming opened by Emperor Yi with the ancient bronze key, are probably part of the 'island-protecting great formation' of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a power from the Xuanhuang Realm itself, but constructed by the upper realm."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, based on what Xuantian King learned in the Ascension Passage..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many scriptures obtained along the way, and the derived "Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation", may have also been transformed and constructed on the basis of this world-protecting great formation. Otherwise, it is really hard to imagine how one could build a celestial-level great formation capable of crossing the high walls with just a half-immortal body and relying only on the resources of the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's flying speed became faster and faster, and the many clues in the past mists suddenly connected together in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation can span the endless void and lock onto other immortal cultivation worlds deep in the distant starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"My formation dao level, with the boost from the Ultimate Separation Disc, has already vaguely reached the limit of the mortal realm. Moreover, I already know three parts of the Primordial Xuanyuan Spirit Formation. Even for celestial-level formations, I can be considered to have initially peeked through the door. Even so, I am completely baffled as to how the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation uses those golden chains to accurately lock onto targets in the endless starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"I previously thought it was because my attainments in formations were insufficient, causing the Ultimate Separation Disc to fail in derivation time and time again. The Profound Heavenly King is a scholar among men, with a half-immortal body and formation level even above this extraordinary Ultimate Separation Disc..."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I think about it, perhaps I overlooked an important factor."</p><p></p><p>A glint of brilliance flashed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What if those locked immortal cultivation worlds and the Xuanhuang world share certain commonalities? Relying on this mutual resonance between them, the golden chains of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation can then accurately lock onto each of them one by one."</p><p></p><p>"That is, they all have world-protecting great formations!"</p><p></p><p>"Baihua once said that even the primordial Xuanhuang world was already a behemoth among the many immortal worlds. Her hometown, the Wansheng world, only had the size of a single state."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to analogize the Xuanhuang world to an island in the Congyu Sea. It's like the Liuli Island I went to initially, a relatively large existence. The other worlds and cave heavens it captured are the smaller existences in the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... Perhaps later on, as these worlds slowly drifted towards the immortal ruins, the Xuanhuang world conveniently captured a few more along the way. After the destruction of the Ten Great Immortal Sects, it was taken over by the Dharma Transmission and Heavenly Doctors sects, who patched it up, only then creating the current prosperity of the Xuanhuang world."</p><p></p><p>"If my speculation is correct, then those regions initially captured by the Xuanhuang world definitely had world-protecting great formations."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan seemed to realize something, and his train of thought paused slightly. </p><p></p><p>Initially, the Xuanhuang world simply captured and annexed, unlike the current dismemberment and reorganization.</p><p></p><p>So those devoured regions at the beginning should actually be on the periphery of the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>"The ends of heaven and the corners of the sea. The world's frontier."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Emperor Yi's words seemed to vaguely imply that the Xuanhuang demon beasts came from the outside..."</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the ancient bronze key used by Emperor Yi didn't open the world-protecting great formation originally belonging to the Xuanhuang world itself..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, to verify his speculation, there might be a simple way. </p><p></p><p>He just needed to go investigate thoroughly again.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan changed direction and rushed straight towards the target location.</p><p></p><p>And on the way, Sun Luyao also gradually woke up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, where are we going?" </p><p></p><p>Without any complaints about Li Fan's previous extreme labor exploitation, Sun Luyao just asked with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Going to an interesting place. Take advantage of this interval to rest well. Next, your help may be needed again." Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Luyao's mirror image couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I feel very weak right now..." After being quiet for a moment, Sun Luyao mustered up courage to say.</p><p></p><p>Responding to him was a blob of thick golden substance.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's attention was instantly attracted as if seeing some peerless treasure.</p><p></p><p>He knew this was the miraculous substance Li Fan previously used to attract the eroding wind disaster out of the Infinite Mirror. </p><p></p><p>It had a fatal, irresistible instinctive attraction to him, and his inner intuition told him this substance was greatly nourishing for him.</p><p></p><p>So Sun Luyao immediately shut up and ravenously swallowed the source power essence.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, his spirit shook. The feeling of weakness disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Coming back to his senses from the wonderful taste, Sun Luyao still wanted to please Li Fan and ask for more.</p><p></p><p>But he was sent back to reality by the other party's cold snort.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare make more requests, only hoping to get some more rewards after completing the next task.</p><p></p><p>Before long, passing through the long void passage, Li Fan finally arrived at that deathly silent world full of ashes again.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>At Li Fan's indication, the Infinite Mirror once again released bursts of faint light.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before at the Great Rift Vortex, the probing and analysis this time was undoubtedly much smoother. </p><p></p><p>Very easily, the images in the faint light restored this place.</p><p></p><p>A vibrant world.</p><p></p><p>Living beings died and were reborn in the rivers, achieving a perfect cycle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Not these, go deeper."</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Luyao was immersed in the secondary scenes, Li Fan's voice came.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's mind trembled and he increased the probing power of the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The vibrant scenes became fragmented and ethereal.</p><p></p><p>That river also became dreamy and illusory like starlight.</p><p></p><p>Below all the appearances, crisscrossing lines suddenly appeared on the Infinite Mirror's surface.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>However, the instant he saw these lines, it seemed to trigger some prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao only felt an irresistible burning sensation suddenly assailing him.</p><p></p><p>As if being roasted by flames, the Infinite Mirror seemed about to melt at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao couldn't help howling.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan remained unresponsive as before, pouring down golden source power essence, making Sun Luyao endure the pain and continue probing.</p><p></p><p>Amidst Sun Luyao's miserable screams, the foundation hidden beneath the world's ruins slowly began to appear.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the small world that had already turned to ruins, although those lines were intermittent and seemed to have suffered some kind of blow, covered in a layer of decaying aura,</p><p></p><p>They still ultimately preserved their original form.</p><p></p><p>As more and more lines were probed, the rudimentary form of a formation also emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the space of the Derivation Art Orb,</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Separation Disc temporarily stopped all other tasks and began recording and analyzing these fragmentary formation lines.</p><p></p><p>"Save me..."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this formation relic was too vast. Before even one-tenth of the probing progress was made, Sun Luyao was already on his last breath, about to perish.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

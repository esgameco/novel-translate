        <h1>Chapter 1206</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After drifting in the starry sea for ten thousand years, even without the interruption of civilization, the level of cultivation theory and techniques on the Xuan Immortal Boat had not made much progress.</p><p></p><p>All the realms they encountered were destroyed, and only the destructive remnants of various True Immortal seal characters lingered in the starry sea. As the saying goes, "rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to drink the water." The Xuan Immortal Boat thus placed all its future hopes on the study of this great power. As for other aspects...</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Xuanhuang Realm, which had suffered numerous calamities, they were more than a notch weaker.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, under the extreme environment where different cultivation methods could not be practiced together, the various wonderful techniques born in the Xuanhuang Realm were all existence that could make people exclaim in admiration in the eyes of the Xuan Immortal Boat cultivators.</p><p></p><p>With the foundation of the Wanxian Alliance's cultivation technique library, Li Fan's divine sense quickly found the most suitable set of cultivation methods for Zhao Xian. Of course, in Zhao Xian's own view, this was part of the vast number of techniques derived by the future Dao Institute through the Method Derivation Jade.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual God Integration Technique. A divine technique suitable for cultivators to practice even in situations of extreme lack of resources. It can achieve perfect coordination of divine sense and spiritual power. When either one is strong, it can be converted to the weaker one."</p><p></p><p>"Within the institute, the supply of spiritual power is extremely limited. Providing for my advancement to the Golden Core stage is already the limit. It is impossible to go further. However, I can use secret methods that can increase the power of divine sense to drive the increase of spiritual power..."</p><p></p><p>"In the institute's exchange list, the value of the items needed to perform the secret methods is far less than that of spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian, who was troubled by hitting a bottleneck, suddenly had a flash of inspiration and recalled more from that strange dream of the future. In his excitement, he immediately spent all his accumulated contributions over the years to exchange for the materials needed to temper his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Black God Glue, Red Ancient Essence, Ambition Amber...</p><p></p><p>These ordinary items for calming the mind on the immortal boat were burned and melted by Zhao Xian's flames into a crystal-clear liquid. Then, like a whale drinking water, it continuously entered his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The scorching heat wave almost instantly burned Zhao Xian's divine sense clean.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of blankness in his consciousness, Zhao Xian found that he had adapted to this scorching heat. At the same time, the strength of his own divine sense also began to increase visibly.</p><p></p><p>"It is truly a supreme technique!" Zhao Xian praised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, what Zhao Xian didn't know was that the reason his fragile divine sense at the Qi Refining stage could survive such intense smelting was entirely due to Li Fan's divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Even the majority of the effects of those precious materials refined into the essence were absorbed and refined by Li Fan's divine sense. After all, Zhao Xian only had the cultivation of the late Qi Refining stage, and just sharing a little bit was enough to steadily improve his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>When Zhao Xian woke up from his cultivation, he felt that the strength of his divine sense had almost doubled compared to before, reaching the level of the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this "vast" power of divine sense, his own spiritual power cultivation seemed a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>It felt like a giant manipulating a toy body.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian suppressed his inner ecstasy and hurriedly operated the [Spiritual God Integration Technique]. It was as if an invisible millstone suddenly appeared in his sea of consciousness, crushing the power of divine sense into pure energy to nourish Zhao Xian's body.</p><p></p><p>Without absorbing any spiritual energy, Zhao Xian's cultivation also advanced at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after three days, Zhao Xian's...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>His spirit and spiritual power had reached a balance at the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>"Did I just successfully establish my foundation?" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian, coming back to his senses, looked at his hands in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"This breakthrough was too easy. I didn't feel any of the heart demons or bottlenecks that my master and the senior brothers at the academy mentioned."</p><p></p><p>"After establishing my foundation, my privileges at the academy have also greatly increased. I can exchange for even more resources now. My cultivation will likely progress even faster than before..."</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just a young man. As he fantasized about the future, Zhao Xian found it hard to contain his excitement.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was the image of the immortal boat crashing in that dream of the future that pulled him back to reality.</p><p></p><p>"The road ahead is long and arduous. I still have a long way to go. I must not be complacent."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian was pondering how to further leverage his "prescient" advantage to rapidly elevate his status.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian didn't actually encounter any obstacles in his breakthrough. They had been blocked by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"That fluctuation that appeared out of nowhere, directly pointing at the heart."</p><p></p><p>"It's not the power of the True Immortal Seal Script, but the Heavenly Dao of the Starry Sea..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the Mysterious Immortal Boat, the Holy Fetus Li Fan suddenly had a realization. </p><p></p><p>His body was in direct contact with this space filled with an aura of death. During the crossing to the Dark Star Void, the Holy Fetus Li Fan had already understood that this Dark Starry Sea actually shared a set of fundamental laws with the Mysterious Yellow Realm. Its upper limit was even slightly higher than the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>His Dao of the Sword, which had already reached its limit in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, had unknowingly broken through its original bottleneck and reached new heights during this time crossing the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>And the bottleneck manifested as the "Tribulation of Heaven" in the Mysterious Yellow Realm took on a different form of existence in this Dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Exhorting one to return to the Dao, all hopes extinguished. It's just a breakthrough from peak Qi Refinement, yet it has such power. If I hadn't experienced so much, if my heart wasn't incomparably steadfast..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I would have had to use the Immortal Heart Mantra to resolve it." The Holy Fetus Li Fan inwardly shuddered.</p><p></p><p>In the various illusions carried by that formless fluctuation, the Holy Fetus Li Fan seemed to see scenes of himself successfully breaking through, then going through countless hardships, only to ultimately die from various tribulations.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard he tried, he could not escape the fate of failure.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to return to the Dao, return to the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>The obsession echoed in his sea of consciousness like a demonic chant, persuading him to give up cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao of this Dark Starry Sea is quite interesting. It's somewhat similar to the ancient heart demons recorded in the scriptures of the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Glimpsing a leopard through a tube, one can see that although this starry sea has been shattered by the power of the True Immortal Seal Script, its basic underlying operation is still intact."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan kept pondering. His perspective suddenly expanded, as if he saw a world far vaster than before, enveloping the outside of the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though this world was already riddled with flaws, it still brought new ideas to Li Fan's comprehension of the principles of the world.</p><p></p><p>He savored the contents of the Heavenly Doctor's "Scripture of Mending the Heavens" once more.</p><p></p><p>"If the situation in the Mysterious Yellow Realm is like a terminally ill patient, a patchwork monster resurrected using a borrowed corpse, then this Dark Starry Sea is already long dead, with the vast majority of its body crushed by an immense force, leaving only bits and pieces of limbs behind..."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Yellow Realm can still be salvaged, but this Dark Starry Sea is completely beyond saving."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this is from the perspective of the Heavenly Doctor when he wrote the 'Scripture of Mending the Heavens'."</p><p></p><p>There are still about 12 and a half chapters left.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1202: The Chief of the Dharma Protector Hall</p><p></p><p>The Stone Mother of the Dao Transformation was, after all, an existence that had successfully escaped from the catastrophe of the extinction of the Xuanhuang Realm. Li Fan would not underestimate her.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be in a hurry to succeed. In this lifetime, just be an absolutely reliable partner to gain the trust of the Taiyi Sect, and thus learn more of their hidden information."</p><p></p><p>"As for myself, I will first perfect this data pollution formation. If there's an opportunity, I'll test it out and see the effect."</p><p></p><p>The Yanfa Jue space provided Li Fan with enough safe time without being disturbed by the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Except for occasionally having to deal with the little loli's strikes, other times could be said to be quite leisurely.</p><p></p><p>The communication between the three guardian elders also became less and less, each immersed in their own world.</p><p></p><p>However, on this day, a special group of people came to the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Without the Jianfa Jade Tablet, but with special approval from the Immortal Alliance, they arrived here under the leadership of the chief elder of the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>The usually somewhat lazy Hua Yueye seemed to become a little nervous, greeting repeatedly, "Greetings to Elder Xu."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan noticed that not only the other two guardians, but even the usually carefree and fearless little loli Yanfa Jue also restrained herself a lot.</p><p></p><p>While bowing along with the others, Li Fan looked at the white-haired old man in front of him who seemed to be blind in both eyes, and the information about this chief of the Dharma Protector Hall flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yuanxian has been serving as the chief of the Dharma Protector Hall for more than three thousand years. Although he appears to be approachable on the surface, he actually has a strange and rigid temper. He adheres to the rules of the Immortal Alliance to the point of dogma, showing no favoritism. Even when Dharma Transmitters occasionally come, wanting to break the rules is not allowed. He is valued by Dharma Transmitter Jiang, and although other Dharma Transmitters dislike him, they can't do much about him."</p><p></p><p>"Since he can serve as the chief of the Dharma Protector Hall, Xu Yuanxian's own strength must be unfathomable, not something ordinary Harmonized Dao can compare to. The only record of the Myriad Immortal Alliance executing a Harmonized Dao and retrieving leaked techniques was done by this person. Clean and neat, not even giving bystanders time to react."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yuanxian explained the purpose of this visit, "The Immortal Alliance's grand examination just ended not long ago, and these youngsters are all top performers. The Dharma Transmitter Council has specially approved, allowing them to use Yanfa Jue to extrapolate a Harmonized Dao level technique once."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"How can this be?!"</p><p></p><p>The three guardians and the little loli Yanfa Jue were all a bit surprised. </p><p></p><p>The little loli mumbled with her mouth, still wanting to complain.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Xu Yuanxian's expression, she timidly swallowed her words back into her stomach.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reacted the fastest, nodding and saying, "Please Chief, present the council's dharma seal."</p><p></p><p>He was solemn, not glossing over it at all just because the other party was his top superior.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yuanxian was also very cooperative, sending out a dharma seal.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Dharma Transmitter aura circulating on it, Li Fan seriously checked the information explanation in it. Only after that did he nod to indicate the inspection passed.</p><p></p><p>Postponing the cultivators originally waiting for extrapolation, Li Fan arranged for Yanfa Jue to solve the task of these new Immortal Alliance cultivators first.</p><p></p><p>A total of sixteen people, of different ages and realms.</p><p></p><p>The huge Yanfa light sphere kept rotating, and the little loli grumpily carried out the extrapolation work.</p><p></p><p>While this group of people were queuing up waiting for their techniques to be extrapolated, Li Fan curiously asked Xu Yuanxian via voice transmission, "Chief, forgive my ignorance, these cultivators... don't seem to have particularly good aptitude. Why is the Immortal Alliance treating them so favorably?"</p><p></p><p>The voice transmission did not avoid the other two guardians, and they also looked curious.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, only silence greeted them.</p><p></p><p>The two guardians tactfully withdrew their gazes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't continue to ask, and the ceremony fell into an eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until all sixteen people had completed the derivation of their techniques and were about to leave that Xuyuan Xian suddenly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I also want to know the answer to this question."</p><p></p><p>"But there are too many unknown things in the world, and there's no need to know everything. Just do your own job well."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Council of Law Transmission has decided this, they must have their reasons. As subordinates, we just need to follow orders."</p><p></p><p>The three guardians bowed their heads, indicating they had learned their lesson.</p><p></p><p>Only after Xuyuan Xian had completely left the Yanfa Ju space did they dare to start chatting.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, he really lives up to his reputation of being rigid."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, your reaction was so fast this time. The Chief likes how you just did things according to the rules. It's settled, you've caught the Chief's eye. In five hundred years, when you go out, he'll choose you to be the next Chief." Hua Yueye teased.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't pay attention to their banter. First, he recorded and reported the special use of Yanfa Ju according to the rules.</p><p></p><p>Then he said lightly, "Being the Chief of the Dharma Protector Hall is even more imprisoning than our job. I have no interest."</p><p></p><p>"I have a lovely wife waiting for me to go home."</p><p></p><p>Half-jokingly, it made the two guardians laugh.</p><p></p><p>This matter was just a small episode experienced in the process of guarding Yanfa Ju.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they put it out of their minds.</p><p></p><p>Of course, except for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>Among those sixteen people just now, there was surprisingly a mole from the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty who had infiltrated the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>His name was Yang Fei.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew him, but he didn't know Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't affect Li Fan's vigilance.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance never does meaningless things. These sixteen people had just joined the Myriad Immortals Alliance and received such preferential treatment. It was hard for Li Fan not to suspect that there was some conspiracy behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be like the previous [Immortal Chosen], used as sacrifices to awaken the power left by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable in the stone statues in various places? No, if they were sacrifices, they would be destined to die. There's no need to waste Yanfa Ju's computing power..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly sensed the abnormality behind this.</p><p></p><p>And in the underground secret room of the Sun family, his avatar finally waited for the right opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan came to the secret room again, his eyes red.</p><p></p><p>With a struggling expression, he finally took out a Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Then, using his own essence blood, he nourished Sun Luyao in the Wuliang Mirror while explaining, "The pressure from above is too great, forgive your brother."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought I could stick to my oath and never give in. But looking at the faces of the Sun family..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao transformed into a black shadow, revealing his figure, and comforted according to Li Fan's avatar's instructions, "Brother, I understand. It's okay, just leave it to me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Luyuan trembled slightly, his fists clenched so tightly that his nails dug deep into his flesh.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the information about [Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty] that he had searched for before couldn't help but flash through his mind again.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, we can try to make contact with them."</p><p></p><p>"Being a dog for a lifetime also comes with the risk of being beheaded at any time. Maybe this Great Enlightenment can really give me some surprises."</p><p></p><p>The Wuliang Mirror pretended to search for information related to the Tianxuan Mirror clone in the Tianxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was trying to find out the reason why those sixteen cultivators would receive such preferential treatment.</p><p></p><p>There are still twelve and a half chapters left.</p>

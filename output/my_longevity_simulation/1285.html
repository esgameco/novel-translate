        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1281: Reunion in the Starry Sea (7k words)</p><p></p><p>A large number of corpses of Dao Realm cultivators floated chaotically like kites tied to strings. The expressions on their faces still maintained the joy of escaping from the catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..." </p><p></p><p>Looking at these faces that were still lively not long ago but now completely frozen, Guan Xing Xiu could no longer bear it. The Falling Star Divine Sword turned into a golden light and slashed straight ahead.</p><p></p><p>A green figure suddenly appeared and blocked the sword light.</p><p></p><p>Ice crystals bloomed like flowers at his fingertips, and the surrounding air seemed to condense, freezing the Falling Star Divine Sword in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... Qing Shuang?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Guan Hai exclaimed in surprise when he saw this familiar yet unfamiliar figure.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the one who cast the spell to stop the Falling Star Divine Sword was none other than Dao Realm Qing Shuang, who had been drained of his inner core and had fallen not long ago.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Guan Xing Xiu narrowed his eyes, unable to hide his shock.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, Old Guan. This Qing Shuang is not Ji Wan Tao himself, but the Primordial Spirit of Heaven and Earth!" Xu Guan Hai also realized the truth in an instant and shouted a warning.</p><p></p><p>The five surviving Dao Realm cultivators suddenly became tense again.</p><p></p><p>After careful observation, they found that the appearance of this Primordial Spirit Qing Shuang was no longer the originally blurry face, but very similar to the appearance of Immortal Lord Ji Wan Tao when he was alive.</p><p></p><p>What made them even more horrified was that a thin thread extended from behind the new Primordial Spirit Qing Shuang, stretching into the void.</p><p></p><p>The thin threads were exactly the same as the murderous weapons they had previously discovered the flying ship used to kill Dao Realm cultivators. </p><p></p><p>And as they confronted the flying ship, a large number of thin threads stretched out from the void.</p><p></p><p>One familiar face after another seemed to float out from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the five survivors.</p><p></p><p>Sun Lu Chang's face turned pale, and his body trembled uncontrollably: "How is this possible? Even if they're dead, the Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth can still be extracted and refined? What kind of evil technique is this..."</p><p></p><p>But Zi Mei seemed to be pondering: "This place is far from the Xuanhuang Realm and deviates from the laws of Heaven and Earth, so naturally it has lost its effect. If some special methods are used, it may be possible to impersonate the Heavenly Dao and accept these Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Guan Hai smiled bitterly: "Old Guan, it seems that we can't escape this catastrophe this time. I, Old Xu, may not be afraid of one or two Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth. But so many... Moreover, there is also this terrifying flying ship."</p><p></p><p>A hint of determination flashed in Guan Xing Xiu's eyes: "Then let's destroy this monster first!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" Just as the Falling Star Divine Sword was about to pierce through the deck of the flying ship, Lan Yu suddenly shouted to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu stepped forward and blocked between the Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth, saying in a deep voice, "Query the probability of completing the current task."</p><p></p><p>The floating Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth all fell into stillness. After a moment, the cold voice of the Revered Flying Ship came: "The feasibility of the current task is extremely high."</p><p></p><p>"Current energy reserve: Sufficient."</p><p></p><p>"Energy replenishment plan suspended."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The voices echoed one after another, and those flying, expressionless Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth were dragged back into the void by those thin threads.</p><p></p><p>Sun Lu Chang wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and let out a long sigh. He still found it a little hard to believe: "It's... it's resolved just like that?"</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu's expression did not relax in the slightest: "It's only temporary. Now it seems that as long as the energy is sufficient and we don't run away, it won't attack us."</p><p></p><p>Guan Xing Xiu nodded and said coldly, "But when its energy is insufficient, it will inevitably hunt and absorb us again. Humph, to think that we are all important ministers of the Immortal Alliance, but now we have become food for this cold and empty device in this void. It's really ironic..."</p><p></p><p>Zi Mei didn't speak, also looking solemn.</p><p></p><p>Only Xu Guan Hai showed a bitter smile and said, "I didn't expect to live a little longer, so it's a gain. Everyone, relax a bit. This thing has swallowed so many Dao Realm experts at once, maybe it can last until we see the Heavenly Venerate, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, they were ambushed before. The five of us join forces and work together to guard against it, maybe we can successfully escape from this ghost place." Xu Guan Hai transmitted this sentence with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"I have the Heavenly Capital Martial Arts Arena. If I open the martial arts formation, it should be able to delay for a while." Lan Yu said.</p><p></p><p>"This place is not suitable for staying long after all. How about we recuperate for a period of time and then break out together?" </p><p></p><p>"If we don't leave, we will definitely die. Let's go all out!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As they communicated with each other, time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>When they had all recovered to their best condition and took action, it was a bit smoother than they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Not only did no Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth come out to stop them, even the Revered Flying Ship itself was like paper, easily torn into pieces.</p><p></p><p>"We... we got out?" Sun Lu Chang was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Guan Xing Xiu looked at the surrounding void with a grim expression.</p><p></p><p>"We're still inside the flying ship! We've been imprisoned!"</p><p></p><p>The Falling Star Divine Sword suddenly burst out with an extremely dazzling light, trying to illuminate the dark space here.</p><p></p><p>But just like the real starry void, this place seemed to be boundless. The light of the falling star also disappeared in an instant like a firefly.</p><p></p><p>"Go!" Guan Xing Xiu still refused to give up and summoned the Falling Star Divine Sword to fly rapidly into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, it disappeared and was completely swallowed by the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The other few also discovered something was wrong and used their own methods. But without exception, none of them could escape from this void prison.</p><p></p><p>"That damn thing never intended to let us go from the beginning. We were planning to escape, but it took a step ahead and ambushed us!" Sun Lu Chang said hatefully.</p><p></p><p>"This place seems to be some kind of formation. It's a bit similar to the legendary 'Taiji Microdust Formation' from ancient times." Xu Guan Hai said in realization after observing for a while.</p><p></p><p>Then he said with some regret, "It's just a pity that I don't know formations, otherwise I could try to break the formation."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell into silence, and then they all focused their gazes on Lan Yu.</p><p></p><p>This veteran Dao Realm expert who had lived for several thousand years should know a bit about formations, right?</p><p></p><p>Under the expectant gazes of the other four, Lan Yu shook his head helplessly, "I do know a little about formations, but the level of this formation..."</p><p></p><p>"Is far above this old man's. I can't see through it." Lan Yu said honestly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, everyone felt a little desperate.</p><p></p><p>A deathly silence enveloped the few.</p><p></p><p>"The formation here is an absolutely closed space. I can't find the exit. But if that Revered Flying Ship wants to kill us again, it will inevitably open a gap. At that time, it will be our opportunity." </p><p></p><p>After a while, Lan Yu suddenly said this, igniting everyone's hope.</p><p></p><p>"I'll open the martial arts arena, and everyone can hide inside to prevent the flying ship from launching a sneak attack again."</p><p></p><p>With that said, a ring-shaped building appeared in the dark void.</p><p></p><p>With no better options, everyone could only fly into it.</p><p></p><p>As the gap closed, the five of them looked at each other, and a surge of fighting spirit suddenly rose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lan, can you control this magic treasure? Now is not the time for sparring! If we waste all our energy, what will we do when the flying ship takes action later?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, Old Guan, why did you sneak attack me?!" Xu Guan Hai shouted.</p><p></p><p>Even if the five forcibly suppressed the restlessness in their hearts, they couldn't help but attack each other.</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu explained a little helplessly, "This treasure was personally passed down by the Great Dharma Master back then. After entering it, one will be forced to engage in martial arts until leaving. It's the nature of the treasure and cannot be controlled. The reason I didn't take out this item before is because of this."</p><p></p><p>"But the intensity of the martial arts can be adjusted. I have adjusted it to the lowest. Everyone, don't suppress the fighting spirit in your hearts, just casually make moves and maintain a state of combat. With the supplies we brought, we don't have to worry about energy consumption."</p><p></p><p>After a round of chaotic fighting, everyone finally slowly adapted.</p><p></p><p>While lightly sparring and competing, they also had peaceful exchanges.</p><p></p><p>"It's good to warm up like this. At the very least, it can ensure that we are always in the best condition to take action at any time." Xu Guan Hai tried to find some positivity in the bitter situation.</p><p></p><p>Sun Lu Chang sighed, "I haven't fought with anyone like this for a long time. Fellow Daoists, please go easy..."</p><p></p><p>Guan Xing Xiu brought the topic back to the main point, "In this desperate situation, we only have one chance. So we must be clear about each other's strongest moves."</p><p></p><p>Guan Xing Xiu's words were agreed upon by everyone.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xing Xiu let out a light shout, and sword light slashed out. In an instant, it seemed as if countless starlight was born from it.</p><p></p><p>The Dividing Star Sword did not hit the other four, but fiercely struck the sky of the martial arts arena.</p><p></p><p>The sky shook, and cracks appeared one after another, but quickly healed.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xing Xiu exclaimed in admiration, "What a great treasure!"</p><p></p><p>The four then demonstrated their own killer moves.</p><p></p><p>As they practiced martial arts, they became more and more tacitly understanding of each other.</p><p></p><p>They even jointly developed a set of combined attack techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the void prison formation, time passed without knowing.</p><p></p><p>The five Dao Realm experts were like sharpening swords, cultivating their essence, energy, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Just waiting for the right moment to slash out the strongest sword.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time...</p><p></p><p>A huge tremor startled them.</p><p></p><p>It was not the trembling of the martial arts arena, but the shaking of the entire dark void outside the martial arts arena.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it originated from the Revered Flying Ship.</p><p></p><p>During the long martial arts cooperation, the five had already achieved a certain degree of mutual understanding.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they reached a consensus and waited for the opportunity to come.</p><p></p><p>Without any sign, the darkness disappeared and light reappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had returned to the cabin of the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>But the five, who had already suffered a loss once, did not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>The strongest combined attack that had been brewing for a long time was directly launched.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Divides the Starry River!"</p><p></p><p>"Dusk Observes the Starry Sea!"</p><p></p><p>"Feather Annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>However, a scene that made them a little desperate appeared.</p><p></p><p>A black hole inexplicably appeared on the wall, directly swallowing the huge destructive power brought by the combined attack of the five.</p><p></p><p>The hole slowly healed, and the wall returned to its original state.</p><p></p><p>And their killing move that they had practiced hard for a long time was like a joke, unable to cause even a bit of damage.</p><p></p><p>The five all turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xing Xiu's dao heart was even damaged, and his figure swayed.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?" He muttered in a completely unacceptable manner, looking dazed.</p><p></p><p>The strongest attack had already failed, and the five felt like ashes in their hearts, almost unable to generate the thought of resistance again.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the Revered Flying Ship shook violently again, waking them up.</p><p></p><p>"No? Is this an attack on the outside of the flying ship?"</p><p></p><p>"The void catastrophe?"</p><p></p><p>The five suddenly realized and showed ecstatic expressions.</p><p></p><p>"We still have a chance!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, they also discovered the abnormality of the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>The previously absorbed Primordial Spirits of Heaven and Earth did not appear.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship also seemed to have experienced a big battle, and tiny cracks could be vaguely seen on the walls.</p><p></p><p>Just as the five were startled and motionless.</p><p></p><p>The cold voice of the Revered Flying Ship sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"The third battle of the unknown civilization in the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Reserve energy has been exhausted."</p><p></p><p>"After deduction, the probability of winning the next battle is zero."</p><p></p><p>"Executing backup plan..."</p><p></p><p>"Transmitting data..."</p><p></p><p>"Initiating self-destruct of the flying ship..."</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu subconsciously opened the martial arts arena again, enveloping the five inside.</p><p></p><p>The other four also used their own methods to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Initiating... Ini... Ini..."</p><p></p><p>However, the thing that stunned them happened again.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Revered Flying Ship seemed to be interfered by something, repeating like it was stuck.</p><p></p><p>But the explosion did not come.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Above the flying ship, huge rumbling sounds were heard again.</p><p></p><p>In the rolling smoke and dust, a circular hole suddenly appeared. More than thirty unknown beings wearing strange armor entered one after another from the hole.</p><p></p><p>They were well-trained and divided ten people to surround Lan Yu and the others.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people continued exploring inside the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lan Yu, you are knowledgeable and experienced. What do you think the current situation is?" Xu Guanhai asked telepathically.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu said a bit uncertainly: "An unknown civilization from the Starry Sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Possibly. Let's not act rashly first, and try to see if we can communicate."</p><p></p><p>After all, they were helpless against this group of mysterious people who easily conquered their esteemed flying boat. The strength of this group could be seen.</p><p></p><p>It's better not to take action if possible.</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, Lan Yu still spoke up and asked: "Fellow Daoists, we mean no harm..."</p><p></p><p>The response from the other side was also very quick, using the same language: "Cut the crap and be quiet!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, we can't break through their protective magic treasure for now, do you want to use the [Immortal Seal] again?"</p><p></p><p>"No rush, just trap them for now. Wait until we tow this flying boat back before deciding."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Seal?"</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu and the others looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The slight shaking of the Wangsheng flying boat broke the stalemate.</p><p></p><p>"Phew...the protection can be removed now."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the relieved voices, another group of people came to the Wangzun flying boat and took over.</p><p></p><p>The leader was a long-haired man wearing a strange Daoist robe, with a broken black jade hairpin on his head.</p><p></p><p>Although the man exuded the same Hedao realm aura as Lan Yu and the others,</p><p></p><p>In addition to that, it seemed to be mixed with another mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>It made the five Hedao cultivators from the Xuanhuang realm subconsciously feel a faint sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Just like facing a terrifying calamity in the endless dark void.</p><p></p><p>"This fellow Daoist..."</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu and the others tried to communicate with the long-haired Hedao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But the other party seemed not to hear at all, and was just muttering to himself: "Sure enough, Brother Zhao was right, a ship was really captured in that direction. This hasn't happened for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Watch them closely!"</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu and the others still wanted to speak, but saw the long-haired man glance at them inadvertently.</p><p></p><p>In his dark eyes, a character appeared like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Appearing in the minds of Lan Yu and the others, it instantly became like heaven and earth, filling their sight, senses, and hearing.</p><p></p><p>Eyes could not see, ears could not hear.</p><p></p><p>They fell into endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, it seemed that with just a light glance from the long-haired Hedao cultivator, the five people including Lan Yu were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Standing there in a daze, losing their senses.</p><p></p><p>The scene was silent. Only after the long-haired Hedao cultivator left did everyone start whispering.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wang is getting stronger and stronger. You know, these few are all undoubtedly Hedao powerhouses!"</p><p></p><p>"What Hedao bullshit, without understanding the power of [Immortal Seal], how are they different from us Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators? They just have more physical strength."</p><p></p><p>"Makes sense."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although the craftsmanship of this flying boat was indeed remarkable, the most crucial thing was that no power fluctuations of true Immortal Seal characters were detected.</p><p></p><p>So the real value was actually ordinary.</p><p></p><p>What the long-haired Hedao cultivator cared about now was something else.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian from the Dao Proving Academy actually predicted the descent of this flying boat from the depths of the Starry Sea...</p><p></p><p>How did he do it?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he secretly comprehended the power of another true Immortal Seal character?</p><p></p><p>The long-haired Hedao cultivator couldn't figure it out after much thought. He subconsciously touched the broken black jade hairpin on his head.</p><p></p><p>"Has this person who has been silent for seven or eight years finally going to show his prominence?"</p><p></p><p>"First, in one day, he entered the Nascent Soul stage in the morning and the Hedao stage in the evening, completely breaking the perception of cultivation speed on the Immortal Boat. Then he comprehended a brand new true Immortal Seal character..."</p><p></p><p>The long-haired Hedao cultivator walked hurriedly and quickly returned to the Severed Immortal Building from the Immortal Boat's docking port.</p><p></p><p>In a quiet and dim secret room, the long-haired Hedao cultivator saw Zhao Xian, who also had disheveled hair.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao." The long-haired Hedao cultivator said softly, without the arrogance he had outside.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian ignored him, closing his eyes, not knowing what he was pondering.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, his fingers lightly moved in the air, muttering something.</p><p></p><p>The ignored long-haired Hedao cultivator was not angry, but instead stared intently at the trajectory of Zhao Xian's fingers in the air, secretly pondering.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Zhao Xian finally spoke: "That flying boat was found?"</p><p></p><p>The long-haired Hedao cultivator nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This Immortal Boat comes from the other side of the Starry Sea, where the ancient Xuanhuang Realm was located."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm, like our Immortal Boat, survived the great calamity. But they still retain a considerable amount of resources..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of shock flashed across the long-haired Hedao cultivator's face.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian continued: "Unfortunately, the Xuanhuang Realm is really too far from us. And it's too close to the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"It's not worth it for the Immortal Boat to make a trip. Of course, the specifics still need to be decided by the Elder Council."</p><p></p><p>As Zhao Xian spoke, he handed a light dot to the long-haired Hedao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After examining the information in the light dot, the long-haired Hedao cultivator's breathing couldn't help but quicken a few notches.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, the long-haired Hedao cultivator asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian smiled slightly: "Although the Starry Sea is vast, in the eyes of true immortals, it can be seen through with a glance. Wang Hai, when you comprehended the true Immortal Seal characters, didn't you have all kinds of visions appearing in your mind?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai naturally wouldn't say no, and nodded: "So that's how it is. Brother Zhao, you really have extraordinary talent!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian accepted it frankly, and then handed over another light dot: "This is my new insight. After you read it, submit it to the Elder Council."</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai took it like a treasure, instantly throwing the previous unpleasantness to the back of his mind, and eagerly started examining its contents.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai was intoxicated, immersed in it and unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a long time later, when the broken black jade hairpin on his head trembled slightly as if it was about to break free at any time, that Wang Hai came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao is truly a great talent!" This time, Wang Hai bowed sincerely, and then left here very excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian, or rather the Holy Fetus Li Fan, watched Wang Hai's departing figure. Feeling Wang Hai's distorted back slowly losing control under the influence of the power of the true Immortal Seal characters, he revealed an imperceptible smile.</p><p></p><p>Due to the inconsistency of the time flow, it had been nine years since Zhao Xian broke through the Nascent Soul stage and was accepted as a core disciple by the Dao Proving Academy.</p><p></p><p>The real Zhao Xian, because he was affected by the illusion created by the Holy Fetus Li Fan, was always tense and worried that the Profound Immortal Boat would be destroyed in the future. Even with Li Fan's help, he was still frequently troubled by heart demons.</p><p></p><p>Even the divine sense that the Holy Fetus Li Fan split off was about to be exhausted, and his situation did not improve.</p><p></p><p>He even repeatedly showed abnormalities, which was noticed by the three elders of the academy, and nearly exposed Li Fan's existence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also vaguely felt that on the path of cultivation, the Profound Immortal Boat was different from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators on the Immortal Boat, whether breaking through bottlenecks or daily cultivation, were extremely susceptible to the influence of heart demons.</p><p></p><p>These heart demons originated from the Dao of the Starry Sea and directly imposed on the cultivators themselves.</p><p></p><p>Every time Li Fan intercepted it for him, the frequency of heart demons appearing afterward became more and more frequent.</p><p></p><p>And as Zhao Xian's actual realm became stronger, the power of these heart demons also increased day by day.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan simply stopped wasting effort on him and directly used the [Dao Pill] technique he learned on the Profound Immortal Boat on Zhao Xian.</p><p></p><p>Merging divine senses and taking over.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally eliminating the possibility of heart demons appearing.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian's own talent could only be described as passable.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised Li Fan was that after the Dao Pill was swallowed, he, who inherited Zhao Xian's body, actually also simultaneously inherited the characteristics of the original inhabitants of the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to Zhao Xian, Li Fan, who had experienced many things, had a strong will.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary heart demons could not shake him.</p><p></p><p>So there were no obstacles in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan, he lurked in the Dao Proving Academy, greedily absorbing the technological accumulation of the Immortal Boat over thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Then he took the initiative to volunteer to represent the academy and come to this Severed Immortal Building.</p><p></p><p>Learning and probing the harmless method of using true Immortal Seal characters mentioned by the Severed Immortal Building.</p><p></p><p>The Severed Immortal Building's words were not false.</p><p></p><p>They indeed mastered the exquisite technique of using a part of the power of true Immortal Seal characters with the body of a mortal cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Hedao cultivator named Wang Hai subdued the five people including Lan Yu with one move before.</p><p></p><p>The key lay in the broken black jade hairpin he wore.</p><p></p><p>This jade hairpin was a destroyed realm artifact collected by the Immortal Boat in the vast ruins. Over the years, it was influenced by the true Immortal Seal characters. The original body thus retained traces of the [Dao] corresponding to the true Immortal Seal characters.</p><p></p><p>And it was also constantly washed by the revolving astral force in the void.</p><p></p><p>The collision of two different true immortal forces created the special existence of this black jade hairpin.</p><p></p><p>The [Entering Dao] method mastered by the Immortal Pivot Court of the Immortal Boat over the years, although also using these destroyed realm artifacts to grasp the residual power of true Immortal Seal characters,</p><p></p><p>But they all selected artifacts that were only influenced by a single true immortal force.</p><p></p><p>The deeper one entered the Dao, the stronger the restraint of the true Immortal Seal characters. Not only would the body undergo some terrifying changes, but even the mind would be affected and become crazy.</p><p></p><p>The Severed Immortal Building unintentionally found these artifacts with the remnants of two kinds of true Immortal Seal character forces.</p><p></p><p>They invoked and studied one of them, and used the revolving astral force attached to it as an existence similar to an [anchor].</p><p></p><p>When entering the Dao too deeply, one could escape from the state of entering the Dao by tracing back the influence of the revolving astral force.</p><p></p><p>Doing so, although the power mastered at the extreme level was not as good as the Immortal Pivot Court,</p><p></p><p>But it was safe and could be promoted to the vast majority of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even if one only had the Nascent Soul realm, with the assistance of special destroyed realm artifacts, after a period of tempering, one could instantly invoke and erupt the power of true Immortal Seal characters.</p><p></p><p>And if fighting in the Starry Sea, and the surrounding environment happened to have the residual power of the corresponding true Immortal Seal characters,</p><p></p><p>Then its power could only be described as terrifying and formidable.</p><p></p><p>Because of the proposal of this method, the Severed Immortal Building later rose and almost completely replaced the Immortal Pivot Court, becoming the true ruler of the Immortal Boat in name.</p><p></p><p>However, considering that the power of senior [Entering Dao] practitioners was still needed in extreme situations, the Immortal Pivot Court was also allowed to remain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan infiltrated the Severed Immortal Building and had also personally tried "entering the Dao" with an anchor.</p><p></p><p>But having witnessed the full eruption of true Immortal Seal characters, how could he look up to this opportunistic method?</p><p></p><p>What he was interested in here was the research on different true Immortal Seal characters.</p><p></p><p>Because the cultivators of the Immortal Boat could only deduce the power source of true Immortal Seal characters through destroyed realm artifacts, it was like a blind man touching an elephant.

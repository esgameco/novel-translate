            <p>Li Fan remained dormant in the Tian Xuan Mirror, quietly awaiting the outcome.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, the exploration of the ruins had not made any significant progress.</p><p></p><p>However, He Zhenghao eagerly sent a message first.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Li Fan, good news."</p><p></p><p>"After some efforts, I have secured three potential positions, each located in a different state."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please advise me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately replied, "Oh? Tell me about them."</p><p></p><p>"The first one is the leader of the Martial Arts Hall in Taihua State."</p><p></p><p>"Taihua State is not far from the Congyun Sea. A mountain range called Taihua Mountains runs through the entire state, which is also known as the state on the back of the mountains."</p><p></p><p>"There are countless mountain peaks. If I go to this state, my cultivation speed will be much faster than in the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The second one is a staff member of the Strategy Formation Hall in Qingwei State."</p><p></p><p>"Qingwei State is south of Tianyu State. Although it is still quite far, it is much closer compared to the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The third one is a city guardian position in Tianyun State."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun State is not far west of Tianyu State. Therefore, the competition for this position is very fierce."</p><p></p><p>"The transfer is only to an equivalent city guardian position."</p><p></p><p>"The advantage is that it is closer to the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance, and promotion is a bit easier than in other places."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao slowly revealed the results of his efforts during this period.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun State..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and replied, "No need to rush to make a decision. I have an acquainted cultivator in Tianyun State. Let me inquire for you and see if we can take it a step further."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was very surprised upon hearing this, "Fellow Daoist, you even have connections in Tianyun State?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I can't guarantee it. Let's give it a try. Fellow Daoist, wait for my news," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao repeatedly agreed.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan contacted Shenyu Zi and explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you have any way?"</p><p></p><p>Shenyu Zi only replied, "I'll ask for you."</p><p></p><p>And there was no further response.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not in a hurry and waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, a cultivator named Jing Xuan Daoist requested to add Li Fan as a friend.</p><p></p><p>Also from Tianyun State.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred, and he quickly accepted.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan's hearty voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you must be Junior Li Fan? I heard from Shenyu that you have a good friend who wants to take a position in our Tianyun State?"</p><p></p><p>"Fourth-level Golden Core, tsk tsk, the younger generation is really impressive."</p><p></p><p>"How about this, ask him if he is interested in joining our Tianyun State Garrison Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, due to the great war a few years ago, there are still some vacancies that have not been filled."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned and couldn't help but ask, "Senior Jing Xuan, what is this Garrison Academy..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that Li Fan didn't even know what the Garrison Academy was.</p><p></p><p>However, he immediately realized that Li Fan came from a remote area and explained, "The Garrison Academy is a unique organization in the hinterland of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It is directly responsible to the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance. Its main duty is to suppress the wicked and maintain the stability of the hinterland."</p><p></p><p>"When necessary, it will also follow emergency orders to go to other states for combat."</p><p></p><p>With Jing Xuan's explanation, Li Fan understood.</p><p></p><p>In essence, it was the same as the garrison camp stationed outside Xuanjing City in Daxuan, which only listened to Li Fan's orders and guarded the safety of the capital.</p><p></p><p>"It should be considered an important position."</p><p></p><p>"But it seems to require frequent battles. I don't know if He Zhenghao, with his current temperament, would agree to it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, exchanged a few words with Jing Xuan, and then contacted He Zhenghao to explain the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Garrison Academy?" This time He Zhenghao was really a bit shocked.</p><p></p><p>When he was young, he had stayed in Tianyu State for a while, so he naturally knew what the Garrison Academy was.</p><p></p><p>Like the Dharma Protector Hall, they were both institutions directly under the command of the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Only below the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Li Fan is truly unfathomable, actually being able to secure this position."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit dangerous, but..."</p><p></p><p>A graceful figure flashed through He Zhenghao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He immediately gritted his teeth and agreed.</p><p></p><p>After learning of He Zhenghao's determination, Li Fan also replied to Daoist Jing Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Great!" Jing Xuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Tell your friend to come to our Tianyun State first and serve as a city guardian."</p><p></p><p>"After three years of accumulating experience, I will use my connections to transfer him into the Garrison Academy."</p><p></p><p>Next, Jing Xuan carefully explained some precautions before ending the communication.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a moment. Although the matter had not been settled yet, he still transferred 100,000 contribution points each to Shenyu Zi and Jing Xuan.</p><p></p><p>As a token of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this expense was recorded under He Zhenghao's account.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Tianyun State.</p><p></p><p>Shenyu Zi, who received the contribution points, was slightly stunned and laughed in spite of himself.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan also immediately sent a message to inquire, "Old Shenyu, did you receive the contribution point transfer from Junior Li? 100,000 contribution points! I remember he is only at the Foundation Establishment stage, right? What a generous gesture!"</p><p></p><p>Shenyu Zi replied with a smile, "Anyway, it's much more generous than when we were at the Foundation Establishment stage."</p><p></p><p>"I only passed on a message and received the same reward as you. Jing Xuan, you won't be angry, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan laughed loudly, "Hahaha, treating us equally, this little kid is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. I find him more pleasing to the eye than that old man Guangwu."</p><p></p><p>"Screw up? Who are you looking down on?" Jing Xuan snorted coldly and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, He Zhenghao's appointment order came.</p><p></p><p>There were no major issues.</p><p></p><p>Guangan City Guardian of Tianyun State.</p><p></p><p>For this, a total of 80,000 contribution points were spent back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was borrowed from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, He Zhenghao was already in debt, so he had no mental burden.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also very generous, lending as much as needed.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, He Zhenghao made a solemn vow.</p><p></p><p>Once he had a stable footing in Tianyun State, he would try to arrange for Li Fan to be transferred there as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't say much, only patting He Zhenghao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>After He Zhenghao left, Li Fan hid in the Tian Xuan Mirror all day, not going out at all, and diligently cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Soon, time arrived at the 23rd year of the Anchor Era.</p><p></p><p>The ruins that had risen into the sky were finally found.</p><p></p><p>It had fallen into a thousand-mile swamp in the center of Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>And when the cultivators began to explore it, the origins of these ruins were also unearthed.</p><p></p><p>The ancient immortal sect, Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although not as renowned as Taishang and Dadao Sect, whose fame was still known to everyone even thousands of years later,</p><p></p><p>It was still a famous and prominent sect before the great calamity descended.</p><p></p><p>According to past experiences of exploring sect ruins, there must be abundant treasures stored here.</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, it immediately attracted many cultivators to venture to Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>Jiushan State, which was already in chaos, became even more turbulent.</p><p></p><p>The level of arrogance could be seen at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The weakness of the Wanxian Alliance's control over Jiushan State could also be glimpsed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it was just a normal ruin exploration, and the Wanxian Alliance had no intention of interfering too much.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, a piece of news arrived, making the Wanxian Alliance furious.</p><p></p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator named Luo Xi from the Five Elders Council came to explore the ruins, which was fine.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he not conceal his identity as a cultivator of the Five Elders Council, but he also relied on his profound cultivation to injure and kill many exploration members of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After entering the ruins and obtaining some unknown treasures, he left with his head held high.</p><p></p><p>On my turf, and still being so arrogant?</p><p></p><p>It was simply a slap in the face.</p><p></p><p>However, doubts also followed.</p><p></p><p>Such behavior carried a clear provocative meaning.</p><p></p><p>Could there be some conspiracy?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Five Elders Council wanted to start another war?</p><p></p><p>Regardless, face could not be lost.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance swiftly dispatched several Nascent Soul experts to Jiushan State to take control of the situation.</p><p></p><p>And issued a stern warning.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators from the Five Elders Council were prohibited from coming to Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>Those who dared to come would die!</p>

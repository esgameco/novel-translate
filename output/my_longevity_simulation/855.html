        <h1>Chapter 855</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What appeared before his eyes was no longer a small pond, but a seemingly endless starry sky!</p><p></p><p>Countless brilliant light spheres were hidden within it.</p><p></p><p>From the fleeting images that flashed above, Ji Shaoli could vaguely see visions of exotic beasts, magical treasures, and even cultivators engaged in battle!</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was sitting atop this starry expanse, casting down a single thread!</p><p></p><p>The innumerable light spheres were like fish in a pond.</p><p></p><p>At first, they were all startled and instinctively fled.</p><p></p><p>But then, some became curious and slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>These light spheres were divided into different colors: white, green, blue, purple, orange, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The white light spheres hardly exuded any special aura.</p><p></p><p>From green to orange, the pressure carried by the light spheres gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>Even the fleeting gold and purple-gold light spheres in this sea of stars contained an aura that made Ji Shaoli, who had seen the Eternal Venerable and the remains of True Immortals, tremble with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"What on earth is this thing..."</p><p></p><p>Even after reincarnating through a hundred lifetimes and witnessing many grand scenes, the sight before Ji Shaoli's eyes still made him instantly lose his mind.</p><p></p><p>His heart and mind were incredibly shaken, losing control of his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he withdrew from the state of fishing in the starry sky!</p><p></p><p>The endless starlight disappeared, and before his eyes was only an ordinary small pond.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli subconsciously clenched his fists and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>With his vast experience, he now realized that he might have found something extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Given his temperament, it took him a long time to completely calm his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Once again, with the pure mindset of an angler, Ji Shaoli cast out his rod!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>There was no change in the scene before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli gripped the fishing rod tightly. After pondering for a moment, he recalled how Master Zhong Shentong and his disciple had only swung out their rods.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is a limit to the number of attempts within a certain time interval," he thought.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a bit disappointed, he put away the fishing rod and removed the concealment technique.</p><p></p><p>He then lurked and spied from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Every day, they lived an ordinary life of eating, resting, and fishing.</p><p></p><p>When it was Zhong Shentong's turn to fish again, he only caught a white light sphere and returned in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>The young disciple also came back empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was Ji Shaoli's turn to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, as an experienced angler, he adjusted his mindset to the optimal state.</p><p></p><p>Then, he cast out his rod!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ji Shaoli once again entered the endless starry expanse!</p><p></p><p>Having seen this magnificent sight before, he was accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>This time, he finally managed to maintain the state of fishing in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Fishing requires bait. What is needed to catch these light spheres?" Ji Shaoli couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the vast majority of the light spheres quickly moved away, leaving only a large empty area, Ji Shaoli couldn't help but think:</p><p></p><p>This place was clearly not within the realm of the Xuanhuang World, but rather a separate space of its own.</p><p></p><p>With only a bare fishing rod, Ji Shaoli's body was merely a simple conceptual existence.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there was no way to add bait to the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they simply take the bait willingly?" Ji Shaoli couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that as time passed, it seemed that the light spheres were getting used to the fishing line he had lowered, and gradually began to approach.</p><p></p><p>Some were even attracted and curiously touched it.</p><p></p><p>When a white light sphere got too close, in an instant-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The fish was tightly hooked onto the fishing line. </p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli only felt the fishing rod sink downwards.</p><p></p><p>Then, instinctively and uncontrollably, he lifted it up.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes shattered, and he was back in the small mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>But in his hand, there was an additional white glowing orb.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, imitating Zhong Shentong's earlier actions, reached out his hand and fumbled around.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after retrieving a dark green stone, the glowing orb slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Now, Ji Shaoli could definitely be considered knowledgeable and experienced.</p><p></p><p>But upon inspection, he discovered that he had never seen a mineral with the texture of the one in his hand before!</p><p></p><p>"Either it's an extremely rare variety. Or it's..."</p><p></p><p>"Not from the Xuanhuang realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The white glowing orb should be from the lowest tier in terms of value in the starry sky. It shouldn't be so precious that I've never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, my guess may not be wrong."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>This fishing pool here should be a supreme treasure from another immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>It might even be an immortal tool from the immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>In his 115th life, at the end of his lifespan, Li Fan, relying on the Medicine King's True Cauldron, rushed to the immortal ruins.</p><p></p><p>There, he saw the remains of a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he was able to experience the might of an immortal.</p><p></p><p>However, at this very moment, from the endless starry sky within this fishing pool, he once again felt an aura equal in power to the remains of a true immortal!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it wasn't just a thread!</p><p></p><p>Those fleeting purple-gold and dark-gold glowing orbs that swiftly passed by in the starry sky gave him a feeling that was undoubtedly not inferior to true immortals!</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be my misconception."</p><p></p><p>"But even if there are some errors, the level of this fishing pool must be extremely high."</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed through Ji Shaoli's eyes. </p><p></p><p>He recalled a rumor he had heard before.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient Xuanhuang realm, immortal tools did exist.</p><p></p><p>However, when the great calamity occurred, all the immortal tools and even the immortals' remains vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this fishing pool is a fortunate immortal tool that remained?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it all because of this fishing pool?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ji Shaoli figured out the possible causes and effects.</p><p></p><p>"This fishing pool is very special. Only by having the mindset of an angler can one discover it. Perhaps this is also the reason why it has been able to remain intact until now."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's thoughts were myriad, and the greed in his heart surged uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>However, with a temperament far superior to ordinary people, he quickly suppressed his desire.</p><p></p><p>Today's attempts had ended, and Ji Shaoli chose not to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he temporarily retreated.</p><p></p><p>On the third day, after Master Zhong Shentong once again caught nothing, Ji Shaoli cast another line in front of the pool.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the power related to [Immortals] that might exist in the fishing pool,</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a wave of agitation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps it was precisely because of this reason that after entering the angling starry space for a moment this time, he was forced to be expelled.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli couldn't help but be slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then it dawned on him: "All treasure seekers and those attempting to explore secrets are not allowed?"</p><p></p><p>"Only true anglers can enter the starry sky."</p><p></p><p>Having figured it out, Ji Shaoli couldn't help but secretly shake his head.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait for tomorrow to come.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he adjusted his own state of mind.</p><p></p><p>After the greed in his heart was completely suppressed, Ji Shaoli successfully entered again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he cast his line with exceptional focus.</p><p></p><p>The fishing line slowly sank, and myriad glowing orbs surged once more.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>There's one more chapter coming a bit later, around 2 o'clock it should be ready.</p>

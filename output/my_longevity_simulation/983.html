        <h1>Chapter 983</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Listening to Lin Ling's earnest words, Li Fan's thoughts instantly locked onto the young Taoist disciple Liuli, who was in the Lingmu Realm. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was standing in front of a world-level furnace with wide eyes, full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the [Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light], it's also a world-level golden light. This little thing is truly not simple."</p><p></p><p>"With an innocent appearance, even I almost overlooked her."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could naturally discern whether Lin Ling was lying or not.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, it seemed as if a pair of invisible giant hands emerged in the Lingmu Realm. In an instant, they captured the young Taoist Liuli and brought her before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Liuli felt her vision blur and the scenery suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>When she saw Li Fan's face, a trace of panic flashed in her eyes. She wanted to say something, her lips moving up and down, but no sound came out.</p><p></p><p>"I heard from Zhong Shentong before that when you were just fished out of the fishing pool, you were still a transparent fruit like crystal."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to emit a golden light, your fruit must also be a great nourishing item."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention of asking questions. Instead, he continuously made hand seals, setting up a furnace-like formation around Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the scorching heat coming from all around, Liuli's face turned pale. She waved her fair arms, desperately trying to explain something.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan paid no attention and seemed to want to refine Liuli on the spot and eat her directly.</p><p></p><p>The immense pressure from all directions quickly made Liuli unable to move. It was as if she was tightly bound by ropes, floating stiffly in the air.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Liuli seemed to have no power to resist, Li Fan narrowed his eyes and continued to strengthen the output of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Inside the elixir furnace formation, nine crimson fire dragons appeared. They let out angry roars and simultaneously spewed dazzling flames towards the bound Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Behind Li Fan, Lin Ling, who was watching this scene, felt a chill in her heart and her body couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect that her master would directly roast Liuli without a word, not even half a sentence of interrogation!</p><p></p><p>With such decisive killing intent, it seemed that if he really wanted to kill her, there would be no hesitation at all.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lin Ling no longer dared to have the slightest bit of disloyalty in her heart.</p><p></p><p>However, in the elixir furnace formation, Liuli did not dissipate in the flames as Lin Ling had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Bursts of dark golden light suddenly erupted from her body, blocking the flames outside.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Li Fan activated the formation, he was always unable to break through the protection of the dark golden light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted lightly and continued to draw the surrounding spiritual energy, constantly generating molten fire to roast Liuli.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't really trying to kill Liuli, but was using this method of slowly turning up the heat to force out Liuli's true form.</p><p></p><p>Inside the furnace formation, the two forces continued to confront and be in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Releasing the dark golden light to protect her body seemed to have produced a higher burden on Liuli. Her eyes slowly closed and her body gradually curled up like a baby, bending and hugging her knees. She seemed to have fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>But the dark golden light around her became more and more stable.</p><p></p><p>Next to Liuli, it took the shape of a six-petal lotus flower!</p><p></p><p>With the formation of the Liuli Lotus, the flames spewed by the nine fire dragons could no longer threaten her in the slightest. They were easily blocked outside the Liuli Lotus, no matter how...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>No matter how fiercely the flames raged, the glazed lotus flower remained unmoved and towering.</p><p></p><p>Within the Xuanhuang Realm, it seemed that no such thing existed. Even the "Heavenly Physician Immortal Scripture" had no records of this object.</p><p></p><p>It should be something that originated from other immortal cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>"The six petals should only be its juvenile state." Carefully observing the glazed lotus flower in the firelight, Li Fan suddenly had a feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Having achieved his goal, Li Fan retracted his divine power.</p><p></p><p>The nine fire dragons disappeared in an instant, but the young glazed girl was still bound.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, his voice thundering and echoing in this space: "You think that with this broken lotus flower protecting you, I can't hurt you anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"That would be underestimating us cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm a bit too much!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Fan released a seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>What was wrapped in the divine light was precisely a small piece of gray mold.</p><p></p><p>There were two pieces of gray mold that were split and cultivated initially, with the larger piece used previously to deal with the Dharma transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Although the remaining piece was a bit small, the gray mold's natural ability to erode the world had not diminished in the slightest. The moment it appeared, even though it was still wrapped in seven-colored divine light, it made the glazed lotus flower feel an extreme sense of crisis!</p><p></p><p>The glazed girl's body trembled uncontrollably, and the six-petal lotus flower protecting her also had dark golden light constantly flowing.</p><p></p><p>In a moment of change, it seemed that another new petal was about to appear.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light was about to collide with the glazed lotus flower, and it looked like the gray mold was about to be released.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cold and clear female voice suddenly rang out in Li Fan's mind: "Wait!"</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light stopped in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that this world would also be affected by the 'Mo' character formula..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Mo' character formula..." Li Fan's heart moved, his expression remaining unchanged: "Please come out and meet me, fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>The cold and clear female voice no longer hid, and the glazed lotus flower slowly bloomed, revealing a virtual dark golden figure in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even though her appearance was blurred and unclear in the golden light.</p><p></p><p>But the aura of an emperor emanating from her could still proclaim her identity to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, fellow Daoist of the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you have infiltrated our Xuanhuang Realm with ulterior motives." Li Fan's gaze sized up the golden figure, and for a moment, he couldn't quite gauge the other party's strength.</p><p></p><p>Having lost her human body and existing only in the form of energy, according to common sense, she should have been severely injured and had no choice but to do so. However, Li Fan did not sense any weakness from this golden figure, but instead, there was boundless vitality.</p><p></p><p>Tenacious and powerful.</p><p></p><p>The golden light apologetically said, "It's not that I deliberately concealed it, but rather I had no choice."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan to ask, she continued to explain, "Any immortal cultivation realm that still survives in the Sunken Starry Sea holds great hostility towards outsiders. In my current state, if I directly reveal my identity, I'm afraid I won't live for long."</p><p></p><p>"Sunken Starry Sea?" Li Fan tilted his head slightly and probed.</p><p></p><p>"It's the collective name for all the star domains affected by the 'Immortal Ruins'."</p><p></p><p>As if realizing something, the golden light quickly added, "Each immortal cultivation realm has a different name for it..."</p><p></p><p>"I see. We cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm call it the 'Darkest Starry Sea'." Li Fan interjected in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>"Darkest..." The golden light fell silent for a moment and sighed softly, "Indeed, the name is quite fitting."</p>

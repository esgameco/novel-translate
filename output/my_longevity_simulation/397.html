        <h1>Chapter 397</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Exploring opportunities is not without risks.</p><p></p><p>If they were to go together, the whole army would eventually be wiped out.</p><p></p><p>If the inheritance of 【Fu Xian】 ceases here.</p><p></p><p>This is the biggest concern in Xiao Heng's heart.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Changyu also noticed that, except for Xiao Heng, the others present did not attach much importance to the so-called 【Fu Xian】 inheritance, at least in comparison to their own cultivation levels.</p><p></p><p>In Xiao Heng's heart, he might also understand this.</p><p></p><p>However, he has his principles in his heart, but does not impose them on others.</p><p></p><p>So, he couldn't say it directly.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Changyu's eyes were closed all along, he could see through everyone's thoughts in the room.</p><p></p><p>So he took the initiative to resolve the situation: "How about this, Xiao Heng, Little Sister, and Zhang Haobo, you all go together to Cangwu Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"As for me, I'll stay here."</p><p></p><p>Before Su Xiaomei could retort, he continued explaining, "The cultivation technique I practice is special. In fact, opportunities are not of much use to me."</p><p></p><p>"So you don't need to worry about me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xiao Heng cast a grateful look at Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei, however, turned her head stubbornly, not looking at Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>But she still believed in Su Changyu's words.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had made a decision, the matter was almost settled.</p><p></p><p>"So we'll have one more Small Medicine King Cauldron. Could it be that, as Senior said, we should sell it?" Zhang Haobo furrowed his brows and asked.</p><p></p><p>"No." Su Changyu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Holding the Small Medicine King Cauldron is already a crime. If we expose our knowledge of this medicine king's true cauldron for a small gain, it would be unwise."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to keep it and throw it out at a critical moment as a distraction to divert the enemy's attention."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng also agreed with Su Changyu's words.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit of a pity, this is the safest method."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless! Since you have the final say!" Su Xiaomei snorted and stopped objecting.</p><p></p><p>She grabbed Han Wuyu and went outside to play.</p><p></p><p>"To go to Cangwu Abyss, the journey ahead is long. We are not cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, so we cannot rely on transmission arrays."</p><p></p><p>"If we fly with our physical bodies, it will take too long, and there might be unexpected incidents along the way."</p><p></p><p>"We need to come up with a good solution..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng stroked his chin, furrowing his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Um..." Zhang Haobo hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Xiao Heng looked at Zhang Haobo with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can also use a transmission array," Zhang Haobo explained.</p><p></p><p>"You know, during our adventure in the Jiushan Province before, we met Senior Shaofeng."</p><p></p><p>"During the trip to the Chao Yuan Sect, we fought our way out of the sea of corpses and blood together."</p><p></p><p>Our relationship is deep."</p><p></p><p>"When parting, Senior Shaofeng invited us to join the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, although we politely declined."</p><p></p><p>"But he understood and left a jade card for Little Sister."</p><p></p><p>"With that jade card, we should be able to use the transmission array without any problems."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xiao Heng nodded, saying, "That's just perfect."</p><p></p><p>He thought that Zhang Haobo's hesitation earlier was because Shaofeng was a cultivator of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng said seriously, "I am also a flexible person. Our enemies are the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, not every member of the alliance."</p><p></p><p>"If we can make friends with cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and unravel them from within, it would benefit us without harm."</p><p></p><p>"Why would I object?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go talk to Little Sister about it."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xiao Heng left to find Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo watched Xiao Heng's back and shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Why, is there something between Little Sister and Shaofeng?" Su Changyu noticed Zhang Haobo's intentions and asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, but it seems there's a spark between them. Although Shaofeng has returned to the realm of Nascent Divinity, he doesn't mind Little Sister's cultivation level."</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu chuckled, "You worry too much. In my opinion, there may not be any romantic feelings in Little Sister's heart."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo shook his head in silence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After many years, those few kids from the beginning seemed to have grown up.</p><p></p><p>But there were still some things that hadn't changed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit sentimental, suddenly recalling his children from his past lives.</p><p></p><p>"I've really gotten old," he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Li Fan quickly suppressed these emotions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xiao Heng spent a lot of effort to convince Su Xiaomei to agree and hand over Shaofeng's jade card.</p><p></p><p>After a few days of preparation, Xiao Heng, Su Xiaomei, and Zhang Haobo set out on the road to Cangwu Province.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyu, with his big eyes full of envy, waved his hands to bid them farewell.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu's eyelids twitched violently, as if he wanted to open his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But his face remained calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>Until the end, he never opened his heavy eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shaofeng's jade card worked wonders.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were not cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, Xiao Heng and the others were able to enter the Stone Immortal City smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng held onto Su Xiaomei, who was very curious and wanted to explore everything.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a bit nervous, he activated the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>They were teleported to the border of the Stone Immortal Province, crossed the White Mist Barrier, and arrived at the Source Dao Province.</p><p></p><p>Continuously using transmission arrays, they rushed to the Cangwu Abyss in the southwest corner of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>And so, after nearly half a month.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan began inspecting the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation in Lanlin Province, Xiao Heng and his group finally arrived at their destination.</p><p></p><p>With everyone's eyes, Li Fan also finally got to see the long-awaited Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the completely vanished Abyss of Clouds from before.</p><p></p><p>This Cangwu Abyss more resembled a vast sinkhole of the Great Mystery.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the towering cliffs was an endless deep valley.</p><p></p><p>Above the deep valley, red-colored clouds swirled, with no end in sight.</p><p></p><p>Many flying birds and strange beasts soared through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>On the cliff walls, at intervals heading downward, there were many buildings built into the mountains and deep into the mountain's interior.</p><p></p><p>"Cangwu Abyss was formed when all the mountains and waters in the Cangwu Province disappeared many years ago."</p><p></p><p>"Hence, the Abyss has its boundaries, shaped like a foot."</p><p></p><p>"It has been explored to a depth of about three hundred thousand zhang, yet the bottom is still not visible."</p><p></p><p>"The Cangwu Abyss is not empty, but each layer has its own features."</p><p></p><p>"The first layer, from the surface to thirty thousand zhang below, is where many strange beasts inhabit the Cangwu clouds, the Abyss at the boundary, and the cliff walls."</p><p></p><p>"These beasts can swallow gold and spit out lightning, and their strength is formidable. They are fierce and unafraid of death, so beware."</p><p></p><p>"The second layer, from thirty thousand zhang to eighty thousand zhang underground."</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei read aloud from the jade slip given by the cultivators outside Cangwu Abyss, her eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"So big, so deep."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Medicine King True Cauldron is really inside this Cangwu Abyss, we won't be able to find it, right?" she transmitted.</p><p></p><p>But Xiao Heng felt a stir in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He manipulated the Small Medicine King Cauldron in his storage ring to sense.</p>

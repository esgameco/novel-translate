        <h1>Chapter 743</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Thoughts raced through Li Fan's mind as his brow furrowed slightly, still unable to pinpoint the source of this lurking sense of crisis. </p><p></p><p>But his intuition had always been sharp, so he could not ignore it.</p><p></p><p>"It must have something to do with the Heavenly Mystery Mirror..." Li Fan pondered, looking at the final disk that Liu San and the others had just created.</p><p></p><p>"Can this thing amplify its effects in the form of a formation array, and then cover the entrance to the Valley of Eternal Life?" Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"It should be possible, but Sect Master, why do you suddenly mention this..." Fang Zaiji replied affirmatively, then realized with a start. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." Liu San also looked shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not explain, but instructed them to complete this task as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his attention shifted to Xu Bai's side. Over the past two years, Xu Bai had gradually regained Nan Gong Shi Rong's trust through his actions.</p><p></p><p>Currently in Heavenly Coolness City, due to the temporary failure of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, chaos had ensued. Tens of thousands of cultivators who had been in closed-door cultivation within the mirror were forced out, filling the once somewhat empty streets.</p><p></p><p>The Ministry of Governance, the Martial Arts Hall, and even the Guardian Hall were also experiencing varying degrees of disorder.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance's operations truly relied heavily on the Heavenly Mystery Mirror. Its sudden failure had an extremely significant impact.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding what had happened, the cultivators were filled with panic.</p><p></p><p>"Could they be fighting with the Five Elders again?"</p><p>"It seems the situation is serious this time, even affecting the Heavenly Mystery Mirror. Say, who among you is more familiar with the Five Elders' side?"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the situation was getting out of control, Nan Gong Shi Rong finally appeared and explained the circumstances to everyone.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan had guessed, the sudden inability to use the Heavenly Mystery Mirror was indeed related to its metamorphosis and ascension.</p><p></p><p>However, the Immortal Alliance officially used a more precise term: "Upgrade".</p><p></p><p>"After the establishment of the Underworld, another epoch-making event is about to occur. You all just need to wait patiently, there's no need to panic!"</p><p></p><p>Under Nan Gong Shi Rong's explanation, the cultivators' worries quickly dissipated. They excitedly discussed the upgrade of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Immortal Alliance cultivators, the Heavenly Mystery Mirror was indispensable in their daily lives - they were practically inseparable from it.</p><p></p><p>Now that it was about to undergo an "upgrade" and advance further, everyone was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"The current Heavenly Mystery Mirror is already capable of almost anything. If it truly completes the upgrade, how powerful will it become?"</p><p></p><p>"Trading, communication, spirit awakening, discussion, inference - aside from these existing functions, what new abilities will the new Heavenly Mystery Mirror gain? It's really something to look forward to."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what does it have to do with us ordinary cultivators? Do you think it will freely give us cultivation methods? We'll still have to work hard to earn contribution points."</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mystery Mirror did not keep everyone waiting for long. Seven days later, it resumed normal operations. All functions seemed no different from before.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the cultivators discovered that when they tried to leave the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, they received a prompt from it:</p><p></p><p>"Generate personal copy of the 'Heavenly Mystery Tome'?"</p><p></p><p>"What is this Heavenly Mystery Tome?"</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Questioning in doubt. </p><p>The answers from the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, however, made their hearts race and were hard to believe.</p><p>"The Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror can be considered an avatar of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror. It is generated for free and can be carried by cultivators."</p><p>"In addition to the regular functions of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, such as transactions and communication, it is also equivalent to the eyes of the cultivator, recording in detail everything the cultivator sees and hears, for them to revisit at any time."</p><p>"Furthermore, the Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror can also provide personalized cultivation guidance and suggestions based on the cultivator's own situation, as well as provide techniques and spiritual powers. It can also improve the cultivator's actual combat strength through virtual battles using spiritual awareness."</p><p>"There are many other functions, which the cultivators can explore for themselves."</p><p>...</p><p>This instantly stirred up a thousand waves of discussion.</p><p>The cultivators stared blankly at the introduction of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, almost unable to believe their eyes.</p><p>The various functions of the Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror were truly too powerful, almost comparable to the legendary immortal artifacts.</p><p>If it were to be sold for tens of millions of contributions, there would still be cultivators eager to pay for it. However, now they saw what? </p><p>Such a precious treasure, actually generated for free?</p><p>When did the Myriad Immortal Alliance become the largest charitable organization in the world?</p><p>Given their past experiences, some cultivators chose to observe for the time being.</p><p>While some bold cultivators couldn't wait to confirm their choice.</p><p>It didn't take long for their feedback to spread throughout the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p>"I didn't see any physical object, it seems to be generated directly in the sea of consciousness, and can be invoked with a thought."</p><p>"It's so convenient, really too convenient. After experiencing it, the Heavenly Mysterious Small Mirror I bought for over 10,000 contributions before feels like a letdown..."</p><p>"In the future, even spirit symbols for communication will be unnecessary! Everything can be done through the Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror. And it can even directly transmit items! Tsk tsk, those unscrupulous merchants reselling items across regions may be in trouble!"</p><p>"Providing personalized cultivation guidance... is it really true? The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror has made me temporarily stabilize my foundation, not to be in a hurry to break through. Otherwise, the impact of the Heavenly Calamity will be particularly severe..."</p><p>...</p><p>Feedback from different cultivators kept pouring in.</p><p>Causing those who were originally hesitant to change their minds and rush into the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, requesting to generate their own Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirrors.</p><p>After carefully reading their user experiences, Xu Bai couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p>"Isn't this just an enhanced version of the Mysterious Network from the previous world? The various functions are almost all extensions of the Mysterious Network's power. But this time, it's not relying on the Heavenly Mysterious Spirit Sealing Arrays scattered throughout the Mysterious Yellow Realm, but on the cultivators as the carriers..."</p><p>But perhaps it's the same destination by different paths.</p><p>The Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror, such a divine object, is almost impossible for any cultivator to refuse. It can be foreseen that when every cultivator has integrated the treasure mirror into their body, the power of the Mysterious Network in this world will certainly not be weaker than the previous world.</p><p>"Since it can provide cultivation guidance to the cultivators, it must have a thorough understanding of the various conditions within the cultivators' bodies. Its position is definitely higher than the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, even if it scans them, it may not be able to detect any abnormalities."</p><p>"But I won't take that risk."</p><p>"It's better to try with a clone. Or perhaps..."</p><p>Xu Bai suddenly thought of the Doomsday Stone Tablet.</p><p>"I wonder if this item can have any influence on the Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror?"</p><p>While Xu Bai was pondering, the Myriad Immortal Alliance issued another announcement.</p>

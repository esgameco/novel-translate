        <h1>Chapter 489</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Watching as the vast Wanxian Island rose from the ground and slowly flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators attempted to make a desperate attempt to break through the siege of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But they all ended up in the same fate.</p><p></p><p>As long as they left Wanxian Island, they would be pierced and killed by the descending light.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of the cries and wails of the cultivators continued to be heard.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space seemed to be completely locked, even the images of the falling cultivators in the sky appeared strangely distorted, piled up and squeezed together.</p><p></p><p>The fierce attacks of the Five Elders caused the chaotic cultivators to calm down temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Because they found that as long as they stayed on Wanxian Island, there seemed to be no intention of attack from the Five Elders over there.</p><p></p><p>So they could only tremble in fear, looking up at the purple gate that was getting closer to them.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders are making such a big fuss, could it be aimed at me?" Li Fan, who witnessed this scene, couldn't help but recall the incident where several Yuanying cultivators came to arrest him before, and such thoughts surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Their territory over there is not easy to deal with. Once captured and taken there to the 'Realm of Truth', lying is impossible. Once questioned, wouldn't the matters of crossing and true things all be directly exposed?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still had a clear understanding of his current strength and should not be able to resist the authority of the Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"To go or not to go…", a hint of hesitation flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>After considering for a moment, Li Fan decided to temporarily observe the situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current situation had not deteriorated to the point of endangering his life.</p><p></p><p>The original horizontal boundary between water and sky in the distance had now disappeared from view.</p><p></p><p>The entire Wanxian Island floated in mid-air, and the faces of the Elders' cultivators in the sky were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>Just then, another commotion suddenly came from the island.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a group of cultivators appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>The number of these cultivators was extremely large, and in an instant, they were all crowded together, making it seem like even Wanxian Island couldn't accommodate all of them.</p><p></p><p>Whispers and noise rose from among them.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>"I remember I was in seclusion in the Tianxuan Mirror, how did I suddenly appear here?"</p><p></p><p>"Look at that! The Tianxuan Mirror has turned into a stone!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to their successive exclamations, Jiao Xiuyuan murmured to himself, "It's bad, even the Tianxuan Mirror has withdrawn its empowerment, it seems that we can't count on this rescue force."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then realized that these people were actually cultivators who were practicing in seclusion in the Tianxuan Mirror space on Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>With Wanxian Island about to be captured by the Five Elders, the Tianxuan Mirror, for its own safety considerations, canceled the so-called empowerment.</p><p></p><p>Turning the miraculous mirror on the island, which had endless uses, into an ordinary stone.</p><p></p><p>The group of awakened cultivators, looking at the overwhelming enemies, finally realized their current situation.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, I heard that the Five Elders have something called a 'Soul Contract'. Once signed, their souls are completely controlled by them. Losing freedom, at that time, it might be better off dead!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, they must want to capture us and force us to sign the soul contract!"</p><p></p><p>"Under the control of others, it's better to fight to the death. With so many of us, maybe there is still a chance!"</p><p></p><p>After the shock, someone quickly raised their arms and shouted, calling everyone to break through the blockade of the Five Elders together.</p><p></p><p>The saying goes, strength in numbers.</p><p></p><p>With so many additional reinforcements out of thin air, the courage of the Wanxian Alliance cultivators on the island also grew.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the guidance of one or two cultivators, they launched a charge towards death.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not blindly follow, looking at the confused Jiao Xiuyuan with rolling eyes, he pulled his clothes and asked in a transmitted voice, "Brother Jiao, do you have a way to escape?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan smirked, stretched out his palm, and made a "five" gesture.</p><p></p><p>"All right! It's just a contribution of fifty thousand, I'll transfer it to you now!" Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's face darkened, "Is your life, Master Li Fan's life, only worth so little?"</p><p></p><p>"Fifty thousand contributions! Still considering our relationship!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Jiao Xiuyuan and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Without bargaining with him, he directly completed the fifty thousand transaction.</p><p></p><p>"I am not one to be all about money. A deal is a deal, even between close brothers, accounts must be settled." Jiao Xiuyuan explained for himself.</p><p></p><p>He then whispered, "Currently, the only possible way to escape from Wanxian Island is to pass through the ancient tree in the 'Qingfeng Hall'."</p><p></p><p>"Qingfeng Hall…", Li Fan's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>During the 113th generation, he had contacted the Qingfeng Hall, a hidden lending organization on Wanxian Island, through He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>The human-faced ancient tree inside had left a deeper impression on him.</p><p></p><p>The location of the ancient tree seemed to form its own space.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for pointing out, Brother Jiao!" Li Fan arched his hand and was about to step away.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he remembered something, and after a while, he turned back.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at Jiao Xiuyuan carefully, making him feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiao, if you don't escape, why are you looking at me?" Jiao Xiuyuan was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiao, I wonder, would you sell this body of yours?" Li Fan's tone was faint.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was startled and immediately took a step back, creating some distance between him and Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"You…" Jiao Xiuyuan looked at Li Fan in disbelief, seemingly seeing his true face for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Jiao Xiuyuan's jumbled thoughts, Li Fan continued, "After waking up for so long, I have always stayed within the territory of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I have a simple understanding of the overall Immortal Alliance. However, I have never had the chance to meet the Five Elders who can match the Immortal Alliance. The information about that side within the Immortal Alliance is also pitifully scarce. I am really curious about the Five Elders."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze swept up and down Jiao Xiuyuan's puppet body.</p><p></p><p>"I, the original body, naturally want to escape. However, I also want to take this opportunity to see the view over there. Do you happen to have a method that temporarily allows me to control your puppet body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked slowly.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Jiao Xiuyuan realize Li Fan's intention.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he muttered softly, "If the price is right, it's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was delighted at the response.</p><p></p><p>"Alright! Brother, name your price!" Li Fan inquired eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan made a "five" gesture again, not giving Li Fan a chance to interpret, and said, "Being possessed by someone, this is my first time!"</p><p></p><p>"Fifty thousand contributions, not a penny less!"</p><p></p><p>"Fifty thousand, fifty thousand it is. I, Li Fan, am not stingy."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

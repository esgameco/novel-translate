        <h1>Chapter 319</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xu Ke stood protectively in front of Li Fan, his face tense as he asked, "Song Yang? What are you trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the chaotic scene that had rarely been seen in the Beast Taming Sect for hundreds of years that gave him the courage. Song Yang no longer pretended and said viciously, "I really don't understand why a fool like you has such good luck!"</p><p></p><p>"You ask what I want to do? Of course, I'm going to take back what should have been mine!" Song Yang revealed his ferocious appearance, his eyes full of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>At his gesture, his companion spirit beast, a two-headed black snake, continuously slithered on the ground, slowly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's face was full of horror as he kept retreating, saying, "Senior Brother Song, you must have misunderstood! I never took anything that belonged to you..."</p><p></p><p>Despite his words, Xu Ke always stood in front of Li Fan, trying to block Song Yang's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>The small movement naturally couldn't escape Song Yang's notice. He sneered and said, "Kid, don't pretend. Hand over the ownership of the Xuan Bird to me, and I can still spare your life. Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Song Yang snorted coldly, "Don't blame me for not considering our sect's relationship. The pain of forcibly transferring a companion spirit beast by extracting essence blood, I'm sure you know about it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Ke became a little panicked, "Song Yang! Seizing a fellow disciple's spirit beast is a taboo in the sect! How dare you..."</p><p></p><p>Song Yang impatiently interrupted Xu Ke, "Truly stupid beyond belief. At a time like this, you still mention the sect. Can't you see that the Beast Taming Sect is already struggling to protect itself?!"</p><p></p><p>His patience seemed to have run out, and he no longer bothered to waste words. He directly ordered, "Black Spirit, go!"</p><p></p><p>The two-headed black snake had long been ready to strike. At Song Yang's command, its body slightly straightened, and from the mouth of the snake head with open eyes, a stream of black venom shot out like an arrow, about to fall on Xu Ke's body. Xu Ke stepped on the wind, his figure turning urgently, barely dodging the black water. It fell on the ground, making a sizzling sound.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke glanced at it, his face turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Not only were the grass and trees completely corroded, but even the stones couldn't withstand the erosion of that venom. He had not yet comprehended the protective spiritual energy, and if he were hit, he would probably either die or be crippled.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Ke took out an object from his bosom and threw it fiercely at Song Yang and the two-headed snake. He then took out a white feather from his bosom, wanting to summon the crane to fly away.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that Song Yang had already prepared for this.</p><p></p><p>Before the hidden weapon Xu Ke released could explode, it was seized by a green light and fixed in mid-air. The head of the black snake that had been keeping its eyes tightly closed suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>It emitted a black light that hit the immortal crane feather.</p><p></p><p>The white crane feather seemed to burn up, turning into ashes inch by inch and floating down.</p><p></p><p>"It's useless, Xu Ke. In order to deal with you, I have made all the preparations. I've been secretly following you for months, and I know all your tricks!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you have to fight against me with?!" Song Yang looked at Xu Ke as if he were looking at a dead man. The next second, another stream of venom spewed from the black snake's mouth, about to fall on Xu Ke, who was too shocked to dodge.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment of life and death, a white light suddenly shot out from behind and collided head-on with the black venom. The poisonous water that could corrode hard stones seemed to be no match for this white light.</p><p></p><p>The moment it was touched, it all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The white light's momentum did not diminish and charged straight at the two-headed black snake.</p><p></p><p>The snake head with closed eyes opened its eyes again, and a black light burst out, barely blocking the white light. Song Yang was shocked, and there was a trace of greed in his eyes. "Heavenly Mandate Xuan Light!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mandate Xuan Bird is indeed extraordinary. Even in its infancy, it can directly confront Black Spirit. If it were in its complete form..."</p><p></p><p>"Most importantly, it has the companion divine ability, [The Mandate of Heaven is with Me]."</p><p></p><p>Song Yang looked at the mentally exhausted Li Fan, and his desire to deprive the Xuan Bird grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Are you okay?" Taking advantage of the time pulled out by that Xuan light just now, Xu Ke's feet moved swiftly, flying away towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>But the difference in strength between him and Song Yang was too great. It seemed that it wouldn't take long for the other party to catch up. At this moment, however, Xu Ke didn't first worry about his own life.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he looked at Li Fan, who had overdrawn and released his innate divine ability to save his life, with heartache. "So weak. Releasing one strike is already the limit." In his drowsiness, Li Fan thought helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have the strength to scratch Xu Ke with his claws. Li Fan only called out softly to indicate that he was temporarily fine.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when Xu Ke's life was threatened, as his companion spirit beast, Li Fan suddenly awakened the memories in his bloodline and unleashed the [Heavenly Mandate Xuan Light] to save him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan learned the identity of the strange bird he was possessing: the Heavenly Mandate Xuan Bird.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Bird's own strength was often not considered powerful, but it had an ability that all other exotic beasts and even cultivators envied and wanted to possess.</p><p></p><p>That was the ability to condense and enhance fortune. The concept of fortune was not illusory but truly existed.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators had excellent talent and temperament, but they lacked a bit of fortune and ultimately perished on the path of cultivation, dying with regrets.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Bird could help the objects it recognized to reverse their fortune.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the Xuan Bird's strength continued to increase, this ability to condense fortune would also become stronger. In the end, it could even evolve from "changing fortune" to "changing fate."</p><p></p><p>The so-called [The Mandate of Heaven is with Me] was like this. The master of the Xuan Bird was the son of the Heavenly Mandate. Turning misfortune into blessing and encountering wonders were all common occurrences.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder that skinny bamboo pole wants to catch me so badly."</p><p>"So the strange bird I'm possessing is also a delicacy."</p><p>"Fortune..."</p><p></p><p>The exhausted Li Fan forced his eyes open and tried to use the divine ability he had just awakened.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Ke, he saw a purple-gold light rising from the top of his head to the sky.</p><p></p><p>Although there were one or two black smoke curling around at this time, they could not obscure the nobility of the purple-gold light.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? This kid..."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that a good person has the blessing of heaven. Instead, I was being presumptuous."</p><p>"And it consumed so much energy too." In his anger, Li Fan bit Xu Ke fiercely. But because he was too weak, it was like scratching an itch, neither painful nor itchy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke, who was struggling to escape, didn't pay attention to it at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Because Song Yang, who was eyeing him like a tiger behind him, was about to catch up.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Ke was exhausted and on the verge of despair, he suddenly saw that not far ahead, a bewildered green luan bird was standing.</p><p></p><p>Lying at its feet seemed to be the corpse of its original master. Seeing this, Xu Ke was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He leaped to the side of the green luan bird in one move, wrapped his arms around it, and rode on it. At the same time, he shouted loudly, "Little Qing, let's go!" And that green luan bird actually became alert and instinctively spread its wings.</p>

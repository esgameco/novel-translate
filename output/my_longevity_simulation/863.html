            <p>Li Fan, however, was not angry. </p><p></p><p>A group of pure and extreme seven-colored light emerged in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It wrapped the one-eyed little man inside.</p><p></p><p>This seven-colored divine light was continuously and deliberately compressed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The seven colors of light almost merged into one.</p><p></p><p>It turned into a dazzling white light.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was an extra sun in his hand, illuminating the surrounding void to an incomparably white-hot state.</p><p></p><p>The yellow paper man in the white light seemed to become a little distorted due to the huge pressure of exclusion.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was still increasing the output of the seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>With the Five Elements Grotto Heaven as a supplement, even the damaged Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light could exert its original power to the greatest extent.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light did not belong to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>When it began to condense, it continuously rejected all external objects.</p><p></p><p>The yellow one-eyed paper man finally seemed to sense the crisis as well.</p><p></p><p>Its eye rotated rapidly and looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have the intention of communicating.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan completely ignored it.</p><p></p><p>He had no intention of stopping at all and once again increased the output power of the seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when a bit of white light was refined to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Like the violent explosion that occurred when the world was created, in the blazing fire, the yellow talisman paper was completely burned away.</p><p></p><p>The stone pressing on his heart finally fell to the ground, and Li Fan let out a long sigh of relief, slowly retracting the seven-colored divine light back into his body.</p><p></p><p>He had just advanced to the Nascent Soul stage and had not yet completely refined the Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light.</p><p></p><p>What he just did was actually a bit of an overload for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, it was worth it to finally destroy the means of this Crossing Calamity Sect.</p><p></p><p>"[Eternal Calamity World], seeking the person of calamity."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the yellow one-eyed paper man is their method of finding the person of calamity."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the legendary sect that uses [Crossing Calamity] as cultivation resources. Ordinary magic techniques simply cannot touch these paper men, let alone destroy them."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where these old fellows are hiding."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, he still had no clue.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven had already been devoured into Li Fan's body, so naturally the passage with the changed docking coordinates also became invalid.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan was actually in the void of Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>When he concealed his aura and broke through the void to return to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>A bone-chilling feeling suddenly welled up from his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head and looked at the world.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if it was his illusion, but Li Fan seemed to see one-eyed little men made of countless yellow talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>They were distributed in every corner of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unnoticed by anyone, they quietly widened their single eyes and observed the world.</p><p></p><p>The moment Li Fan broke through the void and returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, they seemed to sense the culprit who had destroyed one of their members.</p><p></p><p>They all rotated their eyes and looked at Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Locked onto by thousands of gazes, Li Fan's body instantly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could even breathe out in his mind, those gazes naturally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, it was as if it was just Li Fan's illusion.</p><p></p><p>His stiffened body gradually returned to normal, but Li Fan's face could not relax.</p><p></p><p>He knew that what had happened in an instant just now was not an illusion at all.</p><p></p><p>It really happened.</p><p></p><p>In this Xuanhuang Realm, it was actually filled with eyes by the people of this Crossing Calamity Sect.</p><p></p><p>Wow! And it was done with almost no one knowing!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think of himself still being a mortal, on the edge of the Great Profound Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He was almost bewitched by the illusions in the abyss and about to fall off the cliff.</p><p></p><p>But he was suddenly awakened by the same illusion.</p><p></p><p>Escaping a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Does this mean...</p><p></p><p>Even the Profound Realm has been spread and fixed with a yellow single-eyed paper man?</p><p></p><p>A hint of coolness arose in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>But after all, he had experienced too much and did not lose his composure.</p><p></p><p>After some analysis, he gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>First of all, it can be determined that the range that each single-eyed paper man can monitor will not be too large.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there would be no need for so many talismans to complete the coverage of the entire Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, apart from monitoring, these Crossing Calamity Sect talismans should not have any other functions.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association definitely also know about the existence of these yellow talismans.</p><p></p><p>But it's not an easy thing to destroy them.</p><p></p><p>So most likely they will choose to turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance is built inside the Profound Mirror, not in the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It must be with the intention of avoiding these yellow paper men that are like psoriasis."</p><p></p><p>"And Senior Sister Zhao's One Heart Immortal Sect is also in a separate space."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled his experience of almost being led to the One Heart Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The quality of this Crossing Calamity Sect is so damn low."</p><p></p><p>Through a hundred reincarnations, Li Fan had seen figures like Mo Sha, Tian Yi, Ruo Mu, Mr. White, and True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Although each time was fraught with danger, Li Fan had reverence for these truly powerful people.</p><p></p><p>And indeed, their actions did not disappoint the demeanor of top experts.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Fan died at their hands due to a mistake.</p><p></p><p>He would not have any complaints in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just felt that he was not careful enough and his skills were inferior, that's all.</p><p></p><p>But only this time, Li Fan was really disgusted.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who knows that such a good Profound Yellow Realm is covered with talismans everywhere.</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid their mood will not be too good.</p><p></p><p>Even in the 114th lifetime, when the Profound Net descended, it was done openly and aboveboard.</p><p></p><p>But it is definitely much better than these densely packed, space-filling dog skin plasters!</p><p></p><p>Recalling the startling glimpse just now, Li Fan couldn't help but have the idea of thoroughly sweeping them clean.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It's just a thought.</p><p></p><p>Since the Myriad Immortals Alliance has allowed the existence of these paper men for so many years.</p><p></p><p>It shows that it is not an easy thing to thoroughly eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>After all, who would be willing to live under the watchful eyes of others every day?</p><p></p><p>"Crossing Calamity Sect, Crossing Calamity Sect..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of fierceness flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, he had the idea of actively going to kill them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that other things will have to be put aside for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, we have to solve the problem of being constantly monitored first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly said.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a hint of doubt welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What exactly do these people from the Crossing Calamity Sect want to do?</p><p></p><p>He had experienced quite a few endings of the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the destruction of the world had happened.</p><p></p><p>But no matter which direction the future of the Profound Yellow Realm went, he had never seen a true Crossing Calamity Sect cultivator appear.</p><p></p><p>"Are they always waiting for the person of the tribulation to appear and for the calamity to thoroughly pass?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the faint gaze coming from the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he flew towards the Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p>

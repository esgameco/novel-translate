            <p>From time to time, he looked at the pair of dark brown feathers on his back, and a trace of envy flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was thousands of kilometers away and was watching all of this, also had an inexplicable look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Cirrus Essence Blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Just a drop of blood, through the bloodline inheritance, even if several thousand years have passed, can still make the human body, such a heaven and earth changes."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who has already achieved a small degree of success in the Oven of Creation, knows very well what kind of greatness this is.</p><p></p><p>"How powerful was the Peng Peng in his heyday?"</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention, there are many other demonic beasts that are as famous as the Peng, or even more ferocious than the Peng."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I can't see any of them."</p><p></p><p>"And what happened back then? ......"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could not help but feel a burst of emotion.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how the blood of demonic beasts strengthens the physical body. How is it different from my [Creation Oven Technique] that mobilizes the secret power of the human body?"</p><p></p><p>"A stone from another mountain can attack a jade, perhaps there is a chance that I can learn from it."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to Ye Feipeng's amazing speed and strength just now, Li Fan could not help but think secretly.</p><p></p><p>"From the looks of it, it seems that Little Fatty has not given up his intention to fight for the Heaven and Earth Spirit. I just don't know who will succeed between him and Zhang Zhiliang. Although it is said that Zhang Zhiliang's current cultivation level is far greater than Ye Feipeng's, in my heart I secretly feel that Little Fatty's chances are a little bit greater, and I don't know why. ......"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why, but let's see what else he can do when he reaches the end of his dan.

Sifu?"</p><p></p><p>The familiar voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled and stared blankly at Zhang Qian Mo who appeared in front of him again, waving his hand.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why am I still here?"</p><p></p><p>"I've defeated him, I've solved his obsession, and I've even gained the Secret Technique."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was suddenly filled with countless doubts.</p><p></p><p>The spatial and temporal area around Ningyuan City should be similar to Tian Yang's [Eternal Legacy].</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was trapped here, and unless he dissolved the obsession of maintaining the existence of space-time, he would not be able to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>But now ......</p><p></p><p>Forcing down the disappointment in his heart, Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly and analyzed calmly.</p><p></p><p>For one thing, Li Fan's perception of this space-time region is completely wrong.</p><p></p><p>He was trapped here forever for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he tried, he could never leave.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Li Fan's perception was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>However, it has not officially resolved the obsession of Zhang Qian Mo.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is to fly with Chixia, or to seek a defeat, it is not enough.</p><p></p><p>Neither is what he really wants.</p><p></p><p>There is a third possibility ......</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly as he looked in all directions.</p><p></p><p>What maintains this space-time is not at all Master Zhang's obsession.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianlian was nothing more than a colorful supporting character.</p><p></p><p>The real protagonist.</p><p></p><p>There is someone else!</p><p></p><p>Which guess is right?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan is not sure now.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, he had enough time to eliminate the wrong options one by one.</p><p></p><p>By then, he would know the correct answer.</p><p></p><p>Crushing his impatience for quick success, Li Fan slowly regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>At this time, seeing Li Fan's face constantly changing during the process, Zhang Qian Mo finally asked in a voice, "Senior, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you having a nightmare in the middle of the day?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly: "Senior brother is as good as God, I did have a nightmare in a trance, so I am a bit disturbed."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qian Mo was a bit curious: "Oh? What did you dream about?</p><p></p><p>"I dreamed that my senior brother was surrounded by a tidal wave of demons and beasts and was outnumbered and died of exhaustion." Li Fan shook his head and sighed. "It's really bad luck, I don't know why I dreamt about this in good time."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qian Mo's expression moved, frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Now the nightmare is born abruptly, is it possible that you have sensed something in the darkness, the mind and spirit of self-preparedness?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qian Mor touched his chin, thoughtfully said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was somewhat speechless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think that even if he just casually said it, Zhang Qian Mo could associate it with so many things for no reason.</p><p></p><p>However, he also hit the nail on the head, Ningyuan City in front of him, there is indeed a small "danger".</p><p></p><p>At that moment, following his words, Li Fan continued, "Could it be that this trip to get the Fruit of Longevity will have some twists and turns and will not be so smooth?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qian Mo was slightly stunned, but did not immediately refute.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, he then said, "Your worries are not without reason, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>"I heard my master and uncle mention that the Immortal Cultivation Realm seems to be not very peaceful these days."</p><p></p><p>"To be on the safe side, why don't you and I sneak into Ningyuan City and do some investigating first."</p><p></p><p>"To see if there are any oddities in the city."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded his head in agreement.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the two of them put away their [Purple Sky Flying Cloud], restrained their breath, hid their forms, and quietly flew towards Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I don't know what is your greatest wish in life?</p><p></p><p>As he was flying, Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why did you say that?" Zhang Qian Mo was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I don't think you'll be offended if I say so. Just now, in my dream, I saw my brother die a horrible death, a pair of eyes staring at me, seem to have undecided regret."</p><p></p><p>"The eyes were so real that even when I woke up now, I could not forget them for a long time. It's hard for me to get over it, so I'm asking this question."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said slowly.</p>

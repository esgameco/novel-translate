        <h1>Chapter 1338</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1327: Awakening Moxu Rubin Again</p><p></p><p>However, after waiting for a long time, the Dharma transmitters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance still did not witness any greater disturbances in the Xuanhuang Realm. </p><p></p><p>Could the Venerable Lord have misjudged?</p><p></p><p>No matter how unbelievable it was, the Dharma transmitters eventually had to accept this fact in the end.</p><p></p><p>But out of reverence for the Dharma Transmitting Venerable, none of them dared to discuss it openly. </p><p></p><p>Let alone actively sending messages to inquire with the Dharma Transmitting Venerable.</p><p></p><p>They could only attribute the reason to the Venerable caring about the commoners of Xuanhuang, and thus transmitting a warning even for the slightest disturbance. After all, disturbances did occur.</p><p></p><p>What the denizens of Xuanhuang could not sense was that an enormous Celestial Immortal force had already been quietly accumulating outside the void.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood before the filled depression, sensing the faint suction force, and couldn't help but nod in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>This time's harvest was even more than expected.</p><p></p><p>The natural depression's existence became an almost perfect container for the Celestial Immortal force. Combined with the formations Li Fan had laid at the perimeter to conceal anomalies, even Dharma transmitters like them would not discover anything amiss unless they specifically investigated carefully, rather than just passing by.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was confident that with this accumulation, the plan to transcend Xuanhuang had a much higher chance of success.</p><p></p><p>The force driven by the Celestial Immortal's enlightenment hunger mantra from the Immortal Ruins was naturally different from pure spiritual energy, and could not be directly absorbed by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could use the Ascension Formation to transform this enormous force into the driving force for Xuanhuang's ascension. This would greatly reduce the consumption of Celestial Immortal flesh and blood. Otherwise, even if he squeezed Oushan Tian dry, the output from the Kun and Qian Bones would never be enough to construct a sufficient Ascension Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Like a lake suspended in the sky, like the ruins of an immortal realm." After gazing for a while, Li Fan's gaze finally shifted away from the depression.</p><p></p><p>He temporarily concealed this place with formations.</p><p></p><p>"Next is to find a way to temporarily anchor the world's height..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure flashed and instantly returned to Xuanhuang, arriving below the Lecture Podium.</p><p></p><p>The giant web woven from essence energy was sealing the slumbering original souls of Moxu Rubin and Ji Yuchang.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not awaken the female Dharma King Ji Yuchang.</p><p></p><p>Although he had absorbed most of her memories and understood her better, this female Dharma King still gave Li Fan a sense of being more dangerous than Moxu Rubin.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Moxu Rubin, with whom he had crossed paths several lifetimes, was easier to handle.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, the illusory sword shadow emerged, and Li Fan brought Moxu Rubin out into the void outside of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>He then slowly removed the sealing golden web.</p><p></p><p>Exposed to the cold, silent Darkest Starry Sea, Moxu Rubin instinctively sensed the danger and gradually awoke.</p><p></p><p>Almost as soon as he regained consciousness, Moxu Rubin noticed Li Fan's presence standing not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? I remember falling asleep when..." Moxu Rubin was a bit dazed at first, but after a moment's thought, he roughly guessed the culprit behind all this.</p><p></p><p>"What does the Dao friend intend to do?" Moxu Rubin studied Li Fan warily, his words full of caution.</p><p></p><p>A mirror boundary hidden in the darkness was silently born, locking onto Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine ability from the Myriad Realms Undying Demonic Heart Celestial Technique, able to replace the person reflected on the other side of the mirror with a new demonic heart.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of cultivation level, anyone enveloped by it would be doomed.</p><p></p><p>This was the confidence bestowed upon Moxu Rubin from the inheritance of the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Moxu Rubin soon noticed something was amiss, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>The mirror did envelop Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But on the other side of the mirror, there was no reflection of Li Fan! It was as if the person before him was merely an illusion that did not exist in the real world!</p><p></p><p>Contradictorily, the aura of life force emanating from Li Fan undoubtedly proclaimed his reality!</p><p></p><p>This true-or-false transformation even transcended the Celestial Immortal Talismans, naturally beyond Moxu Rubin's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this Xuantian Sect Dharma King only knew that he had encountered an extremely formidable enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma friend Moxu need not be so tense. If I truly meant you harm, why would I deliberately awaken you?" </p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Kalpas Undying Demonic Heart Celestial Technique is not truly undying for myriad kalpas. I have at least three or four ways to break it." Li Fan smiled slightly and said softly.</p><p></p><p>These few sentences fell upon Moxu Rubin's ears like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Kalpas Undying Demonic Heart Celestial Technique was personally taught to him by the Xuantian King, known to very few. Yet Li Fan had bluntly revealed its secrets...</p><p></p><p>"Which sacred realm does the Dao friend come from?" Moxu Rubin asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer directly, but instead...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Friend, do you know how long you have been asleep?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, all of Li Fan's attention had been drawn to him. </p><p></p><p>Now that Li Fan had reminded him, Moxu Bin calculated with his fingers and then his body shook violently.</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand years have passed, everything has changed. If you're interested, friend, let me tell you the stories of these years." Li Fan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin pondered and nodded.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan slowly recounted how after the Tianxuan Sect was destroyed, the Ten Sects took over, but then another catastrophe arose and the Xuanhuang Realm was nearly annihilated. The Inheritor of the Heavenly Laws rose up with his forces unexpectedly, and the Five Elders of the Myriad Immortal Alliance divided and ruled.</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin's expression kept changing.</p><p></p><p>"Those beasts of the Ten Sects deserved to die!"</p><p></p><p>From start to finish, this was the only sentence Moxu Bin couldn't help saying. The rest of the time, he listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>With the keen perception of human emotions from his Demonic Mind Immortal Technique, Moxu Bin was 80% certain the other party was not lying.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the people of the Ten Sects inherited the legacy of the Xuantian Sect. And they also had the true teachings of great masters, so they were not so easy to destroy. Some of them had already crossed over before the catastrophe fully erupted," Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Crossed over?" Moxu Bin narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not left the Xuanhuang Realm, but crossed the high wall to the other side!" Li Fan exclaimed forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin reacted unprecedentedly strongly: "The other side of the high wall? Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already expected Moxu Bin to say this: "Friend, take a look!"</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, the scene of a sword piercing the heavens and earth, emitting boundless light and tearing through space appeared before Moxu Bin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is the scene when the Sword Sect forged the Realm-Rending Divine Sword and used it to cross over back then. Although it's uncertain if they succeeded, with such might, it couldn't have been as simple as just escaping the Xuanhuang Realm, right?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin stared fixedly at the repeating scene before him.</p><p></p><p>"That Realm-Rending Divine Weapon is just a mortal object, how could it possibly cross the high wall? Ridiculous!" Moxu Bin still did not change his stance.</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin cut off Li Fan's words: "Is that all? No matter what heavenly materials or treasures, as long as they are products of the Xuanhuang Realm, they cannot have such an effect."</p><p></p><p>"What if it was infused with a mass of pure spiritual energy?" Li Fan asked solemnly again.</p><p></p><p>"!!!" Moxu Bin abruptly raised his head and stared at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual energy?" His expression and tone had changed from before.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Moxu Bin said gloomily, "If that Realm-Rending Divine Weapon truly contained spiritual energy in its core, then it would indeed be possible to cross the high wall with it..."</p><p></p><p>"That's it," Li Fan said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Realm-Rending Divine Weapon forged by the Sword Sect back then truly contained spiritual energy, Li Fan did not know either.</p><p></p><p>However, the forging of the divine weapon was instructed by the White Elder.</p><p></p><p>The White Elder inherited the legacy of the Great Lord of Heaven and had gone beyond the high wall and returned. How could he not know that it was impossible to cross the high wall with just mortal materials?</p><p></p><p>If they failed and crashed into the high wall head-on, there would be no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Given the White Elder's character, how could he make people walk to their deaths like that?</p><p></p><p>So after learning about the scale of the Great Lord of Heaven's legacy from Grandson Tian Ci in the previous life, Li Fan had this speculation in his heart. That is, the White Elder had taken a portion of the spiritual energy released from the detonation of the immortal artifacts and given it to the Sword Sect, allowing them to successfully execute their plan to escape through realm-rending.</p><p></p><p>Because compared to the remaining four immortal artifacts like the Great Sun Golden Bell, the amount of spiritual energy obtained from detonating the other nine artifacts was indeed too little.</p><p></p><p>It was more like a portion had been taken out, rather than consumed.</p><p></p><p>It was even hard to say whether members of other sects besides the Sword Sect were on that Realm-Rending Divine Sword back then.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's explanation, Moxu Bin remained silent for a long time, and then couldn't help cursing: "Damn things, only caring about saving themselves, not giving a single thought to the people of Xuanhuang!"</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin had reason to curse like this.</p><p></p><p>Back then, if the Xuantian King, who was already a semi-immortal, wanted to escape alone, it would have been absolutely no problem.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because he wanted to bring the Xuanhuang homeland along that there was the long-term plan to drift through the starry void, and the ensuing troubles later on.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Moxu Bin's words, Li Fan also took the opportunity to shift the topic to the Xuantian King.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian King was noble and lofty, shining like the ancient sun that none in this world could compare to. Not to mention the rat sects of the Ten Sects, even after ten thousand years, no one has emerged to inherit his will. The Xuanhuang Realm has only persisted until now because its living beings are trying to save themselves," Li Fan couldn't help sighing in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan praise the Xuantian King so highly, Moxu Bin's perception of him also gradually changed, though he still did not completely let down his guard.</p><p></p><p>"To tell the truth, I wish to inherit the Xuantian King's will, to save the Xuanhuang Realm from the fire and water, and help it cross the high wall to leave this darkest expanse of stars."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Moxu Bin carefully observed and realized that Li Fan did not have long to live.</p><p></p><p>His pupils constricted abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "By a fortuitous opportunity, I discovered the past deeds of the heroes of the ancient Xuantian Sect and could not help being moved and inspired."</p><p></p><p>"I have also been searching for any surviving traces of you all, and finally found you sleeping here..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Moxu Bin with a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin felt a surge of indescribable emotions.</p><p></p><p>However, being cautious by nature, he suppressed these feelings and began to ponder the credibility of the other party's words.</p><p></p><p>"The matters of the Xuantian Sect happened over ten thousand years ago, how do you know about them?" Moxu Bin asked.</p><p></p><p>"In a ring-shaped mountain of countless flowers, I discovered the shattered remnants of Jiyuzheng's soul," Li Fan told the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Although it was just countless fragments of memories pieced together, I could still glimpse the past of the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin's expression shook: "Jiyuzheng? She's still alive too?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "Only some remaining soul fragments."</p><p></p><p>Moxu Bin wanted to say something more but stopped himself.</p><p></p><p>After a silence, he looked straight at Li Fan and said, "Back when the Xuantian Sect underwent that dramatic change, some brothers died, some were injured. We all lost contact with each other."</p><p></p><p>"There may even have been traitors among us..."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, besides the Xuantian King, I don't trust anyone."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in understanding: "In fact, one reason I woke you up was to try to find the Xuantian King."</p>

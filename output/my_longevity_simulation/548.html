            <p>When he revealed the news that Li Fan was about to restart the fundraising plan, the many cultivators of the Cloud Sea were afraid of missing this rare opportunity to get rich. They rushed to transfer their contributions to He Zhenghao without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was busy and overwhelmed, feeling both pain and happiness.</p><p></p><p>In less than seven days, half of the target had already been achieved, with nearly fifty-three million contributions received.</p><p></p><p>Handling such a huge amount of contributions made a subtle change in He Zhenghao's mindset unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what kind of days did I live before meeting the Lord of Secrets?"</p><p></p><p>"For a mere two or three hundred thousand contributions, I had to tighten my belt, living in worry every day."</p><p></p><p>"It was really suffocating!"</p><p></p><p>Looking back on the past, He Zhenghao couldn't help but shake his head, sighing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the days of hardship are gone forever!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao looked at the continuously rising numbers in the statistics, feeling an uncontrollable excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If everything went smoothly, after this fundraising was completed, the Lord of Secrets should share some of the profits with me, just like the previous times...</p><p></p><p>Even if it's just one percent...</p><p></p><p>No, as long as there is one-third of one percent, He Zhenghao would be satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the Lord of Secrets' abilities, making a profit equivalent to the principal each time should not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Calculating this way, he would at least receive a reward of three hundred thousand contributions...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, an idiotic smile appeared on He Zhenghao's face involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally snapped out of his daydream.</p><p></p><p>He began to plan to transfer the contributions he had on hand to the Lord of Secrets. However, soon, an unexpected incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror actually indicated that it couldn't find the trading partner, and the transfer failed.</p><p></p><p>Large beads of sweat dripped from He Zhenghao's forehead in an instant.</p><p></p><p>There were only two possibilities for this situation.</p><p></p><p>One was that he made a mistake in transferring to the wrong target, missing the intended recipient.</p><p></p><p>The other was that the other party temporarily suspended all their functions in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao quickly realized where the problem lay.</p><p></p><p>The first possibility was obviously impossible. The Lord of Secrets was an appointed figure of the Immortal Alliance, a key figure in the region.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>He also recalled Li Fan's meaningful words before, saying that he needed to go into seclusion deeply and should not be disturbed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>He also left a clone token for himself as a contingency measure.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!" He Zhenghao slapped his thigh suddenly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that, as that kid Gao Yuan said, it's a test from the Lord of Secrets for me."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao looked at the astronomical figures in his account, his face turning pale.</p><p></p><p>The contributions that had seemed pleasing at first now felt like a death warrant.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, oh no. Although my investment ability is indeed outstanding, it also depends on the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of contributions, I can barely handle."</p><p></p><p>"As for hundreds of millions of contributions, I dare not operate it."</p><p></p><p>"If I luckily make a profit, it's fine, but if it's a loss, wouldn't I have to bear the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>The more He Zhenghao thought about it, the more terrified he became.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that, despite the cultivators who depended on him today calling him "Brother He" so affectionately, it was all based on their ability to make money.</p><p></p><p>Once they suffered losses in the contributions they had accumulated, probably from this fundraising plan, they would likely be the first to tear him apart.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt dizzy and weak in the legs, almost collapsing on the ground in this moment.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a thought of "taking the money and fleeing" flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, he managed to maintain his composure.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, dismissed this suicidal idea, rallied himself, and quickly found Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gao Yuan's expression turned serious as well.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't give hasty advice but instead frowned thoughtfully, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao didn't dare to disturb him and could only wait anxiously on the side.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan comforted him, "Brother He, don't worry. You don't need to act rashly, just be patient and wait for the Lord of Secrets' orders."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was puzzled, "Brother Gao, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan smiled and confidently said, "Who is the Lord of Secrets? Although he may not care much about this one billion contribution, even I know that such a large sum is beyond ordinary control."</p><p></p><p>"You have your own reputation, but it's clear you may not have the confidence to operate it profitably."</p><p></p><p>Acknowledging, He Zhenghao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan continued, "That's right. Since we both understand this, how could the Lord of Secrets not be aware of it?"</p><p></p><p>"Remember the clone token he left us. When he instructed us, he said we could use it to contact him."</p><p></p><p>"But think about it, this token also contains a trace of his consciousness. Therefore, he can naturally contact us through it later."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"What to do with this one billion contribution. The Lord must have already made arrangements. Brother He, you just need to do as the Lord instructs, complete the fundraising, and wait for his guidance."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, what we, the subordinates, most disdain is acting on our own and trying to be smart." Gao Yuan advised.</p><p></p><p>"You were fortunate to come and ask me this time rather than panic and use the clone token directly to report to the Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, this test, Brother He, you would have probably failed." Gao Yuan emphasized.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a while, He Zhenghao took a deep breath, got up quickly, and bowed to Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Gao, for helping. In the future, if you need my help, do not hesitate to ask!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, Brother He is too polite. In the future, working under the Lord, you and I must support each other." Gao Yuan replied politely.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao, with the guidance from Gao Yuan, finally felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Hurriedly, he returned to continue his fundraising plan.</p><p></p><p>As Gao Yuan watched He Zhenghao's figure disappear into the distance, his eyes were inexplicably deep.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he had repeatedly tried to win over He Zhenghao was that he saw something special in this person's eyes in the eyes of the Lord of Secrets.</p><p></p><p>Although all were "tools," without a doubt, there were preferences among tools.</p><p></p><p>The ones that were handy were always used again.</p><p></p><p>And He Zhenghao seemed to be such an existence.</p>

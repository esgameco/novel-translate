            <p>Chapter 1113: Hiding Alone in the Dark Prison</p><p></p><p>Despite the possibility of being discovered by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate and the Wangsheng Sect, Li Fan was still very confident that he would not be found.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the countless concealment formations on the True Immortal Puppet, which were extremely complex and even surpassed the Life and Death Reversal Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>In this world, no one had ever been to the Frozen Dead Sea before.</p><p></p><p>Yet the True Immortal's remnant body was able to accurately locate its position.</p><p></p><p>Just this point alone was enough to make Wangsheng suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"According to common sense, he should focus his target on those old acquaintances that may have existed in recent years."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he wants to investigate me, there's no way to start."</p><p></p><p>"The only flaw is that the True Immortal Puppet's transfer method uses the power of darkness."</p><p></p><p>"And apart from the Myriad Immortals Alliance, only I from the Myriad Realms United Association have been to the Dark Realm before..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the level of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, there was no longer a need for evidence to "speculate" when doing things.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was a shred of possibility, it was enough for him to make a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Since I just reviewed that in the entire Mysterious Yellow Realm, there are not many forces that can accomplish this matter. Then putting myself in his shoes, as long as I eliminate them all, I can prevent future troubles..."</p><p></p><p>"Although it seems a bit unreasonable, it is the way of the dominator."</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts turned, Li Fan's heart suddenly jumped.</p><p></p><p>He almost immediately made a decision.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm, all defensive formations were activated at full power.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Myriad Realms United Association were all prepared for battle at any time.</p><p></p><p>He summoned the main figures from the Heavenly Machine Realm, Medicine King Sect, Imperial Small World and others, explaining the critical situation.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong, Liu Ruchen and others all slightly changed color.</p><p></p><p>"This is too unreasonable? Just because we have the strength to kill the Dharma Transmitters and they can't find the murderer, they want to destroy us all together?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Envoy being a little too pessimistic? I don't think the Myriad Immortals Alliance would act so recklessly, right?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone discussed, but seeing Li Fan's gradually darkening face, they all instantly chose to shut up.</p><p></p><p>"By begging for the blessing of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, I have almost confirmed this matter."</p><p></p><p>"There is no need to doubt, just prepare in advance. In this battle, there is no room for reconciliation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone's faces turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"The only chance of survival is if our resistance is strong enough."</p><p></p><p>"They are going to conquer us in order to avenge the three Dharma Transmitters. But if we can bring them not just the demise of the three Dharma Transmitters..."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Myriad Immortals Alliance is powerful, it is impossible for them to attack us with the full force of the alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Plus, we have the geographical advantage. The Spirit Wood Realm is impregnable, covered by countless formations, and has the fortifications of the Heavenly Machine Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, we can also mobilize the power of the Dark Realm to launch a surprise attack on the enemy with the dark tide..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said confidently: "As long as we can withstand the first few waves of the fiercest attacks, we should be able to get through this crisis."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan said so, the others still couldn't see optimism on their faces.</p><p></p><p>They all left with a heavy heart to mobilize before the battle.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Wood Realm was completely sealed off, even if they had thoughts of escaping, they couldn't escape.</p><p></p><p>The only option was to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan's side...</p><p></p><p>In the underground secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>A sacred fetus that looked exactly like Li Fan was rapidly taking shape.</p><p></p><p>Using the divine power of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal,</p><p></p><p>After forcibly raising the Holy Fetus to the Nascent Soul realm, it left the secret chamber and put on the Tianyang War Puppet.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan himself...</p><p></p><p>He didn't bring anything and quietly left the Spirit Wood Realm without anyone noticing.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the Myriad Immortal Alliance would come to attack the Spirit Wood Realm, how could Li Fan stay behind with his true body to fight them to the death?</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, the Myriad Realm Alliance, the Spirit Wood Realm, the Heavenly Medicine King...</p><p></p><p>They were all just external things that could be abandoned at any time.</p><p></p><p>Only his own safety was the most important.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could preserve his life and survive this storm,</p><p></p><p>After the Dharma Transmission and reincarnation, when they relaxed their guard, he would activate the Destruction Layout.</p><p></p><p>Once everything returned to its original state, everything he had lost would eventually return to his hands.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current concealment abilities, after leaving the Spirit Wood Realm, he traveled swiftly without anyone discovering his whereabouts from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>As for where he would hide in the coming period, Li Fan had already thought of it.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he had already reached his destination.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the Myriad Immortal Alliance's Secluded Prison, where he had previously taken out the Dharma Transmitter Wei Congzhong!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, does this count as turning myself in?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan laughed at himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"However, this so-called prison net cannot stop me."</p><p></p><p>After carefully observing for a while, Li Fan had already cracked the formation covering the entrance of the Secluded Prison.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a dark shadow, he quietly flew inside.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes suddenly became dim.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat similar to the scene in the Nether Realm.</p><p></p><p>There was no sky or earth, and all that could be seen was endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the complete darkness of the Nether Realm, there was still a little light here.</p><p></p><p>At least divine sense could barely distinguish the direction to proceed without getting completely lost.</p><p></p><p>In the endless dark space, towering prison pillars stood.</p><p></p><p>Each pillar seemed to be suppressing a prisoner.</p><p></p><p>And on the surface of the pillars, various horrifying torture scenes kept changing.</p><p></p><p>As for the jailers of this Secluded Prison, they were monstrous creatures made of unknown black mist-like substances floating here.</p><p></p><p>There were thousands of them, even outnumbering the pillars in the space.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, they let out bursts of roars and flew into the pillars where prisoners were held.</p><p></p><p>Before long, faint screams of agony echoed in the prisons.</p><p></p><p>After torturing for a long time, these black mist monsters would only then leave the pillars with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Similar scenes kept playing out in the Secluded Prison, as if there was no end...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene that was like a purgatory, Li Fan's expression did not change in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>After observing the composition of these prison pillars for a while, he determined they were formed by some kind of formation.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed, and he cracked it almost instantly.</p><p></p><p>Then he chose an empty one and took the initiative to enter it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>After entering the black pillar, Li Fan looked around and found that compared to the outside, it was actually brighter inside the prison.</p><p></p><p>It's just that formation attacks would fall at any time as a means of punishment.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they could not hurt Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid even if they turn the Profound Yellow Realm inside out, they would never imagine that I'm hiding here."</p><p></p><p>"And when they forget about me, that will be the time for me to go out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan settled down comfortably in the Secluded Prison as if he had returned home.</p><p></p><p>For him, the Spirit Wood Realm and the Secluded Prison were essentially no different.</p>

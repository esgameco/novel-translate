        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan's eyes shimmered with a gleam of light.</p><p></p><p>As the essence of heaven and earth trapped in a body, it confined the overwhelming evil aura of the remaining sword.</p><p></p><p>The scene described by Dragon Leap made Li Fan instantly think of the incident involving the trapped sword in the Qingfeng Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike what Li Fan had seen before, the opportunity for Long Jiuyuan to merge with the Dao was in Tianling Prefecture, not the Qingfeng Cloud Sea. The essence of heaven and earth was also a black marsh, not Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>But…</p><p></p><p>What was strikingly consistent was the overwhelming evil aura of the remaining sword.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could almost confirm that whether in the Qingfeng Cloud Sea or Tianling Prefecture, it should all belong to a part of the complete Tian Sha Sword.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Sha Sword, as the weapon of the old fisherman, is in pieces, scattered all over."</p><p></p><p>"But even these incomplete remains of the sword can counterbalance the essence of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, later the hilt of the Tian Sha Sword could even break free from Qingfeng's imprisonment. Over at the Yunshui Tiangong, the suppression by the Turtle Snake Taichi was also extremely difficult and they were forced into a deep sleep."</p><p></p><p>"If the fragments are like this, how strong would the complete Tian Sha Sword be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Now he knew of three fragments already. Could there be more in other places?</p><p></p><p>What secrets did the Tian Sha Sword hold that caused the essence of heaven and earth to appear to suppress it?</p><p></p><p>And what cultivation level would the owner of the Tian Sha Sword, the old fisherman, have?</p><p></p><p>"Fisherman, Heavenly Doctor, Master…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes. "There is a sense that these three people are obviously acquaintances, but their past is extremely mysterious. It seems to be always shrouded in a thick fog, making it impossible for others to discern."</p><p></p><p>And, Li Fan had a vague feeling.</p><p></p><p>The secrets between them were very important to him!</p><p></p><p>"When enemies meet, they are particularly jealous. I hope that in the near future when the three of them engage in a great battle, I can gain some insight."</p><p></p><p>While focusing on locking onto Zhou Kebao's invisible killing intent, Li Fan continued to monitor the situation on Dragon Leap's side.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, he set off again towards the originally planned destination.</p><p></p><p>According to Dragon Leap's subsequent narration, when Long Jiuyuan saw the stand-off between the Tian Sha remnant sword and the black marsh, he was also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not tempted by the readily available opportunity for merging with the Dao and losing his sanity.</p><p></p><p>Long Jiuyuan knew that the standoff between the remnant sword and the black marsh had already reached a certain balance.</p><p></p><p>And if he rashly attacked and disrupted this balance, it might backfire, and he might even face the united attack of the remnant sword and the black marsh.</p><p></p><p>After all, the interference of a Nascent Divine in a Dao contest was akin to provocation of some sort.</p><p></p><p>So Long Jiuyuan made a decision in an instant. With his protective magical weapon damaged, he risked getting severely injured and broke out of the black marsh sea.</p><p></p><p>After a brief rest, Long Jiuyuan laid down the "Heaven Separation Array" all around.</p><p></p><p>This formation had only one function, which was to sever the connection between the essence of heaven and earth and the earth itself.</p><p></p><p>Although the essence of heaven and earth manifested the laws, once separated, it was like water without a source or a tree without roots - the power gradually weakened through continuous consumption.</p><p></p><p>And with the black marsh and the Tian Sha remnant sword evenly matched, if one weakened, the Tian Sha Sword would have an opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Long Jiuyuan lurked around, waiting for changes.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, several months later, the black marsh in the deep mountains seemed to boil fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The anomaly lasted for nearly half a day, and finally, a sword shadow broke through the cage of the black marsh, soared into the sky, and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The swamp sea melted like snow and rushed rapidly inward, converging all onto the humanoid body of the "Black Marsh."</p><p></p><p>After identifying the departure location of the Tian Sha Sword, the Black Marsh was about to track it.</p><p></p><p>Just then…</p><p></p><p>Long Jiuyuan made a move!</p><p></p><p>He unleashed all his power without holding back.</p><p></p><p>And the outcome of this battle was already determined.</p><p></p><p>The Black Marsh, annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Long Jiuyuan, successfully merged with the Dao!</p><p></p><p>"I remember that in the great battle of Tianling Prefecture in the previous life, it seemed that a powerful Daoist fell. I wonder if this newly emerged Daoist can escape this calamity."</p><p></p><p>With fleeting thoughts in his mind, Li Fan's destination was already in sight.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a deserted island.</p><p></p><p>It was Han Yi, who had been missing for a long time!</p><p></p><p>Since the day he narrowly escaped death and fled into the underwater ruins from Li Fan's hands, he had not reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only recently, Li Fan sensed his return to the world of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He did not return from the original deep-sea cave but emerged from the ruins a thousand miles away.</p><p></p><p>He appeared quite disheveled, his clothes stained with blood and tattered. He seemed seriously injured and had to find a nearby island to rest.</p><p></p><p>After sensing the situation here, Li Fan decisively tracked Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>Hiding his figure, Li Fan watched Han Yi from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Long time no see, he was still at the Qi Refinement stage, not having succeeded in Foundation Building.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a strange aura on him that wasn't there before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had not noticed it before.</p><p></p><p>But now, Han Yi, due to his severe injuries, fell into a coma. This aura naturally manifested and helped him recover.</p><p></p><p>His pale face gradually turned rosy at a visible speed. His weak breath also became steady and powerful.</p><p></p><p>A hint of surprise flickered in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan revealed himself, first controlling Han Yi with the "Futu" technique.</p><p></p><p>Then he activated the "Yunshui Illusion Technique," entering Han Yi's dream.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to just escaping death, Han Yi's mental defenses unexpectedly proved fragile.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for Li Fan to break through.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, Li Fan learned of Han Yi's experiences during this time.</p><p></p><p>One day, as Han Yi was suddenly pulled into an underwater vortex, he lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up, he found himself tied up stark naked.</p><p></p><p>Around him were gathered a group of terrifying creatures with human bodies and animal faces.</p><p></p><p>They formed a circle, dancing as if performing some mysterious ritual.</p><p></p><p>In the center, a blazing fire burned.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was instantly terrified, wanting to break free.</p><p></p><p>Despairingly, he found that there was no spiritual energy around at all.</p><p></p><p>And the spiritual power in his elixir field had inexplicably dried up long ago.</p><p></p><p>Like an ordinary person, Han Yi could only watch as he was about to be gleefully pushed into the fire by those monstrous creatures.</p><p></p><p>Just as Han Yi thought he was doomed, the sky suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>A torrential downpour suddenly arrived, extinguishing the fire in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The monstrous creatures were filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>They left Han Yi aside, bowing frantically.</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain lasted for nearly half a day before it stopped.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the monsters were also begging for mercy in fear in the rain.</p><p></p><p>After the rain stopped, the monsters slowly dispersed.</p><p></p><p>And Han Yi, as the sacrifice, naturally was detained again.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

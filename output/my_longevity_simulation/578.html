        <h1>Chapter 578</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In a short period of time, he went from great joy to great shock, and then to great sorrow, narrowly escaping death. </p><p></p><p>Han Yi in this moment only wanted to curse his bad luck. </p><p></p><p>"Just because I won a million contribution points, is it really necessary for my luck to backlash so drastically?" </p><p></p><p>Passing by a deserted island, Han Yi finally fell to the ground, panting heavily in shock. </p><p></p><p>"Indeed, fortunes and misfortunes are unpredictable!" His face fluctuated between brightness and darkness. </p><p></p><p>His premonition was correct; that place was indeed a great opportunity. </p><p></p><p>There was a spirit of heaven and earth that could achieve the realm of harmony, and a strange remaining sword that could contend with the spirit of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>If his strength was enough, he could have killed Qing Feng and subdued the remnant sword just now. </p><p></p><p>By achieving the realm of harmony in one stroke, he could also possess a divine weapon equivalent to his own combat power. </p><p></p><p>Thinking of that scene, Han Yi suddenly became short of breath. </p><p></p><p>He even had the thought of going back to try again. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he still had some rationality and immediately shook his head to push the idea aside. </p><p></p><p>"My strength is not enough!" he lamented in his heart. </p><p></p><p>"To kill Qing Feng, I need at least the transcendence realm. Although I possess the 'Heavenly Luck Sutra,' it will still take at least a hundred years to achieve that." </p><p></p><p>"If during this time, that place is discovered by someone, what should I do?" </p><p></p><p>"I knew it, I shouldn't have been greedy for that small advantage. Using a million contributions to quickly improve my cultivation is the right choice." </p><p></p><p>"What 'play it safe'? There's no easy success in reaching the realm of harmony in one go!" </p><p></p><p>Filled with mixed thoughts, Han Yi became indecisive. </p><p></p><p>Just as Han Yi coincidentally encountered Qing Feng trapped with the sword due to the hint of Li Fan's previous 'Cloud Water Illusion Technique'. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan himself, the instigator, had already quietly left the Cluster Cloud Sea. </p><p></p><p>He arrived at Tianlingzhou. </p><p></p><p>The ceasefire was already in place, and many cultivators who had been called to the front had returned to their hometowns. </p><p></p><p>The previous battlefield had also returned to peace. </p><p></p><p>However, the air still seemed to be filled with a thick smell of blood that couldn't be dispelled. </p><p></p><p>Looking into the distance, the ground was covered with cracks in all directions. </p><p></p><p>The sky was also a mix of red and green, eerie and strange. </p><p></p><p>One after another, cultivators in blue rushed to various places in Tianlingzhou. </p><p></p><p>They cast spells to cleanse the remaining hostility in the air and repair the cracked and broken earth. </p><p></p><p>In the distance, there were occasional muffled roaring sounds. </p><p></p><p>From time to time, distorted scenes in the sky could be seen. </p><p></p><p>"I spit! The Five Elements Grand Paradise is the possession of our Tianlingzhou. Why should we let them move it like this?" </p><p></p><p>"Well, it's good to move out. Although it's a rich place, it's not a good omen. In this battle, too many cultivators have fallen." </p><p></p><p>"Yes, the casualties in Tianlingzhou this time are really heavy. Many old friends have already lost contact." </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Along the way, occasional discussions among the surrounding cultivators could be heard. The cause of the Tianlingzhou battle and the existence of the Five Elements Grand Paradise were no longer secrets. </p><p></p><p>The feelings of the Tianlingzhou cultivators towards this incredibly rich Five Elements Grand Paradise were complex. </p><p></p><p>So, when the official announcement from the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was made to relocate it to the hinterland, many cultivators gathered to watch. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan, hidden among the crowd, only cast a glimpse and quietly retreated afterwards. </p><p></p><p>Going against the flow, he flew towards the original location of the Five Elements Grand Paradise. </p><p></p><p>Not long after, Li Fan arrived at his destination. </p><p></p><p>In the mountains, at the convergence of twin peaks. </p><p></p><p>As if a piece had been forcibly carved out, a dark abyss lay between the heavens and the earth. </p><p></p><p>Turning the originally beautiful scenery of mountains and rivers into something eerie and horrifying. </p><p></p><p>Without the Five Elements Grand Paradise, there was no longer any value in guarding this place. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, these cultivators did not attach much importance to their task. </p><p></p><p>After all, the war had ended, the Five Elements Grand Paradise had been relocated, and who would have nothing else to do but come to this place? </p><p></p><p>Therefore, they were very lax, just gathering together to chat without much vigilance. </p><p></p><p>Hence, Li Fan, hidden in the shadows, easily broke through their defense line and ventured deep into the void above the black hole. </p><p></p><p>Before the pitch-black void, Li Fan stopped his movement and silently observed. </p><p></p><p>Unlike the complete annihilation seen by Ink in the Abyss, various strange energies could still be faintly sensed in the void of Tianlingzhou. </p><p></p><p>There was even still spiritual energy present. </p><p></p><p>"It's not a dead zone..." There was no warning from his spiritual sense, so Li Fan pondered for a moment before flying into the void. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, the light disappeared. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt like a blind man, losing all sight. </p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense spread out like tentacles, constantly radiating around him. </p><p></p><p>However, all the feedback received was the concept of "nothing." </p><p></p><p>Looking back in the direction he came from, the landscape of Tianlingzhou had also vanished. </p><p></p><p>As if suddenly falling into an endless deep sea, Li Fan instantly lost his sense of direction. </p><p></p><p>No matter how he flew in all directions, he couldn't sense any changes in his position. </p><p></p><p>It was as if he was always in the same place, without any change. </p><p></p><p>The extreme contrast between movement and stillness made Li Fan feel a slight dizziness. </p><p></p><p>If it was another cultivator who fell into this situation, there would definitely be some panic. </p><p></p><p>However, for Li Fan, this kind of situation where he was only trapped without any other lethal factors in the void was no reason to worry at all. </p><p></p><p>With 'Stillness' in hand, even the most dangerous forbidden land couldn't trap him! </p><p></p><p>With a thought, he could free himself from this predicament in an instant, so Li Fan was naturally not anxious at all. </p><p></p><p>Maintaining a calm mindset, he did not rush to move but quietly pondered the surroundings. </p><p></p><p>Although it was an empty void, there seemed to be something hidden in the darkness. </p><p></p><p>Every so often, Li Fan could sense ripples of inexplicable movements passing through his body. </p><p></p><p>However, as he tried to carefully trace the source of these ripples, the clues suddenly disappeared. </p><p></p><p>It was as if everything was just his illusion. </p><p></p><p>Immersed in darkness, an unknown amount of time passed without any changes. </p><p></p><p>"Once the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance relocated the Five Elements Grand Paradise, they should have sent people here for investigation." </p><p></p><p>"The fact that they couldn't find any clues at that time indicates that the secrets in this void space are deeply hidden." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself without any urgency. </p><p></p><p>He had plenty of time and opportunities. </p><p></p><p>Putting aside all external affairs, Li Fan focused his mind and abandoned the idea of pursuing the ripples in the void. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he tried not to control his body, allowing it to flow along with the ripples. </p><p></p><p>In a trance, Li Fan felt like he was drifting along with the current in a river. </p><p></p><p>Gradually, he felt his body starting to "move" in this space. </p><p></p><p>But the good times didn't last long. Soon after, he felt like he hit a wall in front, causing a slight tremor in his body, and he was forced to stop.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1014</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Nearly three hundred years have passed, and the Xuanhuang Realm must have drifted further away from the Immortal Ruins. However, it still hasn't collapsed..." The meaning of Qiaogong Jushi's words was clear.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement, "Among the countless realms that have been destroyed, only Xuanhuang has survived. Like you and me, there must be many cultivators who have escaped from other cultivation realms to this place. However, they are all cautiously hiding, perhaps in awe of the power that protects the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, fellow Daoist, I have some knowledge of formations. When I first arrived in Xuanhuang, I detected a vast formation that seemed to envelop the entire world. Its power level is so high that it might be comparable to the legendary immortal-level formations. Feeling shocked, I have always kept a low profile."</p><p></p><p>"I wouldn't dare to make the Lingyuan Sect as grand and powerful as you have, fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiaogong Jushi smiled bitterly, "It seems that you have been keeping an eye on me for a long time!"</p><p></p><p>After a while, Qiaogong Jushi explained, "The Lingyuan Sect may appear to be quite large in scale, but in reality, it's just a loose alliance. The Wanxian Alliance doesn't take it seriously at all. It's just that the geographical environment of the Nine Mountains Prefecture is unique, and it borders the Five Elders Association, so it's a mix of good and bad. Rather than carefully managing it, it's better to let the Lingyuan Sect grow wildly."</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, I have to hand over a portion of the large amount of source power I harvest each time."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what exactly happened during these three hundred years..." A hint of gloom flashed in Qiaogong Jushi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly laughed, "Fellow Daoist, you're just scaring yourself. In fact, the development of the Lingyuan Sect has been thriving over the years. It's just that recently, it suffered an unexpected disaster and was implicated when the suddenly appearing Chuanfa Tianzun's Dharma Image destroyed the Nine Mountains Prefecture with a single glance."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan projected the scene of Chuanfa Tianzun's Dharma Image displaying its power for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi looked at it, his face twitching, and exclaimed in disbelief, "What did they do to provoke Chuanfa Tianzun to take action?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, in the war between two colossal powers, they chose to side with the Five Elders Association," Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi's face was filled with disbelief, and then he said hatefully, "How muddled!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of bewilderment, Qiaogong Jushi seemed to have thought of something and said with some suspicion, "No, that's not right. I can clearly sense that there are still nearly a million people in the world practicing the Cangsheng Lingyuan Cultivation Method..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, about that," Li Fan replied very calmly, "I couldn't bear to see your foundation destroyed in an instant, so I took over."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi was completely stunned upon hearing this, "You..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his thoughts turned rapidly, and he understood everything, "No wonder you discovered my location soon after I was resurrected..."</p><p></p><p>"No, you must have found the location of my resurrection method long ago, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi's face kept changing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, "Rest assured, fellow Daoist, I have no ill intentions. Otherwise, I wouldn't have told you everything truthfully."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Then what exactly do you..." Qiaogong Jushi's expression was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, I see that your skills are extraordinary and that you have the potential to surpass the heavens. Therefore, I want to invite you to join us in our great undertaking!" Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan explained in detail the alliance of myriad realms and the benevolent true immortal Dao lineage of restoring the red dust.</p><p></p><p>"There is actually a true immortal Dao lineage?" Qiao Gong Ju Shi narrowed his eyes, half believing and half doubting.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Li Fan transmitted a trace of golden Wan Ling Qiong Jiang that Qiao Gong Ju Shi was once again inexplicably shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Source power essence?!" He blurted out a term different from what Bai Hua Dao Ren had described.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What is this source power essence? In our Wan Sheng Realm, this substance is called Wan Ling Qiong Jiang." Li Fan asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Ju Shi stared straight at the object in Li Fan's hand, as if he had seen some peerless treasure: "Source power is the fundamental power that drives the advancement of a cultivator's realm. And source power essence is the fundamental force that causes source power to be born."</p><p></p><p>"Or, according to a saying that was once popular in some immortal cultivation realms, the realm is the core, and cultivation is the fruit. The source power essence is the 'Dao Flower' itself, and as for the source and origin of everything, it is the 'Dao' that drives the development of all things."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled Bai Hua Dao Ren's description of Wan Ling Qiong Jiang in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Your analogy is quite novel, my friend." Li Fan kept pondering over these words, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>And Qiao Gong Ju Shi kept staring at the source power essence in his hand, unwilling to look away.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Dao Flower poisonous?" Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Ju Shi was stunned for a moment, and then understood what Li Fan meant. After a moment of contemplation, he explained: "It is harmless to believers. Non-believers will inevitably suffer backlash!"</p><p></p><p>"You should know that the root of the Dao and the flower of the Dao are not powers that we cultivators who have not yet ascended to immortality can grasp."</p><p></p><p>"If we want to use it, we must rely on the 'Immortals'."</p><p></p><p>"But 'Immortals' are beings that are beyond our understanding. When they pursue the root of the Dao, they will inevitably leave traces of themselves. The Dao Flower, Dao Fruit, and Dao Core that are thus produced are all imbued with their unique aura."</p><p></p><p>"In the mortal world, flowers take root, branch out, bloom, and bear fruit in this process. But for us cultivators who pursue the Dao, we seek the cause from the fruit. We search for the source of everything, the root of the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"If it is not personally comprehended, and one wants to take a shortcut without fully understanding the true meaning of the power of the Dao Fruit, and is eager to trace back to the root of the Dao, then one can only rely on the achievements of others."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if you understand what I'm saying, my friend?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because he had personally seen the true Dao Flower, Qiao Gong Ju Shi, in his excitement, had said a lot in one breath.</p><p></p><p>"According to what you said, it seems that there are not many drawbacks to using the power of the Dao Flower?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, as long as you don't go in search of other roots of the Dao in the future." Qiao Gong Ju Shi replied.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a moment and suddenly understood: "One root bears one fruit?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Once tainted by the power of the Dao Flower, it is almost impossible to escape in one's lifetime. If there is an opportunity to go further in the future, one can only follow the path that has already been set and pursue the root of the Dao that has been bound in the mysterious realm. However, there is already a true immortal who has taken a step ahead on the path..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Ju Shi smiled: "So, either become a follower or subordinate of the other party, or kill them and become the strongest on the Dao path."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, there's one more thing I forgot to mention. The fruit is born from the root. If the root withers, the fruit will also wither. So once the immortal at the source dies, those downstream who have used his power to taint the Dao Flower will also die with him."</p>

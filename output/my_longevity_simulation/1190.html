        <h1>Chapter 1190</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Xian!" Zhao Wuji saw the situation and let out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian immediately came back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what does the conflict between Duan Xian Lou and Xian Shu Yuan have to do with me sending you to carry out this mission?" Zhao Wuji asked, narrowing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is a statement and a gesture of goodwill. This is the first time that Duan Xian Lou has collected relics since taking over Zhen Zui Valley. Everyone is watching to see how Duan Xian Lou's new method compares to Xian Shu Yuan's long-standing tradition. Sending away useless relics for waste utilization... this is something that can be done casually, but Master specifically let us run this errand in person. It is both to make your attitude clear to Duan Xian Lou, and to make a statement to the outside forces that are watching..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian said weakly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji listened and nodded repeatedly, very satisfied with Zhao Xian's analysis.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw Zhao Xian's indifferent expression, he couldn't help but get angry.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to say something, Zhao Xian took the initiative to interrupt, "Master, I really don't understand. The Immortal Boat is already in this state, so why can't we unite instead of fighting each other to the death first?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji's expression changed, and he waved his hand to prevent his disciple's voice from leaking out.</p><p></p><p>"You unworthy disciple..."</p><p></p><p>"Am I wrong?" Zhao Xian raised his neck, not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a ruler appeared in Zhao Wuji's hand. He raised it high, about to bring it down on Zhao Xian's head.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he didn't do it harshly.</p><p></p><p>"Xian'er, you don't understand."</p><p></p><p>"This Xuan Immortal Boat must have, and can only have, one helmsman. The tragic event many years ago has already shown the terrible consequences of the highest decision-making level not being able to unite." Zhao Wuji sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Xian also looked dejected and no longer argued.</p><p></p><p>"You may go down." Zhao Wuji suddenly lost interest.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go out recently, just cultivate honestly in the academy. Since Master has already taken sides, we just have to wait for them to determine the winner. Even if Duan Xian Lou really loses, Xian Shu Yuan won't dare to do anything to our Zheng Dao Academy. At most, they will just reduce our resource allocation."</p><p></p><p>The three disciples obeyed and left, returning to their respective residences.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Dao Academy, the name was quite domineering.</p><p></p><p>But Zhao Xian's residence was a bit too simple.</p><p></p><p>It didn't look like a place for a cultivator to rest at all, just a single room barely enough to live in.</p><p></p><p>The only thing worth mentioning was that the concentration of spiritual energy in the room was obviously much higher than in other areas of the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to satisfy cultivation below the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Closing the door and skillfully sealing it with a restriction, a hint of excitement flashed in Zhao Xian's eyes as he rummaged under the bed for a book-like magic tool.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to use it, he suddenly fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly revealed his figure with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>He took the book-like magic tool.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... it's similar to the Tian Xuan Mirror, connecting to the Immortal Boat's consultation network. It can also exchange corresponding resources with the academy's contributions. However, it is limited to within the Zheng Dao Academy and cannot connect to other areas of the Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and tossed the so-called [Wan Wen Lu] aside.</p><p></p><p>How could a mere Qi Refining stage teenager resist Li Fan's probing?</p><p></p><p>Before long, all of Zhao Xian's secrets from childhood to adulthood were seen through by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhao Xian and Zhao Wuji both had the surname Zhao, they didn't have much of a blood relationship.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji's excessive love for Zhao Xian was entirely due to Zhao Xian's impressive "cultivation talent".</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the Academy of Proving Dao for just a year, he had already reached the late stage of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Although this cultivation speed was not worth mentioning in the Xuanhuang Realm, it was already considered outstanding on this Divine Boat.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation resources on the Divine Boat were limited. Even the Academy of Proving Dao was living frugally and could only prioritize supplying those disciples with exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>Every three academic years, they would implement a last-place elimination system.</p><p></p><p>Those who fell behind in their progress had to leave the academy and either return home, choose to become a rogue cultivator, or accept an appointment from the Divine Pivot Institute to serve in various positions on the Divine Boat.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this cruel elimination system that allowed the Academy of Proving Dao to maintain its advantage and vitality at all times.</p><p></p><p>Not only the disciples would be eliminated, but even Yuan Ying stage cultivators like Zhao Wuji faced great pressure.</p><p></p><p>If the disciples they taught performed mediocrely, it indicated that they lacked teaching talent.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't have a strong background or backing, they would have to leave their teaching position and take on other duties with a certain degree of danger.</p><p></p><p>It was for this reason that the atmosphere in the Academy of Proving Dao was very oppressive.</p><p></p><p>No one knew when they would be forced to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhao Xian was an exception.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was due to his nature, but he didn't have a strong attachment to staying in the Academy of Proving Dao.</p><p></p><p>He even lacked enthusiasm for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Outsiders all believed that reaching the late stage of Qi Refining in a year was the result of his bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only he himself knew that this was merely his performance after slacking off and not investing much effort.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian's greatest interest was searching for strange tales and anecdotes in the Wanwen Record.</p><p></p><p>He was full of interest in the origin of the Divine Boat, everything about the ancient cultivation world, and the endless starry sea beyond the Divine Boat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully read through his experiences over the past year.</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, the Divine Boat was still intact. However, due to a sudden catastrophe in the Starry Sea Realm and internal strife, the Divine Boat was split into two parts from then on."</p><p></p><p>"One was named [Xuan], and the other was named [Shang]."</p><p></p><p>"This one is the Xuan Divine Boat."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Li Fan continued reading.</p><p></p><p>"For a long time after the Divine Boat was split, it was an era of chaos, drifting aimlessly in the starry sea and completely out of control."</p><p></p><p>"The population also plummeted during that time, with nearly nine-tenths dying in that period."</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't until the Divine Boat finally stabilized that it appeared in this sea of relics."</p><p></p><p>"Since then, it has never left..."</p><p></p><p>"Although it can be transferred within a small range, it lacks the power to escape the strong binding force surrounding the relics."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing how the people of the Divine Boat named that attractive force, Li Fan suddenly fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"[Echoing Star Force]?"</p><p></p><p>"What does this word 'echoing' mean?"</p><p></p><p>As a mere Qi Refining cultivator, Zhao Xian already knew so much, which was all he could find out by shamelessly pestering the senior members of the academy.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the source of the Echoing Star Force was not something he could know.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only suppress his doubts for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He began to consider his next plan.</p><p></p><p>The divine fetus's power was too weak, and only by letting the holy fetus enter could he have enough leeway to make a move.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that needed to be resolved was the residual power of the True Immortal Seal characters.</p>

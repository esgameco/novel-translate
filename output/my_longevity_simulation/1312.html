        <h1>Chapter 1312</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The primary task in this life is to merge the super Xuanhuang realm's heavenly and earthly immortal souls.</p><p></p><p>Before achieving this goal, it's best to avoid these two for now.</p><p></p><p>"The art of sealing souls to replace realms is also mentioned in the Heavenly Doctor's Scripture of Mending the Heavens."</p><p></p><p>"A realm is like a person. Just as a person's body can be possessed, so can a world."</p><p></p><p>"However, there are two prerequisites for successfully replacing a realm. First, the divine sense serving as the world soul must be extremely powerful. At the very least, it can't be much weaker than the world's Dao source consciousness. Otherwise, during the brief process of realm replacement, the world itself will collapse from the inside out. It would be a catastrophe tantamount to the end of the world."</p><p></p><p>An image of the transparent figure inside the Dharma-transmitting body flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"As for the second prerequisite, the practitioner needs to achieve complete suppression of the world. The world's consciousness must be made to fall into deep slumber. If two consciousnesses exist simultaneously, it could very likely lead to the splitting of the world..."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Doctor, the Dharma Transmitter, and the five Patriarchs of the Five Elders Council joining forces can indeed accomplish this."</p><p></p><p>Combining the contents of the Scripture of Mending the Heavens with the Heavenly Doctor's textbook-like practical operation, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Sealing the soul to replace the realm, sealing the soul to replace the realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Dao consciousness of the minor Daxuan World has just been born, it's the perfect opportunity for me to test it out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head, his eyes piercing through the earth, straight to the Daxuan sky.</p><p></p><p>As if pierced by a sharp arrow, a seven-colored vortex appeared on the sky curtain. None of the living beings in Daxuan, except for Li Fan, could perceive it.</p><p></p><p>And within this seven-colored vortex, the world's consciousness, like a baby, was sound asleep.</p><p></p><p>Fearing that any rough movements would disturb Him, Li Fan very carefully split off a wisp of divine sense and stealthily approached.</p><p></p><p>Then he carefully comprehended.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the rising winds and clouds, the ebbing tides, the falling flowers and blooming blossoms of the Daxuan World all appeared before Li Fan's eyes one by one.</p><p></p><p>It was as if these changes were happening to his own body.</p><p></p><p>As his perception deepened, in addition to the natural scenery, the joys, anger, sorrows, fears, birth, aging, sickness and death of the living beings in Daxuan also began to appear in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Empathizing with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of cultivators in the world, this would be a rare opportunity. Immersing oneself in it, calming the mind and comprehending, it wouldn't be difficult to grasp a move or two of earth-shattering divine powers.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan actively withdrew from this enlightenment process.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a state of half-clarity and half-enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Simulating, myriad living beings!"</p><p></p><p>With a movement of his mind, a semi-transparent figure of Li Fan immediately appeared inside the starry vortex of the Daxuan sky.</p><p></p><p>Pouring all the insights gained from the Daxuan Dao into it.</p><p></p><p>The semi-transparent figure gradually changed, as if reversing aging, transforming from a middle-aged man to a wailing newborn baby!</p><p></p><p>Yet the baby's behavior was as sophisticated as an adult's.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the sleeping Daxuan Dao consciousness, it pressed close and suddenly enveloped it...</p><p></p><p>Replacing it!</p><p></p><p>The earth shook and mountains swayed as crack-like scars spread out from the central starry vortex in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Dissociation Disk! Extrapolate!"</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's sea of consciousness, the Ultimate Dissociation Disk temporarily stopped its task of extrapolating the downgrading of immortal formations, and instead devoted its full power to calculating the compatibility of the Daxuan simulated personality.</p><p></p><p>After continuous improvements through the Simulated Myriad Living Beings Formation, the flickering transparent infant finally stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Replacement!"</p><p></p><p>A golden needle gathered in Li Fan's hand, who was deep underground. He then shot it towards the simulated Daxuan Dao in the sky curtain.</p><p></p><p>It hit right between the brows at the Yintang acupoint.</p><p></p><p>The semi-transparent infant instinctively let out a faint cry. The first cry of heaven and earth, the soundless Dao. No one in the world could hear it, yet in an instant, it spread throughout the entire minor Daxuan World.</p><p></p><p>From weak to strong, growing more and more sonorous. In the end, it became inaudible.</p><p></p><p>And amidst the crying of this simulated Daxuan personality, the anomalies in the world gradually disappeared, returning to its initial tranquility.</p><p></p><p>The wounds and vortex in the sky healed, but Li Fan could sense the simulated personality that had replaced the newborn Daxuan Dao consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it would be more appropriate to call it a simulated Dao personality.</p><p></p><p>The newborn Daxuan Dao consciousness was not destroyed by Li Fan, but forcibly suppressed and sealed in slumber.</p><p></p><p>All the slow growth of the Dao consciousness would be absorbed and synchronized to the simulated Dao personality. To ensure the correct operation of the Daxuan Dao.</p><p></p><p>Like nourishment to strengthen the simulated Dao personality, once it could fully take over the operation of the minor Daxuan World's Dao, it would completely devour that Dao consciousness that had been sleeping since birth.</p><p></p><p>Completing the true metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully comprehended the operational state of the Daxuan simulated Dao personality.</p><p></p><p>The simulated Dao personality was his creation, so he could naturally perceive all the information it received. The current situation was as if he had a Dao clone constantly helping him comprehend the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a minor world's Dao, its advantage lay in its continuous and accumulating nature.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>"Being the first attempt, the methods were a bit crude. If it weren't for the Ultimate Dissociation Disk's timely adjustments, I'm afraid the Daxuan World would have been destroyed by my hands." Li Fan looked at the great ravines on the surface of Daxuan caused by the disturbance of heaven and earth, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"But with this experience, sealing souls to replace the realms of other minor worlds should go much smoother."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the traditional realm replacement technique in the Heavenly Doctor's Scripture of Mending the Heavens, Li Fan's improved version used a simulated Dao personality.</p><p></p><p>Originating from the insights of the Pseudo-Reality and the nine-star red pearl of the ancient Daxuan realm-protecting immortal formation, this simulation technique could probably only be performed by Li Fan in the world.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, no matter how many minor worlds he manipulated, there was no need to worry about the risk of losing control.</p><p></p><p>"After the myriad realms return to Xuanhuang, the minor world Daos will also merge with the Xuanhuang Dao. Although the scale is not proportional, ants can still kill an elephant when in great numbers. Coupled with my other methods at that time..."</p><p></p><p>An ingenious and sinister plan was instantly born in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Now limited by my current strength, I can only create simulated Dao personalities on the scale of minor worlds. After I ascend in the future, perhaps I can create simulated Xuanhuang, or even simulated Starry Seas..."</p><p></p><p>As he gradually tasted the sweetness of comprehending the Pseudo-Reality, Li Fan increasingly felt that this transformation of the real and the false was the fundamental source of his power, even more so than specific cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that this Dao is too profound. Even after reincarnating for a hundred lifetimes, I have only comprehended a little. Moreover, this Pseudo-Reality Dao can only be comprehended by me who possesses the Huan Zhen. It cannot be borrowed from."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also vaguely sensed that for the comprehension of Pseudo-Reality, the so-called talent and comprehension commonly discussed in the immortal cultivation world were useless.</p><p></p><p>To further explore its true profundity, the most important thing was actually...</p><p></p><p>Opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Or, to put it in more colloquial terms, it depended on Huan Zhen's mood.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, after Huan Zhen came into contact with the so-called new interfering variables, Li Fan found that his comprehension of the Pseudo-Reality transformation had become noticeably easier.</p><p></p><p>Although his innate talent and comprehension had not changed, it was as if the distance had become closer and easier to touch. How profound it was!</p><p></p><p>"Resonating Dao, projection..." Li Fan recalled the Holy Emperor's Dharma transmission and the various statements of the little loli Yan Fa Jue from his previous life. His eyes narrowed slightly as countless speculations welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The anomalies in the Daxuan heaven and earth did not have much impact on the living beings within. Soon, people refocused their attention on that Holy Master who kept preaching.</p><p></p><p>For five years, the Holy Master preached without stopping.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had been eight years since the anchoring. The preaching platform had also expanded from its initial scale to a radius of five hundred miles. Even so, people from all over the world continued to come in an endless stream to seek the Dao and a master.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the virtual image of the Holy Master lightly waved the duster in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of tens of thousands, the preaching platform with a radius of a hundred miles actually became the center of the world. The surrounding mountains and plains, rivers and lakes, all revolved and flowed around the preaching platform.</p><p></p><p>The living beings on the preaching platform sat still, yet traveled a thousand miles a day.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, the preaching platform, carrying millions of disciples, became the center of the minor Daxuan World.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the highest step of the preaching platform already represented the realm of Golden Core perfection.</p><p></p><p>There were three people sitting on that level, overlooking the Daxuan living beings below who were getting farther and farther away from them.</p><p></p><p>They were Sun Erlang, Wang Xuanba, and Yue Zhenwei.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were all disciples of the Holy Master, addressing each other as martial brothers.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, the upcoming Nascent Soul realm requires devouring the heavenly cave-heavens. It seems we will have to leave Daxuan for a while," Yue Zhenwei asked respectfully, even though the other party was much younger than him.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Master not only imparted the profound principles of the Dao, but also mentioned a lot about the common knowledge of immortal cultivation and specific situational intelligence of the immortal cultivation world. Therefore, the Daxuan cultivators were not completely ignorant of the world outside Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang also didn't put on airs: "Brother Yue, there's no need for such courtesy. You are older than me, so I should be the one calling you martial brother."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the other party to respond, Sun Erlang went straight to the point: "We are fellow disciples, and the Xuanhuang native realm is in grave danger. For this trip, we should go together and take care of each other."</p><p></p><p>"As the Holy Master's first disciples, we already know the locations of the cave-heavens that Master has marked for us. But..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's tone was proud, a hint of confidence flashing in his eyes: "Those are just the most common cave-heavens. They are barely enough to form the Nascent Soul, but if you have ambitions and want to further peek into the Deity Transformation realm, they are far from sufficient!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to go find a cave-heaven suitable for myself," Sun Erlang said with determination.</p><p></p><p>Yue Zhenwei's face lit up with joy: "Brother Sun, your thoughts are exactly the same as mine!"</p><p></p><p>"In the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, most of the cave-heavens are monopolized by the Immortal Alliance and the powerful families within the alliance. In contrast, there are more opportunities on the Five Elders Council's side. Especially in the Land of No Worries, it is said that the cultivators there are all immersed in dreamscapes, and reality is basically unguarded..."</p><p></p><p>The three of them discussed and reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>Then they bid farewell to the Holy Master and left Daxuan, heading towards the location of the Land of No Worries.</p><p></p><p>The virtual image of Li Fan on the preaching platform glanced at them indifferently.</p><p></p><p>His mouth continued to preach without stopping.</p><p></p><p>This preaching platform was now the center of Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, under the manipulation of the simulated Dao personality, the power of formations had been silently circulating without pause. Like a huge smelting vessel, it projected and engraved all the living beings listening to the Dao inside onto a silver-white pearl.</p><p></p><p>The principle was based on the Xuanhuang Nine-Star Red Pearl that Li Fan had seen before. Although it could not yet completely record all the information of the living beings, it could already synchronize the experiences of the living beings and project them into the silver-white pearl for recording and preservation.</p><p></p><p>Like a huge eye, it stared intently at the living beings on the preaching platform. No matter how far they ran, they could not escape its gaze.</p><p></p><p>This surveillance only acted on the living beings themselves. Therefore, it would not be detected by other external forces. It was not limited to the experiences of the living beings in reality; even those in dreams and illusions could hardly escape its projection.</p><p></p><p>"The living beings in the mortal world, once in the eye, cannot escape."</p><p></p><p>"The master of heaven and earth, the master of myriad spirits."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the preaching figure resounded throughout the minor Daxuan World, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true body came alone to the minor world where the Youzu gathered.</p><p></p><p>There were rules, and it was very simple.</p><p></p><p>Eating, praying, martial training, reproducing, sleeping.</p><p></p><p>"The first generation Grand Heavenly Venerate..."</p><p></p><p>In this excerpt, Li Fan, the protagonist, is investigating the origins of the mysterious power possessed by the Youzu people, a race that has been hunted by the Wanxian Alliance. Li Fan believes that this power is related to a long-lost artifact that shares similarities with his own ability, "Jia Yi Zhen" (The Truth in Falsehood).</p><p></p><p>To uncover the secrets, Li Fan possesses the body of a strong Youzu man and spends over half a year living among them, observing the process of how the mysterious power is generated during their daily prayers. He discovers that a part of the body and soul is transformed by a formation-like existence within them, creating the golden "Yuanli Jingcui" (Essence of Primal Power). This process reminds Li Fan of his own ability.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the artifact responsible for this power is likely lost with the disappearance of the immortal realm, Li Fan attempts to recreate the mysterious power using his "Jia Yi Zhen" ability. Despite numerous failures, he persists, believing that success would greatly expand the applications of his power.</p><p></p><p>After receiving a blessing from the Youzu chief, Li Fan notices a slight improvement in the mysterious imprint within him. As his possessed body nears its end, Li Fan makes a final prayer, and the imprint becomes clearer than ever before. His true self, hidden nearby, attempts to capture the fleeting inspiration by drawing a complex symbol in the air, hoping to recreate the unknown artifact's power.</p><p></p><p>However, the symbol proves to be endlessly complex, beyond Li Fan's current abilities. Realizing that this was his only chance in this lifetime, he reluctantly gives up, knowing that he can try again in his next life after achieving "Heavenly Immortal Fusion" (Tiandi Xianpo Hedao).</p><p></p><p>Although he failed to fully capture the mysterious symbol, Li Fan gains some insights into its structure, believing it could improve immortal formations and true immortal seal scripts. He ponders the true nature of this mysterious symbol as the excerpt ends.</p>

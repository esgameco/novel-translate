        <h1>Chapter 1281</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1277: The Dark Sea Hides a True Immortal (7K words, please subscribe and vote)</p><p></p><p>The killing intent, as if tangible, swept towards the Holy Emperor's seat, but was dissipated into nothingness by the threads of golden light in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After Mo Rubin's rage had subsided a little, Li Ping said calmly, "I can see that your heart is not truly angry."</p><p></p><p>"Still acting in front of me? Or once you get into the role, even you find it hard to distinguish?"</p><p></p><p>"Look, true anger is like this..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor suddenly took a step forward, and a powerful force erupted from his toes, sweeping wildly around him. The glow of the white jade flagpole swayed endlessly like a willow in the wind.</p><p></p><p>But this surging energy quickly dissipated after leaving the range of the light circle and entering the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>The silent dark sea rippled with threads. Erasing all disturbances.</p><p></p><p>As if comforting the furious Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need you to teach me! I understand this place better than you!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's figure suddenly appeared behind Li Ping. A shadow hidden under the white brilliance of the white jade flagpole, like a viper, bared its fangs at Li Ping's neck.</p><p></p><p>The golden armor on the surface of the Holy Emperor instantly showed cracks, and a black line pounced out from the hole in the center, heading straight for Li Ping's neck.</p><p></p><p>However, just as it was about to succeed, it was blocked by Li Ping's outstretched palm.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bound and squirming shadow in the center of his hand, Li Ping said coldly, "Another personality? This one... is very much like you."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he did not directly crush this sneak attacker, but let it return to Mo Rubin's side.</p><p></p><p>However, Mo Rubin himself had already disappeared from the spot, not even wanting the magic weapon white jade flagpole. Taking advantage of this moment of conversation.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping shook his head slightly, the kick he made before was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>Following the remaining response, he moved quickly in the dark sea, chasing after Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>The direction Mo Rubin was heading seemed to be the crack where the Wanxian Alliance was extracting the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know where you got the trick, but you dare to talk big in front of me?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't I know that this dark sea accommodates everything, and even the emotions of cultivators will cause ripples and then be covered by darkness?"</p><p></p><p>"You even see through my heart?"</p><p></p><p>Dozens of Mo Rubin's faces, hidden in the darkness, floated over from time to time, mocking Li Ping with sarcasm.</p><p></p><p>Their tones were all different, but without exception, after saying their own lines, they dissolved spontaneously into the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>Since these demon faces did not launch an attack, Li Ping directly ignored them and let them mock, only quickly approaching Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>The demon faces' chatter continued.</p><p></p><p>"What is the real me again? I am the number one genius of the Nine Refinement Sect, the first person to become an immortal with hope. I am also one of the Twelve Dharma Kings of the Xuantian Sect, assisting Xuanyuan Hong to create the great cause of the Xuantian Sect and unify the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, should I always show the same face? The top genius should always be steady? The Twelve Dharma Kings should plan before acting?"</p><p></p><p>"Wrong, wrong, wrong! Laughing and scolding is me, unruly is me, unrestrained is also me!"</p><p></p><p>"Using the immortal heart to control the demon faces, whatever is encountered, that's the attitude that should be shown!"</p><p></p><p>"As for stubborn do-gooders like you, you should be cursed awake viciously!"</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think you are?! You haven't even stepped into the realm of immortals, and you want to save the world?!"</p><p></p><p>Dozens of faces split around again, spewing a bunch of extremely unpleasant words at the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Emperor didn't have the slightest fluctuation in his expression.</p><p></p><p>His eyes seemed to penetrate layers of darkness, and on Mo Rubin's face not far ahead, there was the same calmness as him.</p><p></p><p>Phew...</p><p></p><p>The waves of the dark sea stopped Mo Rubin's advancing footsteps.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stopped, looking up at the distant sky.</p><p></p><p>A gap was spewing out dark power at regular intervals. The intermittent muffled sound was like a heavy heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>"It's really damn it."</p><p></p><p>"With such a group of worms dragging you down, how can you succeed."</p><p></p><p>Another shadowy face appeared above Li Ping's head. This time the words were no longer as crazy and angry as before. But Li Ping could hear that beneath the calmness, there was real killing intent hidden.</p><p></p><p>"I once tried to mobilize the power of the dark sea to close that gap. But it was blocked by an eyeball..."</p><p></p><p>"Is the owner of that eyeball the Xuantian King?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor came to Mo Rubin's side and placed his hand on his shoulder, transmitting his voice.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin did not look back, but a face suddenly appeared on the back of his head, looking at Li Ping with great disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Would Brother Xuanyuan do such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not angry either, and asked along with his words, "Then why can that eyeball mobilize the power of the dark sea?"</p><p></p><p>The face on the back of Mo Rubin's head disappeared, "Do you know what the essence of this dark sea is?"</p><p></p><p>"Formation?" After pondering for a moment, Li Ping replied.</p><p></p><p>"Really stupid enough." Mo Rubin sneered, "The formation is just an appearance. What really creates this gathering of darkness, allowing the Xuanhuang Realm to resist the suction force in the ruins of the ascension passage, is..."</p><p></p><p>At the crucial point, Mo Rubin suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to know?" He asked in a somewhat teasing tone, his voice flirtatious.</p><p></p><p>"I do." Li Ping said frankly.</p><p></p><p>"The only thing that can fight against true immortals is the power of true immortals."</p><p></p><p>"The one who created the catastrophe of the Darkest Star Sea was an enlightened true immortal. Then the one who can generate enough power to allow the Xuanhuang Realm to escape..."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally it is another true immortal."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, it was like a thunderbolt, resounding in the mind of the Faceless Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding darkness seemed to come alive in an instant, all peering at him.</p><p></p><p>"True immortals are indeed true immortals."</p><p></p><p>"But they are dead true immortals. Right?"</p><p></p><p>However, the Holy Emperor, who suddenly learned such a secret, seemed to have expected it long ago.</p><p></p><p>He calmly asked back.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin shrugged, "It's really boring to talk to you smart people."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the foundation of the entire dark sea is the transformation of a true immortal's corpse."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not surprised by this result.</p><p></p><p>The dark sea can absorb the faith of the dark race and transform it into the essence of source power. But it doesn't care if its believers change their faith.</p><p></p><p>Once the true immortal's web is formed, it exists in substance and does not change with will.</p><p></p><p>Once fallen into the web, if you want to escape, you must burst out a power that can tear apart the true immortal's web.</p><p></p><p>Those weak dark race people naturally do not have such ability. The only reasonable explanation is that the owner of the true immortal's web has already perished.</p><p></p><p>The restraint is no more.</p><p></p><p>"True immortal." Li Ping repeated these two words.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm, a fallen true immortal."</p><p></p><p>"It's amazing, isn't it? A mere lower realm actually has a true immortal falling here. But fortunately, the Xuanhuang Realm hides a true immortal's corpse. Otherwise, even if Brother Xuanyuan wanted to save the Xuanhuang Realm, there would be no good way." Mo Rubin said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping introduced the existence of the Fallen Immortal Realm to Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>"Oh. I didn't expect that there would really be a succeeding Heavenly Venerate willing to share this true immortal's remnant thoughts with the world." After hearing this, the aura on Mo Rubin's body became unstable again.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to imagine that there are people even more stupid than Brother Xuanyuan in the world. It's really..."</p><p></p><p>"He has already fallen." Li Ping added.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he said, "He died well. He died well..."</p><p></p><p>Although he said this with his mouth, for some reason, Li Ping always felt that his expression was a little sad.</p><p></p><p>So Li Ping asked the question he had always wanted to ask, "Is the Xuantian King really dead?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin turned his head and stared blankly at Li Ping, "You ask me, who should I ask? He probably isn't dead. I'm also looking for him. Someone as strong as Brother Xuanyuan, even if he was secretly plotted against, he wouldn't die like this."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, without giving Li Ping a chance to continue communicating, he directly turned back.</p><p></p><p>"The dark sea, with the [Gathering Spirits Ascension Formation] as the foundation, the true immortal's remains as the bones, and the bloodline of the first generation Great Heavenly Venerate as the rope. Creating something out of nothing, giving birth to a power sufficient to resist the suction force of a true immortal."</p><p></p><p>"But after all, it's just a dead thing. Without the control core, it has actually become someone else's nourishment."</p><p></p><p>"So, never die. Even if you were a true immortal when you were alive, so what? After you die, even ants can bully you."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin looked at the device in the distance where the Wanxian Alliance was extracting the power of darkness, his tone mocking.</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline of the first generation Great Heavenly Venerate?" The strange appearance of the dark race flashed through Li Ping's mind, and his heart couldn't help but move.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder only these people can communicate with the dark sea. But..."</p><p></p><p>The direct bloodline of a true immortal, without much thought, one would know how noble it is. But now it has become this kind of neither human nor ghost appearance.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin seemed to see through Li Ping's thoughts and said coldly, "There is no need to sympathize with these people. If you lived in that era and personally experienced how the Great Heavenly Venerate's bloodline enslaved others..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid you would be the first to rise up."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for Brother Xuanyuan's intervention back then, exterminating all their claws and teeth, who knows how long these superior people would have acted tyrannically. Becoming like this now is also their blessing." Mo Rubin laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not argue with Mo Rubin on this issue anymore.</p><p></p><p>"The dark sea is actually using the remains of a true immortal to condense the dark immortal power to resist the immortal ruins. Then what exactly is the eyeball that the Wanxian Alliance possesses?" He asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal ruins..." Mo Rubin seemed to disagree with this term very much, and gave another cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he did not dwell on the trivial details, but directly answered Li Ping's question, "That is just a magic tool refined by Brother Xuanyuan back then to control the dark sea. After all, he can't watch here all the time, and the dark sea is too important in the entire escape plan, so he needs our assistance. There are three in total, distributed to different Dharma Kings."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know whose it is in the hands of this Wanxian Alliance." A hint of killing intent flashed in Mo Rubin's words.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping nodded slightly, "Is there a way to influence the control of that eyeball magic tool over the dark sea?"</p><p></p><p>"If your attainments in formations are better than Brother Xuanyuan's..."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was about to mock, but suddenly remembered the level of formation dao displayed by the Holy Emperor in the previous confrontation.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it can be tried in the core hub of the Gathering Spirits Ascension Formation." Mo Rubin said.</p><p></p><p>His gaze shifted from the crack in the dark sea to the other side.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping looked in the direction of his gaze and said with some emotion, "This formation is indeed mysterious and unparalleled. I pride myself on my extraordinary attainments in formations, but in this piece of darkness, I can't even glimpse half a trace of the formation dao."</p><p></p><p>"That's the effect of the true immortal's remains." Mo Rubin bluntly pointed out the error in Li Ping's words, "If it weren't for the diffusion power of the true immortal's remains, you should be able to do it."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin called out, then slightly discerned the direction and disappeared into the darkness as a black line.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping followed closely.</p><p></p><p>The closer they got to the so-called core of the dark sea, for some reason, a sense of unease suddenly surged in Li Ping's heart for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Even some blurry images flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was a scene where Mo Rubin was left with only a shell, lying quietly in this dark sea.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>With a shudder in his heart, Li Ping called out to Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Although a little dissatisfied, Mo Rubin still stopped temporarily.</p><p></p><p>"You'd better have something real."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment regarding the other party's attitude, he said, "What kind of power can instantly kill you?"</p><p></p><p>As if hearing an extremely funny joke, faces flew out from Mo Rubin's body one by one, coming in front of Li Ping, making a big fuss.</p><p></p><p>"Instantly kill me? The demon heart is indestructible, the immortal body is unending. As long as there is one personality, I will not truly die!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's a true immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"A true immortal should be able to do it."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's main body suddenly said, and those clamoring faces instantly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, with Brother Xuanyuan's strength, it could be done unintentionally."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's main body analyzed very rationally. </p><p></p><p>After hearing Mo Rubin's conclusion, Li Ping straightforwardly expressed his concerns.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this time Mo Rubin did not refute.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly said something that seemed completely irrelevant: "The entire Dark Sea is built upon the remains of true immortals."</p><p></p><p>"In our era, this place was far from being as vast as it is now. It seems the Great Celestial Venerable's bloodline has proliferated well over the years."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... although there has been a shrinking trend recently, it doesn't affect the overall situation."</p><p></p><p>"Gathering spiritual energy to ascend to immortality, ascending to immortality to gather spiritual energy, in fact, this place can also be regarded as a masterless true immortal body that has cultivated on its own for nearly 10,000 years. Inside the body, it is all pure true immortal power."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that... this true immortal power was cultivated based on the remains of true immortals. So theoretically speaking, only that departed true immortal can use them."</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically speaking." Mo Rubin repeated these three words again.</p><p></p><p>"But there are countless mysterious techniques in the world, there must be some method that can break this shackle."</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sacred Emperor gazed into the distance at this boundless Dark Sea: "If such vast energy could be controlled, I'm afraid it could instantly erupt with power comparable to a true immortal."</p><p></p><p>"A child carrying a cauldron, the result is being crushed to death by it." Mo Rubin shattered Li Ping's fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to walk towards the core of the Gathering Spirit Ascension Formation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm thinking, is it possible that after Brother Xuanyuan was severely injured, he hid here."</p><p></p><p>"If we were to say who in the Xuanhuang Realm is most likely to absorb the power of this Dark Sea, it would undoubtedly be him."</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was talking to himself, and also seemed to be explaining to Li Ping the reason why he had to go there regardless of the danger.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, with me by your side. If the two of us join forces, even if we encounter a crisis, there shouldn't be much of a problem if we want to escape." Li Ping said calmly, also following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"What a fool. That's why good people die fast." Mo Rubin seemed to not appreciate Li Ping's good intentions and mocked.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping's attention was focused on the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The darkness gathered here, becoming increasingly thick. Knowing that the essence of this darkness was the power of true immortal remains, Li Ping, being in it, had a completely different feeling from before.</p><p></p><p>But what made him a little strange was that the cat treasure, which had always been very greedy for immortal-level energy, seemed to not sense such vast energy at all at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It was still sleeping sweetly on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>It didn't even open its eyes once.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Li Ping increased his vigilance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Mo Rubin stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Should be?" Li Ping was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Such ambiguous words shouldn't be spoken from the mouth of Mo Rubin, the Dharma King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Someone has been here before. And made modifications to the formation." Mo Rubin's tone became unprecedentedly solemn. Li Ping also heard the hidden anticipation and excitement in it.</p><p></p><p>However, after circling around, he looked at Li Ping again.</p><p></p><p>"This formation is a bit complicated."</p><p></p><p>The implication was to let the Sacred Emperor help.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping shook his head slightly: "The power of true immortal remains is pervasive, I can't sense the traces of the formation."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin snorted: "Watch closely!"</p><p></p><p>A shadowy face instantly flew out from his body, coming towards Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not feel any malice, so he did not dodge.</p><p></p><p>This shadowy demon face of Mo Rubin's very mischievously swam and attached itself to Li Ping's blank face.</p><p></p><p>Before he could express his displeasure, Li Ping was attracted by the magnificent scene that suddenly lit up in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The dark and silent Dark Sea suddenly shed its mysterious veil.</p><p></p><p>Revealing its true appearance hidden underneath.</p><p></p><p>Like thick clouds accumulated in the sky, evolving into their own different forms. The dark power gathered piece by piece, Li Ping and Mo Rubin seemed to be in the high heavens, in the kingdom of clouds.</p><p></p><p>The aggregates of dark power moved slowly and extremely quickly. When they approached each other, they engulfed each other and transformed into new shapes again.</p><p></p><p>And at the very center of this Dark Sea, those ancient dark clouds that had settled for more than 10,000 years emitted an aura that made even Li Ping's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>These ancient aggregates were truly like terrifying ancient exotic beasts, quietly residing in the depths of the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a true immortal's power. The energy contained in each cloud here, if erupted, far exceeds the full-strength strike of the Longevity Realm."</p><p></p><p>"What great power!" Li Ping exclaimed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also noticed that the device used by the Myriad Immortal Alliance to extract the dark power was actually absorbing the clouds floating in various parts of the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Myriad Immortal Alliance seemed to be able to distinguish the size of the clouds, and did not take action against those larger aggregates. The targets were mostly concentrated on those small, wandering individuals.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see it clearly now." Mo Rubin's voice interrupted Li Ping's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping came back to his senses from the shock and observed carefully again.</p><p></p><p>However, before starting to solve it, Li Ping asked a question first.</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation, in my previous deduction results, consists of four sub-formations."</p><p></p><p>"The golden chain used to lock onto and capture the immortal realm outside the star sea; the Celestial Beast Eye serving as an observation post; the Dark Sea used to escape the attraction of the Immortal Ruins, which is the Gathering Spirit Ascension Grand Formation. What is the remaining one?"</p><p></p><p>With the help of Mo Rubin's demon face, Li Ping only stared at Mo Rubin's main body.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin shrugged and replied very naturally, "How would I know."</p><p></p><p>"The Crossing Formations were almost all built by Brother Xuanyuan alone. We only had the opportunity to get close and see them after he completed the construction of the formations. Different Dharma Kings were responsible for different areas. I'm just a little familiar with this place."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not find any flaws in Mo Rubin's words.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't easily believe it either.</p><p></p><p>Not dwelling on this matter for now, Li Ping first focused on analyzing the formation here.</p><p></p><p>After all, he really wanted to personally meet the legendary Mysterious Heaven King.</p><p></p><p>"The formation is a bit old, and its style is somewhat different from what has been passed down in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It seems there are also traces of it being activated, could it be that a battle took place here?"</p><p></p><p>"It can only be considered an anomaly. It's not particularly complex. It's not enough to reach the threshold of an immortal-level formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping made such a conclusion after observing for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Will casting techniques here cause the dark power to riot?" Before breaking the formation, Li Ping asked Mo Rubin very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin unsurprisingly mocked, "Have you advanced to the True Immortal realm? Don't consider these irrelevant things."</p><p></p><p>"If you can cause the true immortal power here to riot, then the first thing I should do is immediately run away."</p><p></p><p>With Mo Rubin's answer, Li Ping had no more concerns.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the hidden formation patterns separated and arranged in front of his eyes. Intertwining and combining, decomposing and recombining.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Ping found the flaw in the formation here.</p><p></p><p>"Go this way."</p><p></p><p>Leading the way in, it did not trigger the formation's counter.</p><p></p><p>"So quick and neat, you still have some skill." Mo Rubin also rarely praised.</p><p></p><p>The scene inside the formation seemed no different from before entering.</p><p></p><p>"Here is where the original core formation of the Gathering Spirit Ascension Formation is located."</p><p></p><p>Following Mo Rubin's words, Li Ping swept his gaze left and right.</p><p></p><p>The ancient dark power aggregates from the outside world were absorbed here.</p><p></p><p>Turning into wisps of green smoke and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"No remnants of true immortal power, the essence of energy is deeper in the formation." Li Ping said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Once the power part of the Ascension Formation is closed, it cannot be entered again. But the main control area is not closed."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful." Mo Rubin continued to delve deeper into the interior with ease.</p><p></p><p>And Li Ping walked slowly on one side, observing the left and right, firmly memorizing the details of the formation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although only a small part of the formation was exposed, with his current formation attainment, he could infer the source of the formation by observing a small part.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, there are actually traces of fighting."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin, who was leading the way in front, suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He looked at a corner of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also saw a sword light from the slight damage to the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Realm." Li Ping judged, suddenly becoming vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"And not a weak Longevity Realm." Mo Rubin added.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he sped up and continued to penetrate into the interior.</p><p></p><p>From a visual perspective, the positions of the two seemed to never change.</p><p></p><p>The ancient aggregates in all directions above and below remained motionless relative to them.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping could clearly feel that even with the enhancement of Mo Rubin's demon face, the surrounding environment was getting darker and darker.</p><p></p><p>"The depths of the Dark Sea."</p><p></p><p>The familiar, all-encompassing dark feeling came again.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the darkness on the periphery, the darkness here was even more suffocating.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping even felt that the circulation of his own cultivation was hindered. Even the essence of origin power could not be avoided.</p><p></p><p>When the darkness devoured the last bit of light, and he could only barely sense the surrounding scene with the help of Mo Rubin's demon face.</p><p></p><p>The cold aura came faintly.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping approached slowly and discovered the reason why Mo Rubin was motionless.</p><p></p><p>Not far ahead, a corpse was lying quietly.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, using an empty shell to describe it would be more appropriate.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long it had been dead, but the face still looked lifelike, and one could clearly see the horror and disbelief on this person's face before his fall.</p><p></p><p>And his body, which seemed to still be full, was actually empty inside long ago.</p><p></p><p>Nothing was left.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Realm." Mo Rubin communicated with Li Ping through the attached demon face.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the clothes on his body look a bit familiar." Mo Rubin suddenly surged with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Great Dao Sect, Fang Dingge."</p><p></p><p>After careful observation, Li Ping confirmed this person's identity from the previous records of the Genesis Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>"So it's here." Li Ping realized.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the vigilance in his heart rose to an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>"Who." Mo Rubin asked concisely.</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years after your era, when the great calamity descended, he was the sect master of the Great Dao Sect."</p><p></p><p>"In order to pursue the Dharma Transmitter, that is, the founder of the current Myriad Immortal Alliance, six Longevity Realm experts took action together at that time, and all of them disappeared without a trace. No one saw them alive or dead. But the Dharma Transmitter survived."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the Dharma Transmitter was only at the Harmonious Dao realm." Li Ping briefly introduced the ins and outs of the matter to Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>"Six Longevity Realm experts died here?" Mo Rubin was no longer calm.</p><p></p><p>He retreated slightly, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's not what I guess." After a long time, Mo Rubin muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Dharma Transmitter use the power of this Gathering Spirit Ascension Formation to kill those six Longevity Realm experts?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, it would be the best outcome." Mo Rubin's faint voice came.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just afraid that the true immortal remains have come back to life."</p>

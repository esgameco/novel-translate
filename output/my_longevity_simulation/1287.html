        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1282: The Secret Treasures of Baiwen Immortal (7K words)</p><p></p><p>In this life, Li Fan had also tried to classify the true immortal seal characters he had seen before based on their specific powers, such as destruction, decree, enhancement, etc.</p><p></p><p>However, in the断仙楼 (Duanxian Tower) on the other side of the starry sea, it was from another novel perspective.</p><p></p><p>That is: whether the "Dao" depicted by the true immortal seal characters has been occupied by a true immortal, or had been occupied by a true immortal before.</p><p></p><p>According to the descriptions in many documents in the Duanxian Tower, the difficulty and danger of cultivating these different types of true immortal seal characters are completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>If it is a Dao that a true immortal has already occupied, anyone who attempts to enter the Dao through the characters will vanish without a trace the instant they "attain the Dao", no matter how high their strength is or how much of a genius they are. It is unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>If there is no true immortal on the Dao, then even if there are some side effects, mortals can still get a glimpse of the grand Dao depicted by the true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully pondered, relying on the fragmentary insights of predecessors he could read based on his current "contributions".</p><p></p><p>Compared to copying and attempting to depict the methods of true immortal seal characters, the Duanxian Tower and even the entire Xuanxian Boat are not so much invoking the power of true immortal seal characters, but rather using the remnant artifacts of destroyed realms to draw upon the residual immortal power.</p><p></p><p>The so-called entering the Dao is not truly entering the Dao path of a true immortal. It's more like the body, primordial spirit, and consciousness merging into the remnant artifacts, obtaining certain characteristics born from the tempering of time, thus being able to better draw upon the residual immortal power in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>There is no doubt that this is an opportunistic method. If the environment changes and there is not so much residual immortal power in the starry sea, even if one can "enter the Dao", the power unleashed will definitely be greatly weakened. Li Fan's method of using the fundamental shapes of true immortal seal characters that he copied is not restricted by the location, only related to the cultivator's own strength and comprehension of the true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just the current understanding of Li Fan, who had personally seen the true immortal seal characters before. The people on the immortal boat probably would never agree, unless Li Fan is willing to share the fundamental shapes of the true immortal seal characters. With the accumulation of the immortal boat over thousands of years, if they could see the true forms of the true immortal seal characters, the overall strength of the immortal boat would likely have a qualitative leap in a short period of time...</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan would not be foolish enough to do so.</p><p></p><p>It's still more relaxed and safe to occasionally submit an "insight" like now to exchange for contributions. After all, it is an inspiration from the real [True Immortal Seal Characters], so no matter how strange the angle is, it is absolutely correct.</p><p></p><p>"This is the essential difference of being able to see the true teachings. They try every means to reproduce the origin from various appearances of the true immortal seal characters. While I was fortunate enough to see the true form of the origin early on, and naturally it is extremely smooth to go from top to bottom."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan firmly believes that the methods of the immortal boat are just opportunistic minor paths, it is undeniable that for ant-like existences below true immortals like them, it is completely worthwhile to do so if they can invoke the power that originally belonged to true immortals.</p><p></p><p>After all, survival is the first priority in the darkest starry sea.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for these research results on true immortal seal characters, the Xuanxian Boat would have probably long become one of the endless ruins in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan guiding the Xuanxian Boat to capture the flying boat of the Wanxian Alliance this time, besides wanting to accumulate more merits for this body of his, the more important reason is to take advantage of this group of Hedao cultivators from the Wanxian Alliance to reveal the existence of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>After lurking in the Xuanxian Boat for so long, Li Fan has finally figured out the identity of that mysterious cultivator he encountered in the Sea of Remnant Artifacts at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>They were all once members of the Xuanxian Boat, and even one of the supreme rulers of the immortal boat. However, hundreds of years ago, because they were bewitched by a certain outsider and secretly reached some kind of cooperation agreement, they actually allowed this outsider to enter the highest secret [Baiwen Immortal Records] of the immortal boat.</p><p></p><p>This outsider said he only wanted to borrow the ancient secret records stored inside, but after entering, he never came out even after the agreed time. The people of the immortal boat sensed something was wrong and hurriedly checked, only to be horrified to find that many secret treasures in the [Baiwen Immortal Records] had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Along with that outsider and the three Hedao cultivators in charge of guarding, they all vanished without anyone noticing.</p><p></p><p>The immortal boat was shaken, and those rulers were purged, resulting in a small-scale internal strife.</p><p></p><p>It eventually ended with a small number of people escaping from the immortal boat. But this group of people never gave up on the immortal boat. Moreover, in the vast dark starry sea, there was nowhere else to go, so they also lurked in the Sea of Remnant Artifacts, hoping to counterattack and return to the Xuanxian Boat one day.</p><p></p><p>As for the immortal boat side, although they never gave up on surrounding and annihilating these people, the starry sea was too vast, making it difficult to capture them.</p><p></p><p>They could only tolerate the existence of these people.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the immortal boat held a grudge against that outsider who caused this internal strife. Especially those lost secret treasures, which were the eternal pain in the hearts of the immortal boat people.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the identity of this outsider was extremely mysterious, and perhaps only those immortal boat rebels might know.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was not certain whether this outsider was really the Dharma Transmitter, it did not prevent him from creating the "possibility" that the two were the same person.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the current darkest starry sea, there are not many living people to begin with.</p><p></p><p>Near the high walls, and also mysterious and unfathomable...</p><p></p><p>Besides the Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Doctor, who else could it be?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that if the immortal boat side learned that in the distant and even more vast remnant realm sea far away from the Sea of Remnant Artifacts, a powerful figure who was very likely an ancient enemy was still lurking all year round, they would definitely try to probe the truth there.</p><p></p><p>After all, how can one allow others to sleep peacefully by one's bedside is an eternal truth.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan could also take the opportunity to probe the truth about the Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Doctor through the hands of the Xuanxian Boat.</p><p></p><p>He did not hold high expectations of truly achieving anything, but it would be good to be able to find out any bit of information. Anyway, for Li Fan, it was just a casual push without any cost.</p><p></p><p>"The final victory may be built upon these inconspicuous pieces of intelligence. The immortal boat and the Holy Emperor are all chess pieces I use to probe."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself as he flipped through another document again.</p><p></p><p>As for the fate of those Hedao cultivators from the immortal alliance, it was not within his consideration at all. Anyway, they were also just consumables in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But what Li Fan did not expect was that three days later, the long-haired Hedao cultivator Wang Hai returned.</p><p></p><p>And brought back an interrogation record.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, take a look. The things that happened on this flying boat are quite exciting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned it and frowned slightly, "This flying boat is so powerful? The Hedao cultivators are like rations..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai nodded, "We also fought fiercely with it three times before finally breaking its defenses. And consumed quite a few remnant artifacts."</p><p></p><p>"But it was not a loss after all. The resources carried by each of those Hedao cultivators were luxurious. Not to mention the things called [Essence of Heaven and Earth] stored in the flying boat..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head slightly and pretended to be ignorant, "What exactly is this Essence of Heaven and Earth? Manifestation of the laws of the world?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai smiled, "If it was only this, I wouldn't be so excited and run all the way here to report the good news to you. This so-called Essence of Heaven and Earth, in addition to the power of laws from the cultivation world, also carries a considerable portion of the foundational power that constructs the world."</p><p></p><p>"If the cultivation world is compared to a house, then these Essences of Heaven and Earth can be considered the beams and pillars for building the house! And this is exactly what our Xuanxian Boat lacks! With the replenishment of this [fuel], our immortal boat can run smoothly for another hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>From Wang Hai's voice, one could undoubtedly hear the joy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He added incessantly, "Even that flying boat itself can be dismantled to add bricks and tiles to our immortal boat. Brother Zhao's foresight this time has brought gains to the immortal boat that are absolutely comparable to dozens of remnant artifacts!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to flip through the documents with his head down, "I only care about what specific rewards there are. By the way, what did the council of elders say about that world called Xuanhuang Realm? Although the fat meat is farther away, it can still save lives after all."</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai shrugged, "You still don't understand that group of people in the council of elders. They use [the bigger picture] and [the future of the immortal boat] as excuses for everything. Expedition across the starry sea, that kind of thing..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan nodded thoughtfully, "It's a pity. I vaguely saw that Hedao cultivators like those on the flying boat are already the top combat power of that Xuanhuang Realm. Stronger Changsheng realm ones are only a handful. If our immortal boat arrives, they definitely won't have any strength to resist..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai nodded in agreement, full of disdain, "They are just a bunch of parasites attached to the surviving cultivation world. In my opinion, we don't even need the full force of the immortal boat. Just three to five Rudao cultivators can easily suppress this Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai sighed again, somewhat regretfully, "It's just a pity the council of elders won't allow it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond, and asked again, "What is my reward? The council of elders wouldn't make no gesture after I made such a big contribution, right?"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Wang Hai stop selling the point and carefully took out a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The moment the jade slip appeared, Li Fan's gaze froze.</p><p></p><p>He keenly discovered that the half jade hairpin on Wang Hai's head was trembling non-stop. And the jade slip itself was faintly emitting power fluctuations of true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly reacted, "The jade slip itself is a remnant artifact of a destroyed realm?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai said somewhat proudly, "That's right, this counts as the third [Destroyed Realm Jade Slip] our immortal boat has collected. Every time this destroyed realm jade slip is studied, a portion of the true immortal power attached to it will be consumed, so it is extremely precious. The council of elders really bled a lot this time."</p><p></p><p>"What is recorded in this jade slip?"</p><p></p><p>"I also want to know, but unfortunately I don't have the qualification. You'll know as soon as you read it. Hurry up, I still need to take it back after you finish reading." Wang Hai looked at the jade slip in Li Fan's hand with some envy and urged.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan solemnly split his divine sense and delve into it.</p><p></p><p>The destroyed realm jade slips are an extremely special type among the remnant artifacts of destroyed realms.</p><p></p><p>Unlike ordinary magic treasures, after being immersed in true immortal power for many years, although the destroyed realm jade slips themselves will not be tainted by the power of true immortal seal characters, the true immortal power will penetrate into the contents recorded in the jade slips.</p><p></p><p>Causing them to undergo some kind of "mutation".</p><p></p><p>Or in other words, sublimation.</p><p></p><p>The sublimated contents are as if they have been enlightened by true immortals, having a qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>Mortal techniques become true immortal methods. Even simple articles will be tainted by true immortal power and become existences that can enlighten the Dao.</p><p></p><p>In short, destroyed realm jade slips are one of the few ways to harmlessly come into close contact with [True Immortals] at present.</p><p></p><p>As the divine sense entered the destroyed realm jade slip, what surged in first was the original content of the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary method for tempering one's will. Judging from its grade, it was at most Huashen realm.</p><p></p><p>After reading it in an instant, what the divine sense perceived suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The originally ordinary text seemed to come alive in an instant, twisting, mutating, and transforming into brand new characters.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly shocked in his heart and quickly studied this new method carefully several times.</p><p></p><p>A familiar yet unfamiliar feeling slowly welled up in his heart as his understanding deepened.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Heart Mantra?"</p><p></p><p>"But not the Xuanhuang one."</p><p></p><p>"And... there are still subtle differences. After all, it was not truly derived and personally taught by a true immortal, but evolved by the jade slip itself. It can even be said to be a weakened version of the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra." Li Fan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed inwardly with regret.</p><p></p><p>However, on the surface he still showed an expression of being very excited and engrossed.</p><p></p><p>When the floating words in his mind slowly faded and finally disappeared completely, Li Fan reluctantly returned the Jie Mie jade slip, while saying: "This is indeed an immortal technique. With this method, I can ensure that I will not be troubled by heart demons in the future. Even when comprehending the True Immortal seal characters, the negative impact will also be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>"Please also thank the various elders for me!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Hai subconsciously glanced at the Jie Mie jade slip in his hand. Then he forcibly suppressed the thought of peeking.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that there were restrictions placed by the elders that he could not spy on it. Taking it without permission was a great taboo on the immortal boat.</p><p></p><p>Even for him, committing this would only result in becoming living research material for studying immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>"I was able to gain this much this time, thanks to Brother Wang's long-term connections for me. This is my comprehension, please accept it." Seeing the other party's expression, Li Fan closed his eyes slightly to concentrate, and surprisingly carved another jade slip on the spot and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai was overjoyed at the sight: "Thank you Brother Zhao! In the future, I will go through fire and water without hesitation for you!"</p><p></p><p>After saying the polite words, he directly took the jade slip and started reading it.</p><p></p><p>He was immersed in it, with a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>After a while, coming back to his senses from the comprehension, Wang Hai directly crushed the jade slip to dust in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This was the rule for spreading knowledge on the immortal boat.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no restriction that techniques could not be practiced simultaneously, techniques, methods and various insights were still extremely precious resources.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Jie Mie jade slip rewarded by the Duan Xian Tower elders this time, only Li Fan had the qualifications to study it and could not lend it to others.</p><p></p><p>But after Li Fan finished reading it, there was no such restriction on passing on his own comprehensions.</p><p></p><p>However, after all it was passed down secondhand, the effect was naturally much inferior compared to personal experience. Especially when it involved the power of true immortals, even if the text was completely consistent, without being able to feel the profound changes in the mysterious power, both the cultivation progress and the level of profoundness in understanding would naturally be much weaker.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of adhering to this rule that Wang Hai destroyed the jade slip condensed by Li Fan after reading it.</p><p></p><p>After he left today, he would have the right to further spread this technique. However, if spread by him, it would be outside of three transmissions, and the effect would be further weakened.</p><p></p><p>If someone who obtained this technique wanted to go further, they would need to go upstream along the path of the technique's transmission and pay a certain price to beg the previous transmitter. As for whether one could obtain the true technique, it would depend on the sincerity of one's heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had infiltrated the Xuan Immortal Boat for more than ten years and was already very familiar with the rules inside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wang Hai's actions, Li Fan gave him another jade slip of comprehension as a gift, and the two reluctantly parted ways.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, among the five living Harmonized Dao cultivators in the Xuan Huang Realm, there is something strange about one of them. So to be cautious, the elder council has not made a move against him yet. If you're interested, maybe you can go understand the situation." Wang Hai left this ambiguous sentence before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules of the immortal boat, only when it involved the upper echelons of the immortal boat or the forces behind the other party would they be so euphemistic.</p><p></p><p>"Survivors..."</p><p></p><p>"It should be Lan Yu? After all, he's the only one who cultivated ancient techniques and has no value to the immortal boat. But it's not strange at all..."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sorcerer of Tian Du?"</p><p></p><p>With some thoughts in mind, Li Fan tidied up his somewhat messy clothes and went out towards the direction of the Duan Xian Tower elder council.</p><p></p><p>The current immortal boat was built on a void divine tree, and after the Duan Xian Tower gained actual control of the immortal boat, it moved to the top of the void divine tree.</p><p></p><p>Strands of green light, like the tips of branches and leaves, connected the many buildings of the Duan Xian Tower.</p><p></p><p>Stepping in the void, there was no need to fly by oneself. With a thought, one could manipulate the green light to travel between different locations.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, one could vaguely see the Dao Proving Academy, Forging Star Workshop, the newly built Sin Suppressing Valley and other locations below the giant divine tree.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that each was floating in the endless void, connected by the divine tree.</p><p></p><p>The giant man Li Fan saw before, who was pierced through the center of his body by the divine tree, had been completely drained. Now in its place was a huge rabbit.</p><p></p><p>This rabbit had a white body and black ears, with a human face. Although it was already dead, the expression on its face was one of compassion, as if it had seen something extremely heartbreaking before its demise.</p><p></p><p>This "Human Emperor Rabbit", like the previous "Dao Chasing" giant, was part of the secret collection "Hundred Heard Immortal Records" of the Xuan Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>The various materials collected in the secret collection not only came from the prosperous era of cultivation before the destruction of the starry sea, but also included many strange objects the Xuan Immortal Boat had collected while drifting in the darkest starry sea for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze swept imperceptibly over the nearly withered body of the Human Emperor Rabbit, but his thoughts drifted to the secret collection of the immortal boat.</p><p></p><p>If there was anything on this immortal boat worth scheming for, it was probably this "Hundred Heard Immortal Records".</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, with the addition of the other half, the traces of the Shang Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>As a former part of the Xuan Shang Immortal Boat, although the Xuan and Shang boats had lost contact for a long time, they could still occasionally sense each other's existence.</p><p></p><p>However, any information related to the Shang Immortal Boat was the highest secret of the Xuan Immortal Boat. Even in the Duan Xian Tower elder council, only the three core members had the qualifications to know.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had been lurking for more than ten years, and had only occasionally heard a sentence or two when auditing an elder meeting.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the specific situation of the Shang Immortal Boat is, that the level of secrecy is even higher than the True Immortal seal characters..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering, he had already arrived at the top of the void divine tree where the Duan Xian Tower elder council was located.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the first thing Li Fan did was visit his "teacher".</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Immortal Boat placed great importance on the teacher-disciple relationship and factions.</p><p></p><p>Wang Hai repeatedly ran errands and passed messages for him, naturally because both Li Fan and Wang Hai were disciples under the third elder of Duan Xian Tower, Ai Tianjue.</p><p></p><p>And the relationship between this Ai Tianjue and Li Fan was even closer.</p><p></p><p>Because Ai Tianjue was also from the Dao Proving Academy.</p><p></p><p>However, in order to study new methods of entering the Dao, he had kept a low profile and few people knew about him since leaving the academy and joining the Duan Xian Tower.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he had results and the Duan Xian Tower counterattacked to gain control of the immortal boat that Ai Tianjue reappeared in the public eye.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Teacher." Li Fan saluted with a normal expression, and then truthfully explained his comprehension of the Jie Mie jade slip he had just received to his teacher.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a student had any gains, they needed to report and submit them to the teacher.</p><p></p><p>This was naturally also a rule of the immortal boat.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Li Fan's explanation, Ai Tianjue nodded slightly: "I have also seen this jade slip before. Your talent is indeed extraordinary, and you have already comprehended seven or eight parts of its essence."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saluted respectfully again, thanking his teacher for the praise.</p><p></p><p>"But don't rely on it too much." Ai Tianjue's words suddenly took a turn.</p><p></p><p>"You should know that heart demons are a tribulation, but also an opportunity. Even if you can use wonderful techniques to cut off the heart demons, heart demons are endless and will be reborn after being cut off. Using the Immortal Heart Mantra to calm the mind is ultimately an inferior approach."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to transform them into tempering materials, which will greatly benefit cultivation instead..."</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue said slowly and unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>While teaching Li Fan, he was also writing something on a piece of white paper.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed one of the top experts of the Duan Xian Tower. Even his casual words could inspire Li Fan at this point.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened attentively, his eyes not peeking at the contents of Ai Tianjue's writing at all.</p><p></p><p>It was not until half a day later that he finally put down his brush.</p><p></p><p>"Take a look at this character, how is it written?" Ai Tianjue said to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan look up.</p><p></p><p>On the white paper, surprisingly, was a "complete" True Immortal seal character.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's reaction at first glance.</p><p></p><p>"Fall..."</p><p></p><p>Continuing to observe with concentration, Li Fan felt a sense of loss in his heart: "What a pity."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a complete True Immortal seal character. It has only been restored to eight or nine parts out of ten."</p><p></p><p>"But to be able to comprehend to this extent from a bunch of broken pieces is truly extraordinary..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself that he definitely would not be able to do this on his own.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan expressed his comprehension of this character "Fall": "This 'Fall' is not the fall of the mind and spirit, but the fundamental fall of all things. Falling from a higher level to a lower level."</p><p></p><p>"True Immortals become cultivators, cultivators become mortals, mortals turn to dust..."</p><p></p><p>Just based on one character, Li Fan's comprehension took a full half day to explain.</p><p></p><p>And it was still far from being complete.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan finished, Ai Tianjue first pointed out a few errors in Li Fan's words, and then sighed slightly: "Comprehending True Immortal characters is like watching a horse run on a mountain."</p><p></p><p>"This character 'Fall', a thousand years ago on the immortal boat, had already been restored to six or seven parts out of ten. After a thousand years, the progress has only increased by one part."</p><p></p><p>"The closer one gets to the true meaning of the immortal seal characters, the slower the progress. And even if it differs by just a little bit, compared to real True Immortal seal characters, the power is vastly different."</p><p></p><p>"One can see the path ahead, but cannot step on it. The immortal dao, how difficult it is."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ai Tianjue's lament, Li Fan felt a little strange.</p><p></p><p>This didn't sound like something his research-obsessed teacher would say.</p><p></p><p>"Why does Teacher say this?" Li Fan asked directly without hiding.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Ai Tianjue explain the reason.</p><p></p><p>"That Xuan Huang Harmonized Dao cultivator, Lan Yu, cultivates a true immortal technique."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Tribulations Transforming Feathers Art..."</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue sighed again.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, Li Fan's heart was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>He knew how discerning his teacher's insight was. Since he said it was a true immortal technique, it should be a genuine immortal-level technique, just like the Xuan Huang Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>How is that possible?</p><p></p><p>Lan Yu?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he cultivating the "Tian Du Transforming Feathers Art"?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, countless thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>But his mouth reacted without delay: "Since Lan Yu has fallen into the hands of our immortal boat, doesn't this immortal technique essentially belong to our immortal boat?"</p><p></p><p>"What is Teacher's regret about?"</p><p></p><p>He pretended to be puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue shook his head with a smile: "That Xuan Huang Realm has a rule that techniques cannot be practiced simultaneously. Although the immortal boat is far from the Xuan Huang Realm and is not subject to this restriction, the immortal technique Lan Yu cultivates also has a similar shackle."</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate the Myriad Tribulations Transforming Feathers Art, one needs to use the 'Myriad Tribulations Feather' as a guide. Without this treasure, even with the most amazing talent, one cannot enter the door."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Tribulations Feather has already merged with Lan Yu, and we cannot separate it from him."</p><p></p><p>"So even if the immortal technique is before our eyes, we can only look at it but cannot cultivate it!"</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue shook his head again: "This situation is similar to the only recorded immortal technique in our Xuan Immortal Boat's secret collection."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also showed a pensive expression: "Not only techniques, but also True Immortal seal characters are like this? If a True Immortal occupies it, others cannot cultivate it..."</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue waved his hand, putting away the writing on the table, with an inexplicable expression on his face: "So that day, I suddenly had a feeling that perhaps not comprehending this True Immortal seal character is a good thing instead."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, there will inevitably be another bloody storm within the immortal boat."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"However, speaking of which, the emergence of the 'techniques cannot be practiced simultaneously' rule in the Xuan Huang Realm is quite interesting." Ai Tianjue suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his teacher.</p><p></p><p>He saw him muttering to himself: "This restriction should be unique to the immortal realm. It shouldn't be something that the laws of a lower realm can derive..."</p>

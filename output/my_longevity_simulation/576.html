        <h1>Chapter 576</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For this reason, Li Fan swallowed down the previous "Dao Star Dust" that could reverse the thoughts of his beloved, as well as hundreds of Dao Enlightenment Pills, without even expecting to be able to digest them, as long as the waves of these treasures overflowed.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it now, the effect of bluffing was still good.</p><p></p><p>As more and more contributions were collected, he believed that if nothing unexpected happened, this final fundraising plan should proceed smoothly.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to stay here any longer, so Li Fan quietly left.</p><p></p><p>Instead of returning to the Congyun City, he returned to the secret room he had excavated in the deep sea trench before, and hid again.</p><p></p><p>"The heaven and earth dice..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed slightly as the crystal-clear dice appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He kept playing with them, his thoughts surging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The words he said earlier weren't all made up.</p><p></p><p>During the time he had contact with the ancient mystery of the Tianji Sect before, occasionally some vague scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was the desolate scene of the world at the end, with a thousand miles of red land and the Congyun Sea in deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary cultivator had such an inexplicable premonition, they would certainly be extremely panicked and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't feel anything special about it. After all, not to mention deducing such scenes, even if something more terrifying than the ink flame destroying everything happened, he had witnessed it with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Red Flame Burning Sea was really just a small scene to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he was interested in was the future scenes sensed from the Heaven and Earth Dice, which appeared not within the anchor period of 28 years he had experienced in previous lives, but earlier.</p><p></p><p>And at this time point, with his various actions in this life, it was still pushing forward.</p><p></p><p>For example, when he slightly manipulated things to make Sikuang Yi go complete the Heavenly Doctor's mission.</p><p></p><p>For example, after he conceived the plan to instigate a great battle between the Fisherman, the Heavenly Doctor, and the Master.</p><p></p><p>The scenes of the Red Flame Burning Sea sensed from the Heaven and Earth Dice were clearly significantly earlier than a while ago.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that the future was never just one possibility.</p><p></p><p>There was no such thing as an inevitable event.</p><p></p><p>It's just that as a thorough event, the Red Flame Burning Sea should not be easily changed by his actions.</p><p></p><p>But apparently, perhaps Li Fan underestimated the impact of his actions on the Red Flame Burning Sea.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Congyun Sea experience the slaughter of souls by the essence of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Why did even after the Red Flame disappeared, the will of heaven and earth still did not stop, sending out the powerful "Ink Killer" to turn the Congyun Sea into a dead land?</p><p></p><p>If the Ink Killer made a move, the Congyun Sea would only be left a void. This was undoubtedly a mutually detrimental method for heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even so, heaven and earth insisted on it.</p><p></p><p>The Congyun Sea must perish.</p><p></p><p>This was something Li Fan had already understood in the first few cycles.</p><p></p><p>But why exactly, he had never been able to find a clue.</p><p></p><p>But in this life, things began to change as he actively pushed the Heavenly Doctor, the Master, and the Fisherman to meet in the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>According to the feedback in the future scenes from the Heaven and Earth Dice, if the three of them really had a battle.</p><p></p><p>The Red Flame Burning Sea event that was originally anchored to take place in 28 years would now be set to happen at the latest in 20 years.</p><p></p><p>Eight years earlier!</p><p></p><p>The battle between the Heavenly Doctor and the Fisherman was a plan Li Fan had long prepared.</p><p></p><p>It would not change just because of the premature occurrence of an inevitable event.</p><p></p><p>So this was also why Li Fan decided to set the final fundraising plan now.</p><p></p><p>Of course, currently, everything was just fragments of scenes appearing in the Heaven and Earth Dice.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only after a few years had passed, when things actually happened, could conclusions be made.</p><p></p><p>"If the Red Flame Burning Sea really advances due to the frequent activities of the Heavenly Doctor and the others, it will be an interesting matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed with a hint of depth.</p><p></p><p>He once again thought of the fragments of the Tian Sha Sword pieces suppressed by the essence of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Having entered the mysterious and yellow realm of cultivation for several cycles, Li Fan had read extensively. Although he didn't claim to understand everything about the cultivation situation in the mysterious and yellow realm, he had a considerable understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>As far as he knew, although the conflict between cultivators and heaven and earth had become irreconcilable since the establishment of the new laws, when heaven and earth counteracted cultivators, they often used the method of "laws cannot be cultivated together" to change the inherent rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Indirectly cleaning up the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan really rarely saw such examples.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the relevant information was hidden, but at least for now, Li Fan only knew of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>"What does this really mean?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face showed a pensive look.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Heavenly Doctor and the others can give me some insights in this life."</p><p></p><p>After the gathering of the cultivators on Liuli Island, within less than a day, all the cultivators in the entire Congyun Sea received definite news.</p><p></p><p>The previous rumors were not false, and the Senior Emissary who had been in seclusion for a long time had personally confirmed it.</p><p></p><p>Thus, a grand celebration began.</p><p></p><p>The fundraising plan with high returns that had previously only been a legend and only cultivators related to Li Fan could participate in, they could finally join this time.</p><p></p><p>The goal of tripling the contributions in five years seemed incredible, but if it was handled by that legendary Tianji Sect cultivator, it was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators spread the news excitedly, discussing fervently how much contribution points to invest in this plan.</p><p></p><p>Even some very rational cultivators couldn't help but feel a bit shaken in the midst of this all-inclusive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>"I currently have a total of four hundred and fifty thousand contribution points in my hand. If I triple them..."</p><p></p><p>"Then it will exceed one million!"</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi's emotions fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>"Han Dao friend was right after all, in the path of cultivation, connections also matter! Without the opportunity he left to contact He Zhenghao, how long would it take for me to earn a million!"</p><p></p><p>"Han Dao friend, you're quite something!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Sikong Yi decided without hesitation to take another gamble, investing all his accumulated contributions into this fundraising plan.</p><p></p><p>"Opportunities are rare, cannot be missed anymore. It all depends on this one to make a complete turnaround!" A hint of determination flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Due to winning the Fish Head Lottery and possessing a hundred thousand contribution points, Han Yi was currently in Yuandao Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Congyun Sea's Li Fan, five years, tripling?"</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to forcibly overturning the fortune, he had been experiencing bad luck since he entered Yuandao Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had not improved much, although he had already spent a considerable amount of his hundred thousand contribution points.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe..."</p>

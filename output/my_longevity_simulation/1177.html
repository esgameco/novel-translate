            <p>Chapter 1175: Suspicion of Two Immortals in the Starry Sea</p><p></p><p>In fact, the two words "perhaps" can be removed. ◆𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝟓𝟐𝟎𝐜𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝◆</p><p></p><p>If the entire Xuanhuang Realm truly experiences an overall tremor next, then it can almost be confirmed that it was caused by a certain action of Li Fan in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"The source of the Xuanhuang Realm's tremor should come from the suction force of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"The key lies here. What virtue and ability do I have to actually influence the Immortal Ruins?"</p><p></p><p>The scenes experienced in this lifetime flashed quickly before Li Fan's eyes. </p><p></p><p>Eliminating all the impossible options, Li Fan was left with a few suspects worth doubting.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious figure who replanted the world fragment in the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The formless existence collecting the corpses of cultivators in the Life and Death Maze.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>The relocation and transportation of the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's own strength, whether it was his true body or avatar, he was currently unable to change the Immortal Ruins in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>However, his actions could influence and change the fate trajectories of those powerful existences that could shake the Immortal Ruins, thereby causing deviations to occur.</p><p></p><p>"It's only a little over a month's time, just patiently wait."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>While the entire Immortal Alliance entered a state of emergency preparedness, the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty was also the same.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, an imperial edict was issued. The Holy Emperor would test his divine powers in the void outside the Great Enlightenment. It may cause some tremors, which was quite normal and there was no need to panic.</p><p></p><p>The subjects of the Great Enlightenment now had a near-fanatical worship of the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, whatever he said was the truth.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, not only did the common people not feel nervous or frightened, instead they were full of anticipation for the power of the Holy Emperor's divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the underground secret chamber of the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was facing Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"Those little fellows you sent me last time indeed have great talent. Some are even smarter than I imagined. Two of them have already successfully established their foundation with me. The others shouldn't be far off either."</p><p></p><p>"If one accepts from the beginning that [establishing foundation with me] is the only and most correct method, it indeed greatly helps smooth cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren first summarized the recent results, then abruptly changed the topic: "I've been feeling a bit unsettled recently. I heard you're going to test some divine powers? Try to stay far away and don't destroy this small world."</p><p></p><p>"I quite like it here." Yin Shangren said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping nodded in agreement, but his mind was surging with thoughts: "Yin Shangren is a world specter, parasitizing in the Xuanhuang Realm. Even he vaguely senses something, it seems the Xuanhuang Realm is indeed about to encounter some tribulations."</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed amidst the anticipation of the masses.</p><p></p><p>And without anyone's knowledge, over a hundred stone puppets quietly flew to the sky above the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the boundary of the world, one step away from being deeply trapped in the void.</p><p></p><p>Yet also able to observe the overall macro view of the Xuanhuang Realm from a high vantage point.</p><p></p><p>These puppets were naturally made by Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>There was no other special purpose, just to observe and record this Xuanhuang Realm tremor event.</p><p></p><p>The puppets floated silently in the air, waiting for the target event to arrive.</p><p></p><p>The day predicted by the Dharma Transmission was getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>On this day, suddenly, Li Fan's true body in the Yanfa Orb space, the Holy Fetus Li Fan outside the Chizha Abyss, Li Fan's avatar in the Immeasurable Mirror, and the Holy Emperor Li Ping in the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>All of them felt something in their hearts in an instant.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the sky in unison.</p><p></p><p>The sky</p><p></p><p>In that life of Xuansuo Ling, Ji Hongdao once instantly killed a state's cultivators, using a method of mutual destruction to force the Eternal Realm's Yixin Tianzun to retreat to the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>At that time, because of the sudden loss of many cultivators' anchoring, the Xuanhuang Realm suddenly became lighter.</p><p></p><p>Continuously trembling and roaring.</p><p></p><p>All the living beings within it could sense it, as if a great calamity was imminent and they would perish in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan had personally experienced this feeling.</p><p></p><p>But now, this feeling was more than a hundred times stronger.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Without any warning, the Xuanhuang Realm began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a giant was using both hands to fiercely tear apart the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Cracks appeared from all corners of the earth and then rapidly spread in both directions. In an instant, the originally flat terrain became full of scars.</p><p></p><p>Countless mountain ranges split open, some even collapsing entirely and falling into the abyss that suddenly appeared at the bottom of the earth.</p><p></p><p>If the changes happening on the earth's surface were not enough to make the cultivators living in the suspended cities feel fear,</p><p></p><p>Then the changes that occurred in the white mist barrier next made all the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>The white mist barrier that seemed to span across the sky and earth and never change actually bent and broke.</p><p></p><p>The white mist overflowed from its originally fixed area and spread to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, it devoured the lifespan of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>And with the help of the eyes of the hundreds of puppets in the sky, Li Fan saw it more clearly.</p><p></p><p>The life-devouring white mist seemed to be attracted by something outside the Xuanhuang Realm and surged in waves.</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps due to being constrained by some force, the white mist could not leave the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the pulling of the two forces that caused the white mist barrier to break.</p><p></p><p>The world changed drastically, and the spiritual energy also became violent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clearly saw that in the Xuanhuang Realm below, storms, flames, lightning, floods...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of disasters suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>Under the agitation of the turbulent spiritual energy, they were hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than usual.</p><p></p><p>And the shaking of the Xuanhuang Realm still did not stop.</p><p></p><p>This catastrophe seemed to last much longer than imagined.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance finally took action.</p><p></p><p>They flew out from various suspended cities, calming the spiritual energy while also trying to repair the various anomalies caused by the violent shaking of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shaking of the world, they struggled with every step.</p><p></p><p>But indeed, there was no fatal danger.</p><p></p><p>However, the tremors of the world would ultimately make the living beings in it feel uncontrollably terrified.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators could only have a blank mind and pray in their hearts for the disaster to pass quickly.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there was nothing they could do.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had seen the true scene of world destruction.</p><p></p><p>Some tremors, compared to the Immortals of the Immortal Ruins destroying the Xuanhuang Realm with a glance, were truly like a small sorcerer meeting a great one.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he could ignore the anomalies of the world and observe very calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Strange..."</p><p></p><p>"The source of this pulling force that caused the world to shake..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt a sense of disharmony in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the hundreds of stone puppets at the edge of the world flew away from the boundary and came to the endless void.</p><p></p><p>Without the shelter of the Xuanhuang Realm, the puppets were affected by the strong pulling force and moved uncontrollably in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>However, as they moved away from the Xuanhuang Realm faster and faster, Li Fan also confirmed the anomaly he had noticed.</p><p></p><p>The pulling force that caused the great tremor of the Xuanhuang Realm this time did not come from the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>But from the depths of the Darkest Star Sea!</p>

            <p>Chapter 1011: The Remnants of the Heavenly Mechanism Realm</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure with an indiscernible face finally appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this question, the Ling Yuan Sect Master nearly vomited blood.</p><p></p><p>You suddenly burst forth, captured me and brought me here, and you still ask who I am? I want to ask you the same!</p><p></p><p>The Ling Yuan Sect Master snorted coldly, refusing to answer.</p><p></p><p>"Fearless and unafraid, it seems you're not afraid of soul searching?"</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation and material creation are indeed different from ordinary creatures."</p><p></p><p>"However, have you seen this object before?"</p><p></p><p>The other party's tone was grim as a seven-colored glowing orb suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>And within this glowing orb, the Ling Yuan Sect Master shockingly sensed something deeply buried at the bottom of his memories, something he could never forget and made his hair stand on end!</p><p></p><p>"Are you crazy!?" The Ling Yuan Sect Master's tone was full of horror.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the other party unmoved and even attempting to bring the seven-colored orb closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk nicely, let's talk nicely." The Ling Yuan Sect Master instantly compromised.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're also no stranger to the 【Mo】 Spell," Li Fan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Fellow Daoist is also a refugee from other cultivation realms who fled here?" The Ling Yuan Sect Master probed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't answer, but revealed an unfathomable smile.</p><p></p><p>The Ling Yuan Sect Master had already determined this matter in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, as possibly the only paradise in this starry sea, the Profound Yellow Realm was still relatively safe at present. There were no signs of 【Mo】 Spell contamination.</p><p></p><p>"This object is extremely dangerous. Fellow Daoist, it's better to put it away first. Although the cultivators of this realm seem quite adept at dealing with various disasters, I'm afraid it would still be difficult to withstand if it erupts quietly."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I'm of one heart with the cultivators of the Profound Yellow Realm, but there's nowhere else to go besides here." The Ling Yuan Sect Master hurriedly explained, seemingly afraid Li Fan would misunderstand.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, Li Fan seemed to be seriously considering.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he put away the seven-colored glowing orb. As that fatal dangerous aura disappeared, the Ling Yuan Sect Master's heart that had been suspended finally settled down for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"To dare carry this object on one's person, he's truly a ruthless man." The Ling Yuan Sect Master inwardly shuddered.</p><p></p><p>He immediately showed an understanding attitude, saying, "Since we are both wanderers far from home, Fellow Daoist, feel free to ask me anything you want to know! I will certainly answer without reservation!"</p><p></p><p>No choice, who let his life be in the other party's hands?</p><p></p><p>The Ling Yuan Sect Master inwardly felt bitter.</p><p></p><p>"Which cultivation realm do you hail from?" Li Fan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"This humble one is Qiao Gong, a recluse from the 【Heavenly Mechanism Realm】." The Ling Yuan Sect Master introduced himself.</p><p></p><p>"How did you die and come back to life?" Li Fan asked the key question.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you know the Profound Yellow Realm is truly full of hidden dangers. One never knows when they might encounter a hidden vicious person..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong paused, glanced at Li Fan, then continued, "For my own safety, I had no choice but to back up my self-consciousness every once in a while. This way, even if I encountered any mishap, I could still achieve resurrection through prior preparations."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the calamity I encountered this time seems a bit severe." Qiao Gong said with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded upon hearing this, but didn't explain.</p><p></p><p>He continued asking, "This Heavenly Mechanism Puppet seems to be crafted using 【cultivation】 as material? It's somewhat incredible..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong said...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, your insight is truly remarkable. However, in our Tianji Realm, we generally refer to cultivation as 'Source Power'."</p><p></p><p>A hint of reminiscence flashed in Qiaogong Jushi's eyes: "The fundamental power that drives the advancement of a cultivator's realm is called 'Source Power'."</p><p></p><p>"Our Tianji Realm has a unique environment, built upon the broken body of an immortal puppet from an immortal realm. We refer to that puppet as the 'Ancestor'. It is through continuously studying the mysteries within the Ancestor's body that we have been able to develop various refining techniques that far surpass those of other cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>"Source Power is one of the most important discoveries made by our Tianji Realm during this process. Although cultivators in the world practice a myriad of cultivation techniques, they can all be extracted, purified, and then transformed into the most versatile Source Power through certain methods."</p><p></p><p>"Parts are like bones, and Source Power is like flesh. With them, puppets somewhat similar to the 'Ancestor' can be forged."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi spoke eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan constantly monitored and observed the other party. In this conversation, Qiaogong Jushi should not have lied.</p><p></p><p>"Your Tianji Realm truly possesses great fortune to have occupied the remains of an immortal puppet."</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, our Wansheng Realm seems rather ordinary." Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Wansheng Realm? I have not heard of it." Qiaogong Jushi shook his head with some regret.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not mind: "Back then, there were as many cultivation realms as stars in the sky. But now, they have all turned to dust. Let's not mention it anymore!"</p><p></p><p>This conversation also stirred up Qiaogong Jushi's emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Was your Tianji Realm also destroyed by the 'Mo' character technique?" After a while, Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know how long had passed, Qiaogong Jushi still seemed apprehensive: "Indeed. At first, we could still rely on the techniques of the artifacts we developed to hold out for a while. But the infectivity of the mold was simply too strong."</p><p></p><p>"Even the remains of the 'Ancestor' could not escape its erosion. On the day our defenses collapsed, in despair, we had no choice but to flee and scatter."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Fellow Daoist, that seven-colored light seems to be able to seal the mold?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly remembering something, Qiaogong Jushi abruptly asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered: "It took refining an entire cultivation realm to obtain this treasure. But it can only block the mold for a period of time, and I still need to constantly replenish the energy consumption day and night."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, what's sealed inside is only a tiny portion."</p><p></p><p>"When the calamity strikes, no one can expect to stay out of it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiaogong Jushi fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, he couldn't help but retort: "Actually, I feel that if there was no immortal ruins above, perhaps this Xuanhuang Realm could survive the calamity."</p><p></p><p>"I have also observed traces of the calamity descending in this realm, but it seems to have only raged for a while before being eliminated by some unknown means. The Xuanhuang Realm truly has an abundance of capable people, one can't help but admire it."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, no matter how extraordinary, in the end it is still destined to be buried in the immortal ruins. Now it is just barely clinging to life!" Li Fan said coldly, with a hint of disdain in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi seemed to have more to say but stopped himself.</p><p></p><p>"What, does Fellow Daoist have some insight?" Li Fan glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi couldn't help but say: "Based on my observations from over 300 years ago, the Xuanhuang Realm was already very close to the immortal ruins. But in the face of such an immense power, the Xuanhuang Realm still has not disintegrated..."</p><p></p><p>"I speculate that there must be a power approaching that of the immortal ruins protecting the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I believe escaping the immortal ruins may not be impossible."</p>

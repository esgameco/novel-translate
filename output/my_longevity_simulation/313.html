        <h1>Chapter 313</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation's core components are extremely rare, and it's impossible to mobilize over a thousand of them to Tianyu Province for a single test.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this formation practical exam is not conducted simultaneously for all formation students. Instead, they are divided into groups of fifty, and each group is tested in turn.</p><p></p><p>The order of participation in the assessment is based on everyone's comprehensive test scores. Li Fan is ranked in the upper-middle position, so he doesn't have to wait too long.</p><p></p><p>The scale of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is so grand that even the most talented person would need several years to fully construct it.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's just a test to examine everyone's formation layout skills, and it's impossible to really waste so much time.</p><p></p><p>So the specific rules are that within seven days, try to construct the central core structure of the formation as much as possible. The final ranking is determined by the actual formation layout.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan is in the sixth group, which means conservatively estimated, it will be his turn after more than forty days.</p><p></p><p>During the assessment period, it is also strictly forbidden to go out.</p><p></p><p>Only students who have completed the assessment are allowed to leave the Huanyu Academy and relax in Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>However, based on previous lessons, they are not allowed to leave Tianyu City either.</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Li Fan also began to study the small black box that Zhang Zhiliang gave him. Previously, Li Fan had also tried to crack it.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, Zhang Zhiliang was not dead, and the small black box seemed to be shrouded in a layer of unknown restrictions in addition to the sealing formation. Li Fan tried a few times without success and temporarily gave up.</p><p></p><p>Now that Zhang Zhiliang has fallen, Li Fan noticed that the layer of restrictions had also disappeared on its own, indicating that it was time to open Zhang Zhiliang's legacy.</p><p></p><p>Without much effort, as a silver line lit up on the small black box, the sealing formation was broken by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The contents inside were also revealed, not much different from the 12th world.</p><p></p><p>The encrypted jade slip recording the Infinite Law, the Heart Ape incense, the Soul Recognition Orb, the Legacy Token, and the ordinary jade slip recording Zhang Zhiliang's last words.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first read Zhang Zhiliang's last words. After a moment, he put down the jade slip with a look of emotion.</p><p></p><p>In the last words, Zhang Zhiliang briefly explained that he had learned by chance a few years ago that the Chiyan was about to descend on the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>In order to be able to advance to the Harmonious Dao realm, he began a desperate plan.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan could see the last words in the jade slip, it meant that he had failed to achieve the Harmonious Dao and had perished.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang's tone was full of regret, but he also expressed that he had no regrets.</p><p></p><p>In the battle of Tianling Province, the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association fought each other and fell one after another like ants.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang even personally witnessed several cultivators who were close to him in daily life die miserably in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The entire sky was occupied by the phenomenon of falling cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Often, before one could see clearly the previous death, it was covered by the phenomenon of the next falling cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the war, Zhang Zhiliang's pride as a Nascent Soul formation master was completely crushed.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Nascent Soul, even Primordial Spirit cultivators could only go with the flow and live or die by fate in this great battle.</p><p></p><p>"Below the Harmonious Dao, all are ants."</p><p></p><p>As Zhang Zhiliang awakened, an infinite ambition for the Harmonious Dao inevitably arose in his heart. He survived the great calamity and returned to the Congyun Sea, having an epiphany and advancing to the Primordial Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>And now that the heaven-sent opportunity had just appeared, how could he possibly give it up? If he failed, he would simply die, and he was already prepared for that. He was only afraid that his lifelong learning of the [Infinite Law] would disappear, so he left his inheritance in advance.</p><p></p><p>Because most of his savings were used to create the formation crown, the contribution points left in this world's Legacy Token were even less than before, only over 200,000 points.</p><p></p><p>For the current Li Fan, it was just slightly better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan valued more was how the Infinite Law of Zhang Zhiliang at the Primordial Spirit stage differed from when he was at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Lighting the Heart Ape incense, Li Fan picked up the encrypted jade slip with gold inlaid on all four corners and carefully read it.</p><p></p><p>After the Golden Core stage, the strength of divine sense soared.</p><p></p><p>This time, without the dizziness, Li Fan quickly browsed through the contents of the jade slip. He was already very familiar with the original contents of the Infinite Law.</p><p></p><p>Comparing it with this new version, he quickly noticed the differences, or rather, the improvements.</p><p></p><p>The core concept of the Infinite Law is that the formation can continuously evolve on its own, constantly growing at all times.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial part is the lack of a central core that can provide computational support for the infinite evolution of the formation.</p><p></p><p>In the 12th world, due to the limited perspective of the Nascent Soul stage, Zhang Zhiliang did not explicitly state the possible reference objects for this core.</p><p></p><p>But this time, Zhang Zhiliang stated bluntly that the most suitable object to serve as the central core of the Infinite Law was the Wanxian Alliance's supreme treasure, the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>When countless cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance use the Tianxuan Mirror at the same time, it never experiences any lag. Not to mention, the Tianxuan Mirror also has to simultaneously control prices, information flow, and other matters.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that its data processing capability has reached an unimaginably terrifying level. Moreover, the Tianxuan Mirror has its own spiritual intelligence, making it a perfect fit for the Infinite Law.</p><p></p><p>Previously, because of its unique status in the Wanxian Alliance, Zhang Zhiliang never even considered this possibility. However, after the battle of Tianling Province, the emergence of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation gave him inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is a great attempt at combining the Tianxuan Mirror's own abilities with formations."</p><p></p><p>"They all think this attempt is somewhat earth-shattering, but in my opinion, it's still a bit conservative."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Tianxuan Mirror is too important. If any errors occur, the Wanxian Alliance will inevitably fall into intense turmoil. Being cautious is understandable."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, with the new mirror surface of the Tianxuan Mirror as the formation core, the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation has undergone a qualitative change compared to other formations in the world."</p><p></p><p>"You are undergoing closed training in Tianyu Province, so you may already have some understanding of how to construct it." "But you may not be clear about the true power of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation."</p><p></p><p>"When the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation debuted in Jiushan Province, I personally went to experience it."</p><p></p><p>"When I saw those light pillars penetrating heaven and earth light up, when I felt the sense of surveillance and threat vaguely present all over my body, when the fluctuations of the Tianxuan Mirror swept over me..."</p><p></p><p>"A sense of trembling from the depths of my soul arose spontaneously."</p><p></p><p>"Ji Hongdao and the others are true geniuses, creating a true monster."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, what will happen when one Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation after another is built, covering all the territories of the Wanxian Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan locks the soul, nothing can escape. Every little movement that happens in the world will fall into the sight of the Tianxuan Mirror without the slightest difference."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1101: Secretly Calculating the True Immortal</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I retained the memory of destroying her body before, and then added it in when creating her new body this time..."</p><p></p><p>"You didn't see the expression on her face when she just woke up."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi became more and more excited as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>As the construction of the source power essence buffer zone was gradually completed, the surroundings became brighter. He was thus able to see clearly the gazes of the people around him looking at him.</p><p></p><p>So he became even more complacent.</p><p></p><p>"I should have thought of it earlier. Since you can copy and back up your own consciousness, then preserving the consciousness backups of other cultivators in the Tianji Realm shouldn't be a problem either." Li Fan suddenly appeared, his cold tone making Qiaogong Jushi instantly freeze.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators of the Tianji Realm are all absolute geniuses in tool refinement. Our alliance is in need of talents, how can you hide them for yourself?" Li Fan's gaze was unkind.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi could only smile awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"How many more consciousness backups do you have on your side? Hand them all over, and I'll let bygones be bygones. Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi felt waves of killing intent emanating from Li Fan, and couldn't help but feel a palpitating fear.</p><p></p><p>He even felt his neck being tightly grasped by a pair of invisible giant hands, almost unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, along with this sense of constriction, there was a growing trend.</p><p></p><p>He was like an insect caught in a web, completely unable to break free, only helplessly waiting to die.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi knew this was the power of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal.</p><p></p><p>After he finished reciting the oath of joining the association, he had already fallen into the web of the true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Unless he could surpass in strength, otherwise just relying on this connection, Li Fan, as the superior, could annihilate him with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan didn't really want to kill him here.</p><p></p><p>When Qiaogong's consciousness was about to blur, the constricting sensation disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Gasping for breath as if he had gained a new lease on life, Qiaogong wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and explained repeatedly, "Just a few core members of the Elder Council."</p><p></p><p>"I was in a hurry to escape at the time, so I only took this many."</p><p></p><p>"The power of darkness is mysterious and unusual. When the time comes, let's release them and study together." Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi naturally could only agree.</p><p></p><p>After being frightened by Li Fan once, Qiaogong became much more honest.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the golden buffer zone was completed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the thick darkness in the distance, all blocked outside, everyone couldn't help but sigh again at the divine power of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Although the power of darkness was strong, it still couldn't contend with a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Although a buffer measure was constructed, there was still a risk of this power of darkness going out of control.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention of bringing it back to the Lingmu Realm for research.</p><p></p><p>He just opened up another research site in this underground world.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this time that Li Fan learned that the stunning female immortal puppet from before was actually Shangguan Tuo, the chief elder of the Tianji Realm that Qiaogong had mentioned before.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Shangguan Tuo had wanted to completely control [Ancestor], so she took a risky move and merged her own soul into the damaged core of [Ancestor]. Of course, she had already made a backup of her consciousness beforehand.</p><p></p><p>However, her reckless actions nearly led to the collapse of the entire Tianji Realm. It could be said that her sins were deep.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the members of the Elder Council at that time vetoed the proposal to revive Shangguan Tuo.</p><p></p><p>They only deeply hid her consciousness backup.</p><p></p><p>In the end, before the destruction of the Tianji Realm, it was taken out by Qiaogong.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan even more was that Shangguan Tuo was actually Qiaogong's teacher who had bestowed teachings upon him.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Layman looked at the eyes of the crowd, his expression not showing a trace of abnormality.</p><p></p><p>And the three remaining elders of the Heavenly Mechanism Realm remained silent about Ingenious Layman's behavior, which could be described as betraying one's teacher and destroying one's ancestors.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan asked Shangguan Tuo if he wanted to seek freedom, he received a negative answer.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan a little curious.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Ingenious Layman, he was instantly startled and hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>"This actually has little to do with me."</p><p></p><p>"After all, they are only consciousness backups. In order to avoid the situation of two 'me' killing each other, the subjective initiative of these backups has been suppressed, and they cannot be completely equated with real personalities. Only the Great Elder himself knows how to unlock the restrictions."</p><p></p><p>"This is also a protective measure activated by our Heavenly Mechanism Realm to prevent people from using consciousness backups on a large scale and endangering the safety of the world."</p><p></p><p>"As for myself, since the Heavenly Mechanism Realm is gone, naturally there are not so many concerns."</p><p></p><p>Ingenious Layman's tone could not hide his complacency.</p><p></p><p>"So, they are just second-class people in the Heavenly Mechanism Realm. So they have to listen to you, a first-class person?" Fang Zaiji asked, rubbing his chin.</p><p></p><p>Ingenious Layman nodded.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing Li Fan's expression, he immediately patted his chest and promised, "Emissary, please rest assured. Although they consider their identity to be one level lower than mine, their research talents are no different from the original. With the joint efforts of us few, it should not be difficult to figure out how to use this dark power."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was too lazy to care about these broken affairs of the Heavenly Mechanism Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could be of use to him, that's all that mattered.</p><p></p><p>After giving instructions, Li Fan returned to the underground world alone.</p><p></p><p>There was no fear in Li Fan's heart, only a quiet comprehension of his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"It's just as I thought. In the darkness, even the influence of the Faceless True Immortal is greatly weakened."</p><p></p><p>"Although I still can't completely escape, for me, it's actually equivalent to a shelter."</p><p></p><p>"Deep in the dark realm, I can activate Huan Zhen and return at any time."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the threat that had been pressing heavily on Li Fan's mind for a long time was finally greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"But avoiding it is useless."</p><p></p><p>"With so much preparation in this world, I have great confidence in safely withdrawing from the confrontation between the Faceless True Immortal and the Immortals of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"How should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rarely calmed down in this world and pondered alone.</p><p></p><p>The darkness seemed to be a protective umbrella that isolated everything, making Li Fan's heart more relaxed than ever before.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Faceless True Immortal always remains in the Xuanhuang Realm, and it's not something I can avoid just by not provoking Him."</p><p></p><p>"When I reach a certain level, it will inevitably attract His attention. This is an unchangeable fact."</p><p></p><p>"Unless I can find a way to safely escape the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"But outside the high walls, True Immortals still exist."</p><p></p><p>"There's no escape..."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of brilliance flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"When facing True Immortals, sometimes one's own weakness can be an advantage."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to observe carefully while the other party ignores you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the deep darkness around him again.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this piece of darkness. If there is something in the darkness staring at me, and its strength is far weaker than mine, completely unable to pose a threat to me..."</p><p></p><p>"Then how could I detect it?"</p>

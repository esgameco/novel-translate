        <h1>Chapter 383</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan estimated that if he relied solely on his flying ability, he wouldn't even think about catching up in one or two months.</p><p></p><p>However, relying on the Escape Sky Shuttle, not even a day was needed.</p><p></p><p>After a little over seven hours, Li Fan arrived at the designated location.</p><p></p><p>As the speed gradually slowed down, the black and gold fluid around his body slowly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan stopped, it once again transformed into a small water-drop-like object and was stored in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan surveyed his work environment for the next period of time.</p><p></p><p>Below was still an endless expanse of azure waters.</p><p></p><p>Above, however, seemed within reach.</p><p></p><p>A huge branch hung from the sky like a curtain, making intimate contact with the Water Attribute Dao Domain.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan was that after the lively tree touched the water, it should have been even more vibrant. However, the giant branch in front of Li Fan was completely withered and decaying.</p><p></p><p>The grayish-yellow tree was incomplete, dotted with many hollow spots, seeming like it could break and fall at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he stared at it for too long, leading to an illusion.</p><p></p><p>From those dead branches, Li Fan actually saw many partial human figures.</p><p></p><p>When he looked again later, that feeling had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Fan took out the Duty Recording, carefully studying the construction plan again.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was inspecting the surroundings, the plan had already been updated.</p><p></p><p>Five more cultivators were assigned as his assistants, bringing logistical supplies with them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not wait for them.</p><p></p><p>The Duty Recording released a radiance and fixed it in the sky.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the coordinate nodes, Li Fan began constructing the Locking Spirit Array directly.</p><p></p><p>Different from when he was at the Abyss Roar, where he had to guard against the devolving white mist and the Abyss demonic sound.</p><p></p><p>The Water Attribute Dao Domain here was almost devoid of danger.</p><p></p><p>The dense spiritual energy was conducive to constructing formations.</p><p></p><p>Without hindrance, Li Fan could act as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>After years of strenuous training, Li Fan's speed in setting up formations in normal circumstances had once again reached a new level.</p><p></p><p>It was like a primal instinct carved deep in his soul, requiring no thought at all.</p><p></p><p>Casually grabbing, wherever his mind would reach, the formation would instantly be created.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt neither joy nor sorrow, moving forward with a terrifyingly efficient and fast pace in setting up the formations.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he was immersed in his work.</p><p></p><p>When the five-man support team arrived, they saw Li Fan focus so intensely, creating the Locking Spirit Array effortlessly, akin to freely splashing ink.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't their first time participating in formation construction.</p><p></p><p>But the formation masters they had dealt with before, in terms of the speed and casualness in setting up formations, were clearly not on par with the white-haired Golden Core formation master before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The five men glanced at each other.</p><p></p><p>"Is this person really only at the Golden Core stage?"</p><p></p><p>"Li Fan... seems familiar. Wait, could it be that Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>"No mistaking it. He truly is a person who fights until death on the frontline of constructing the Locking Spirit Array. His proficiency in formation making is simply astonishing."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, cooperating with him this time is our good fortune."</p><p></p><p>The five communicated with each other using their spiritual senses.</p><p></p><p>They did not disturb Li Fan and began building their own base on the water's surface below.</p><p></p><p>Although they had heard that Li Fan was exceptionally dedicated and didn't need rest when setting up formations.</p><p></p><p>However, a resting point was still necessary for such special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they couldn't endure continuous work for several years.</p><p></p><p>For them, this work was a walk in the park. Together, they completed the construction of a small base hovering above the water's surface in just three days.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, they followed the procedure, inspecting and verifying the formation units that Li Fan had completed.</p><p></p><p>The results shocked them.</p><p></p><p>The Locking Spirit Array's structure was extremely complex, containing numerous formation units.</p><p></p><p>Added to the influence of external environmental factors, even for someone with exceptional talent, mistakes were bound to happen during the construction process.</p><p></p><p>However, the formation Li Fan had laid out had no flaws whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Tireless, efficient, precise.</p><p></p><p>All of this occurred on a Golden Core cultivator who was advanced in age and nearing his end.</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>The five men were all in awe.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the area where Li Fan had completed setting up formations expanded rapidly.</p><p></p><p>With each completed formation node, the five became increasingly admiring of Li Fan from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This man truly lived up to the rumors.</p><p></p><p>He knew no fatigue, resting not for even a moment.</p><p></p><p>Even the five who were assisting him found it a bit overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>But they dared not complain in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>So, a year quietly went by.</p><p></p><p>When the area covered by the completed formation left the original node and extended to a radius of five thousand miles, the task initially assigned to Li Fan and the others was nearly completed.</p><p></p><p>"We planned to finish in three years, yet it seems the work will be done in just a year," remarked Yan Hang, a Yuan Ying cultivator among the five, as he looked at the formation in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"At least we can finally rest for a bit," he said with exhaustion evident on his face.</p><p></p><p>The rest nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan completed the final formation and paused in the air for a moment, instead of indicating a break, he continued to spread the formations outward.</p><p></p><p>Yan Hang, who had been preparing to relax, couldn't help but exclaim, "This..."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, check the Duty Recording. The work plan has been updated!"</p><p></p><p>"Master Li has taken the initiative to assist other formation masters in setting up formations?!"</p><p></p><p>"We must cooperate to our best ability and not slack off?"</p><p></p><p>Their words left them in shock and despair.</p><p></p><p>After a considerable pause, the group finally came to.</p><p></p><p>Yan Hang gritted his teeth and rallied the others, "If Master Li is giving his all, we have no reason to refuse."</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, let's push harder and endure a little longer."</p><p></p><p>One of them sighed, "It's the only choice we have. If we give up now, it would be a disgrace."</p><p></p><p>"I don't really mind. What concerns me the most is Master Li. Haven't you noticed that he seems to be aging more rapidly?" Yan Hang reminded.</p><p></p><p>Upon this cue, the others all realized the same after carefully looking at the not-so-far figure that, despite appearing aged, still stood tall.</p><p></p><p>They were all taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"It does seem so."</p><p></p><p>"He didn't have many years left to begin with. Pushing himself like this will surely deplete his lifespan even more."</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>They exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>"No, we can't stand by and watch Master Li perish before our eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Immediately report this situation!"</p>

            <p>As he spoke, Li Fan waved his hand and a storage ring appeared in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Liu, please check the quality. Can it satisfy the alchemy needs?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Liu San took the ring and after examining it, he looked surprised, "The quality is excellent, mostly spirit herbs that have grown for over a hundred years. Did you purposely select them, Young Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, "Just ordinary spirit plants sold in the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Liu San couldn't help but feel emotional, "After the Ten Xian Alliance merged with the Five Elders' Association to unify the cultivation world and integrate all resources, it has indeed become very extravagant."</p><p></p><p>"In our time, even if it was the ten major sects of immortality, I'm afraid they wouldn't be able to provide such a large quantity of high-quality spirit herbs."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also smiled and agreed, "Perhaps it's also one of the reasons why most cultivators in the world died. The scale of the cultivation world today is far smaller than when we started. Leaving that aside, just our Medicine King Sect with a few thousand people was only a medium-sized sect in ancient times. In one province, there were countless sects like ours."</p><p></p><p>"But now..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused, "If all of us suddenly appeared, I'm afraid it would cause a sensation in the world and attract the attention of powerful beings in the Eternal Life Realm."</p><p></p><p>Liu San shuddered and was amazed, furrowing his brows slightly, "When I flew over several provinces earlier, I also discovered this problem. Compared to the past, the cultivation world is too bleak. The land is vast and sparsely populated. Other than the fixed cities, it's rare to see cultivators in the wilderness. In the past, as long as there were spiritual veins in the mountains and rivers, there would be cultivators occupying them."</p><p></p><p>"As they say, the larger the tree, the more wind it attracts. Today's powerful beings in the Eternal Life Realm and the principles of defying the natural order are probably stronger than the elders of those sects in the ten major sects of immortality. If our Medicine King Sect travels through time and arrives in the present, if we are exposed, it's inevitable to attract others' covetousness."</p><p></p><p>"Your decision, Young Master, is correct. Dispersing and infiltrating the Ten Xian Alliance is the best way for us to quickly restore our strength without attracting attention." Liu San looked at Li Fan, a look of relief in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Now in the Ten Xian Alliance, all cultivation resources depend on contribution points. Even though we owe Senior Zhou some, although he doesn't say anything, if he doesn't see any benefits from us, there may be problems. Only by forcibly binding us together as a community of shared interests is the most secure solution."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained, "Don't trust human nature lightly, only interests are eternal. So, we must quickly stabilize the production of the Longevity Pill. I will trouble you, Senior Liu!"</p><p></p><p>Liu San looked serious, "Rekindling the glory of the Medicine King Sect is my duty. Young Master, rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Leading a group of disciples to the alchemy room in the center of the Medicine King Cauldron, Liu San said solemnly, "Young Master, release the permissions and let me control the Medicine King True Cauldron."</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's divine sense, he temporarily transferred the usage permissions here, and a shadow of a medicine cauldron appeared in the center of the area.</p><p></p><p>Liu San lightly tapped in the void, and the shadow transformed from solid to virtual with a "clang" and landed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"In position!" Liu San scanned the disciples beside him and said softly.</p><p></p><p>Ninety-nine elite Foundation Building disciples who had been selected one by one each controlled their own small Medicine King Cauldron, gradually arranging themselves from the inside out, with the Medicine King True Cauldron as the core.</p><p></p><p>A blue light emitted from the Medicine King True Cauldron, connecting each small cauldron around it, delineating a complete formation on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The Salvation Longevity Grand Formation..." Li Fan observed silently as he saw this scene, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Liu San fully operated the Eternal Life Scripture. A pure green vitality flowed out from the center of the Medicine King True Cauldron, then circulated around the formation, refined by the array, becoming more vibrant before returning to the True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>When the green vitality in the cauldron had accumulated to almost half of the cauldron's volume like stagnant water, Liu San began to put the required herbs into the cauldron one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Plop..."</p><p></p><p>As the spirit herbs entered the cauldron, the green vitality boiled as if to surpass, violently surging. The herbs melted instantly and disappeared in the cauldron. The evaporated gas condensed, forming a transparent barrier at the top of the cauldron, blocking the overflow of the green vitality.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's expression became serious as he controlled the timing of adding the herbs based on the situation inside the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the ninety-nine disciples, while assisting with their own small Medicine King Cauldrons, also seized the rare opportunity, staring attentively at Liu San's alchemy process.</p><p></p><p>Time passed by second by second.</p><p></p><p>With the addition of many herbs, the green vitality became thicker and even tangible.</p><p></p><p>At the most critical moment, Liu San shouted loudly, "Condense!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he pointed towards the central position of the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the cauldron became virtual again and then shrank violently towards the center.</p><p></p><p>In this moment of compression, the green vitality, already dense to the extreme, underwent a qualitative change, completing the transition from liquid to solid.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the Medicine King True Cauldron disappeared, leaving only a spinning blue pill exuding a strong vitality in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>A strong medicinal fragrance wafted from it.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators present, including Liu San, subconsciously flashed a greedy look in their eyes upon smelling this fragrance.</p><p></p><p>But Liu San, being a combined Daoist, reacted immediately from the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>His face changed slightly, and he suddenly shouted, "Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Following this, he grabbed forward, forming a giant palm that enveloped the Longevity Pill just refined.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was puzzled, they heard a loud explosion coming from Liu San's palm.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's body trembled slightly, and although he quickly composed himself and retracted his hand, he couldn't hide the embarrassment on his face.</p><p></p><p>"This... did the alchemy fail?" Li Fan and the Medicine King Sect disciples looked at Liu San with a strange gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." Liu San coughed lightly and explained softly, "I forgot about the changes in the world. I still used the old method for alchemy, so..."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not a big problem, just need some minor adjustments."</p><p></p><p>"Next time, next time it will definitely be fine." Liu San pledged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>So, Liu San condensed the shadow of the Medicine King Cauldron again and began the refining of the Longevity Pill.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no explosion this time, the product of the refinement...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the half-green and half-purple pill in his hand, his face twitching.</p><p></p><p>Liu San couldn't hold the situation anymore, angrily shouting, "Again!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elder angry, the disciples shivered one after another but had to continue to cooperate.</p><p></p><p>On the third attempt, they finally succeeded in refining a qualified Longevity Pill.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Liu San let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

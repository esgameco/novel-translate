        <h1>Chapter 691</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The evil spirit lingers!" A cold light flashed in Li Fan's eyes. Just happening occasionally could be considered a coincidence. But when it occurred repeatedly, it couldn't be explained by luck.</p><p></p><p>It was almost certain that Li Fan's connection to the "fated person" mentioned by Jiao Xiuyuan was related. However, how the Du'E Zong, hidden in the dark and persistent like a fly, sensed and targeted him was still unknown to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the ancient world of cultivating immortals, the Du'E Zong was an extremely mysterious existence. Not to mention thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>"Every time the cycle resets, the Du'E Zong will undoubtedly be affected. So in their eyes, I am nothing more than a cultivator with a mysterious background, hiding some secrets. Why is it always certain that I am their so-called fated person, able to help them pass through disasters?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that besides the 'True' on me, there is something else special? Or is it purely because of the Du'E Zong's mystical techniques, the ability to foresee the future?" Li Fan pondered in his mind.</p><p></p><p>For the question of whether he could escape from the seemingly hopeless Xuanhuang Realm and achieve immortality and freedom, Li Fan, who possessed the extraordinary treasure of "True," had absolute confidence.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, if destined to the Xuanhuang Realm destined for destruction, and if there really existed a savior.</p><p></p><p>Then, as the only variable, "Li Fan" undoubtedly was the most likely one.</p><p></p><p>"But if Mu let me go at the beginning, it was probably because he foresaw that I would commit endless slaughter, bringing unimaginable disasters to cultivators. Salvation and destruction both exist in my future."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's contemplation was interrupted by a blinding white light in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the visions recorded in the Time Mirage were too astonishing, even the current space-time was affected to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the violent spiritual energy around him resonating and trembling with the moment when a crack in the Xuanming Divine Beast Mountain released a light that cracked the boundary.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! Friend Li, quickly retreat!" Suddenly, Dongfang Yao's excited face changed, his figure flickering and retreating beyond the vortex.</p><p></p><p>With a decent heart, he reminded Li Fan, who was still standing there foolishly.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan drifted away, but his eyes were fixed on the great vortex, including the vast sea around it, as if the space had been segmented into small areas.</p><p></p><p>Every black crevice seemed to contain a fierce silhouette of a monster.</p><p></p><p>Roaring, howling.</p><p></p><p>Showing their fangs, tearing through space.</p><p></p><p>Countless monsters united to break through the Xuanhuang boundaries.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of the scene when forging the Divine Armament to break through the Xuan realms in the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The process of cracking the realm in the Xuanming Divine Beast Mountain seemed to have similarities.</p><p></p><p>"The Void Tyrant." Dongfang Yao sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The vision of the white column of light in the sky lasted for half an incense stick's time, nearly disappearing at the end silently.</p><p></p><p>The strong contrast of light before and after made the world in Li Fan's eyes dim suddenly.</p><p></p><p>After the disappearance of the Time Mirage, the storm in the vortex gradually subsided, as if entering a calm period after a great battle, gathering strength anew.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, who knows when the next crack will appear? I am a bit regretful of it," Dongfang Yao said.</p><p></p><p>"But in my view, friend Li, it seems like you gained some insights this time," Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao waved his hand, "Gaining insights from these wonders is always beneficial. After all, my insights are still far from the power of the real crack. Unfortunately, unlike the 'Mortal-Shaman Wall' of the Ordinary Realm, which appears at a fixed location and time, it is purely a matter of chance."</p><p></p><p>"I repeatedly contemplated in front of the Mortal-Shaman Wall back then and finally achieved the Golden Core with the Four Methods. Unfortunately, my insight was limited, and I could not perceive anything from it afterwards," Dongfang Yao reminisced.</p><p></p><p>"The Mortal-Shaman Wall," Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>Being in the Time Mirage and seeing Mr. Bai's transformation from a mortal to a divine being through the Mortal-Shaman Wall scene, Li Fan had heard about it a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>But due to lingering doubts in his mind, he had never gone to see it.</p><p></p><p>The core issue was whether Mr. Bai's display of "the world's best person" was real or fake, and whether he still existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's repeated encounters in the Meteor Immortal Realm, Mr. Bai seemed to have an almost immortal aura and almighty power.</p><p></p><p>If such a figure still existed in a corner of the Xuanhuang Realm, then even if it was just a recorded image from the Mortal-Shaman Wall, meeting him might not be any different from seeing him in reality.</p><p></p><p>No one could say what would happen then.</p><p></p><p>Without understanding Mr. Bai's background, Li Fan could only venture through the Meteor Immortal Realm and confront Mr. Bai's "past" or maybe the "past Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>The thoughts flashed by, and Li Fan continued, "The Mortal-Shaman Wall is indeed extraordinary and a great wonder of the Tianyun Province!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao put on a blue shirt and thought of something strange, saying, "Although the Mortal-Shaman Wall is impressive, in my opinion, the greatest wonder of the Tianyun Province is a black dog!"</p><p></p><p>"A black dog?" Li Fan was first stunned, then a memory he had heard from the Oracle Son came to mind, and he asked, "Is Dongfang Friend referring to the one who turned his Daoist companion into a mundane base through the Heartless Path?"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao nodded repeatedly, "Exactly, it's him. This villainous act provoked the 'Hollow Fairy' and turned into a black dog. Countless cultivators, in a bid to please the 'Hollow Fairy,' brought all sorts of beasts to queue up to harass him."</p><p></p><p>"That scene..."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao shuddered, feeling a chill.</p><p></p><p>"However, in fact, the true 'wonder' of this matter is not just that." Dongfang Yao suddenly changed the topic, lowering his voice.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Is there another hidden story to this matter?" Li Fan was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The friend also knows that I have ancient monster bloodline. Perhaps because of this, as my constitution became stronger, I discovered another wonderful use of the monster bloodline I inherited."</p><p></p><p>"That is being able to communicate with all beasts," Dongfang Yao said mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>"Before, I passed by Tianyun Province and saw the pitiful Dustland Beauty who was ravaged. Others heard the tragic howls of a dog. But to me, it was Dustland Beauty constantly pleading innocence."</p><p></p><p>"He said that it wasn't him who turned his Daoist companion into part of his base. Instead, his Daoist companion willingly became part of his foundation to be inseparable for eternity."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Li Fan was momentarily taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"At first, I didn't believe it either. But after Dustland Beauty found out that I could understand him, it was like grabbing the last straw and frantically telling me this secret."</p><p></p><p>"He vowed that everything was his weird Daoist companion's idea. He just slept and woke up to find his Daoist companion missing, but an additional base within himself."</p><p></p><p>"What's even more creepy is that he said his Daoist companion hadn't actually died. By some means, she could still communicate and speak to him every day."</p><p></p><p>"Suffering unjustly, enduring dual torment of spirit and body every day, Dustland Beauty has become completely mad."</p><p></p><p>"That time he begged me to help him escape. However..." Dongfang Yao looked helpless, "The 'Hollow Fairy' has countless suitors, and I dare not offend her. Even if she is wrong, I cannot say it directly."</p><p></p><p>"So I can only continue to distress Dustland Beauty."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since then, I knew that women are such terrifying beings. I try to avoid them." He looked at Li Fan and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Li Fan subtly moved slightly away from Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time I've heard of this incident, and it's truly interesting. The 'Hollow Fairy'..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had heard of the name of this "Hollow Fairy." Even in his previous life, he had seen her once.</p><p></p><p>It was at the commendation ceremony held after the establishment of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>Truly stunning and bewitching, living up to the title of Fairy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she had a special constitution. The inherent unique item "Yin-Yang Jade," which was half of a heavenly wonder's existence.</p><p></p><p>Through the Yin-Yang double cultivation method, the 'Yin' part of the 'Yin-Yang Jade' could be fused with a Daoist companion. This fusion could upgrade the companion's foundation artifact, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, and even transform their life, elevating them into extraordinary talents.</p><p></p><p>Truly defying the heavens to change destiny.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the 'Hollow Fairy' attracted the fervent pursuit of numerous young and talented cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And she seemed to have a deep background. There were cases where a confused cultivator attempted to use force against her but eventually vanished, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's subtly thoughtful expression, Dongfang Yao could not help but advise, "Friend Li, trust my words. Red-faced are all calamities, true brotherhood is..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what Dongfang Friend said is right. Such women are not to be trifled with!" Li Fan laughed heartily, interrupting him.</p><p></p><p>"The storm in the vortex has subsided. Where do you plan to go next, friend?" Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's agreement with his words, Dongfang Yao was delighted and said, "I have a friend named Huangfu Song. We get along well, like brothers. With our congenial relationship, I believe you and I can also get along very well."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, I heard that he is going to the Shizhe Abyss for a rare chance to achieve great deeds. He invited me along. I'm free, and I have grasped new divine powers recently, itching to use them, so I thought about joining in the fun."</p><p></p><p>"What do you say, Friend Li, are you interested?" Dongfang Yao looked at Li Fan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"The Shizhe Abyss? White mist, the Enchanted Realm, achieving great feats?" Li Fan squinted, connecting countless clues.</p><p></p><p>"When the next crack appears, who knows how long you will have to wait for it?" Dongfang Yao sounded a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>"I agree, though. I dare not refuse. I've accepted," Li Fan replied without much hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Dongfang Yao was pleased.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask where he is now and then join him!" he said, taking out a communication talisman to inquire.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Dongfang Yao put away the talisman.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan heard the familiar place name, he smiled lightly. Then he followed Dongfang Yao and flew towards the nearest transmission array.</p><p></p><p>In the Beast Domain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, who was further comprehending the world's destiny, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the sky, his lips slightly parted, as if speaking a word.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth suddenly fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the countless roars from different ancient monsters, emanating from the most mighty creatures from the ancient times in the Beast Realm, resounded throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the ancient fierceness and hostility, all the exotic creatures who had been toiling in the Beast Realm were at this moment...</p><p></p><p>End of the excerpt.</p>

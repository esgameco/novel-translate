        <h1>Chapter 311</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The black and white golden core devoured all the different types of forces in the dantian vortex, strengthening itself.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the vortex slowly shrank while the golden core became more condensed and dynamic.</p><p></p><p>Its shape became more and more rounded, and the black and white colors on the surface circulated faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>When the vortex was completely devoured, and black and white finally merged into one at this extreme speed, a wave burst out from it, instantly sweeping through the dantian and then spreading throughout Li Fan's entire body.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the wave passed, all the remaining chaotic energy in the body during the core formation process completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Everything returned to calm as this wave swept around and quickly returned.</p><p></p><p>Mixed with the spiritual energy throughout the body and the karma body used to store cultivation in the dantian, the light sphere transformed by [Huan Zhen] also followed this wave, turning into a wisp of clear light and piercing into the golden core.</p><p></p><p>Completing the last piece of the puzzle, Li Fan's golden core was finally fully formed.</p><p></p><p>The golden core fell into absolute stillness in an instant, and then a dazzling light radiated from it.</p><p></p><p>Illuminating the whole body, even Li Fan's internal vision process was interrupted.</p><p></p><p>As the light gradually receded, when Li Fan looked again, he only saw a seemingly ordinary and plain golden core floating quietly in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could even sigh, the vast spiritual power surged out from this golden core, flowing from the dantian to the limbs and bones.</p><p></p><p>It was a brand new force that far surpassed the foundation building period in both quality and quantity.</p><p></p><p>Every cell in the body, nourished by the spiritual power of the golden core stage, seemed to be letting out a joyful cheer.</p><p></p><p>The long-lost vitality and youthful feeling emerged from Li Fan's heart. "All the way through hardships and dangers, nearly dying several times."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I have finally achieved the golden core."</p><p></p><p>"It was hard-earned, lucky, lucky."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed in his heart and opened the [Huan Zhen] panel to check the changes after forming his golden core:</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p>Realm: Early Golden Core Stage</p><p>Physiological Age: 48/599</p><p>Psychological Age: 1240/4200â†‘</p><p>Void Filling Energy Progress: 200%</p><p>Anchor Charging Progress: 2%</p><p>Current Number of Anchors: 3</p><p>Current Number of Available Anchors: 0</p><p>Bound Items: "Thousand Mechanisms Jade Disc Golden Seal", Taiyi Boat, Remnant Stele (damaged), Essence Blood of Ten Thousand People, Dao Transformation Stone</p><p>Techniques: Mysterious Yellow Heart Refining Chant, Cloud Dream Illusion Technique, Stealing the Heavens Technique, Creation Furnace Technique, Thousand Mechanisms Jade Disc Golden Seal, Sitting on the Mountain Technique, Mind Spirit Illusion Technique</p><p>Magical Powers: Life and Death Linking, Formless Killing Intent, Insect Binding, Gathered Clouds Single Sword, Heaven Flipping Palm</p><p>Special: Eternal Remembrance (Tianyang) (Number of uses: 1)</p><p></p><p>"Life expectancy increased from four hundred years to six hundred years all at once, nearly increasing by half. The upper limit of psychological age also began to increase again."</p><p></p><p>"The accumulation of cultivation between the golden core and foundation building is indeed extremely different. The karma bodies I accumulated before, I originally thought they could push me to the middle stage of the golden core after forming the core. Now the progress has just passed one-third..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this may also be due to the fact that I forcibly used the Nine Methods to form the golden core."</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Methods Golden Core is naturally incomparable to ordinary golden cores."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the process of forming the golden core just now, Li Fan had to admit that his success this time had a bit of luck.</p><p></p><p>The power of the five elements was just hastily gathered by him. The strength of water and fire was far greater than metal, wood and earth.</p><p></p><p>This led to the operation of the five elements not being so harmonious and smooth, but instead showing signs of losing control at all times, almost causing him to fail.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the final result is not bad, and a golden core with considerable power was barely formed."</p><p></p><p>With the golden core formed, it was already one with Li Fan. The various wonderful uses of it were naturally clear to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Methods of Core Formation, as well as the various functions of [Huan Zhen] as a foundation building wonder, were all attributed to this golden core.</p><p></p><p>From now on, when Li Fan uses the five elements techniques, it will be like using his own arms, and will be strengthened to a certain extent. Among them, the effects of water and fire are even more prominent.</p><p></p><p>The five elements generate each other, providing an endless and continuous combat ability, which is many times stronger than the previous Lian Hen branch.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan is confident that if he returns to the spiritless land of immortal extinction now, relying solely on the spiritual energy in his body, even if he is in a state of constant battle consumption, he can persist for a considerable period of time.</p><p></p><p>And the existence of the secret storage method also allows Li Fan to recover his injuries at an extremely fast speed. The combination of the two makes Li Fan almost an existence that cannot be exhausted or broken.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Flame Illusion Spirit has disappeared and no longer exists in the sea of consciousness. It has become a part of the golden core law. Now, Li Fan can enter the previous state of absolute rationality at any time without relying on the Blue Flame Illusion Spirit.</p><p></p><p>And finally, the Heavenly Fiend and Ink Killing...</p><p></p><p>At the moment of achieving the golden core, Li Fan inexplicably comprehended and came up with a killing move that integrates the characteristics of the two.</p><p></p><p>Using the power of the five elements as the internal core drive, and the power of the Heavenly Fiend and Ink Killing to destroy everything as the sword edge, plus the unyielding and unstoppable momentum of the Gathered Clouds Twenty-Eight Swords.</p><p></p><p>In his conception, Li Fan named it the "Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword".</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this is my trump card and cannot be easily exposed. This Huanyu Branch is under heavy surveillance, so it is impossible to experiment with its effects here."</p><p></p><p>After imagining the power of this new magical power, Li Fan had to suppress the idea reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>After summarizing what he had gained, Li Fan also carried out reflection and planning for the future.</p><p></p><p>"The five elements are not harmonious and must be completed sooner or later. Otherwise, even if the golden core stage is unscathed, when seizing the perfect and self-contained Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, it will definitely suffer a setback."</p><p></p><p>The new method of the Celestial Venerate is fast in cultivation, but when breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, one will inevitably begin to face the counterattack of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Previously, peeping into the laws of heaven and earth was compared to tracing with a canvas.</p><p></p><p>Then seizing the essence of heaven and earth can be regarded as forcibly seizing precious paintings from a museum full of treasures.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, one has to face the counterattack of the security system.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan is not yet clear about the specific details, but he has read some relevant snippets before.</p><p></p><p>"Next, cultivate on one hand and collect relevant information on the other."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it is the information of the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven or the power of the five elements comparable to the Vast Sea and Scarlet Flame, it is not easy to obtain."</p><p></p><p>"It needs to be carefully planned."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan, who was in the golden core stage, cultivated again, he felt the slowness of his cultivation progress increase for the first time in a long time.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but miss Xiao Heng, He Zhenghao, and Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Heng should be in Shilin Prefecture at the moment, and Su Xiaomei has not yet come out of the ruins of Chaoyuan Sect."</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenghao has finished his closed training, but he seems to be busy with his duties and has not had much opportunity to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"Well, they have all broken through to the golden core stage, and it is not a matter of a day or two to make further progress."</p>

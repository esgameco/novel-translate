            <p>Chapter 1139: The Sun Family's Hidden Hand</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lay on the bed with his eyes closed, as if he hadn't heard Wu Ninglu's words at all.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu's beautiful eyes moved, and she was about to take off her clothes and climb onto the bed as well.</p><p></p><p>However, just as her body was about to get close to Li Fan, a bone-chilling coldness made her shiver involuntarily and instinctively move away.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, Wu Ninglu was horrified to find that a layer of frost had condensed on the surface of her skin in that instant.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for her subconscious avoidance, Wu Ninglu had no doubt that she would have been frozen into a popsicle by her husband!</p><p></p><p>She was both happy and angry.</p><p></p><p>Before she could say a thousand words, she suddenly heard Li Fan say calmly, "I just broke through and can't perfectly control my power yet. It's best if you don't casually approach me recently."</p><p></p><p>Rejected from sending warmth, Wu Ninglu was no longer angry.</p><p></p><p>Overjoyed, she nodded repeatedly, "Okay, okay. I didn't expect that after disappearing for more than half a year, Young Master Sun, you would give me such a big surprise when you reappeared. This is a big deal, we must notify the whole family, let everyone know."</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu was about to go out, but saw an ice wall blocking the door, stopping her way.</p><p></p><p>She turned her head and looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were still not open, but he said something that seemed completely unrelated.</p><p></p><p>"Before this, the three elders of the family, have they decided on who will go to the Protector Hall to take office?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu was stunned for a moment, then immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch naturally can't leave. Uncle and Third Uncle pushed each other for a while. It is said that not long ago, Uncle finally couldn't win and compromised..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Wu Ninglu couldn't help but retract her foot that had already stepped out.</p><p></p><p>"Our branch has never been well-treated in the family. If the news of my advancement to the Harmonious Dao spreads, I'm afraid I will have to go to the Protector Hall in their stead. I won't be allowed to go out for at least three hundred years..."</p><p></p><p>"Humph."</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't been injured during my advancement, causing my realm to be unstable and afraid of being noticed by outsiders and having the fruits plucked, I wouldn't have rashly come back."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Although going to the Protector Hall will be given some material compensation from both the family and the Immortal Alliance, those things are basically useless to me now. Besides, three hundred years is really too long."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Wu Ninglu.</p><p></p><p>"So, don't leak the news of my advancement for now."</p><p></p><p>Meeting Li Fan's gaze, Wu Ninglu's body trembled violently, and she couldn't help but nod.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes again to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>The room fell into silence once more.</p><p></p><p>The vaguely visible ice-sealing arena made Wu Ninglu almost fully circulate her spiritual power to maintain her body temperature.</p><p></p><p>Curled up in the corner of the room, Wu Ninglu felt both aggrieved and envious.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the might of the Harmonious Dao? I didn't expect that he would also have the day to advance to the Harmonious Dao. Originally, I thought Sun Weizhou would be the first among the younger generation to break through."</p><p></p><p>Until the fluctuating aura on the other party's body gradually calmed down, but still without words, still sitting in meditation with eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Wu Ninglu walk out of the room in a huff.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, soon, this stupid woman will reveal that her Dao companion is already a Harmonious Dao powerhouse."</p><p></p><p>"Just for the little benefit promised by Sun Luchang."</p><p></p><p>"It can't be said that she's really that stupid. After all, the benefits that are truly in one's own hands are real. As long as Sun Ang is a Harmonious Dao</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No matter where she was, others would treat her, the Dao-Harmonized Lady, with extra courtesy." Li Fan's eyes were deep, as if he could see through time.</p><p></p><p>It turned out just as Li Fan had predicted.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, when Wu Ninglu personally witnessed the various generous conditions that Uncle and Third Uncle promised each other in order to avoid serving in the Dharma Protection Hall, she couldn't help but be somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>You should know that she and Sun Ang had not been living very well in the past.</p><p></p><p>They had absolutely no say in the family's various decisions, and any good things would always go to others first.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Li Fan's previous instructions, she did not speak up directly.</p><p></p><p>But Wu Ninglu's slightly unusual expression did not escape the eyes of the several Dao-Harmonized members of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the faint fluctuations that Li Fan had deliberately released when he returned previously.</p><p></p><p>Made them have a vague guess in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After some questioning, Wu Ninglu reluctantly told them about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luchang was overjoyed and immediately pulled his two elder brothers to come together.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to show a helpless and angry expression, and looked at Wu Ninglu.</p><p></p><p>The three Dao-Harmonized elders took the initiative to make excuses for her.</p><p></p><p>Then they persuaded Li Fan with emotion and reason, taking turns.</p><p></p><p>For the overall benefit of the family, he had no choice but to agree to go to the Dharma Protection Hall in his place.</p><p></p><p>"Lu'er, don't worry. During the time you are away, we will definitely take good care of Ninglu and not let her suffer the slightest grievance." Sun Luchang promised.</p><p></p><p>Lu'er was Sun Ang's nickname.</p><p></p><p>In principle, even as Dao-Harmonized cultivators and elders, it was inappropriate to directly call him by his nickname as before. However, Sun Luchang still called him that, just to remind "Sun Ang" of his identity as a member of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure that Sun Ang could pass the assessment of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the three Dao-Harmonized members of the Sun family joined forces to test Sun Ang's actual combat strength.</p><p></p><p>After persisting for several hundred rounds, he gradually showed signs of not being able to hold on.</p><p></p><p>"Lu'er, the Heaven and Earth Essence you devoured is truly extraordinary. Although its offensive power is a bit lacking, the domain that freezes everything around it can block the vast majority of offensive techniques."</p><p></p><p>The three Dao-Harmonized members of the Sun family were very satisfied with Li Fan's performance.</p><p></p><p>Even as a newly advanced Dao-Harmonized cultivator, such strength was enough to be accountable to the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan went to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, he quietly called Wu Ninglu to his side.</p><p></p><p>"I know you have been avoiding me recently, afraid that I will blame you, right?"</p><p></p><p>"How could that be?"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I also know that even if you didn't say it, my advancement to Dao-Harmonized realm couldn't be hidden for long. Some things are unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, you and I are originally one body. I worked hard for three hundred years to fight for some benefits for you, it's nothing."</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu was very surprised by Li Fan's words and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>She even felt a little moved.</p><p></p><p>"During the time I'm gone, you still need to be careful when you're alone."</p><p></p><p>"Those old guys in the family may say nice things, but it's uncertain how they will actually be."</p><p></p><p>"During this trip, I made a good friend. He helped a lot for me to break through."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, he handed over a communication jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>"If you encounter something that you can't solve, contact him."</p><p></p><p>"He should lend a hand to help you resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"However, this person is also at the Dao-Harmonized realm, and his temperament is a bit eccentric. Don't ask him unless it's absolutely necessary."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, remember."</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The next chapter will be around 1 o'clock, my hand is injured, typing is a bit slow.</p>

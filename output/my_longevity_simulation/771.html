        <h1>Chapter 771</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A curved, winding line divided the map into two parts. On one side, the map information was very detailed, showing the names of states, terrain and topography in full view. However, the other side of the curve seemed shrouded in mist, with even the rough outlines of states difficult to discern. It was only roughly divided into five regions.</p><p></p><p>"The area controlled by the Five Elders is under strict rule of the five immortal lords. It's really difficult to infiltrate. Even our Realm Alliance doesn't know much about it," Xu Bai said, instantly marking thousands of black dots on the map. </p><p></p><p>Most were distributed within the territory of the Realm Alliance, with only a few in the misty area. "These are the small worlds that can already be excluded. The vast majority of them have not yet been discovered by the cultivators of the Realm Alliance. But some have been exposed." </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai lightly pointed, and thirty-seven black dots were marked with a small flag bearing the word "Immortal".</p><p></p><p>"There are also some that the Realm Alliance has explored but Xiao Hei hasn't ventured into in recent years."  </p><p></p><p>Another 435 "Immortal" flags flew to different corners of the map.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke's whereabouts should be in the remaining small worlds of the Profound Yellow Realm," Xu Bai said indifferently before this map.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can find Xu Ke before thoroughly searching all the remaining small worlds within the Realm Alliance territory."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if he is unfortunately in a small world entrance within the Five Elders' territory, there is basically no hope."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xiao Hong couldn't help but ask: "Aren't you called the Realm Alliance? Can't you provide us with the entrances to the small worlds you control?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Dao Friend Red thinks I'm some big shot in the Realm Alliance?" Xu Bai asked in return.</p><p></p><p>"To ensure the safety of each small world, our Alliance usually only has fixed envoys responsible for liaising with specific small worlds. Apart from the ones they are responsible for, the envoys know nothing about the other small worlds," Xu Bai explained.</p><p></p><p>"If you have the ability, you could kidnap and severely torture that Elder Dao Liu who came with me last time. Maybe you could get something out of him."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hong was instantly speechless. </p><p></p><p>Di Nu looked at the map of the Profound Yellow Realm before her and felt a surge of powerlessness. Her gaze became less bold: "This...is almost like finding a needle in a vast ocean."</p><p></p><p>"What, you're not going to give up so soon, are you?" Xu Bai seemed a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"What Xiao Hei can do, I can do as well. Rest assured, Dao Friend Xu, the Empire will not go back on its word," Xiao Qing, who had been worried before, suddenly became determined.</p><p></p><p>At Xiao Qing's urging, Di Nu eventually handed over the improved "Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement Method" to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>It was not recorded in books or jade slips, but by the Empire's unique "Book Worms".</p><p></p><p>"To practice the Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement Method, certain specific resources are needed as supplements. Dao Friend Xu, please wait a moment, we will have someone prepare them for you right away," Xiao Qing continued.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly. Without directly viewing the contents recorded by the Book Worms, he temporarily put them away. After pondering for a moment, he then suggested: "Your main priority now is..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Competing with the Myriad Immortal Alliance cultivators for time."</p><p>"I don't know, did Xu Ke have any personal items left behind? Perhaps I can ask some senior members of the organization to help you investigate a bit."</p><p>Xu Bai smiled and said, "After all, I'm quite curious about this ancestor of mine."</p><p>Within the Myriad Immortal Alliance, there were many who practiced the art of stealing techniques.</p><p>If combined with the Doomsday Disc that Xu Bai had gifted, it would be enough to search for the entrance to the small world without exposing one's own identity.</p><p>After hearing Xu Bai's words, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong exchanged a glance.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Xiao Qing finally said, "When the master left back then, there were indeed some personal items he didn't take with him. We have preserved them well."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please come with me."</p><p>Guided by Xiao Qing, Xu Bai arrived at a small, unassuming room at the top of the grand palace.</p><p>Unlike the luxurious room they had just met in, the interior here was quite simple and plain, showing no signs of being the residence of the Empire's creator.</p><p>"This was the place where the master lived in those days, and everything inside remains untouched. In the beginning, we still had the hope that the master might return. But after so many years, we've long since realized that was an impossible dream," Xiao Hong said with a tinge of sadness.</p><p>Xu Bai's gaze swept across the small room, and his heart suddenly raced. For in the drawer of one of the wooden tables, he discovered a thin, fading red cord!</p><p>Though it was just a few strands, about to break at any moment, Xu Bai was intimately familiar with its appearance and the faint aura it emanated.</p><p>"Is this the red cord that Bai Xiansheng left for Xu Ke? He didn't take it with him when he left?"</p><p>Xu Bai's heart was in turmoil. He subtly shifted his gaze, seemingly looking at other items, but in reality, he was constantly recalling the red cord he had just seen.</p><p>"There's no mistake, it's the same red cord that could easily slay the Crimson Nine-Headed Beast in Xu Ke's hand."</p><p>"But it seems to be just a fragment, not the main body. Was it left behind as a final protective measure for the Empire?"</p><p>"However, judging from its neglected state, it seems that Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong don't know the terrifying power contained within this red cord."</p><p>Xu Bai was well aware of the formidable power of this red cord. Even though it was now just a few strands, it could still pose a deadly threat to Dao-realm cultivators.</p><p>Naturally, the desire to claim it as his own began to rise in Xu Bai's heart.</p><p>"The art of divination is profound and mysterious. It would be best to take a few more items."</p><p>He explained.</p><p>"No problem, they are just ordinary objects. To increase the chances of finding the master, fellow Daoist, please take as many as you need," Xiao Qing said without any objection.</p><p>Xu Bai then took a pen and a set of clothes that Xu Ke had once worn from the room. Finally, he pretended to search around and took the red cord as well.</p><p>"That's it?"</p><p>Holding the precious item, Xu Bai still found it hard to believe.</p><p>But after discussing the details with Xiao Qing and the others and taking his leave, it was only after leaving the Empire that he finally confirmed he had so effortlessly obtained the red cord of Bai Xiansheng.</p><p>"I still need to research how to use it properly."</p><p>Xu Bai did not linger and swiftly returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>

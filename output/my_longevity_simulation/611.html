            <p>It was named because the valley was abundant in the raw materials needed to refine the "Elixir of Longevity".</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, the Elixir of Longevity is a type of elixir that can prolong the life of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It is the ultimate secret of the Medicine King Sect, and is also the key to the Medicine King Sect's prosperity in a region.</p><p></p><p>Depending on the quality of the elixir, the increase in lifespan varies. The finest Elixir of Longevity can even surpass the "Heavenly Feather Elixir," extending life by a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>In the refining process of the Elixir of Longevity, besides the high quality requirements for medicinal materials, it also requires the Medicine King True Cauldron as the core, and ninety-nine auxiliary mini cauldrons to form the "World-Healing Elixir of Longevity Formation." During the alchemy process, the "Green Life of Longevity" needs to be continuously infused.</p><p></p><p>Although the process is a bit complex, it is definitely worth it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other life-extending wonders, the greatest feature of the Elixir of Longevity is that it can be repeatedly consumed.</p><p></p><p>Although each pill will be much less effective than the previous one, eventually losing all effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>But compared to other life-extending wonders that become completely ineffective after one consumption, the Elixir of Longevity is much better.</p><p></p><p>The vast Void Sea requires great courage to cross.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir of Longevity, along with the "Dream of Spring and Autumn Array" that can put all sect cultivators into a dormant state, are the two mainstays of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Elixir of Longevity is indeed a great treasure. Unfortunately, before the departure of the Medicine King Sect, most of them were sold and exchanged for reserve resources."</p><p></p><p>"The remaining ones are also in the hands of those elders."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan checked the inventory list of the Medicine King Cauldron and did not find any Elixir of Longevity, feeling somewhat regretful.</p><p></p><p>However, considering that most of the Medicine King Sect's cultivators are now in his hands, he has a way to make them refine elixirs for himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see the current situation in the Valley of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>"If no one has discovered it all this time, that would be ideal. After thousands of years, it is really hard to imagine what kind of herbs could have grown inside."</p><p></p><p>"If it has been discovered and developed by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"It wouldn't matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan checked the materials needed to refine the Elixir of Longevity and found that they could all be purchased in the current Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Although the prices were a bit high, buying them back to refine into the Elixir of Longevity and then selling them would definitely bring profits.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Li Fan currently does not lack contribution points.</p><p></p><p>"Jiarong Border in South Fuzhou..."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of place is this?"</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan wanted to follow the memories of Linghu Chang to go to the Valley of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>He encountered a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>Because there was no such place within the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance now.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be within the territory of the Five Elders Association?" Li Fan suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><p></p><p>"It's not certain. After so many years and lineage interruptions, maybe it just changed its name."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought again.</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he compared the terrain around the Valley of Longevity with the current territory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In an attempt to finally determine the exact location of the Valley of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>After some hard work, he finally...</p><p></p><p>Helplessly gave up.</p><p></p><p>"While I know that the changes in the Xuanhuang Realm are unpredictable, I didn't expect it to be to this extent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Near the Valley of Longevity in Linghu Chang's memory, there is a Wormtail Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>But now, there are many Wormtail Mountain Ranges within the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance's territory.</p><p></p><p>Compared to thousands of years ago, the Wormtail Mountain Range seemed to have been cut into several pieces, and then dispersed in a disorderly and chaotic manner.</p><p></p><p>This was just in terms of names. Not to mention those parts that had lost their names.</p><p></p><p>Trying to find the exact location of the Valley of Longevity with his own power was like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p></p><p>If he tried each place one by one, it would indeed take a lot of time to eventually find it.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It was unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's time was very precious.</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, he decided to leave it to the professionals.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, through research in the Tianxuan Mirror, he contacted a cultivator who specialized in studying ancient and current geographical changes, Ximen Yu.</p><p></p><p>His work, "Historical Examination of Mountains and Rivers," was widely circulated.</p><p></p><p>Calculating based on the remains of several ancient sect sites, then estimating the changes in position.</p><p></p><p>The results he calculated in the book had been verified by many cultivators with very small errors.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Xuanhuang Realm was vast. The examples in the historical examination were just to prove Ximen Yu's ability to do this.</p><p></p><p>To determine the correct current location of the locations recorded in ancient texts?</p><p></p><p>Spend some contribution points and he'll solve it for you right away!</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu's intention was clear â€“ to earn contribution points through his unique skill.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also appreciated people who did things for money.</p><p></p><p>In order to conceal his true purpose, he directly listed dozens of places from the ancient times in his memory for Ximen Yu to calculate.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time Ximen Yu had accepted such a large order, and he was pleasantly surprised. He even offered Li Fan a discount.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just waved his hand, rejecting it. He only asked him to speed up the process.</p><p></p><p>Once Ximen Yu received the advance payment, he readily accepted it. He promptly ended the communication and went to calculate.</p><p></p><p>The extra contribution points were completely overlooked by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>For him, it was just a drop in the bucket. As long as it could avoid potential trouble, it was worth it.</p><p></p><p>Reassessing over fifty locations was also a massive project.</p><p></p><p>It would take some time to get the results.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Fan quietly arrived on Shenhua Island.</p><p></p><p>It had been seven years since he had brought the people from the Ling Realm to this place.</p><p></p><p>Yi Feipeng, Xiao Heng, Sun Erlang, and others had grown into young men.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Li Fan's rule that they had to defeat the Sun Puppet to leave the island, they had been stuck on Shenhua Island for so long, never taking a step off the island.</p><p></p><p>Being youthful and full of blood, they were almost going crazy from being cooped up for so long.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't dare to provoke the Sun Puppet. They only competed with each other every day to vent their energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and glanced at everyone.</p><p></p><p>Without attracting their attention, he then entered the secret room on the island.</p><p></p><p>Here, there were formations set up by Li Fan for protection, and only Sun Yang had the authority to enter.</p><p></p><p>Inside were jars of bright red essence blood, from which faint angry roars could be heard.</p><p></p><p>These were the essences extracted from Yi Feipeng at intervals under Sun Yang's command.</p><p></p><p>After a long time without Sun Yang's visits, a considerable amount had accumulated.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Kunpeng bloodline, how could Yi Feipeng fatten up with such frequent blood extraction?</p><p></p><p>So, in this life, Yi Feipeng was not chubby like in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he appeared a bit lean.</p>

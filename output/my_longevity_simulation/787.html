        <h1>Chapter 787</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"How could the scenes recorded in the Yao Wang Zhen Ding be fake?" Fang Zaiji snorted. </p><p>His gaze drifted over the duplicate Huadao Shimo that Xu Bai was fiddling with in his hands. Seeing Xu Bai eventually put it away, he couldn't help feeling a bit regretful.</p><p>Then he asked curiously, "But you said the attraction of the Xian Xu is indeed getting stronger and stronger, how did you see that?"</p><p>Chen Tianhai did not hide it and explained, "According to the time and angle when the Yao Wang Zhen Ding's trajectory deviated after flying out of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p>"As I mentioned before, over the years, we have also sent people to explore the Xian Xu. Although we gained no insight into the scenes inside the Xian Xu, we did record a lot of useful information."</p><p>"According to our calculations, the gravitational pull of the Xian Xu now is almost twice as strong as when the Yao Wang Zhen Ding encountered it."</p><p>"It's quite frightening. Doesn't that mean the entire Xuanhuang Realm will be swallowed by it after some time?" Fang Zaiji clicked his tongue in wonder, but there was not a trace of fear on his face.</p><p>"Those so-called Long Sheng Tian Zuns, who knows what they're actually doing."</p><p>"Anyway, if the sky falls, we have those tall guys to prop it up," he muttered under his breath.</p><p>"Pinning hopes on others is not the act of a wise man," Chen Tianhai did not agree with his attitude.</p><p>After learning from the Huadao Taiyuan School that the Xian Xu's gravitational pull was indeed getting stronger, Xu Bai also pondered this.</p><p>"After the Xian Xu was discovered back then, the major forces of the Xuanhuang Realm did not immediately choose to flee, but instead chose to capture other small worlds to counteract it..."</p><p>"Perhaps it was because the Xian Xu back then was not as terrifying as it is now."</p><p>"And now, there is not much time left for the Xuanhuang Realm. So in the previous life, after the Xuanhuang Realm was unified, the Tui Li Plan was immediately launched."</p><p>His thoughts flashed by quickly, and Xu Bai raised his final question of this trip: "The cultivators in the city were all converted by members of the Taiyuan School in recent years. But I've heard that the Huadao Shimo itself has also given birth to spiritual intelligence. I wonder if it has created a human form for itself?"</p><p>Hearing this question that seemed unrelated to the previous topics, Chen Tianhai was a bit surprised.</p><p>However, this was not a secret matter, so he nodded and said, "Initially, out of curiosity about humans, the Huadao Shimo did create a human form to analyze and study."</p><p>"But now she rarely appears in human form."</p><p>Having received the answer he wanted, Xu Bai nodded slightly.</p><p>He then bid farewell to Chen Tianhai.</p><p>Chen Tianhai hesitated for a moment, but ultimately allowed Xu Bai and the others to leave.</p><p>When Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji disappeared into the Taixuan Cave World, </p><p>an azure figure whose appearance could not be seen clearly suddenly appeared beside Chen Tianhai.</p><p>"You just let them go like that?"</p><p>"That one called Xu Bai may have many secrets."</p><p>"An outlier variable, perhaps brought back from outside the heavens by the Yao Wang School, or maybe from those existences deliberately erased by powerful beings." The azure figure's voice sounded neither male nor female, with an eerie fluctuation in pitch.</p><p>But this did not hinder communication with Chen Tianhai.</p><p>"Deliberately erased?"</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You mean the great cultivator can be revived?" Chen Tianhai's eyes flashed with a gleam.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the results of our analysis, it's quite possible. The character of Xu Bai has never appeared in any of the worlds we've analyzed. His birth may have been a mere coincidence. But Fang Zaijing called him the Sect Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Then it means we are missing some information, leading to errors in our analysis," the azure figure spoke quickly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai pondered for a moment and slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What did he mean by that last question?"</p><p></p><p>The azure figure rippled slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a while, she replied, "The analysis failed."</p><p></p><p>"But..." </p><p></p><p>She did not finish her sentence, and her figure gradually faded and disappeared from Chen Tianhai's sight.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai felt as if he had heard the unfinished words of the azure figure.</p><p></p><p>He had an intrigued expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>In the Long Valley, Fang Zaijing was recounting his experiences to Liu San and Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the mighty Taiyi Sect has become such a sorry state. In comparison, our Yaowan Sect is rather fortunate," Fang Zaijing sighed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, no matter how Chen Tianhai boasted, he could not accept the so-called "indestructible information."</p><p></p><p>Liu San also had a wistful expression.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense swept through the cultivation activities of the many disciples in the Long Life Valley, a scene of vibrant energy. His expression changed, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai had already arrived in the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling Dao Refining Stone Mother replica was now floating before him.</p><p></p><p>"Simulation..." </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai snorted coldly, but did not use his spiritual sense to interact with it or perform the so-called simulation operation.</p><p></p><p>Whatever about the Taiyi Sect being unable to contain lies, and the lack of connection between the replica and the original Stone Mother - Xu Bai did not believe any of it.</p><p></p><p>Li Taishi was naturally suspicious, especially after obtaining the precious "Returning True" technique. He would not simply trust anyone else.</p><p></p><p>"Once I use it for simulation, I will either immediately return to the true state, or it will be a life-and-death situation where I have no choice."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, if I have to use it, I must be prepared for the 'Returning True' to be exposed."</p><p></p><p>"According to Chen Tianhai's explanation, although the simulation may span hundreds of years, only a moment will have passed in reality."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it can be used at a critical moment to find a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>"I just hope I will never have to use it in this world."</p><p></p><p>Putting aside these thoughts for now, Xu Bai solemnly began doing something.</p><p></p><p>Writing a will.</p><p></p><p>It was a case of preparing for defeat before the battle.</p><p></p><p>This world was fraught with danger, and even though Li Fan had made many preparations, he did not have an assured victory.</p><p></p><p>If...</p><p></p><p>Just if, he could not escape the influence of White Immortal's revival.</p><p></p><p>And ultimately perished, with White Immortal taking his place.</p><p></p><p>Then, given Li Fan's temperament, how could he be reconciled?</p><p></p><p>"If I die, the news of the 'Returning True' treasure shall spread throughout the world."</p><p></p><p>"Want to take my place? Even if I die, you won't have an easy time!"</p><p></p><p>A gloomy expression flashed across Xu Bai's face.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine that if the cultivators of the Mysterious Yellow Realm learned of the existence of the Returning True treasure, even if its next holder was an existence comparable to the Heavenly Venerable of Longevity, they would never have peace.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's final gambit.</p><p></p><p>It would only be activated if Li Fan's consciousness was completely extinguished.</p>

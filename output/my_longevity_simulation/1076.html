        <h1>Chapter 1076</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan himself is only at the Nascent Soul realm now. </p><p></p><p>However, since the beginning of his development and advancement in the Lingmu Realm, he has been constantly using [Array Refinement] to deepen his control over this small world.</p><p></p><p>Now, after accepting and integrating other small worlds such as the Empire, the Lingmu Realm is not much smaller than the ancient [Immortal Cultivation Realm] in the general sense.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, this "Nascent Soul cultivator", still firmly grasps the control of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>For him, it's like a refined magic treasure, the birth and death of the world is just a matter of a single thought.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, with this ability to absolutely control the world, he is indeed a true [Lingmu Realm Venerable].</p><p></p><p>In comparison, it's easy to understand what kind of existence the [Xuanhuang Great Venerable] is.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Li Fan took advantage of the situation and gained control when the world was still weak.</p><p></p><p>As for Xuanhuang Great Venerable...</p><p></p><p>"The will is the same as the heavens." Li Fan instantly thought of Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>In the Fallen Immortal Realm, the scene of Tianjian Sect forging swords.</p><p></p><p>After Mr. Bai revealed his true strength in Tianjian Sect, the eldest senior brother of Tianjian Sect exclaimed in shock: "You are..."</p><p></p><p>Then his attitude was very respectful. He no longer had any hostility towards Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao, as the strongest in Tianjian Sect, is also an existence in the Eternal Life realm.</p><p></p><p>To be able to show such respect, in addition to strength, identity is probably an even more important factor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, almost all the scenes Li Fan experienced in the Fallen Immortal Realm were vaguely related to Mr. Bai. It seemed like some kind of guidance.</p><p></p><p>It made him not dare to explore the Fallen Immortal Realm much now.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Bai has nothing to do with that Fallen Immortal, Li Fan would be the first to not believe it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was pondering, the Dharma transmitter Zhou continued to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Venerable is different from ordinary Eternal Life Venerables."</p><p></p><p>"There can be many Ancient Dao Eternal Life beings. But there can only be one Xuanhuang Venerable in the world at most."</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Dao Eternal Life steals the authority of eternal life between heaven and earth. Xuanhuang Venerable has all the authority of the Heavenly Dao bestowed upon him. The difference is so great that it cannot be measured in miles."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the previous records of the Immortal Alliance mentioned that the operation of the Heavenly Dao in Xuanhuang Realm has traces of [Personification]. For example, the souls of heaven and earth are all in human form. For example, the Heavenly Dao will also show emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow and happiness, which can be seen from the anomalies after the fall of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"This is actually the influence of [Xuanhuang Great Venerable] on the operation of the Heavenly Dao in Xuanhuang Realm. Even if Xuanhuang Venerable is no longer present, this influence has continued."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan instantly thought of the Heavenly Dao Spirit that he "revived" by chance.</p><p></p><p>As well as the divine ability he recently comprehended, Deceiving the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The heart of heaven, the will of man. The principle of heaven and man..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was pensive.</p><p></p><p>But his thoughts were quickly interrupted by what Zhou said next.</p><p></p><p>"At most, it's just that the cultivator has received the gift of heaven and mastered some authority of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Realm is very special..."</p><p></p><p>"And from the deduction results of Tianxuan Mirror this time, it can be seen that this special mode of operation of the Heavenly Dao may originate from the first Xuanhuang Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"His impact on Xuan..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm has undergone some transformations."</p><p></p><p>"It's even possible that the entire Xuanhuang Realm was created by this Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that the first Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate mentioned by the Dharma Transmitter Zhou might be the Mysterious Heavenly King.</p><p></p><p>However, it was possible to create the entire Xuanhuang Realm...</p><p></p><p>This was obviously not something the Mysterious Heavenly King could do.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately asked, "Creating the Xuanhuang? What does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>"The entire Xuanhuang Realm is like a perfect creation. Although it has absorbed other worlds over thousands of years, its core remains the original Xuanhuang Realm from many years ago. The reason why the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror was damaged to its origin is because it wanted to deduce the location of the 'Heart of Xuanhuang' that dominates the entire world."</p><p></p><p>"There, perhaps, lies the method to inherit the role of the 'Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate'!" Dharma Transmitter Zhou whispered.</p><p></p><p>"This is something that even the ancient Dharma Heavenly Venerates could not accomplish. If this Dharma King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect manages to do it..."</p><p></p><p>"The consequences would be unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sorted out his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Based on the clues currently available, the Xuanhuang Realm might have been a creation of a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>This powerful being did not take the Xuanhuang Realm with them after ascending.</p><p></p><p>They only left behind a method called "Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate" that could completely control the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Heavenly King and Mr. White.</p><p></p><p>They should have both been Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerates before.</p><p></p><p>From this, it seems that to become a great Heavenly Venerate who controls a realm, one must meet certain conditions and pass the selection of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>After the fall of Mr. White, the position of Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate has been vacant.</p><p></p><p>However, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao still maintains the operation of the world according to the methods left behind by the former Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerates.</p><p></p><p>For example, Li Fan once used the "Devouring Heaven and Earth Great Technique" to devour the earth veins and frantically increase his cultivation. As a result, he broke through the shackles of the Heavenly Tribulation bottleneck but was suppressed by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Palm. This is a sign of the Heavenly Dao operating on its own according to existing rules.</p><p></p><p>And now, Mo Rubin is using the powerful computing power of the Heavenly Mysterious Realm to analyze the entire Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>He is trying to find the so-called "Heart of Xuanhuang" and become the next "Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate".</p><p></p><p>"After becoming the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate, one might be able to inherit the memories of the previous Heavenly Venerates. Then one would be able to figure out what exactly happened to the Mysterious Heavenly King back then..." At this point, Li Fan had already understood Mo Rubin's motive for going to such great lengths.</p><p></p><p>"So where exactly is this Heart of Xuanhuang?" Li Fan asked immediately.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou pointed his finger at the sky.</p><p></p><p>And then he pointed all around.</p><p></p><p>"It's right here. Or rather, it's everywhere."</p><p></p><p>"As long as certain specific conditions are met, one should be able to enter the Heart of Xuanhuang and participate in a certain process of trials."</p><p></p><p>"If one can successfully pass, after coming out, one can transform into the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate." Dharma Transmitter Zhou shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly noticed a key point and asked, "After the Dharma Heavenly Venerate created the new law, achieving immortality requires reversing the principles of heaven and earth. Then this Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloom flashed in Dharma Transmitter Zhou's eyes: "This is what we are most worried about. Theoretically speaking, due to the influence of the Heavenly Venerate's new law, the process of succeeding the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate will fail."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"We can't rule out the possibility that becoming the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate can directly bypass the rules set by the Heavenly Venerate."</p>

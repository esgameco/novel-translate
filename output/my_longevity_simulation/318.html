        <h1>Chapter 318</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, on Li Fan's bare body, a layer of fine hair began to grow. It seemed that he would be able to fly on his own soon. This trip to the Fallen Immortal Realm seemed particularly peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Staying by Xu Ke's side all day, there were no crises, nor did they encounter any opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Just when Li Fan had less than three days left in the Fallen Immortal Realm, a sudden change occurred.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a loud beast tamer's chant resounded throughout the territory of the Beast Taming Sect. Azure light illuminated the world, and the sky above instantly changed with wind and clouds.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up and saw a huge dragon claw hidden in the clouds, blocking out the sun.</p><p></p><p>Although the dragon claw was high in the sky and Li Fan was not its direct target, just the pressure it emitted unintentionally made the young Li Fan tremble involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>It was the pressure of absolute power, making him unable to even think of resisting. It seemed that facing some enemy, the dragon claw fiercely grabbed at the void in front.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stopped abruptly, watching this seemingly world-destroying strike. However... nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>As if encountering an absolute obstruction, the dragon claw was stuck in place, unable to advance or retreat. "Is this how the Beast Taming Sect treats its guests?" After a moment, a very pleasant voice spoke up.</p><p></p><p>As the voice echoed through the world, gentle and weak, as a spirit beast companion, Li Fan keenly sensed Xu Ke's body slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>Not out of fear, but excitement and confusion. "Mr. Bai?" His eyes were a bit dazed, as if in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>As if responding to his words, Mr. Bai's gentle voice sounded again, "The dragon claw is not bad. I'll take it back to nourish the children."</p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking, a beam of light suppressed the azure light filling the sky.</p><p></p><p>Miserable dragon howls echoed as that huge, seemingly invincible dragon claw was directly severed and disappeared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, a figure could be seen standing in front of where the dragon claw was. The severed claw seemed to provoke the anger of the Beast Taming Sect. In an instant, the sky darkened.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying beasts - the flame-bodied Vermilion Bird, the winged Yellow Dragon, the two-winged White Tiger, the two-horned Qilin, the long-fanged Fierce Hound... emerged in the sky one after another, surrounding that somewhat frail figure, raging with ferocious flames.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in the next moment, they would pounce and attack, tearing this provocateur to shreds.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mr. Bai spoke again, "Are you also here to bring gifts for the children?" The world suddenly fell silent. The expressions on the faces of the originally fierce beasts all froze.</p><p></p><p>In front of one man, the ferocious beasts fell into a strange stillness. "If you don't answer, then it's tacit agreement?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems I was wrong before. The Beast Taming Sect is indeed very hospitable." Mr. Bai looked at the two-winged White Tiger, "The wings are not bad. Eating them should make one run faster."</p><p></p><p>Because Mr. Bai said so, the White Tiger's wings were broken. Mr. Bai looked at the two-horned Qilin again, "The horns are not bad. Ground into powder, they can treat injuries."</p><p></p><p>Because Mr. Bai said so, the Qilin lost its horns.</p><p></p><p>The beasts in the sky had no power to resist Mr. Bai in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding what happened, certain organs on their bodies were cut off and taken as gifts for the children. Terror instantly filled the hearts of the beasts in the sky. No longer invincible, they all fled in horror and despair.</p><p></p><p>But they could not escape Mr. Bai's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Wherever his eyes reached, with his unhurried words, one or two beasts would become mutilated.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Taming Sect disciples below who witnessed this scene all fell into unspeakable shock.</p><p></p><p>The sect elders had earnestly taught that the Vermilion Bird, Qilin, Black Tortoise, Phoenix - those spirit beasts were so powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, what did they see now?</p><p></p><p>These majestic spirit beasts, the foundation of the Beast Taming Sect, were all like chickens and dogs, slaughtered at will.</p><p></p><p>Who exactly was that figure? What was his cultivation level? And why did he do this?</p><p></p><p>Countless questions swirled in the minds of all the Beast Taming Sect disciples. And among everyone, Xu Ke was the most shaken. His eyes were at a loss, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>"That... shouldn't be Mr. Bai, right?"</p><p></p><p>"When I left the small temple before, he was clearly just a mortal." "He told me in person..." Li Fan's reaction was not much better.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the beasts millions of times stronger than himself being slaughtered so easily, this body could not suppress its instinctive fear, spreading and surrounding his heart.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's consciousness could only strive to gain control of the body, barely looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at that somewhat thin figure.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Ke was plunged into the greatest self-doubt of his life, a voice sounded, shattering his luck into dust.</p><p></p><p>"Stop, Mr. Bai." "I know you're here for me." Lu Ya in blue robes appeared in front of the frail figure.</p><p></p><p>And that figure indeed stopped moving, allowing the beasts in the sky to flee in panic without making another move. "Lu Ya, long time no see." Mr. Bai said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really... Mr. Bai?" As if unable to accept this fact, Xu Ke's legs went soft and he fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then an even bigger question couldn't help but surge in his heart, "Why did Mr. Bai do this?"</p><p></p><p>In Xu Ke's eyes, although Mr. Bai was the greatest good person in the world, the masters, uncles, and brothers of the Beast Taming Sect also treated Xu Ke very well. "Why?" Xu Ke fell into deep confusion.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Mr. Bai and Lu Ya seemed to be saying something. Then the two disappeared together. And below, the Beast Taming Sect gradually began to fall into chaos.</p><p></p><p>In that instant just now, the authority that the sect elders had painstakingly established was shattered. Some felt that the Beast Taming Sect was all in name and had no future.</p><p></p><p>Evil thoughts arose in their hearts, deciding to ransack the place and escape in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>Some were completely scared out of their wits, hiding in secret rooms, refusing to come out.</p><p></p><p>And those loyal disciples of the Beast Taming Sect felt that the path they had pursued all their lives had been trampled upon so easily.</p><p></p><p>In utter despair, they took their own lives.</p><p></p><p>Amidst this chaos, Li Fan suddenly sensed a crisis descending.</p>

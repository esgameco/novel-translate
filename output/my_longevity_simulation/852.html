        <h1>Chapter 852</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"There was no opportunity to take advantage of this rare chance to gild the disciples of the family."</p><p></p><p>"Could it really be treating everyone equally and fairly?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>However, based on his understanding of the Wanxian Alliance, things might not be that simple.</p><p></p><p>"Let's think from another perspective."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps these so-called thirty-three Immortal Candidates are not a good thing. That's why these family members deliberately avoided it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>This guess happened to coincide with his premonition about the ending of Wei Qizheng.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-three people in harmony, if the Eternal Heavenly Venerable doesn't appear, it can definitely be considered a force that can influence the war situation."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly does the Wanxian Alliance want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but become interested.</p><p></p><p>Based on the information currently available, the Dharma Transmission may have temporarily left the Xuanhuang Realm for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Only a Dao spirit was left behind.</p><p></p><p>Only if [Chaos] occurs, or something like the destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm, will it rush back.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Society appear evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>In fact, without the restraint of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable, facing the Five Elders Society with five Eternal Realm experts, they are at an absolute disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Just like how the 114th generation tried to create the Profound Net to counter the Eternal Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"The thirty-three Immortal Candidates of this generation must also be related to [creating a force that can contend with the Eternal Realm]." A flash of enlightenment passed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Both sides have made their moves, let's see how this game of chess will be played!"</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Five Elders Society had also tried to make contact.</p><p></p><p>But they were all ignored by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The resources obtained from the Five Elders Society were temporarily sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to first observe the development and trend of the situation before making the next plan.</p><p></p><p>He firmly memorized the information of more than three hundred cultivators on the list in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan crushed it to pieces, and his mind once again enveloped the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had successfully advanced to Golden Core Perfection.</p><p></p><p>The process of devouring the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven officially began.</p><p></p><p>The tentacles formed from the roots of heaven and earth spread to each elemental grotto-heaven through the gaps between the grotto-heavens, and temporarily lurked there.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven was too vast. Only by first accumulating strength and cultivating enough rootlets of the roots of heaven and earth could it be devoured in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>The only fortunate thing was that this Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven had not yet given birth to an existence similar to the Dao consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Even the instinctive resistance mechanism was very weak.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan's invasion was exceptionally smooth.</p><p></p><p>In the distinct five-attribute grotto-heavens, the dense rootlets spread out like apocalyptic dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>The more than one million contribution points that Disciple Ji Shaoli threw out were indeed not spent in vain.</p><p></p><p>When the final appointment was announced, a joyful atmosphere once again permeated Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun Province, Formation Strategy Hall."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's heart was even more excited and indescribable, with countless thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although he was only an on-duty formation master with the lowest position, Tianyun Province was located in the central hinterland of the Immortal Alliance. Whether in terms of treatment or prospects, it could not be compared with the garrison of Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Joining the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association that day was truly the most correct decision I have made in my life."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's just a small step, I have finally taken it! One day, I will return to Tianyu Province in glory!"</p><p></p><p>"Ruoshui..."</p><p></p><p>Just as He Zhenghao's heart was surging, Ji Shaoli's figure appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He appeared before the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Ji Shaoli must have put in a lot of effort in assigning the positions, the crowd hurriedly bowed to express their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, we are all one family, no need to be polite." Ji Shaoli waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, he changed the topic: "Since all of you will be leaving Congyun Sea next."</p><p></p><p>"Then there are some situations that I don't need to hide anymore."</p><p></p><p>The crowd felt a chill in their hearts, knowing that the mysterious mutual aid society was about to unveil its secrets, and they listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>"The Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Society is just a small branch of the Xuanhuang Mutual Aid Society in the Congyun Sea area."</p><p></p><p>"Our mutual aid society's influence extends to all parts of the Xuanhuang realm. So even if you go elsewhere, you don't have to worry about not having an organization."</p><p></p><p>The crowd had long expected this.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could a small regional organization be able to know the exam questions in advance?</p><p></p><p>"However, it needs to be explained that the mutual aid societies in each state still have a bit of a competitive relationship. And you all joined through me. So, within ten years, your identity in the organization still belongs to the Congyun Sea branch."</p><p></p><p>"For this reason, the people in charge of other regions will not contact you for the time being. Until the expiration, I will still be responsible for interfacing with you."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit troublesome, it's necessary to prevent vicious competition." Ji Shaoli slowly explained.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd did not show any abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Only a Golden Core cultivator named Yu Hongjian couldn't help but ask, "Fellow Daoist Ji, what exactly was the original intention of establishing this mutual aid society?"</p><p></p><p>"It can't really be just for mutual assistance, right?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the same doubts surged in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Since joining the society, we have always received help from the organization, but there has never been a place where we contributed..."</p><p></p><p>"It really makes one feel uneasy." Yu Hongjian said weakly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled slightly: "Rest assured. Your strength is still too weak now, just focus on cultivating diligently."</p><p></p><p>"There will always be a day when the organization needs you."</p><p></p><p>Even though Ji Shaoli only had Golden Core cultivation, no one present objected to him saying "your strength is too weak".</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone present had seen cultivators who were vaguely at the Harmonious Dao realm strength being respectful before Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Ji Shaoli was not as simple as he appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, although Ji Shaoli's words seemed to appease everyone,</p><p></p><p>it actually made them feel more unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that there was no free lunch in the world.</p><p></p><p>The help the mutual aid society gave them was almost like a second life.</p><p></p><p>Although now, there were no tasks assigned.</p><p></p><p>But if one day, the mutual aid society needed their "help"...</p><p></p><p>The crowd glanced at each other imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>But now that things had come to this, there was no turning back.</p><p></p><p>The crowd deeply suppressed the uneasiness in their hearts, not daring to reveal a bit.</p><p></p><p>They only discussed and studied the possible inspections they might encounter when taking office.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Within ten days, the five people bid farewell one after another and left for their respective states to take up their posts.</p><p></p><p>For a while, Seaè»’ Island became a bit desolate.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli looked at a piece of news and showed a somewhat surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong, whom he had been paying attention to, had unexpectedly broken through for some unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Last month's total monthly votes were 19163, as promised, an additional 1000 words.</p><p></p><p>The additional chapters are added to 7000, short of 12 chapters.</p><p></p><p>The debt will be repaid starting tomorrow.</p>

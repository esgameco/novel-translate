        <h1>Chapter 623</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"This is a great opportunity to witness the true talents of both sides and see what level they are at," Li Fan was extremely interested in this.</p><p></p><p>To facilitate all the cultivators to watch, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance specially created a type of mirror artifact.</p><p></p><p>It was inexpensive, costing only one hundred contributions to purchase.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators could watch the scenes of the exchange conference through it anytime and anywhere.</p><p></p><p>They could even replay the scenes of the competition between the two sides. More importantly, the mirror would provide real-time commentary synced with the Heavenly Profound Mirror to prevent lower realm cultivators from being confused while watching.</p><p></p><p>Once the "Heavenly Spirit Gazing Mirror" was released, it sparked a frenzy among the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Apart from its cheap price, cultivators did not want to miss out on this rare event factor. Some cultivators also wanted to collect it.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the older cultivators, during the first friendly exchange conference, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance had also introduced such a viewing mirror.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it didn't attract much attention because in the Heavenly Profound Mirror, information about the exchange conference could be easily searched for.</p><p></p><p>So only the wealthier cultivators made purchases.</p><p></p><p>But no one expected that after the competition ended, this viewing mirror would become a rare item. Its own value was not the main point, but the scenes of the competition it recorded.</p><p></p><p>In the first exchange conference, the representatives of both sides later became prominent figures in their respective organizations. Almost all of them became powerful experts in the Harmonious Unity Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was their frank discussions or battles, for lower realm cultivators, observing and speculating repeatedly was greatly beneficial.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, some thoughtful individuals would gift the viewing mirrors containing images of the victories of the talents to the parties involved to win their favor.</p><p></p><p>In addition, over the years, due to the fall of cultivators, the number of remaining viewing mirrors in the world was continuously decreasing. By now, they were extremely difficult to find.</p><p></p><p>Having learned from past experiences, it was no wonder that this time's "Heavenly Spirit Gazing Mirror" was so popular.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan bought one for a hundred contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving it, Li Fan found that the craftsmanship of the viewing mirror was quite rough.</p><p></p><p>Not to compare it with the Heavenly Profound Small Mirror, even an ordinary copper mirror was far superior. It was basically a piece of rock polished into shape.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be outsourced again?"</p><p></p><p>"Selling it for a hundred contribution points, who knows the actual cost. Although the unit price is not high, but the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance has many cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>"Not sure who's benefiting from this."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan mused silently and put it away.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the vigorous discussions among the cultivators on the island regarding the exchange conference, he quietly returned to his non-human form on the island.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, Liu San and the others had been working tirelessly and had already used up all the raw materials they had prepared. They successfully refined twenty-eight Longevity Pills, with their quality fluctuating within two hundred years of extended lifespan.</p><p></p><p>When Liu San handed over the pills, he looked apologetic, "I have disappointed the young master. Perhaps due to the effect of incompatible techniques, the essence level of my Longevity Pills is much lower than expected, even after refining using the ninety-nine small Medicine King Cauldrons."</p><p></p><p>"To think that only this kind of quality could be produced..."</p><p></p><p>"If the old sect master were still alive, I cannot imagine what he would say to me." Liu San sounded somewhat melancholic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan comforted him, "Liu Lao, there is no need to blame yourself. Changes in the world cannot be resisted without longevity. Besides, I also checked the market. These Longevity Pills are sufficient for now. Releasing a too high-quality product at once might not be beneficial."</p><p></p><p>Saying so, Li Fan handed over a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"I have some news about the whereabouts of the Longevity Valley. Perhaps it lies within the several locations marked on the map."</p><p></p><p>"Although they are within the White Mist Barrier, the ring contains a treasure named Puxian True Boat. By controlling this boat, you should be able to counteract the effects of the White Mist Erosion."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San showed a hint of joy.</p><p></p><p>"The environment inside the Longevity Valley is unique and slightly different from the outside world. If we can refine pills within it, perhaps the quality will be even higher."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "In that case, I'll leave this matter to you, Lao Liu. With the ongoing friendly exchange conference outside, the attention of the whole world will be captivated. It's a perfect time for you to make a trip."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, safety comes first. The revival of our Medicine King Sect cannot proceed without you!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's sincere instructions, Liu San was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>"I will not disappoint the young master's trust."</p><p></p><p>With that, after familiarizing himself with the Puxian True Boat, he transformed into a streak of light and headed towards the target locations marked on the map.</p><p></p><p>"I hope his journey goes smoothly and he can find the Longevity Valley."</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in this Cloud Sea any longer."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arrived in the airspace above his non-human form island and looked up at the sky. He narrowed his eyes, sensing a faint murderous intent gradually forming between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The murderous intent of heaven and earth blended into all things imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not directly related to one's realm but more to the individual's specific understanding, Li Fan, who carried the inexhaustible killing intent, was sensitive to it and could use it at will under "Heaven's Will."</p><p></p><p>"The killing intent of this life is approaching ominously. It seems much stronger than in previous lives."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the Heaven's Healers have collectively reincarnated?"</p><p></p><p>Taking Tianyang alone to a secluded chamber on the island, Li Fan said, "Junior brother, there's an opportunity for you to advance to the Harmonious Unity Realm now, do you want it?"</p><p></p><p>Initially puzzled, Tianyang tilted his head, unable to fully grasp Li Fan's intentions.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Li Fan repeated himself that Tianyang positioned himself properly. Even the puppet's body displayed a hint of solemnity on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You know, in this world, crises and opportunities always coexist."</p><p></p><p>"The chances of success are slim. But it is very dangerous; you could potentially face death."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face softened, patiently asking without much hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Intermittently, a mechanical sound emerged from Tianyang, "Tianyang's life."</p><p></p><p>"Not inferior to others!"</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan already knew Tianyang's answer, hearing him say it in person still moved him.</p><p></p><p>"Good! In that case, elder brother will do everything to assist you!" Li Fan said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the "Heaven and Earth Yin-Yang Dice" appeared in his hand. After a quick spin, Li Fan had a faint feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in about a year or so..."</p><p></p><p>"It will be enough."</p><p></p><p>Taking Tianyang with him, they went deep into the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out one heavenly material and treasure after another from his personal paradise.</p><p></p><p>He was going to further strengthen Tianyang's body.</p><p></p><p>At all costs.</p><p></p><p>Among them were even some Eternal Essence Gold that could still endure in the "Five Elements Reunion."</p><p></p><p>"I want to see if the ink of death can truly erase everything!"</p>

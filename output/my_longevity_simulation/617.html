            <p>This is naturally the reward given to Gao Yuan - completing one cultivator with one thousand contribution points. Although not much, it definitely cannot be said to be lacking.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's just a matter of a few actions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, both sides know that this is just the beginning. There are bigger things to come.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan didn't make a fuss and accepted the contribution points on the spot. He also promised proactively, "If there are any more ancient cultivators needing to join the alliance in the future, just come find me. I will handle the relevant procedures properly without any mistakes."</p><p></p><p>"However, to prevent being noticed, it's better to come in batches at intervals," Gao Yuan said tactfully.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang cupped his hands, "It's considerate of Friend Gao to think so thoroughly. From now on, I will often trouble you."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan's heart slightly jumped, and he lowered his voice, "Friend, could you give me an idea? How many ancient cultivators are there in this secret realm?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang smiled but did not answer, only making a gesture of "four" and then led the disciples of the Medicine King Sect away.</p><p></p><p>"Four hundred? It seems that the scale of this secret realm is not small. No wonder Zhou Qing'ang's friend wants to monopolize..." Gao Yuan was somewhat surprised inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Having managed the political affairs of the Misty Cloud Sea for several years, Gao Yuan's vision was considered decent now.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, he absolutely wouldn't dare to think that the "four" gesture Zhou Qing'ang made didn't represent four hundred.</p><p></p><p>It was actually four thousand.</p><p></p><p>Instead of bringing the thirty Medicine King Sect disciples who had already acquired the Wuxian Alliance status into the Tianxuan Mirror space, he led them to a central residential area in the Misty Cloud Immortal City, to a cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>In one of the rooms in the cave mansion, more than fifty Tianxuan Small Mirrors were neatly arranged.</p><p></p><p>"Each of you should familiarize yourselves with the basic operations of the Tianxuan Small Mirror first."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang demonstrated once for everyone and then instructed.</p><p></p><p>Although the Tianxuan Mirror was extremely mysterious, the disciples of the Medicine King Sect were quite knowledgeable. After a moment of amazement, they quickly got the hang of it.</p><p></p><p>"Each of you now only has one thousand contribution points as the entry reward. But it's okay, pay attention to the missions that will be announced in the Tianxuan Mirror next."</p><p></p><p>As Zhou Qing'ang spoke, he waved his sleeve, and a light screen appeared in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>The missions displayed on the light screen were quite strange requirements but with generous rewards.</p><p></p><p>For example, inquiring about the life anecdotes of a cultivator from an ancient sect thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Or someone having difficulties with a certain cultivation technique, hoping for guidance from a knowledgeable person.</p><p></p><p>Or someone admiring a female cultivator but unable to make any progress. So, offering a high reward for possible solutions.</p><p></p><p>Various, peculiar missions.</p><p></p><p>"These are the standard answers. You just need to copy them when the missions are announced."</p><p></p><p>"Allocate among yourselves, each person can only complete up to two missions, avoid conflict and repetition."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang displayed another light screen, marking the peculiar mission answers.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect cultivators present were not dull people. They quickly understood what they were supposed to do and looked excited.</p><p></p><p>After a brief discussion, they each chose their targets.</p><p></p><p>They anxiously stared at the Tianxuan Small Mirror in front of them, waiting for the missions to be announced.</p><p></p><p>Soon, as mechanical voices sounded from the Tianxuan Small Mirror, all the Medicine King Sect cultivators received their first rewards.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang nodded in satisfaction and then waved his hand, and a pile of items appeared in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"While waiting for the missions to refresh, exchange these items in the Tianxuan Mirror for contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"Don't take too much, keep it under three thousand each."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang said in a deep tone.</p><p></p><p>Everyone followed suit.</p><p></p><p>After completing this, Zhou Qing'ang then had them open a section in the Tianxuan Mirror called "Fa Yan Tian Xia."</p><p></p><p>It seemed quite lively inside, with different information constantly popping up.</p><p></p><p>"Placing bets, placing bets! Where will the Five Elders Meeting and the Wuxian Alliance's Friendship Exchange Meeting be held!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I guessed it right! The Old Fisherman actually appeared in the Taihua State this time! Who would have thought he would suddenly run so far!"</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate bet, how long will the peace meeting between the Five Elders and our alliance last. Let's play big!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The disciples were left dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Similar to how they answered according to the standard answers previously, this time they also placed bets based on predetermined outcomes.</p><p></p><p>There were wins and losses, but overall, they lost little and won more.</p><p></p><p>As the contribution points on the Medicine King Sect disciples gradually accumulated, Zhou Qing'ang called a stop.</p><p></p><p>"Choose the cultivation techniques you want to practice, just at the Golden Dan Realm. Continue tomorrow," he said.</p><p></p><p>Facing the dazzling list of cultivation techniques, the disciples were all fascinated and immersed in them.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, "Zhou Qing'ang" was secretly calculating.</p><p></p><p>"Altogether, it cost four hundred thousand contribution points. Each disciple received about ten thousand today, effectively washing away three hundred thousand contribution points."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this secret room and the missions and bets in the Tianxuan Mirror were all efficient ways to earn contribution points.</p><p></p><p>For professional matters, professionals should be in charge.</p><p></p><p>Even if it cost a bit more in contribution points, Li Fan could completely afford it.</p><p></p><p>And this group of people didn't disappoint Li Fan. They were quite professional. The methods of acquiring contribution points were diverse and highly secretive.</p><p></p><p>Take the Tianxuan Small Mirrors in this secret room for example, they seemed to be in one place, but in reality, they were distributed across various locations in the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This secret room merely provided an interface. There was no need to worry about exposing themselves due to similar behavior in acquiring contribution points in one location.</p><p></p><p>The process of earning contribution points was highly efficient.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the first batch of Medicine King Sect disciples had all accumulated the required contribution points.</p><p></p><p>They joyfully exchanged for cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang led them back to the Island of Smelting Transformation.</p><p></p><p>And there, the next batch of Medicine King Sect cultivators was already prepared to depart.</p><p></p><p>As an official of the Wuxian Alliance, Zhou Qing'ang was too conspicuous and at risk of exposure.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this time, the one leading the group was the first lucky one to awaken, Xia Ye.</p><p></p><p>Although he appeared a bit nervous, he did not lose his composure. Moreover, having already informed Gao Yuan in advance, there were no issues.</p><p></p><p>Soon, everything proceeded as planned. The second and third batches of ancient Medicine King Sect cultivators successfully completed the transition and became members of the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>When Liusan, full of frustration, hurried back and saw the scene of the disciples of the Medicine King Cauldron exuding new vitality, he was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He was then asked by Li Fan, "Liusan, how did it go?"</p><p></p><p>Liusan blushed and was about to respond, but after seeing the disciples around discussing with each other, he finally pulled Li Fan aside and transmitted, "I am ashamed to have failed to live up to the young master's trust. Although I had already looked at the map, when actually exploring, I realized what a huge change in the landscape it was."</p><p></p><p>Liusan sighed, "I can't find a trace of the scenes from my memory at all. It's as if it's two completely different worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the joint practitioners here are much more sensitive than we were back then. I tried my best to hide my aura, but I was still discovered."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan squinted.</p><p></p><p>"Thankfully, he thought I was a member of the Five Elders Meeting, just advised me not to run around due to the upcoming 'Friendship Exchange Meeting,' to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. Hmph..."</p><p></p><p>Liusan snorted, showing some displeasure.</p><p></p><p>But after a moment, he still felt somewhat helpless, "I can sense that the other party is also at the middle stage of the Harmony Realm. But if a fight really broke out, I'm afraid I wouldn't be his match."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan comforted him, "The new method is omnipotent, with personal sites, laws; when it comes to fighting with techniques, naturally, it has more advantages than our ancient cultivators. Liusan, don't worry. If you can switch to the new method, your combat power won't be weaker than others."</p><p></p><p>This talk made Liusan's expression slightly eased.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan added, "Now that the practitioners required to refine the Elixir of Longevity have gathered, it's up to you, Liusan, to take charge."</p><p></p><p>"The contribution points used by the disciples to exchange for cultivation techniques are all debts owed by me and Friend Zhou. We urgently need to sell a batch of Longevity Pills to repay them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liusan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then, he furrowed his brows slightly and said, "Currently, I am the only one in the sect practicing the 'Longevity Enlightenment Art.' The longevity vitality is limited, so I'm afraid the quality of the pills I refine won't be very good."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Liusan furrowed his brows, "I estimate they will be at most of middling quality, extending lifespan by two to three hundred years at most..."</p><p></p><p>"It's enough. Liusan, begin." Li Fan said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 445</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The sky darkened, and a piece of paper covered with golden characters suddenly appeared in the sky above the island.</p><p></p><p>It covered the sky, as if the next moment would bring down the oppression on all the people in the empire.</p><p></p><p>Qing's expression changed, and two green lights soared into the sky like sharp blades.</p><p></p><p>They collided with the huge piece of paper.</p><p></p><p>The golden paper was torn apart, revealing the sky once again.</p><p></p><p>However, the golden characters on the paper did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they fluttered down towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>From Qing's body, a series of light blades emerged, dissolving the characters one by one.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that the two were fighting very restrainedly.</p><p></p><p>The anomalies they caused were limited to the surroundings of the island, and even observers like Li Fan and Li Chenfeng were unaffected.</p><p></p><p>After a while, when Qing completely suppressed the golden symbol of the Divine Oracle, she suppressed her anger and was about to question the other party's intentions.</p><p></p><p>However, she found that the mysterious person who had used the golden symbol said something to Li Fan before leaving on his own.</p><p></p><p>Qing narrowed her eyes but did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>Watching Li Fan approach boldly.</p><p></p><p>"What does the Wan Jie Alliance mean?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qing asked with a cold tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shrugged, "We mean no harm. However, since we are to cooperate, naturally we need to see your strength and whether it is worth it."</p><p></p><p>"Luckily, you have managed to gain recognition from above.

Qing's tone softened.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw a storage ring over, Qing took the ring and checked it, surprised by its contents.</p><p></p><p>Inside were various materials needed by the empire.</p><p></p><p>Qingjing Crystal, Wanhua Jade Silk, and Tongbi Xuanshen...</p><p></p><p>Although the quantity was a bit less, it was rare to have every type included.</p><p></p><p>Having left the Mysterious Yellow Realm for thousands of years, Qing did not know the current prices of these items.</p><p></p><p>But she also knew that the value of the materials in the storage ring was definitely not low.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Qing's expression gradually softened.</p><p></p><p>"These are the first batch of materials."</p><p></p><p>"The quantity you need is too much. To avoid attracting the attention of the factions in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, we are gradually purchasing them in batches."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qing found it reasonable and nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, we are also looking for a base for the future branch of the empire. New 69 Book → 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"Both safety and secrecy must be absolutely guaranteed. It's not easy to find in the current Mysterious Yellow Realm, so we still need to wait for some time."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, the current best app for listening to audiobooks is, install the latest version."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued.</p><p></p><p>"To eliminate your doubts and show the sincerity of the organization. These materials are provided free of charge to the empire."</p><p></p><p>"After about a year, when the next batch of materials is purchased, I will come again."</p><p></p><p>"However, at that time, the Wan Jie Alliance hopes to see the attitude of the empire."</p><p></p><p>"Then we can discuss the next steps of cooperation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan bowed, didn't wait for Qing's response, and left directly.</p><p></p><p>"Saint..."</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng looked at Qing, hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>Qing furrowed her brows, carefully examined the storage ring, found nothing suspicious, and carefully put it away.</p><p></p><p>"What he said makes sense; we can gradually start the cooperation. Exchange those less important techniques with them first."</p><p></p><p>"Once anything goes wrong, we can cut losses in time."</p><p></p><p>Qing said to Li Chenfeng and the others.</p><p></p><p>"I need to go back and discuss with the Empress and Hong. There's something I haven't said, for some reason, I feel that the envoy from this Alliance is somewhat mysterious."</p><p></p><p>It seemed far more complicated than it appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Wan Xian Island.</p><p></p><p>After expressing gratitude to the Divine Oracle once again, Li Fan followed his usual routine and searched for information in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The results of the entrance examination were being gradually announced, causing joy and sorrow among the candidates.</p><p></p><p>There were still controversies about the admission status for some positions, but they quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the southwest sea area of Congyunhai, a storm devastated over ten mortal islands.</p><p></p><p>The price of the special product, Bixuan Lu, experienced a slight fluctuation. Li Fan bought low and sold high, making a small profit.</p><p></p><p>The Taixu Mountain Range, one of the ten veins of the Taihua Mountain in Taihua State, suddenly collapsed for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan swept over this piece of information, his gaze slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Ten veins of the Taihua Mountain? I recall, in my past lives, I only saw the nine veins of Taihua."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this time the casualties are quite severe."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, but did not delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>He recorded the key points and continued to browse other news.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Li Fan separately searched for the recent situation of "Yufulaoren," "Wuchi'er," "Zhongshentong," "Shuofeng," and others.</p><p></p><p>Yufulaoren was still wandering around the Central Four States near the Wanxian League.</p><p></p><p>Wuchi'er and Zhongshentong had not gained much fame.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng had not started rebuilding yet and remained a renowned Godly Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Based on his experience from the previous life, Li Fan speculated on the possible time of their adventures.</p><p></p><p>A month later, Li Fan woke up from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that the time was about right, he directly transferred half a million contribution points to He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>"This time, luck was good; I quickly sensed an opportunity and achieved the goal early."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, came the ecstatic voice of He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>"Senior's divination is truly incredible!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the backlash of the sect's secret technique is still inevitable. The next recruitment will still be at the time previously set. Go and explain it to them."</p><p></p><p>After instructing him, Li Fan ignored He Zhenghao and swallowed another Enlightenment Pill before entering seclusion again.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was the ninth year.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Fan's initial layout began to show results.</p><p></p><p>More than twenty subtle increases in cultivation emerged in his Dantian, due to various feedbacks.</p><p></p><p>Combined with nearly a year of inspiration and cultivation under the influence of the Enlightenment and Dao Pills.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the peak of the Golden Pill Intermediate Stage, Li Fan was only troubled by the bottleneck of the "Heaven's Calamity" for just over ten days.</p><p></p><p>He successfully advanced to the later stage of the Golden Pill.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan exhaled slowly, easing his cultivation for now.</p><p></p><p>"Next, whether to intimidate the people of the empire or explore the void of the Tianlingzhou, acting alone may be inadequate."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I should seek some assistance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and quietly left Wan Xian Island, heading straight for the Tianyang Cave.</p>

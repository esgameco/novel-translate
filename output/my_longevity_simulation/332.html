        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan deliberately crafted his clone to be eight feet tall, with sword-like eyebrows, starry eyes, fair skin, and unparalleled handsomeness.</p><p></p><p>"The more eye-catching, the better. Go and obtain the Extreme Immortal's bounty, then bring everyone's attention and head to the Source Dao State."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if that monster lurking in the sky above the Source Dao State is truly undetectable by anyone."</p><p></p><p>The clone Xiao Fan smiled and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a streak of blue light, he left the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he stayed in place for over a month, until the time reached the 29th year of the anchor point, before he leisurely returned to the Tianyu State.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the clone was only doing one thing - obtaining a legal identity in the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating to the Golden Core realm, joining the Alliance was no longer as simple as finding someone to recommend you like before.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivation is arduous. For a rogue cultivator to reach the Foundation Establishment stage is already extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Rogue cultivators at the Golden Core stage are truly rare.</p><p></p><p>Although it's not as stringent as joining the system and having to undergo the examination of the White Jade Heart Questioning Platform,</p><p></p><p>At the very least, some questioning and test missions are still necessary.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had already investigated the process in advance.</p><p></p><p>Although it took some effort, he finally succeeded in joining the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>He also incidentally made the acquaintance of Zhou Luo, the town guardian of Juyu Town in Tianyu State.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Luo was a late Nascent Soul stage cultivator. But because the clone Xiao Fan was young and still a rogue cultivator, yet had already cultivated to the Golden Core realm,</p><p></p><p>He was relatively polite to the clone.</p><p></p><p>After the two exchanged communication talismans, the clone first arrived at Tianyu City via the teleportation array for a layover,</p><p></p><p>Then headed straight for the Tianquan State.</p><p></p><p>The location to participate in the Extreme Immortal's bounty was there.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, Tianquan State has countless ties to the word "authority".</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators holding important positions in the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals would purchase properties and build cave abodes in this state.</p><p></p><p>Along with their relatives and subordinates, who would often follow them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, land prices in Tianquan State are sky-high, and every inch of land is worth its weight in gold.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other states that still have vast wilderness, here, as far as the eye can see, the entire Tianquan State is covered by one private formation after another, indicating that people reside there.</p><p></p><p>And those who can live in Tianquan City are the elite among the elite.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Immortal's Tianji Academy is located within Tianquan City.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan's clone exited the teleportation array and made some inquiries, he learned the location of Tianji Academy.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the entrance, two cultivators wearing gray robes stood on either side of the door.</p><p></p><p>Judging by their cultivation, they were actually both at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were stern, exuding an unapproachable aura.</p><p></p><p>But upon hearing that Li Fan had come to participate in the bounty and possessed a life-extending treasure, they immediately switched to an extremely enthusiastic demeanor.</p><p></p><p>A mirror light swept over the door, confirming the clone's identity.</p><p></p><p>One of them promptly greeted, "You must be Fellow Daoist Xiao Fan. Please, this way."</p><p></p><p>He then led Li Fan into Tianji Academy.</p><p></p><p>After winding through several turns, they arrived at a great hall.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had already gathered inside, their gazes all focused on a mirror surface hanging in the center of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Looking over, Li Fan saw that it clearly listed the names of cultivators and the life-extending treasures they contributed.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions of the cultivators, Li Fan learned the reason.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the commotion caused by this bounty was too great. In addition to attracting countless cultivators to present treasures, it also aroused the dissatisfaction of some people.</p><p></p><p>They believed that the opportunity to use the Derivation Jade was a reward from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals for the Extreme Immortal's meritorious service.</p><p></p><p>It was a symbol of honor.</p><p></p><p>But now, in order to save his life, the Extreme Immortal actually chose to transfer this honor to someone else.</p><p></p><p>This was a desecration of the Alliance's honor!</p><p></p><p>It was clear to discerning eyes that this rhetoric was deliberately stirring up trouble.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Immortal had been in charge of the Defense and Guard Division for over five hundred years. Although he held a high position and wielded great power, it was inevitable that he made many enemies.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was severely injured, resigned from the position of Commander-in-Chief, and his lifespan was visibly nearing its end,</p><p></p><p>Those enemies naturally wanted to take the opportunity to make waves.</p><p></p><p>But overtly and covertly making things difficult for the Extreme Immortal was still doable.</p><p></p><p>As a result, all kinds of rumors seemed to emerge overnight.</p><p></p><p>They all stood on the moral high ground, criticizing the Extreme Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The uproar was so great that later on, there were even rumors circulating outside, saying that due to pressure, the Extreme Immortal had already internally designated the three usage slots for the Derivation Jade to the juniors of other immortals in order to quell the situation.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators presenting life-extending treasures were just making wedding clothes for others.</p><p></p><p>Although the rumors were obviously false, when repeated often enough, some people would believe them.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators got cold feet.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Extreme Immortal, who had remained silent amidst the situation, finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called internal designation is purely fictitious."</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of fairness and justice, and to gain people's trust, the evaluation of the life-extending treasures this time will not involve the people of Tianji Academy. Instead, it will be publicly displayed through the Tianxuan Mirror to avoid the possibility of under-the-table dealings."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the Tianxuan Mirror would directly appraise and rank the treasures, the cultivators all settled their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror, there definitely wouldn't be any falsehood.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Extreme Immortal also made a promise that even if the cultivators presenting treasures didn't make it into the top three,</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Immortal would still compensate them at a price double the market value.</p><p></p><p>With this verbal promise from the old immortal, the number of cultivators participating in the bounty finally increased again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the three-year deadline for the bounty was approaching its end, after submitting their life-extending treasures, they didn't leave.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they stayed in the great hall, constantly watching the rankings displayed on the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also looked towards the list. He saw that for the first place, the name of the contributing cultivator was unclear, but the name of the treasure was already known - the Five Hundred Years Life-Extending Longevity Fruit.</p><p></p><p>As for second place, there was a huge gap.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Yu, Qingmu Longevity Pill. Can extend life by two hundred and eighty-six years."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect my Rebirth Longevity Fruit to rank second. How lucky."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued looking down the list. It was all life-extending treasures he had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>"The Extreme Immortal has consumed too many life-extending treasures. Only these that are almost unique and difficult to replicate are effective."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was deep in thought,</p><p></p><p>Another cultivator entered the great hall.</p><p></p><p>Paying no attention to anyone, without even glancing at the surrounding cultivators, he walked straight to the center beneath the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>He took out a purple wooden box and slowly opened it.</p><p></p><p>"I have a Tiandu Feather Transformation Pill that can extend life by eight hundred years. I present it to the Extreme Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Although his voice was soft, it was like a thunderclap to the ears of the crowd. They all stood up in shock and sized up this newly arrived cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also couldn't help but focus his gaze on the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Tiandu Feather Transformation Pill? From the Source Dao State?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, this person... looks a bit familiar."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan recognized the identity of this cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It was the cultivator who, at the end of the 16th year of the anchor point, won the grand prize at the Congyu Sea, raking in a whopping one million five hundred and sixty thousand contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi.</p>

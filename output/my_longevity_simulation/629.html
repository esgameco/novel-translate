        <h1>Chapter 629</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"You can choose to spend one hundred thousand contribution points to save the progress of this advancement deduction."</p><p></p><p>"The next time, you can continue the deduction from the recording point."</p><p></p><p>"You currently have a total of three Divine deduction recording points, and you can spend contribution points to unlock additional slots."</p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but fall into silence.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he reluctantly chose to save the progress.</p><p></p><p>Then, he infused the Divine deduction into the 'Breaking Heaven Heart Sword.'</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a colorful brilliance erupted from Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>And then, the figure transitioned from real to virtual, slowly condensing. Eventually, it turned into a colorful crystal prism that floated slowly towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held it, and after a moment, the prism seemed to dissolve, becoming smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, countless images and insights flooded Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was a new Divine deduction that perfectly combined the 'Conifer Sword' and 'Skyflip Palm.'</p><p></p><p>The effect of the Divine deduction infusion was even better than self-realization.</p><p></p><p>After the prism disappeared from his hand, Li Fan had completely mastered the 'Breaking Heaven Heart Sword.'</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, you have successfully learned a new Divine deduction."</p><p></p><p>"Would you like to apply the new Divine deduction to your character template?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, of course, chose to confirm.</p><p></p><p>After a while, a completely new Li Fan character appeared in front of him. </p><p></p><p>He looked calm, emanating a stronger aura than the previous character.</p><p></p><p>Using this new character, Li Fan challenged other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shifting skies and flashing swords, the enemies were already defeated.</p><p></p><p>"You have accumulated a combat experience. Would you like to extract and infuse it?"</p><p></p><p>The reminder from the Heaven Mystery Mirror echoed once again.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need it for now. Activate the automatic challenge function," Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The proxy mode has been activated. Under this mode, the designated character template will automatically search for suitable targets and engage in battles. Each battle in proxy mode costs ten thousand contribution points," the mechanical voice of the Heaven Mystery Mirror continued to echo.</p><p></p><p>"This fee is quite reasonable," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As he watched his new character engage in spontaneous battles with other cultivators, Li Fan took a breath and temporarily exited the 'Sitting and Discussing.'</p><p></p><p>Although it had only been a short time in actuality, he couldn't shake off the feeling of a lifetime away.</p><p></p><p>With a clearer mind, Li Fan exchanged insights with other cultivators about the Divine deductions from the Heaven Mystery Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It dawned on him that his recent actions were indeed a bit extravagant.</p><p></p><p>In general, most cultivators needed to rely on their own comprehension to deduce Divine deeds. Only when they were on the verge of a breakthrough but unable to comprehend would they seek guidance from the Heaven Mystery Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The reason being that the contribution points required for Divine deduction from the Heaven Mystery Mirror exceeded the usual limits that ordinary cultivators could afford.</p><p></p><p>"However, looking at it from a different perspective, the so-called contribution points are just a currency used by the Union of Ten Thousand Immortals to sustain its operation and do not have actual value."</p><p></p><p>"If one could master the authority of the Heaven Mystery Mirror, wouldn't that mean being able to deduce any Divine deeds they desire?"</p><p></p><p>"In the past two thousand years since the reconstruction of the Union of Ten Thousand Immortals, how powerful have the senior cultivators at the top become?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but shudder at the thought.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan suddenly recalled a speculation he had long ago.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Mystery Mirror was the true master of the Union of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seemed that even though there might be some deviation from reality, cultivators might not have absolute control over the Heaven Mystery Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Instead of being completely controlled, it was more like a mutual cooperation and restriction.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from the fact that the Union of Ten Thousand Immortals needed to manipulate the 'Dark Heaven Sealing Array' and still had to dig up the secrets from the 'Dark Heaven Script King.'</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Having mastered the new Divine deduction, Li Fan, who hadn't fought anyone in a long time, couldn't help but feel a bit itchy for a fight.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he couldn't find a suitable opponent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, luck was on his side, and he soon found a perfect sparring partner.</p><p></p><p>Liu San sent a message saying he had returned to the Body Transformation Island.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan quietly left the Conifer Cloud City and returned to the island.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Liu San in front of him, he seemed a little older than before he left.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the True Sagely Boat really can't completely eliminate the effects of the Yuan-Devouring White Mist," Li Fan realized immediately.</p><p></p><p>Then, his expression slightly changed. "Liu Lao, what's going on? Has your lifespan decreased?"</p><p></p><p>Liu San nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be furious. "When I purchased the True Sagely Boat, that person was so determined, promising to completely isolate the White Mist from consuming lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"How dare he deceive me! I will make him pay!"</p><p></p><p>Unable to contain his anger, Li Fan turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>But looking at Li Fan's concern and anger for him, Liu San couldn't help but be touched.</p><p></p><p>He quickly stopped Li Fan and persuaded him, "Young Master, let it go. We are new here, so it's better to avoid trouble."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a few years of life. I, as an old servant, have sacrificed myself for the revival of the Medicine King Sect, it's nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, he's just a businessman. It may be exaggerated to sell these True Sagely Boats, but it might not necessarily be intentional deception."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Liu San's advice, Li Fan's expression changed, and finally, he snorted and gave up his plan for immediate revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Did Old Liu make any gains on this trip?" After composing himself, Li Fan asked slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Thankfully, I did not disappoint!" Liu San smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Medicine King Sect will not perish under my watch! I almost searched all the locations marked by Young Master and found nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Just when I was about to give up, at the last location, I discovered a trace of the Longevity Valley!"</p><p></p><p>At the words, Li Fan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Excited, Liu San continued, "I've been inside the valley, perhaps due to being amidst the White Mist barrier, it seems like no cultivator has entered the secret realm for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to when we last visited, the concentration of spiritual energy, the density of spiritual plants and herbs has increased substantially!"</p><p></p><p>"And the formations we set up back then are still functioning, collecting mature herbs automatically over the years."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Liu San spoke excitedly and concluded, "By reclaiming the Longevity Valley, our Medicine King Sect's revival is within reach!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, upon hearing this, was also exhilarated. "Good, Old Liu, you have truly achieved a great feat this time!"</p><p></p><p>"After a few days, once things are settled in the Conifer Cloud Sea, we will head to the Longevity Valley."</p><p></p><p>Liu San nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed to remember something shortly after, and his brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This subtle change didn't escape Li Fan's eyes, and he asked, "What's wrong, Old Liu? Do you have any concerns?"</p>

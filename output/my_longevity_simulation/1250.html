        <h1>Chapter 1250</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing Sun Erlang's words, the white-haired Taoist priest smiled slightly. </p><p></p><p>"Indeed, every person has their own independent personality and thoughts. It is the instinct of all living beings to flee when faced with great calamity. It is quite difficult to make everyone unite with one heart and mind. The various events that have occurred in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm have proven this point."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Taoist priest lightly waved his feather duster, and in an instant, countless scenes appeared in the pure white space before Sun Erlang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The black shadow representing the end of the world floated above the Xuanhuang Realm, ready to descend at any moment. However, regarding how to deal with this catastrophe, the various sects and factions in the Xuanhuang Realm still held different attitudes.</p><p></p><p>Some were determined to abandon the realm and flee, some chose to be ostriches burying their heads in the sand, and some tried their best to mobilize and call on everyone to unite.</p><p></p><p>There were also those who took advantage of the chaos to satisfy their own desires.</p><p></p><p>The beings in the scenes had no specific appearances and were all represented by faceless little people.</p><p></p><p>But the absurd farces being played out were incredibly real.</p><p></p><p>"But this is the Xuanhuang Realm of the past," the white-haired Taoist priest said, waving his feather duster again, and the scenes suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"The masses united as one, their will firm enough to defy the heavenly fate, boldly combining their divine powers, without worries and thus without fear, a single word could settle the Nine Tripods..."</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the words of the True Celestial Venerable, what appeared before Sun Erlang were detailed scenes of human life in the various territories of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, how does this compare to the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" the True Celestial Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>"It is naturally much stronger than the Myriad Immortals Alliance," Sun Erlang said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>He then added, "It's just a pity that all of this is built upon the great divine powers of the five Celestial Venerables. Everything is as illusory as a flower in a mirror or the moon in the water. If one day, any of these five Celestial Venerables suddenly meets with misfortune, this seemingly beautiful scene will collapse in an instant."</p><p></p><p>To openly discuss the possibility of Celestial Venerables falling on the territory of the Five Elders Council - such words could be considered utterly treasonous. However, the white-haired Taoist priest, who seemed to be the True Celestial Venerable, did not become angry.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he nodded in agreement, "What you said indeed makes some sense, but also no sense at all."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was startled and respectfully said with his hands clasped, "Please enlighten me, Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"The reason I say you make sense is because from the perspective of an ordinary cultivator from outside, it indeed seems so. The order here exists because of the five Celestial Venerables. If the Celestial Venerables were to pass away, the order would also cease to exist."</p><p></p><p>"As for why I say you make no sense, it's because you don't understand the true meaning of Immortality in this realm."</p><p></p><p>The True Celestial Venerable stroked his beard and said slowly, "Defying the principles of heaven and earth to attain Immortality."</p><p></p><p>"After cultivators defy the principles, they naturally become a part of the principles of the world. Just like sunlight, water droplets, and air, they together constitute the [World] itself."</p><p></p><p>"Humans are not isolated individuals. It is meaningless to deny the existence of Immortals and then discuss cultivators under the influence of Immortality."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang didn't quite understand what the True Celestial Venerable was saying.</p><p></p><p>In his view, it sounded more like some kind of sophistry.</p><p></p><p>But as an Immortal Celestial Venerable standing at the pinnacle of this realm, he obviously wouldn't engage in a battle of wits with a junior like him.</p><p></p><p>So Sun Erlang frowned and pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he said thoughtfully, "We are discussing the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm. This is the major premise. And Immortal Celestial Venerables have already become an inseparable part of the Xuanhuang Realm, so..."</p><p></p><p>"No," Sun Erlang suddenly became alert, "The key is that your power doesn't seem to cover the entire Xuanhuang Realm? It's limited to just this area."</p><p></p><p>The True Celestial Venerable asked, "Have you ever sensed the existence of Celestial Venerable Wuyou's divine power?"</p><p></p><p>"As fellow Immortals, Wuyou's strength is not much greater than the rest of us. What he can do..."</p><p></p><p>"We can naturally do as well," the True Celestial Venerable said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sun Erlang instinctively found it a bit unbelievable at first.</p><p></p><p>But as he thought about it, his expression gradually became somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Then why?" he couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, the time has not yet come." The white-haired Taoist priest smiled lightly and waved his feather duster again.</p><p></p><p>The white space of the True Fruit Tree slowly faded away.</p><p></p><p>And the figure of the True Celestial Venerable also gradually became blurry.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that Sun Erlang suddenly remembered his master's instructions and hurriedly called out, "Does the Celestial Venerable know about the Eastern Extremity Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"You will know when you see."</p><p></p><p>The white space exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>Countless lights and shadows finally burst forth together, blooming in Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the real world, Sun Erlang was still immersed in the images transmitted by the True Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Defy the principles of heaven and earth again? Are you crazy? You've already come this far, just one step away from defying the principles. As long as you proceed normally step by step, it will be enough to attain the Dao of Immortality. Why do you have to do this?" The young Taoist priest's expression was full of incomprehension, his words intense.</p><p></p><p>"Immortality? It's nothing more than transforming the body into the Dao." The figure opposite him had an indiscernible face, but his tone was quite disdainful of [Immortality].</p><p></p><p>He continued, "If it weren't for that existence, it wouldn't matter if we transformed and attained Immortality. But the entire cultivation system is built upon the framework he created..."</p><p></p><p>"Xinghan, do you know what the consequences will be?"</p><p></p><p>The young Taoist priest remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is being reborn amidst destruction. This is the only thing he cares about at the moment. Someone attaining the Dao of Immortality is utterly irrelevant to him. In fact, he would even hope for the emergence of Immortals that meet his expectations. Do you know why?"</p><p></p><p>The young Taoist priest continued to keep his head down and remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"Your talents are not inferior to mine. How could you not understand? You're just harboring a fluke."</p><p></p><p>"Let me put it bluntly. One day, when the Xuanhuang Realm welcomes its rebirth and completes its transformation, the so-called Immortal Celestial Venerables will completely become a part of the Dao of the new world... a fate worse than death, or rather, life and death will be meaningless."</p><p></p><p>"They're nothing more than tools for remaking the world."</p><p></p><p>"It's just your imagination and speculation..." After a long time, the young Taoist priest retorted weakly.</p><p></p><p>The blurry figure, however, paid no heed and continued talking to himself, "But I refuse to believe it! I will fight against him!"</p><p></p><p>"Defying the principles of heaven and earth to attain Immortality. This is the foundation of his attainment of the Dao, but it is also his greatest flaw. If one can defy his principles again, one can instantly steal all his creations and replace him..."</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Extremity! You..." The young Taoist priest hurriedly looked around, afraid that these treasonous words would be heard by others.</p><p></p><p>That blurry figure, however, was filled with ambition, his eyes brimming with wild aspirations.</p><p></p><p>"Xinghan, don't be nervous. I am not alone on this path." At this moment, Eastern Extremity suddenly spoke up to reassure him.</p><p></p><p>"Within that Immortal-Mortal Miasma, there are hidden mysteries of defying the principles of heaven and earth again. It originated from the previous Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable who has already passed away..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've recently gained some insights. As long as..." </p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Before Dongji could finish his sentence, the scene suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>When the view before his eyes became clear again, it was still Dongji's figure.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The originally triumphant and high-spirited Dongji looked very strange.</p><p></p><p>Head hanging low, body naked.</p><p></p><p>Long hair scattered, countless threads extending out from his body.</p><p></p><p>Stretching into the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>"Dongji!"</p><p></p><p>This horrifying scene, accompanied by the True Reality Heavenly Venerate's startled cry, suddenly disintegrated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Sun Erlang's mind was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a brief conversation, the secrets revealed were all shocking.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang first looked around and found that not much time had passed since he entered the Creation Illusion Realm of the True Reality Fruit Tree. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were still cultivators on the fruit who were closing their eyes to accept the trial.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Erlang no longer had the heart to stay here.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the attention of the cultivators in the city was all focused on those "Chosen Ones" who were still lingering in the illusion realm.</p><p></p><p>There was not much attention paid to Sun Erlang, the failure.</p><p></p><p>Quietly leaving the city, he headed straight for the entrance of the Great Enlightenment Small World. </p><p></p><p>While flying, Sun Erlang's thoughts turned rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"The True Reality Heavenly Venerate discovered my whereabouts long ago?"</p><p></p><p>"So he appeared in the illusion realm to meet me."</p><p></p><p>"They already knew about Heavenly Venerate Dongji's predicament, and it just so happened that I came here on my master's orders, so they used me to convey these scenes to my master..."</p><p></p><p>"What is the deeper meaning behind this?"</p><p></p><p>Even though Sun Erlang prided himself on having seen the world, he still found it hard to contain himself in the face of this truth involving the secrets of the Xuan-Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang couldn't help but speed up a bit more.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In fact, he didn't need to return to the Great Enlightenment Small World in person.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the golden giant net woven from the essence of source power, the Faceless Sacred Emperor had already synchronously perceived what happened to him the moment he entered the True Reality Illusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, that True Reality Heavenly Venerate was not really talking to Sun Erlang, a small cultivator who had not yet reached the Dao.</p><p></p><p>But was communicating with the Faceless Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping carefully repeated watching the scenes transmitted by the True Reality Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the other party's seemingly meaningful words also echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Tools for transforming and remaking the new world through the Transmission of Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems they still have some self-awareness. Seeing me appear in the world and contend with the Transmission of Dao, they express goodwill in a subtle way..."</p><p></p><p>"However, we can't fully trust them either."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>It was true that the Five Great Heavenly Venerates had transformed into the Dao with their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But facing the pressure of the Transmission of Dao, Li Ping didn't believe that after so many years, they would just sit and wait for death without doing anything.</p><p></p><p>"The Land of No Worries and Joys, forming its own world."</p><p></p><p>"As for the others, they mostly take the attitude of sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight."</p><p></p><p>"And those who are truly at the end of their rope, such as today's Xuan-Huang Heavenly Dao, will eagerly welcome any sign of life."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's thoughts were very calm and were not affected by the somewhat horrifying scene from the True Reality Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>"But what Heavenly Venerate Dongji said about the secrets that go against the principles of heaven and earth being hidden in the Immortal-Mortal Miasma... may be true."</p><p></p><p>"Dongji's Pure Body Spirit Pool can resolve the principles that Su Bai went against, just like the Xuan-Huang Immortal Heart Mantra."</p><p></p><p>"Going against the principles of heaven and earth again..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered over these two sentences.</p><p></p><p>"We can't rely on it entirely, but it's also a way to shake the power of the Transmission of Dao."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Ping's figure flashed and arrived beside Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was also here.</p><p></p><p>They were observing a little girl who looked like a delicate jade sculpture, both clicking their tongues in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Ping's arrival, Yin Shangren spoke first: "You came at the right time. Come and take a look at this little one."</p><p></p><p>The majestic aura of the Sacred Emperor, as well as his faceless appearance, made the little girl a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>But she still plucked up her courage and looked directly at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Divine sense swept through the little girl's body in an instant, and Li Ping was slightly startled. He asked via voice transmission: "Didn't you say they all cultivate the new new method?"</p><p></p><p>"How come this little child is cultivating the Dao of the Transmission of Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke answered this question with a sense of emotion: "Your Majesty, don't misunderstand. No one here taught her the cultivation method, but she figured it out herself."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, among this batch of children, there are more than just her who are like this."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's tone was also a bit strange: "When you're at the end of your rope, you take a different path. They saw that they couldn't form their foundation, while their companions kept making progress. In desperation, they instinctively stumbled upon and explored another path of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"In order to avoid influencing those children who cultivate the new new method of mind, we had to take them away."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Faceless Sacred Emperor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>This time, the essence of source power swept through and observed the specific situation inside the bodies of these young children.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of the Transmission of Dao has already become a part of the Xuan-Huang Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping recalled the situation in the world created by Sun Erlang not long ago.</p><p></p><p>"This is the [Dao] of Xuan-Huang. The supreme Dao, even the Xuan-Huang Heavenly Dao itself cannot escape its influence."</p><p></p><p>"Following its Dao, one can attain the highest in the realm and achieve immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Going against the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"It's either you die or I perish."</p><p></p><p>The bizarre body of Dongji, like a puppet, appeared before Li Ping's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But there was not a shred of timidity or hesitation in Li Ping's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Su Bai and Dongji, they will fail..."</p><p></p><p>"But that doesn't mean I will!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Transmission of Dao is strong, it's not unsolvable."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's train of thought never changed from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>"To successfully go against the Dao, one is to go against its principles again and disrupt its foundation."</p><p></p><p>"The second is to use strength to overcome strength and break the situation with force. The Dao of the Transmission of Dao is indeed supreme in the Xuan-Huang Realm. But the world is not just one Xuan-Huang Realm. Outside the world, there is the starry sea. And beyond the starry sea, there is the high wall..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping's thoughts turned, he also made his intention clear to Yin Shangren and Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal-Mortal Miasma?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren found it a bit strange that Li Ping suddenly brought up this subject of his previous research again.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai sacrificed his life to successfully go against the principles. Because he was deeply favored by the Heavenly Dao, the greater the entanglement, the greater the backlash. In the end, he couldn't escape and returned to the heavens..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren explained.</p><p></p><p>"Since it has already gone against the principles, why can it be dispelled?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean every time the Immortal-Mortal Miasma is expelled, it's equivalent to going against the principles of heaven and earth again?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping calmly asked.</p><p></p><p>This was a question that Yin Shangren had never thought of before, directly stunned on the spot.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1019: Immortal Body for a Thousand Years</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan had already known the whole story beforehand, facing the might of the Immortal Ruins once again still made him feel a bit shocked and thrilled.</p><p></p><p>After the scene finished playing, Liu Ruchen's phantom figure started to leave his last will.</p><p></p><p>His adopted son Liu Yihang was to take over as the Sect Master of the Medicine King Sect. It would be best if the other elders were willing to support and help him.</p><p></p><p>If they were unwilling, they could leave the Medicine King Sect of their own accord, he would not force them.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Xuanhuang Realm, they should not rush for revenge, but hide and lie low in Changsheng Valley, waiting for the right opportunity, and so on.</p><p></p><p>It was the same as what Li Fan had known before.</p><p></p><p>However, after temporarily gaining control of the Medicine King's True Cauldron, Li Fan was not in a hurry to leave.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued waiting in the control room.</p><p></p><p>Even after Liu Ruchen's phantom figure had completely dissipated, he did not leave.</p><p></p><p>He waited patiently for a while, but still nothing seemed to happen.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan's Mowang Disc spun rapidly, generating a formation.</p><p></p><p>With a cold glint in his eyes, Li Fan instantly laid out the formation in the control room.</p><p></p><p>The main function of the formation was to expose all hidden remnant souls, leaving them nowhere to hide!</p><p></p><p>That's right, Li Fan suspected that Liu Ruchen of the Medicine King Sect had not completely died!</p><p></p><p>It was not a groundless guess.</p><p></p><p>One must know that the current Li Fan had seen a lot.</p><p></p><p>Mechanisms, formations, restrictions... what hadn't he seen before?</p><p></p><p>But the phantom figure giving the last will in front of him did not belong to any of these categories.</p><p></p><p>To be able to maintain the image and say such a long speech, it must be supported by some kind of power.</p><p></p><p>Since all the above external options had been ruled out, the only remaining possibility was Liu Ruchen's own soul power!</p><p></p><p>As the formation was completed, crisscrossing light waves continuously swept through the space.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan had expected, an increasingly blurry figure was forced to reveal itself again!</p><p></p><p>It couldn't even engage in spiritual communication, as if it would dissipate at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the helplessness and despair faintly emanating from the other party, Li Fan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grabbed Liu Ruchen in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Without any courtesy, the power of the Faceless True Immortal was slowly infused into him.</p><p></p><p>As Liu Ruchen's soul gradually became clearer, he himself also appeared within Li Fan's sensory network.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Liu played this trick of shedding the golden cicada shell quite well, almost fooling even me," Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"You jest, fellow Daoist," Liu Ruchen said with a bitter face.</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect," Li Fan said with an evil smile.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!" Liu Ruchen's soul trembled. It was already not very solid to begin with. Now, upon hearing Li Fan's words, it was on the verge of disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>After stabilizing his mind with great difficulty, Liu Ruchen said with lingering fear, "It's better not to make such jokes..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the Blood Moon Phantom behind Li Fan suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>An oppressive might far surpassing that of an ancient Dao-merging cultivator was revealed. Just the aura alone almost completely shattered Liu Ruchen's currently weak soul.</p><p></p><p>"You think I'm lying? Your Medicine King Sect has only been away for half a day, but thousands of years have passed in the Xuanhuang Realm!" Li Fan said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Liu Ruchen wake up as if from a dream, "What? Thousands of years?"</p><p></p><p>He made some calculations and confirmed that Li Fan was not lying.</p><p></p><p>His already ethereal face turned even more deathly pale, "I knew it would affect space-time, but I never thought it would reach..."</p><p></p><p>"To such an extent."</p><p></p><p>Although greatly shocked, Liu Ruchen, as the sect leader, quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"So, does this mean that the Xuantian Sect has successfully restored its power and regained control?" Liu Ruchen asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Li Fan smiled ambiguously, then pointed slightly, transmitting the general situation of the current Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the tremendous changes over the past thousand years, Liu Ruchen remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, I occasionally learned about the legend of your Yaowang Sect leaving in ancient times. A while ago, I saw a meteor streaking across the sky. On a whim, I figured out the cause and effect of the matter."</p><p></p><p>"According to the rules of our Xuantian Sect, foolish and incompetent traitors like you should all be executed." A hint of murderous intent flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, he then changed the subject: "But, times are different now. To overthrow the Wanxian Alliance and re-establish the Xuantian Sect, we need to gather all the forces that can be combined."</p><p></p><p>"So, I'll give your Yaowang Sect a chance..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Liu Ruchen, his eyes revealing a fierce light.</p><p></p><p>What other choice did Liu Ruchen have? Not only his own life but also the lives of the disciples slumbering in the Yaowang Cauldron were all at the mercy of the other party.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen had no choice but to agree.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, actually your opinion doesn't matter. Since you have already bowed to the Hongchen Cibei Zhenxian, you can't escape even if you want to." Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen recalled the faceless stone statue that had abruptly appeared in his soul earlier, and his heart couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily storing Liu Ruchen and the Yaowang Cauldron in his cave heaven, Li Fan returned to the Lingmu Realm and called for the Qiaogong Hermit.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Hermit, who was studying Tianyang, was a little displeased at being disturbed by Li Fan at this moment.</p><p></p><p>With Liu Ruchen's current soul strength, it was difficult for him to even maintain his form, let alone cultivate again.</p><p></p><p>It would be troublesome to help him restore his soul.</p><p></p><p>It was better to let Qiaogong Hermit help.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Hermit glanced at Liu Ruchen and nodded, "No problem! But if it's just an ordinary mechanical puppet, he was at the Hedao realm before, right? I'm afraid the puppet body won't be able to fully utilize his original strength."</p><p></p><p>"As long as he can move, it's fine." Li Fan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Reviving Liu Ruchen was just to better control the Yaowang Sect.</p><p></p><p>There were no more True Temptation Fruits on hand. If he threatened and lured the Yaowang Sect members to submit one by one, there would be some risks.</p><p></p><p>After all, this tendency had appeared in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>As long as Liu Ruchen was there, he didn't have to worry about the Yaowang Sect getting out of control.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Hermit mumbled and asked Li Fan for some materials.</p><p></p><p>Having lived in the Xuanhuang Realm for some years, all the materials Qiaogong Hermit wanted were produced locally in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly prepared them.</p><p></p><p>"Umm..."</p><p></p><p>"Can you provide some Source Power Essence?"</p><p></p><p>Just before preparing to forge the puppet, Qiaogong Hermit suddenly made a request.</p><p></p><p>As if afraid that Li Fan would misunderstand, he took the initiative to explain, "I haven't used Source Power Essence before, so I have to try it out, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if I directly use it on little brother Tianyang, I won't be confident."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was silent for a moment, but in the end, he agreed to Qiaogong Hermit's request.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Hermit immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had overturned the previous forging plan and asked Li Fan for some more materials.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he begin forging the mechanical puppet.</p><p></p><p>And the forging process was quite novel.</p><p></p><p>He didn't use any tangible flames but directly used the golden Source Power in the void to wash out a phantom.</p>

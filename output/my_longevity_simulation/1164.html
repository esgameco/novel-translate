        <h1>Chapter 1164</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The probability of fishing up a treasure-quality item from the fishing pool is unrelated to one's level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It depends more on the sincerity of fishing and the understanding of the Dao of fishing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the more one desires, the less likely it is to catch the intended target.</p><p></p><p>In short, it is profoundly mysterious, similar to ordinary fishing.</p><p></p><p>The winners of the Imperial Fishing Tournament will be arranged to fish at the fishing pool.</p><p></p><p>Most of these people have only reached the Qi Refining stage, with the highest being at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>With their knowledge and understanding, they probably would never imagine that this small, inconspicuous pond could actually be a treasure at the Immortal Tool level, and even drop world-class treasures.</p><p></p><p>For all of them, any gains will naturally be regarded as a reward from the great Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And there is no need to worry that someone among them will be like the 119th generation's Stone Tablet predecessor, who courted death by relying on the fishing pool to comprehend the Dao of fishing. Thus, triggering the reaction of the nameless True Immortal behind it and being fished away instead.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a very few existences that Li Ping would be tempted by, he will hand over the treasures fished up from the pool to these anglers for their own use. He may even focus on cultivating them.</p><p></p><p>"In this life, let me see if the treasures in this fishing pool are truly inexhaustible. And also..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether the myriad heavens' fortune can overwhelm the Mysterious and Yellow!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the thousands of eager anglers holding various fishing rods in the Holy Capital, as if he saw countless star-reaching treasures flying into the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Imperial Fishing Tournament was being held in a tight and orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>At the desolate small mountain on the northwestern border of Yongyun Province.</p><p></p><p>Inside the dilapidated temple on the mountaintop, Zhong Shentong, who had cast a rod but returned empty-handed, suddenly felt a hint of drowsiness.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to call for his young servant Liuli, he discovered that she had also fallen into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong smiled, checked the temple's protective formation to ensure there were no problems.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he lazily take a nap on the reclining chair.</p><p></p><p>Unknown how much time had passed...</p><p></p><p>When he inexplicably woke up, he found himself in a dark and unknown space!</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously wanting to take out his life-saving treasure from his storage ring, he discovered that at some point his entire body had been stripped bare, completely naked!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's face twitched, knowing that he had completely fallen this time. The other party was too ruthless, not giving him any chance at all.</p><p></p><p>"But since I'm still alive, it means the other party has no intention of taking my life. On the surface, I'm just a Qi Refining cultivator on the verge of reaching my limit and in dire straits. If they wanted to deal with me, it would be much simpler than going to such great lengths. So it's for the fishing pool?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's mind turned rapidly, instantly understanding. But no matter how hard he racked his brain, he couldn't figure out how the news of this supreme treasure had leaked out.</p><p></p><p>There was no warning at all!</p><p></p><p>"By the way, where is Liuli?"</p><p></p><p>For this little doll that he personally fished out from the pool and transformed, Zhong Shentong had almost regarded her as his only family. Now that he was trapped, it seemed she was also in a precarious situation...</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhong Shentong was in turmoil, a voice as cold as ice suddenly rang out in this pitch-black space.</p><p></p><p>"Within seven days, break through to the Foundation Establishment stage."</p><p></p><p>Without any intention to communicate with Zhong Shentong further, it only said these two sentences and then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>However, the bone-chilling murderous intent surrounding him made Zhong Shentong understand that this was not some kind of test.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to successfully break through, he would truly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who dares to threaten me will be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"I have been stuck in the late stage of Qi Refinement for more than fifty years. On the surface, I seem to be aging and there is no hope for a breakthrough. Anyone normal would not make such a request of me. Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"He guessed that I am cultivating the Profound Art of Life and Death!"</p><p></p><p>The more Zhong Shentong thought about it, the more unfathomable this mastermind behind the scenes seemed. Although they had never met before, the other party seemed to know everything about him like the back of their hand.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhong Shentong was plunged into endless panic.</p><p></p><p>In another dark space, the young Taoist Liuli still seemed unaware of the impending crisis, still sound asleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping suddenly appeared in front of her, quietly observing.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Ping said lightly: "Daoist Baihua, please show yourself."</p><p></p><p>It was quiet, with no response.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping narrowed his eyes: "Do I have to say it a third time, Sect Master of Tianlianzong from the Wansheng Realm?"</p><p></p><p>His tone was light, but to some people, it was like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>Finally no longer hiding, a figure emerged from Taoist Liuli's body amidst flashes of golden light.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua stared intently at Li Ping: "Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua was certain she had never seen this person before. But he was able to accurately state her identity...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many figures flashed through Baihua's mind. But none of them matched.</p><p></p><p>"Just a fellow wanderer of the starry skies who has lost their homeland. The past is gone, why must Daoist friend delve into it?"</p><p></p><p>This sentence made Daoist Baihua's imagination run wild. It seemed to bring her back to the terrifying moments when world-ending disasters erupted one after another in the past.</p><p></p><p>"More importantly, is the future." But the other party's next sentence completely captured Baihua's attention.</p><p></p><p>"The future?"</p><p></p><p>"Now sunk in the starry sea, only this place can be considered the sole pure land. But the Xuanhuang Realm at this moment is no longer the previous Xuanhuang Realm. Over the years, through the continuous piecing together and fusion of remnants from various realms, this new Xuanhuang Realm has long transcended the conceptual scope of an ordinary cultivation realm." Li Ping's tone was ethereal.</p><p></p><p>"If Daoist friend searches carefully, you may still be able to find the remnants of the former Wansheng Realm."</p><p></p><p>Baihua's expression changed: "What exactly does Daoist friend want to say?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the Xuanhuang Realm has absorbed the remnants of various realms... then the new Xuanhuang Realm should also have a place for us. If they don't allow it, then we have to fight for it ourselves." Li Ping said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"The native forces of the Xuanhuang Realm are too vast, only by uniting can we have a chance to take back what is ours."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Wansheng Realm, I have also found Daoist friends from the Tianji Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping spoke at length.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua was clearly somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>"If the Xuanhuang Realm has really absorbed the remnants of our worlds to resist the Immortal Ruins, then this place can indeed be considered my new home."</p><p></p><p>A tremor suddenly surged in Baihua's heart, the irrepressible emotion of having wandered homeless for many years and suddenly finding a new place to stay.</p><p></p><p>"But... the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm are not so easy to talk to." After pondering, Daoist Baihua still had some hesitation. She vaguely remembered how that Scattered Immortal single-handedly blocked them survivors from various realms back then.</p><p></p><p>Although times have changed and that Scattered Immortal's whereabouts are unknown, a new Dharma Heavenly Venerate has emerged in the Xuanhuang Realm...</p>

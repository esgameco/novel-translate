        <h1>Chapter 1320</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the 'Infinite Celestial Pivot Separating Spirit Technique', there was a distinction between the myriad spiritual fragments and the original spirit. Previously, what Li Fan found on this Dongyong Isle Annular Mountain were merely the memories from those myriad spiritual fragments. </p><p></p><p>However, the truly important original spirit had never been discovered, until now when Bai Quan Luo Fan took action, completely annihilating this Annular Mountain. The hidden original spirit was finally able to manifest.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the myriad spiritual force flowers drifting outside, the spirit flowers hidden within the Annular Mountain seemed to still be in dormancy. Even when actively contacted, they would not attack.</p><p></p><p>After these spirit flowers were exposed due to losing their hiding place, they spontaneously gathered in an orderly fashion, slowly converging to form an enormous glowing white flower.</p><p></p><p>In the Annular Mountain area, the countless spiritual force flowers scattered between heaven and earth rotated around that glowing white flower, as if finding their main body.</p><p></p><p>In the rising storm, the original spirit flower gradually became like those spiritual force flowers, as if trying to use this method to conceal itself.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, at the moment the Annular Mountain collapsed and the spirit flower dissipated outwards, Li Fan's vast and unparalleled divine consciousness had already locked onto them all.</p><p></p><p>Such a clumsy blinding technique, how could it possibly deceive Li Fan?</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan soon realized he was mistaken.</p><p></p><p>When his divine consciousness touched one of the original spirit flowers, the scenes it transmitted felt somewhat familiar to Li Fan. They were the same scenes he had previously contacted within ordinary spiritual force flowers!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there are some tricks to it. Even though locked onto by me, it can still silently complete the exchange and transfer..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the myriad billions of flowers before him, Li Fan coldly snorted, "But since I've already discovered it, where else can you escape!"</p><p></p><p>"You hide in the boundless sea of flowers, so I shall boil the sea!"</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang Apocalypse Transformation: Heaven's Punishment, Earth's Destruction, Soul Gathering Rebirth!"</p><p></p><p>Towering destructive energy suddenly surged from Li Fan's body. His eyes turned pitch black, and the destructive energy even condensed into physical form like myriad tiny tentacles swaying in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Within this black destructive energy, faint bolts of lightning could be seen, as if heavenly punishment was descending to completely exterminate all living beings in the world!</p><p></p><p>This was one of the variations of Li Fan's Xuan Huang Apocalypse Transformation.</p><p></p><p>When the Xuan Huang faced destruction and dire straits, in order to survive, it would exterminate all living beings within the realm, absorbing their flesh, blood and spirits to increase its chances of withstanding apocalyptic crisis.</p><p></p><p>This variation was even more extreme than the Heavenly Silence, Myriad Freezing Li Fan had used before. It was a desperate gambit, eliminating everything except itself in a struggle for survival.</p><p></p><p>Boundless black clouds rolled in from the horizon above Dongyong Isle. This was the Xuan Huang Heavenly Dao reacting to the extreme changes occurring here.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even sensed that due to the birth of this heavenly transformation, the Xuan Huang realm's attitude towards him was rapidly turning hostile. The hard-earned goodwill he had previously accumulated was almost instantly reset to zero.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not care.</p><p></p><p>The destructive tentacles continuously divided into new branches, enveloping and viciously piercing all the spiritual force flowers they could reach.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual force flowers withered one by one.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, stocks of extremely pure yet slightly ominous energy were absorbed and gathered, mixed with many fragmented memory shards.</p><p></p><p>Some belonged to Ji Yurong, while others were from cultivators who had fallen here.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan categorized and organized Ji Yurong's memories, gradually piecing together complete scenes.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Tian Sect's immortal techniques each had their own mysteries. As a precaution, Li Fan did not greedily absorb the energy transformed from the spiritual force flowers directly.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he converged it in one place, sealing it with origin force essence.</p><p></p><p>The black tentacles waved wildly, and the myriad flowers visibly disappeared in large swaths.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the first original spirit could no longer hide and was found by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Without draining or destroying the spirit, he only peeked into the memories hidden within.</p><p></p><p>The scenes flashed by like a galloping horse.</p><p></p><p>It was as if covered by a layer of white light, flickering bright and dim, like looking at flowers through mist, vaguely visible.</p><p></p><p>"Yong'er, do you remember how to activate the Golden Lock Spanning Heavens Formation?" Xuan Tian Wang's voice came, but his face was hidden in the white light, indistinct.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Xuanxuan, do you think I'm that stupid?" Ji Yurong said teasingly.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Tian Wang quickly explained, "Don't misunderstand Yong'er, I know your talents are by no means inferior to mine. But this formation is ultimately an improvement based on the immortal formations. The difference between immortal and mortal, if one has not personally experienced it, it is truly difficult to have a correct understanding."</p><p></p><p>"Since Big Brother Xuanxuan is so distrustful, then teach me again." Ji Yurong said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Um...alright." Xuan Tian Wang hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement.</p><p></p><p>He said solemnly, "The Golden Lock Spanning Heavens locks across the myriad heavens. Even if the target is in the distant starry seas, as long as it is locked onto, the lock chains can instantly arrive and capture it."</p><p></p><p>"I told you before, the reason it can achieve this effect is because it embeds the Horizon Within Reach Great Formation. This formation was originally inscribed on the ascension platform in the immortal realm. When I fled, I brought the entire immortal formation down..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Yurong looked at Xuanxuan Hong, as if seeing him fleeing while collecting immortal relics, and couldn't help but laugh again, "Even though this isn't the first time hearing you say it, I still find it hard to imagine, that Big Brother Xuanxuan is actually this kind of person."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Tian Wang coughed in embarrassment, "The immortal realm was facing catastrophe, which would obviously affect the lower realms. Of course I had to make more preparations. Moreover, they were already masterless objects..."</p><p></p><p>After justifying himself seriously, Xuan Tian Wang continued explaining, "There are slight spatial deviations between where the immortal realms are observed by the Celestial Beast's Eye and their actual locations. So when using the Golden Lock to capture, corresponding adjustments must be made. Currently, there is still no good way to resolve this deviation, so it fully relies on the experience and senses of the presider."</p><p></p><p>"The Horizon Within Reach Great Formation consumes immense energy. After using it for a period, the formation needs repairs and replenishment. But you don't need to worry about damage. I've replicated three backup copies of the core components. At most, the capture efficiency will be lower, but it won't affect using the formation..."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Tian Wang's explanation was very detailed, and Ji Yurong listened word by word.</p><p></p><p>However, her gaze was fixed on Xuanxuan Hong's face the entire time, never shifting away.</p><p></p><p>Returning from the memory to reality, Li Fan carefully took the...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This primordial soul was sealed.</p><p></p><p>He then turned his gaze towards the remaining sea of flowers. </p><p></p><p>As more and more incorrect options were eliminated, the collection of primordial souls became faster.</p><p></p><p>Memories of Ji Yucheng surfaced one after another.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yucheng and Xuanxuan Hong stood facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Xuanxuan, you've finally awakened. Inviting me here alone," Ji Yucheng's beautiful eyes rippled slightly as she gazed at the Xuantian Wang.</p><p></p><p>"Cheng'er, don't be ridiculous. There is serious business today," Xuanxuan Hong said solemnly. </p><p></p><p>"The other eleven brothers have already completed the selection of their celestial arts, only you have yet to decide..."</p><p></p><p>"I said I want you, Big Brother Xuanxuan, to help me choose," Ji Yucheng interrupted Xuanxuan Hong's words.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Hong showed a helpless expression: "I'm looking for you precisely for this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Has Big Brother Xuanxuan chosen one for me?"</p><p></p><p>"The Infinite Celestial Pivot Leaving Spirit Skill. Even among the many celestial arts I have collected, it is one of the best existences. It can divide the soul endlessly, the soul is indestructible and imperishable. More crucially, it can cultivate one's own soul essence and derive primordial souls. Each primordial soul can ascend an independent celestial path..." The Xuantian Wang expounded.</p><p></p><p>"I trust you, Big Brother. I'll cultivate this one," Ji Yucheng decided before the Xuantian Wang finished speaking. </p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Hong paused slightly and nodded. He pointed at his brow, and dark characters flew out from within.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Hong closed his eyes, his expression calm. But occasionally his brow furrowed, as if enduring immense pain.</p><p></p><p>"The divine is the flower of fate. Roaming the vast emptiness, its blossoms are like the new green of spring willows, lush yet not chaotic, divisible yet able to unite..."</p><p></p><p>The moment she saw those drifting dark characters, an abstruse celestial art appeared in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Not only the content of the art, but also countless experiences of cultivating this art and specific insights.</p><p></p><p>Although a beginner, it felt as if she had reincarnated thousands of times, having cultivated it countless times.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the dark characters slowly returned to the Xuantian Wang's sea of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Xuanxuan, are you alright?" Ji Yucheng asked with concern, stepping forward to check on him.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Wang's face flickered with countless other ferocious faces, as if trying to take over. But in the end, it reverted to Xuanxuan Hong's original appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Xuanxuan, you could have just transmitted the art directly. Why use this inheritance method?" Ji Yucheng's tone carried a hint of accusation.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Hong sighed slightly: "Cheng'er, the complexity of celestial arts far exceeds that of mortal cultivation methods. Although your talents are remarkable, without the guidance of inheritance, it may take you over ten years to take your first step in this Leaving Spirit Art. We don't have that much time..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Yucheng fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Hong continued: "Moreover, judging from the cultivation states of a few other brothers, whether the inheritance transmission method is used makes an obvious difference. It must be a limitation of the celestial arts within the Azure Mystery Pearl itself."</p><p></p><p>"This Azure Mystery Pearl may not be a good thing," Ji Yucheng snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxuan Hong disagreed: "There is no good or evil in cultivation arts, it all depends on the cultivator using it. The same goes for this Azure Mystery Pearl."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that I obtained it too late. I could only hastily scan the nearby corpses before hurriedly leaving," Xuanxuan Hong said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>A series of scenes flashed through Li Fan's mind, one after another.</p><p></p><p>They were all from the life of Ji Yucheng, the Celestial Sovereign of the Xuantian Sect in the past.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the fragments preserved in the spirit force flowers before, the memories in the primordial souls were more complete.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they all involved many secrets of the Xuantian Wang of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Such as the origin of the Celestial Sovereign Ji Yucheng's cultivation of celestial arts, that mysterious celestial treasure the Azure Mystery Pearl.</p><p></p><p>Such as the method to control and open the Floating Crossing Formation, the golden locks in the sky.</p><p></p><p>And also, the details of Ji Yucheng's interactions with Xuanxuan Hong.</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled Li Fan was that the memories in these primordial souls were still incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Some important parts were missing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned the surroundings, ensuring there were no more stray spirit force flowers.</p><p></p><p>"Did they escape while I wasn't paying attention? Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Were those primordial souls never preserved to begin with?"</p><p></p><p>From Ji Yucheng's memories, Li Fan obtained the complete content of the Leaving Spirit Art.</p><p></p><p>Although lacking the so-called inheritance transmission method, he now had a general understanding of this celestial art.</p><p></p><p>Apart from being able to divide the soul endlessly and achieve immortality, the primordial souls had an even greater function - to serve as a catalyst for enlightenment after reaching the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether consumed by oneself or others, it could allow two completely different paths to fully merge and integrate.</p><p></p><p>What True Immortals pursued was a particular great path.</p><p></p><p>The great path is unique.</p><p></p><p>Not only would it repel other cultivators of the same path, but it was also very difficult to cultivate two different paths simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>However, the Leaving Spirit Art could ingeniously resolve this limitation.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this heaven-defying ability to fuse paths, its healing effects from consuming primordial souls seemed rather insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could not help but speculate as such.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Ji Yucheng deeply loved the Xuantian Wang.</p><p></p><p>However, for some unknown reason, Xuanxuan Hong never accepted her love and even deliberately kept his distance.</p><p></p><p>Sacrificing herself to save the Xuantian Wang was something Ji Yucheng was fully capable of doing.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Wang..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan murmured, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The ominous clouds accumulating in the Xuan Huang Realm had reached their limit, as if about to collapse from the heavens at any moment.</p><p></p><p>With Ji Yucheng's scattered souls fully absorbed, Li Fan dispelled the Massacre Heaven and Extinguish Earth transformation.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered and vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The anomaly in the sky also dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance who had been blocked outside by the invisible barrier arrived belatedly.</p><p></p><p>Upon discovering the mysteriously vanished ring-shaped mountain and spirit force flowers, they were greatly alarmed and immediately reported back to the Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not go look for Mo Rushen next.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he went into seclusion to digest the memories from Ji Yucheng's souls.</p><p></p><p>The life of the Celestial Sovereign, even with some of the most crucial parts missing, was still immense.</p><p></p><p>Especially within the primordial souls, it contained not just memories, but also the thoughts and emotions from that time.</p><p></p><p>While exploring them, he was inevitably influenced by those emotions.</p><p></p><p>To prevent being affected, Li Fan had to periodically stop and eliminate the seeping emotions whenever he experienced a segment of memory, lest Ji Yucheng's soul take him over instead.</p><p></p><p>"The memory of how Ji Yucheng and the Xuantian Wang first met is also missing. It seems that the important reason why she fell in love with the Xuantian Wang, which was likely one of her most precious memories, is also gone."</p>

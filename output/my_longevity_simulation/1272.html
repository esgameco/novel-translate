            <p>Chapter 1269: The Celestial Folding Formation</p><p></p><p>After being tempered in the Ashen Minor World, Sun Luyao, who narrowly escaped death under the Regression Technique, had indeed made much progress compared to before.</p><p></p><p>The faint light silently bloomed, penetrating the surface land of the Xuan-Huang Realm and reaching its inner core.</p><p></p><p>After a search, traces suspected to be remnants of the realm-protecting grand formation were indeed discovered.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the Ashen Minor World, the formation lines of the Xuan-Huang Realm were more ancient and profound.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to investigate while activating the Limitless Mirror. At the same time, he input the probed formation data into the formation model previously derived from the Doomsday Separation Disc.</p><p></p><p>"The vast majority match. But at certain critical nodes..." Li Fan's eyes flickered as he grabbed the Limitless Mirror, transforming into a streamline shuttling through the Nine Lands, arriving at the deepest part of the underground, still beneath the Xuan-Huang Leylines.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were a chaotic expanse where matter no longer existed under unimaginable pressure. Only dark red aura flowed, stirring up mysterious whispers.</p><p></p><p>Under this extreme environment, Li Fan's divine sense had no choice but to hide inside the Limitless Mirror, relying on the artifact's main body to maintain survival.</p><p></p><p>The Limitless Mirror was not having it easy either. Actively releasing faint light to protect the main body, Sun Luyao was extremely vigilant as he surveyed the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>An impulse suddenly surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>While the Limitless Mirror didn't feel much, Li Fan's divine sense was visibly aging at an accelerated rate.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's divine sense was about to completely dissipate due to aging, a mysterious vitality suddenly welled up from its core.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, it was exactly the same as the method Chuan Fa had used to conceal and seal the Calamity Transcendence Scripture!</p><p></p><p>Namely: the superposition of space in multiple directions. To put it simply, a line is hidden in different spatial dimensions. Naturally, nothing can be discovered from a certain angle. Only by constantly changing perspectives and "rotating" all the distributed individuals into one, will the hidden formation finally be revealed.</p><p></p><p>"And I also sensed it here, the aura of those Celestial Seal Characters. Many of them..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Such a turn of events left the Limitless Mirror spirit Sun Luyao staring in shock.</p><p></p><p>"If the Celestial Realm still existed, this Regression Technique would be equivalent to forcibly opening a passage to the Celestial Realm. Although it only opens to specific targets."</p><p></p><p>"This inexplicable twist in the formation node, unexpected yet seeming as it should be, my previous understanding was still too superficial."</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed like a casual question, Li Fan was actually staring intently at Sun Luyao, observing his changes.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful."</p><p></p><p>"The passage still exists, but the destination is no longer there. However, according to the Limitless Mirror, this experiencer in the flesh, it's also possible that the true Celestial Ruins did not disappear. It's just that after a brief stay, it was forcibly expelled. That is, the old laws can hardly accommodate it!"</p><p></p><p>"No." There were no abnormal fluctuations in Sun Luyao's emotions as he honestly confessed, "After being annihilated by the power of the Celestial Seal Characters, my consciousness was in a blank state. And those vanished parts, I completely lost sense of their existence."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's words suddenly stopped, as if he had fallen into some kind of contemplation and doubt.</p><p></p><p>After the Limitless Mirror shattered, the information related to the Celestial Realm also disappeared along with it. Even though Li Fan helped it complete a rough reconstruction, the lost records did not return.</p><p></p><p>And this was merely because the action of "seeing" brought about proximity.</p><p></p><p>Using the remaining essence of the source power, see if it can disguise as a celestial artifact and use the power of the Regression Technique to explore the true Celestial Ruins.</p><p></p><p>"And now that the Celestial Realm is destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>"After coming into contact with the Celestial Seal Characters, have any memories been restored?" Li Fan asked while observing the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan exclaimed in surprise again and again, immersed in the traces and ruins of a true celestial-grade grand formation. He seemed to ignore the crisis of his own aging and disappearance.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Fan had seen a real celestial-grade formation, not just a theoretical one.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, I don't know how to express it to Senior. In any case, it was a very magical experience. Although it indeed no longer exists, it felt like instantly flying to another extremely distant world. It felt too profound, I really don't know if it was my true realization or an illusion amidst the confusion of life and death." Sun Luyao said slowly, his tone quite dreamy.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the formation ruins I just scanned above are clearly here. But when I get close, I can't see them anymore..."</p><p></p><p>"Much stronger than before." Sun Luyao emphasized.</p><p></p><p>The intention of death completely vanished, like a withered tree meeting spring. Even the lingering aura of the Xuan-Huang Realm's protective grand formation could not shake those few miserable souls that were previously like candles in the wind.</p><p></p><p>But after "returning" and opposing the Celestial Realm, perhaps there were some changes, which is why he asked.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Once the thought arose, it was like a surging flood, difficult to suppress. It was actually the Xuan-Huang Celestial Heart Mantra that automatically circulated to suppress the desire.</p><p></p><p>It was like the merciless trampling of a terrifying behemoth, leaving marks that even space itself was branded with a sense of vicissitude.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>After hearing his words, Li Fan's thoughts paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was clearer than what was seen on the surface.</p><p></p><p>In his contemplation, Li Fan's divine sense also found a way to break the concealment of the original protective grand formation of the Xuan-Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was already able to move and talk to himself within the aura of the grand formation. He glanced at Sun Luyao and smiled slightly, "What, you want to learn?"</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's guidance, traces of the formation lines gradually appeared on the ancient mirror surface of the Limitless Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"For me, relying on my divine sense to try it out while my true body makes full preparations to return at any time, the risk is not very high. Hmm... It just so happens that waiting for the final act to arrive in this world will take a long time. I can plan carefully..."</p><p></p><p>As for the Limitless Mirror Sun Luyao, he seemed to be too shocked to react, just staring blankly and allowing Li Fan's divine sense to rapidly weaken. Without any reminder.</p><p></p><p>Although there were only a few strokes, it allowed Li Fan, who claimed to be at the peak of formations in the mortal realm, to gain a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Se... Senior!"</p><p></p><p>"This is called the Profound Art of Life and Death. Reversing life into death, no life no death."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao trembled and dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>After holding back for a while, he slowly said, "Senior's divine might is really beyond my imagination..."</p><p></p><p>From the glimpse of a corner of the formation, the scale of the original protective grand formation was unexpectedly large.</p><p></p><p>If the discovered details were proportionally enlarged into the model derived from the Doomsday Separation Disc, then theoretically speaking, the scope of the original protective grand formation was actually more than several dozen times larger than the initial Xuan-Huang Realm!</p><p></p><p>Completely in-</p><p></p><p>Understood! Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It makes sense!</p><p></p><p>"Where did the problem occur?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned. After a brief contemplation, he continued to activate the Infinite Mirror to illuminate the remaining remnants of the formation.</p><p></p><p>As the actual data of the original Primordial Boundary Protection Formation gradually became complete, and some key formation nodes appeared, Li Fan modified the extrapolated formation model.</p><p></p><p>He realized the reason why the theory did not match the reality.</p><p></p><p>In the previous extrapolation, the Boundary Protection Formation was merely a large formation covering and enveloping the Xuanhuang Realm. In fact, at the same position, this Primordial Formation folded upon itself several times in slightly different forms!</p><p></p><p>Layered and converging inward, compressing and transforming, it formed the true Xuanhuang Boundary Protection Formation!</p><p></p><p>"Simply by stacking, it increased the potential of the formation several times. Moreover, if the folded formation is unfolded, it can instantly unleash the power of the formation's upper limit under normal conditions."</p><p></p><p>"More importantly, if the Xuanhuang Realm itself expands its territory, the Boundary Protection Formation can also perfectly expand the formation to the new territory through this continuous unfolding. Even if the connection with the Immortal Realm is temporarily severed, as long as one grasps the control of the Primordial Boundary Protection Formation, the perfect state of the formation can always be maintained in this way."</p><p></p><p>The Doomsday Dissociation Disc in the main body released its power to the limit, helping the avatar deep within Xuanhuang to comprehend the Primordial Boundary Protection Formation.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the Infinite Mirror's faint light probing, which already had a certain degree of analysis function, Li Fan was able to relatively smoothly convert the formation remnants into his own knowledge step by step.</p><p></p><p>During the research process, Li Fan discovered that the Primordial Formation frequently used the technique of formation folding.</p><p></p><p>Any seemingly simple formation structure might conceal thousands or even tens of thousands of extremely complex formation units.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure that no omissions would lead to failure in analyzing the formation, Li Fan had no choice but to slow down the deciphering speed.</p><p></p><p>Not missing any details, he thoroughly illuminated everything with the Infinite Mirror. However, this was a torment for Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was already accustomed to being exhausted to the point of fatigue, such high-intensity work still made him miserable.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he had just done something wrong, so Sun Luyao felt guilty. At this moment, he could only grit his teeth and endure.</p><p></p><p>And before Li Fan finished analyzing the Primordial Boundary Protection Formation, he still wouldn't really let the Infinite Mirror disintegrate. He would still accurately save Sun Luyao with the essence of source power before he collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed, and the formation analysis was already mostly completed.</p><p></p><p>Arriving outside the central core area.</p><p></p><p>After careful comprehension, Li Fan determined that this sense of crisis did not come from the Primordial Formation itself, but from other aspects.</p><p></p><p>"There's a restriction here?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Luyao!" He skillfully ordered.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao responded, mustering his extremely fatigued spirit, and carefully searched the surroundings again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, apart from the formation remnants, no abnormalities were found!" After completing the search, Sun Luyao couldn't wait to report back.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and said, "Search again!"</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan personally guided the faint light of the Infinite Mirror, using the method of investigating "folding" to re-examine the space outside the core of the Primordial Formation.</p><p></p><p>As expected! A circle of warning restrictions that had completely concealed their traces under normal conditions through multiple foldings was discovered!</p><p></p><p>The aura of the warning restrictions was also ancient.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Primordial Formation remnants, it had a somewhat superficial feeling. The core power had already disappeared, leaving only an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>However, it was this empty shell that still brought Li Fan a fatal sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>"It should have the same origin as the Xuanhuang Primordial Formation, both being the handiwork of the upper realm." Without tampering, after careful investigation, Li Fan came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"If the restrictions were complete, even with the accumulation of more than ten generations of the Xuanhuang Realm, I'm afraid I would be helpless against it. Fortunately, such a terrifying Immortal restriction has already been broken by predecessors!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan discovered the loophole in the restrictions.</p><p></p><p>To be cautious, he split off a divine soul to probe. After confirming it was not a trap, he then brought the Infinite Mirror and entered the central core area through the loophole in the restrictions.</p><p></p><p>After a brief darkness.</p><p></p><p>When light shone again, what appeared before Li Fan's eyes was no longer an empty void.</p><p></p><p>But a bizarre device.</p><p></p><p>Composed of countless concentric circles of different sizes. They had the same core, but the circular rings were distributed in different positions.</p><p></p><p>Using the word "countless" to describe it was not an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>It was because the number of circular rings that made up this strange device truly could not be counted clearly with divine sense or eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even though it had lost its power source and remained motionless, it still seemed to be constantly changing its quantity.</p><p></p><p>Focusing attention on this device, the world before one's eyes itself seemed to split into separate branches.</p><p></p><p>"My existence is being weakened?"</p><p></p><p>Alarm bells rang in Li Fan's split soul. Not only this split soul, but even the main body hiding in the Myriad Immortal Alliance's Extrapolation Jade space felt a terrifying pressure of crisis as if it were substantial.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's split soul very wisely instantly gave up probing that strange circular ring device.</p><p></p><p>The splitting and sense of crisis thus instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to recall the appearance of that circular ring device in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He found that although he could restore it, the number of circular rings on the device was fixed. Moreover, it was not consistent with the actual object he had seen before, having an extremely obvious but indescribable difference.</p><p></p><p>What was even more startling to Li Fan was that each time he recalled, the number of circular rings on the device that appeared was different.</p><p></p><p>Yet his intuition told him that each recall was correct.</p><p></p><p>This eerie scene couldn't help but remind Li Fan of the quantum superposition state he had heard of before crossing over.</p><p></p><p>"This circular ring device seems to be a remnant from the Immortal Realm as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan changed his method, focusing his attention not on the circular ring device itself, but on the missing parts of the device.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that something was missing from those circular rings.</p><p></p><p>It was not Li Fan's speculation, but the existence of mural-like surroundings that had already described what this strange device should have originally looked like.</p><p></p><p>The endless circular ring device patterns formed the entirety of the mural. Similarly, the number of circular rings on these devices in the painting were all different.</p><p></p><p>However, all the devices had one thing in common.</p><p></p><p>That was, in the center of the circular rings, a bead was floating.</p><p></p><p>A scarlet bead that seemed to be engraved with the pattern of nine stars.</p>

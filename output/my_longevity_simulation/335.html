        <h1>Chapter 335</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sound of someone calling out reached his ears. Li Fan was stunned for a moment before realizing they were calling for him.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, it was because he was not yet familiar with his avatar's name.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, he had just been pondering the advice given by Supreme Immortal Jicheng.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, Immortal Jicheng's vision far surpassed Li Fan's current level.</p><p></p><p>His high-level guidance was indeed worthy of careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan had planned to use the Derivation Jade to derive the "Art of Sitting on the Mountain" to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Because the original version of the "Art of Sitting on the Mountain" was only a Golden Core cultivation method, now that Li Fan had already cultivated to the Golden Core stage, he would not be able to progress further.</p><p></p><p>And the characteristics of the "Art of Sitting on the Mountain" were simply too suitable for Li Fan, he really couldn't bear to give it up.</p><p></p><p>However, Immortal Jicheng's words had enlightened Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>For him now, a Nascent Soul cultivation method was truly unappetizing to eat but a pity to discard.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the "Art of Sitting on the Mountain" would be his main cultivation method for a considerably long time in the future.</p><p></p><p>And he possessed the ability to restart from [Huan Zhen]. In this life, he could inquire about the origin of the Tiandu Huayu Pill from Han Yi, and in the next life, he could seize the opportunity to obtain it for himself.</p><p></p><p>Then, in one step, he could derive the Immortal Ascension version of the "Art of Sitting on the Mountain".</p><p></p><p>"Try to let the Derivation Jade derive those techniques with special effects." Li Fan's thoughts turned, and in an instant, several plans flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"As for the specifics, I can make plans after seeing the Derivation Jade."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing that makes one suspicious is, why would Immortal Jicheng offer me guidance?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it because a person's words are virtuous when they are about to die, or simply because I recognized that Qingyun Willow?"</p><p></p><p>"The 'Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture' clearly records that this kind of willow tree is very common. It is distributed in almost every state. The fact that I can recognize it shouldn't be anything special."</p><p></p><p>When it came to these powerhouses at the top of the food chain in the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan always speculated about them with the worst of malice.</p><p></p><p>"The possibility of them showing kindness for no reason is very small. Perhaps there was a slip-up somewhere..."</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan's main body suddenly opened his eyes and began searching for information on "Qingyun Willow".</p><p></p><p>A moment later, his expression couldn't help but become a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>He then searched for information on Mogu Bamboo, Qingye Wood, Wuwang Flower, Hundred Spirits Eagle, Nine Refinement Deer, and hundreds of other plants and creatures recorded in the "Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture".</p><p></p><p>The result left Li Fan somewhat torn between laughter and tears.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that, whether due to the passage of time, the changes of the years leading to natural evolution of species, or some other reason, many of the originally very common flora and fauna recorded in the "Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture" had become rare in the current era.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Qingyun Willow planted by Immortal Jicheng, nowadays it only had a small distribution in some areas of Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>And as far as Li Fan knew, Immortal Jicheng was born in the wilderness of Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it is because of this reason that Immortal Jicheng showed some care for my avatar?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, the older one gets, the more one cherishes the past, it's human nature."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These various thoughts seemed complex, but actually only occurred in a single moment.</p><p></p><p>Inside Tianquan City, in the Tianji Academy, Ximen Yue sized up Li Fan with interest and asked, "Fellow Daoist Xiao seemed a bit distracted just now? What were you thinking about?"</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, after they left the small courtyard where Immortal Jicheng was, that blue-robed cultivator brought them to this garden and told them to wait here.</p><p></p><p>Later, someone would come to lead them to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This garden was not large, but it had small bridges over flowing water and artificial mountains surrounding it.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, the scenery in the garden changed in sequence from spring to summer to autumn to winter.</p><p></p><p>Growth, prosperity, withering, death - four different scenes appeared in a single painting.</p><p></p><p>It was quite magical.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood up from the stream, looked at this fantastical scene of the four seasons intertwined before him, clasped his hands behind his back, and slowly said, "Don't laugh at me for saying this. I was pondering a question earlier."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Ximen Yue was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly is the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" Li Fan turned his head, his eyes burning as he stared at Ximen Yue.</p><p></p><p>"The headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance? Of course it's in..." Ximen Yue chuckled, about to say something, but suddenly his expression froze and his words halted.</p><p></p><p>"In..." His brows furrowed as he pondered for a long time, but couldn't come up with an answer.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Yi interjected, "Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, Tianquan, these four states are the core territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. I suppose the headquarters of the alliance must be at the central intersection of these four states."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Han's guess is very reasonable, it's just a pity..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and said with a smile, "I once wandered around Tianyu State for a period of time. I also tried to pass through the Devouring Primordial White Mist Wall at the state border."</p><p></p><p>"These four states seem to be tightly adjacent, there shouldn't be any other places in between."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, perhaps it's because my cultivation is low and I can't perceive it even if it's right in front of me." Li Fan didn't state it as a certainty.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yue said at this point, "There are countless minor worlds within our Myriad Immortals Alliance's territory. It's very possible that the headquarters is established in a minor world somewhere in the four states."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan smiled faintly, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he thought leisurely, "Everyone knows the Myriad Immortals Alliance has a headquarters. But where exactly this headquarters is located, very few people know."</p><p></p><p>"How mysterious. Having the opportunity to explore it this time is truly a fortunate event."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi snapped open his fan with a clack, finding Li Fan's fixation on this question a bit unnecessary. "Why bother creating trouble for yourself? In a moment we'll go there in person, and then we'll know."</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case." Although Li Fan thought this in his heart, he nodded with a smile and didn't refute it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he started chatting with Han Yi, "Speaking of which, when I found this [Reincarnation Longevity Fruit] in the Fallen Immortal Realm earlier, I thought this time the Immortal's bounty would at least be able to get second place. I never imagined there would always be someone better."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, looking at Han Yi with an admiring expression. "Fellow Daoist Ximen Yue's five-hundred-year longevity fruit was already unimaginably precious."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Han to actually find a treasure that can extend life by eight hundred years, it's really..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ximen Yue was also full of curiosity and asked on Li Fan's behalf, "That Tiandu Huayu Pill, where exactly did Fellow Daoist find it?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be related to Immortal Lanyu from Yuandao State?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also stared intently at Han Yi, eagerly awaiting his answer.</p><p></p><p>Being looked at by the two people beside him with envious gazes, Han Yi couldn't help but feel a bit smug.</p><p></p><p>Chuckling, he fanned himself with a flourish and said, "It's nothing much. Now that the precious pill has been handed over, there's no harm in telling you."</p><p></p><p>"Have you two ever heard of the [Lanyu Treasure Box]?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's voice carried a hint of pride as he slowly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Lanyu Treasure Box?" Ximen Yue repeated, his eyes showing some confusion.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan seemed lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>However, he also didn't answer, and instead similarly shook his head, watching Han Yi's performance.</p>

            <p>"This dark power may indeed help us escape from the Immortal Ruins. ↤↤↤↤↤ ➅➈Ｓᕼ𝓾𝕏.匚๏ϻ ↦↦↦↦↦ But that should be under the circumstances where we can safely control it."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression turned serious: "If the world is eroded by this darkness, I'm afraid the consequences won't be much better than falling into the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>While the two were talking, as if receiving some kind of nourishment, the darkness occupying half of Mo Rubin's body suddenly expanded again.</p><p></p><p>Almost completely engulfing the entire corpse.</p><p></p><p>However, strangely, the rhythmic pulsation emanating from his body never ceased.</p><p></p><p>It was even clearer than before.</p><p></p><p>Like the trembling of a beating heart, echoing in this dark desolate land. Gradually giving Li Fan an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>Several Dharma transmitters in the team also seemed to sense that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>They quickly issued an order to temporarily stay away.</p><p></p><p>Only after retreating some distance did the strong uneasiness in Li Fan's heart slowly disappear.</p><p></p><p>"My suggestion is to completely seal off this desolate area. Before figuring out the true nature of the dark power, do not approach Mo Rubin's corpse again."</p><p></p><p>"After I return, I will also immediately report this discovery to the council. Once there is news, I will inform you all at the first opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan being so cautious, Dharma Transmitter Zhou nodded in agreement on the surface, but actually felt it was a bit of an overreaction. 💚♢❻❾𝐒ᕼ𝐔𝔁.𝐂𝕆ｍ😲💞</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, there's no need to be overly tense. Regardless, the nature of this dark power being contrary to the Immortal Ruins will not change. This also means it will not invade the mortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan shook his head and didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>With Mo Rubin dead, Li Fan had no reason to stay here any longer.</p><p></p><p>Although the revenge trip ended abruptly, the discovery of this dark power was of great significance.</p><p></p><p>Bidding farewell to the members of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, Li Fan quickly gathered the members of the joint council's various departments and recounted his experience in the dark desolate land.</p><p></p><p>"The power of darkness..."</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers Daoist was the first to speak.</p><p></p><p>After all, as someone who survived from ancient times, although Hundred Flowers' cultivation was not very high, he was indeed knowledgeable.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have heard a Daoist friend mention something similar back then."</p><p></p><p>"He personally witnessed from afar his hometown falling into the Immortal Ruins, all things disintegrating, forming a strange distorted ring of dreamlike scenes."</p><p></p><p>"According to his description, at the same time the cultivation world completely disappeared into the Immortal Ruins, a large amount of matter also seemed to spew out in the opposite direction."</p><p></p><p>"Invisible to the naked eye and divine sense, he was unfortunately grazed by it and was immediately severely injured. 👹💗６➈𝓼Ⓗυ𝔁.𝓒𝓸๓😝ൠ Even after recovering later, he turned into a state neither human nor ghost."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the horrifying image of a cultivator with a face full of squirming black holes drawn by Hundred Flowers Daoist, everyone's expressions couldn't help but turn solemn.</p><p></p><p>Ingenious Artisan also seemed to recall something: "When the power of the Immortal Ruins first enveloped [Ancestor], we were actually quite confident about surviving the tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"Because according to the strength of Ancestor's remaining body at that time, it was enough to resist the attractive force of the Immortal Ruins. But later on, while the attractive force of the Immortal Ruins grew stronger..."</p><p></p><p>Ingenious Artisan had a look of sudden realization: "The fundamental reason was the daily weakening of Ancestor's strength! As if</p><p></p><p>"Something crucial is constantly being lost, causing the ancestor's body to slowly decay."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that what has disappeared is most likely this dark power as well."</p><p></p><p>After hearing their words, Li Fan pondered: "You mean that the dark power is actually a part of the cultivation system of the cultivators. It's just that its natural properties are opposite to the attractive force of the Immortal Ruins, so it was forcibly stripped away in the process of approaching the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"In other cultivation worlds, the dark power would be detached because of this. But in the Xuanhuang Realm, for some unknown reason, it all gathered in one place, still bound to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If one day, the Xuanhuang Realm can break free from the Immortal Ruins, the dark power should return to all things in the Xuanhuang world."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Li Fan's analysis, Qiaogong Jushi and Baihua Daoren both nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Liu Ruchen of the Medicine King Sect suddenly spoke: "Although I have never personally seen this so-called dark power, I once read a legend in an ancient book."</p><p></p><p>"It is about the origin of humans, circulating among various human tribes."</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning, there were no humans or various cultivation realms in the world. In the absolute void, a few powerful creatures wandered. Later, one of them felt bored, so he used himself as material to create and open up worlds one after another."</p><p></p><p>"Slowly, the void gradually became full. Other beings were also gradually attracted by these strange and wonderful worlds, and they all followed suit, using themselves as prototypes to create various different races."</p><p></p><p>"And the ancestor of humans was the one who originally created the realms."</p><p></p><p>This legend was obviously the first time everyone had heard it, and they all listened with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"Although the world became much livelier, these powerful beings soon discovered an anomaly. Because all the beings they created could not be immortal like themselves, and had the so-called lifespan limit."</p><p></p><p>"The liveliness was only temporary, and the world would soon return to silence. Occasional creation was for their own interest, but if they had to keep creating like this, it would become a burden."</p><p></p><p>"So the powerful beings lost interest in the lives they created one after another."</p><p></p><p>"But there was one who was not like this. He was unwilling to see his creations disappear just like that, so he actually defeated his companions and extracted power from them to bestow upon all the creatures in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the creatures of the world gained the ability to reproduce."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Liu Ruchen suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was listening with great interest and gestured with their eyes for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen shrugged: "There's nothing more below."</p><p></p><p>"Nothing but some words about thanking the gods for the grace of creation."</p><p></p><p>"The reason I associate it with the dark power is because perhaps we can get inspiration from it to study what impact losing or gaining the dark power has on us cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"If this dark power originally existed within us and was only separated due to the appearance of the Immortal Ruins, doesn't that mean that we are now..."</p><p></p><p>"Incomplete?"</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the cultivators before the appearance of the Immortal Ruins, how are we different?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiaogong Jushi's face slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"I said, since the Immortal Ruins Catastrophe occurred, my comprehension and creativity seem to be far inferior to before?"</p>

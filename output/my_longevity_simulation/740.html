        <h1>Chapter 740</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't until you mentioned that the young man Guan Changge might have been swallowed by the Infinite Wall that I remembered. New69book.com"</p><p>Nangong Shirong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Lord has entered the Infinite Wall before and broken through, then surely rescuing Guan Changge would be an easy task, right?" One of the accompanying cultivators named Yan Yiqiu quickly flattered.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong's face darkened: "I don't dare to guarantee it. Whether he succeeds or not, it depends on the young man's own luck."</p><p></p><p>Trying to butter up the wrong person, Yan Yiqiu's expression turned bitter as he quickly lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xu Bai spoke up: "Lord, what is so extraordinary about this Infinite Wall?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong looked at the curious Xu Bai, pondered for a moment, and then explained: "I can't say for certain, I can only speculate based on my own experience. This Infinite Wall may be a natural place of enlightenment. When scenes appear on it, there is a chance that nearby cultivators will be drawn into it."</p><p></p><p>"And within the Infinite Wall..." </p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong's eyes narrowed: "It's like activating the 'Enlightenment' function of the Heavenly Mirror. No, it's even more powerful than that. Just a thought, and countless realizations will come pouring in. That effortless joy, I still remember it vividly."</p><p></p><p>"But there is a downside. This enhanced comprehension ability seems to only apply to the 'Dao' that you are most passionate about. At the time, I was completely focused on trying to comprehend..."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong paused, skipping over the details of his own cultivation, and then continued: "I was already on the verge of a breakthrough. Under the multiplied enlightenment boost, I didn't take long at all to achieve sudden enlightenment. So I naturally broke through the wall."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai glanced at the Infinite Wall, and based on the clues he had gathered before, thoughtfully said: "It is said that Guan Changge greatly admires Guan Xingxiu. He is extremely reverent towards Senior Guan's sword techniques... But he himself lacks the talent for the Dao of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps even with the enlightenment boost from the Infinite Wall, it would be difficult for him to make any substantial progress in less than a decade or so. Could this be the true reason for his disappearance?"</p><p></p><p>"And the scenes that the cultivators who accompanied Guan Changge saw on the Infinite Wall were precisely of cultivators practicing sword techniques, which is consistent with your speculation..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai quickly laid out his deductions, but only referred to them as Nangong Shirong's speculations.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong neither confirmed nor denied it.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he added: "The flow of time inside and outside the Infinite Wall may not be the same. Moreover, if one stays in the Infinite Wall for too long, even if they succeed in enlightenment, they may not be able to get out."</p><p></p><p>"So we must hurry to save that young man Guo Changge's life."</p><p></p><p>Yan Yiqiu then spoke up: "Then, Lord, how do we enter the Infinite Wall?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong turned his head, his expression becoming somewhat unpleasant: "You're asking me?"</p><p></p><p>"I dare not!" Yan Yiqiu quickly explained.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong snorted coldly: "If I knew how to do it, why would I have brought you all here?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Yiqiu inwardly cursed himself, wishing he could slap himself.</p><p></p><p>But before Nangong Shirong finished speaking, Xu Bai had already flown back to the base of the Infinite Wall.</p><p></p><p>He pondered to himself: "Since it is not something bizarre, but a natural place of enlightenment, then with my affinity for the Dao, I should be able to sense something."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After observing for a long time, there was still no abnormality detected, just as before. Xu Bai thought for a moment, then directly extended his hands and touched the wall.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes and remained motionless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of Nangong Shirong, Yan Yiqiu and the other three also imitated Xu Bai's actions, directly exploring the boundless wall with their hands.</p><p></p><p>In front of the mirror-like brilliance, it was as if four stone statues had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's persistent perception, the originally hard wall in front of him seemed to gradually become softer.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Xu Bai did not resist.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he allowed the boundless wall to swallow his body.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in the exclamation of Yan Yiqiu and the others, Xu Bai instantly disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong stared fixedly at the place where Xu Bai had disappeared, his eyes flashing with an indescribable expression.</p><p></p><p>Since he had previously learned the secret of this boundless wall from Nangong Shirong, at the moment of entering it, what Xu Bai was thinking was "how to move this boundless wall".</p><p></p><p>Originally, he did not have any real expectations about this, so when countless thoughts spontaneously surged in his mind, Xu Bai was still somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, it was obvious that he had wasted this opportunity for enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the answer given by the boundless wall itself, it is impossible to move it without affecting its enlightenment function.</p><p></p><p>The birth of the boundless wall was a purely accidental event. Even the heavens and the earth themselves cannot easily replicate it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai felt a little regretful, but he soon regained his normal state of mind.</p><p></p><p>After completing a round of enlightenment, Xu Bai was not expelled by the boundless wall. So he began to search for Guan Changge's traces within it.</p><p></p><p>The scene here was somewhat similar to the interior of the "Root of Heaven and Earth", where the cultivators' bodies existed in the form of abstract, distorted lines. However, in the Root of Heaven and Earth, the lines were more orderly and simple, while here they were draped in colorful and dazzling hues, swaying like seaweed floating in the water.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai keenly perceived that as time passed, some of the lines that made up the body were slowly dissolving, merging with the boundless wall.</p><p></p><p>And the blurred, lifeless figures he occasionally saw, which had only the outer contours remaining, seemed to be the traces left behind by cultivators who had entered the boundless wall but failed to leave.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly traversing the boundless wall, Xu Bai soon found Guan Changge based on the fluctuations he sensed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Guan Changge's body had been dissolved into the size of a seven or eight-year-old child, but he was completely unaware of it. He was holding a few sparse lines representing a "sword" and clumsily waving it.</p><p></p><p>"Guan Changge!" Xu Bai tried to call out, attempting to wake him up.</p><p></p><p>But in the boundless wall space, "sound" did not exist. Only some lines seemed to flow from Xu Bai's body and disappear into the surroundings, without catching Guan Changge's attention at all.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then flew directly to the other's side and snatched the "sword" from his hand.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, he tried to take Guan Changge with him as he prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>But at the last moment, the part of Guan Changge that Xu Bai had grasped actively detached from his body.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat surprised, Xu Bai looked at Guan Changge, who then shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>His body, which had shrunk even further, once again transformed into a sword. With a devoted and determined expression, he continued to wield it.</p><p></p><p>"Hearing the Dao in the morning, one can die content in the evening."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was slightly moved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he no longer insisted and, holding a part of Guan Changge, broke through the wall and left.</p>

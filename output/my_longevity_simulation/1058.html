        <h1>Chapter 1058</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Destroy the world? Isn't that a bit too extreme?" Li Fan's expression was somewhat stunned. "Right now, in the Dark Star Sea, only the Xuanhuang Realm remains as a relatively safe pure land..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Transmitter Wei interrupted him with a wave of his hand: "Hehe, young friend, you misunderstand. We don't really want to destroy the Xuanhuang Realm, but rather fabricate a disaster that ordinary cultivators cannot handle, requiring Jiang himself to personally resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we can lure Jiang over, then the two of us can persuade him face-to-face, and we should be able to convince him to investigate the current ruling group of five."</p><p></p><p>A hint of viciousness flashed in Transmitter Wei's eyes: "No matter how well the demons of the Xuantian Sect can disguise themselves, they absolutely cannot withstand the scrutiny of the 'Transmitter's Oath'!"</p><p></p><p>"Transmitter's Oath?" This was the first time Li Fan had heard this name, and he immediately asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Great Oath' that each of us had to take when we joined the Transmitters back then. In the name of the Transmitting Heavenly Venerate, facing countless comrades who have already sacrificed or are about to sacrifice, directly pointing to the heart and facing one's own divine soul."</p><p></p><p>"In that era, facing the fierce encirclement and suppression of the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao, not everyone could maintain their original intentions unchanged."</p><p></p><p>"And in order to distinguish the vermin within the ranks of the Transmitters, the scrutiny of the 'Transmitter's Oath' was indispensable! If a certain Transmitter betrayed their original oath, ten other Transmitters could gather and forcibly initiate the oath's scrutiny."</p><p></p><p>"Whether they have turned traitor or not, under the illumination and questioning of the inner light, it will be laid bare!" Transmitter Wei said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that since the establishment of the Immortal Alliance and the peace of all things, the scrutiny of the Transmitter's Oath has not been truly implemented for many years. Everyone has tacitly agreed to avoid talking about this matter. As if it never happened at all." At this moment, Transmitter Zhou's tone was cold as he interrupted Wei's words.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Wei's expression was somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"However, as long as we can gather ten Transmitters, we will surely be able to expose the Xuantian Sect's plot! Jiang's status is special, one person can be equivalent to five Transmitters. With the two of us added, that means we only need to find three more people to support us!" The white-haired Wei quickly changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"With Jiang's prestige, if he takes the lead, this is not a difficult matter!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded: "In our Myriad Realms United Association, there are many surviving cultivators from other immortal realms. The calamities that descended upon their worlds back then were all different. To create a disaster that can alarm Jiang..."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Li Fan said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Then the only thing that cannot be confirmed now... is what you said about Chen and the others being possessed by the demons of the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally thought the negotiation was about to be completed, but unexpectedly, the two Transmitters in front of him suddenly brought the topic back to the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou's tone became lazy again, and the urgency to save the Myriad Immortal Alliance disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Speculation is after all speculation. If there is no substantive evidence to allow the scrutiny of the highest ruling organization of the Immortal Alliance, then what will the Myriad Immortal Alliance become in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"You Myriad Realms United Association have been hunting down the remnants of the Xuantian Sect for so long, you must be very familiar with them. Can you find key evidence?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The one who spreads the teachings, Zhou, asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was silent for a moment, and then slowly said, "This person, Mo Rubin, is insidious and cunning. Many of the secret methods that could identify the members of the Xuantian Sect in the past have lost their effect on him. However..."</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, then said with confidence, "The Dharma Kings of the Xuantian Sect all cultivate the immortal realm techniques passed down by the Xuantian King in the past. They form their own lineage and are connected by the same energy. After completing their cultivation, they can sense each other."</p><p></p><p>"Based on this principle, we can create a miniature puppet that automatically runs the techniques of the Xuantian Sect's Dharma Kings. When holding this object, if there are Xuantian Sect members nearby, it will naturally generate a response..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan smiled and took out a palm-sized, jade-like, crystal-clear figurine and showed it to the two Dharma spreaders.</p><p></p><p>Zhou and Wei took the miniature puppet and examined it, both revealing surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because this white jade figurine seemed like a living being, with internal techniques circulating on their own.</p><p></p><p>One could even feel its constantly fluctuating life force!</p><p></p><p>Such a level of craftsmanship...</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance was no match!</p><p></p><p>Thus, they had a bit more trust in Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect's demon has been secretly controlling the Wanxian Alliance for five years. With such vast resources at their disposal, no matter what they are secretly planning, it is very dangerous," Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I also need to go back and report this discovery. I hope it will draw more attention from the organization."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan cupped his hands and was about to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>The two Dharma spreaders did not try to make him stay.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan left a disc engraved with "Wanjie" as a means of future contact, he hurriedly left Dharma spreader Zhou's private small world.</p><p></p><p>Zhou played with the Wanjie disc, his eyes showing a strange color.</p><p></p><p>As his divine sense entered the disc, it seemed as if he had arrived in a starry space. However, the vast majority was shrouded in yellow fog, and only the distorted light obscured by it could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>Only one dot of light representing Li Fan shone clearly and could be communicated with normally.</p><p></p><p>Zhou was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Those dots of light in the starry space each represented a cultivator from the Wanjie Alliance. And they could all communicate with them through this disc.</p><p></p><p>However, now only Li Fan's had obtained permission for contact, while the rest of the cultivators' were concealed by some force.</p><p></p><p>The other party's consent was needed to proceed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou showed the Wanjie disc to Dharma spreader Wei.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, white-haired Wei sighed lightly, "This Wanjie Alliance seems to really exist after all."</p><p></p><p>"Not just any force can possess such technology. And this puppet..."</p><p></p><p>"That fellow Huang is really derelict in his duty. Who knows when such an organization has emerged in the Xuanhuang Realm, yet we have no information at all."</p><p></p><p>Wei's face looked somewhat unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Zhou was noncommittal, "Let's wait until we see their so-called Eternal Realm experts before making a judgment. Everything else is just minor details. Only the Eternal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"...is something that cannot be faked and best demonstrates the foundation of an organization."</p><p></p><p>A trace of yearning appeared in Wei's eyes, "The Eternal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"If I weren't restricted by my identity as a Dharma spreader, I would have had a chance back then. What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou gave him a cold look, "Now you're trying to deceive even me?"</p><p></p><p>Wei just shook his head slightly, not arguing.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he suddenly said, "By the way, do a thorough investigation of those little fellows who carried out the mission this time."</p>

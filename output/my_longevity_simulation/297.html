        <h1>Chapter 297</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After some thought, instead of heading directly to the Huanyu Villa, Li Fan first went to the Tianxuan Mirror in Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>After entering his dedicated space within the Tianxuan Mirror, his avatar, far away in the Congyun Sea, paused his cultivation of the "Zaohua Honglu Gong" technique and began searching for rare and precious items that could enhance his soul perception and affinity.</p><p></p><p>Information about various items appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>After browsing through them, Li Fan selected the top-grade human treasure, the "Youhun Hairpin".</p><p></p><p>He then sent the Youhun Hairpin into the White Bone Vanguard Realm.</p><p></p><p>His main body immediately initiated a ritual to absorb the treasure within the Vanguard Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The "Huanzhen" in his dantian slowly transformed, eventually becoming half Seven Apertures Linglong Heart and half Youhun Hairpin in appearance.</p><p></p><p>Having done all this, Li Fan, who had returned to reality, finally rushed towards the Huanyu Villa.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan hoped that by transforming the Huanzhen into the Youhun Hairpin, he could increase the probability of identifying soul contracts.</p><p></p><p>As for why Li Fan didn't do this during the closed training, it was still out of consideration for his own safety.</p><p></p><p>There was no guarantee that the Huanyu Villa wasn't under someone's constant surveillance.</p><p></p><p>If his originally mediocre performance suddenly improved after exchanging for a treasure...</p><p></p><p>The obvious difference might attract the attention of others.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to take that risk.</p><p></p><p>Outside the villa, within the Tianxuan Mirror, there were far fewer concerns.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, from the current situation, the Tianxuan Mirror could still be temporarily trusted.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan entered the Huanyu Villa again, there was no trial of the linked formation. Instead, he appeared directly in front of Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!" Li Fan bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, so soon?" Ji Hongdao was a little surprised. "That's good, saves us from any more unexpected changes."</p><p></p><p>He sighed, looking somewhat haggard.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, Senior, what happened?" Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's hard to explain in a few words." As he re-issued a Huanyu Token to Li Fan and led him to meet Huangfu Song, Ji Hongdao explained to Li Fan the reason for suddenly summoning him back.</p><p></p><p>"What? Dantai Tao and more than a dozen others went out together to relax and met with an accident, unfortunately losing their lives?" Li Fan thought he had misheard and stared blankly at Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's shock was understandable, as this was a bit too absurd.</p><p></p><p>Dantai Tao was the most outstanding among all the cultivators in this training session.</p><p></p><p>In the first assessment, he had already obtained the two highest evaluations.</p><p></p><p>His soul contract identification rate had even reached an astonishing 100%.</p><p></p><p>It was clear to discerning eyes that such a person was bound to achieve extraordinary things in the future.</p><p></p><p>So inevitably, some cultivators deliberately sought to associate with him during training breaks.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Dantai Tao was polite and courteous to everyone.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he had extremely high standards and was only willing to associate with those cultivators who also ranked at the top in the assessments.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, over the course of about half a year, a small group gradually formed with Dantai Tao at its head.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen members, all with exceptional talent in formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation was also not weak, with the lowest being Golden Core cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Dantai Tao himself had even reached the Nascent Soul stage at a young age.</p><p></p><p>It would be no exaggeration to call these people the pride of heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, it was precisely this group of people who had met with an accident and died in Tianyu Prefecture, the heartland of the Myriad Immortals Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's expression, Ji Hongdao's words were also filled with regret: "Dantai Tao and the others said they had been cooped up for half a year and wanted to take advantage of the time before the start of the second stage of closed training to go out and play, relax, and sort out their mood."</p><p></p><p>"They were a group with strong abilities to begin with, and each had life-saving means gifted by their elders. Plus, this is Tianyu Prefecture, so there shouldn't be any danger."</p><p></p><p>"I thought about it and agreed to their request."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought..."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, a momentary lapse in judgment! A momentary lapse!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao sighed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"With more than a dozen people suddenly dying, the predetermined slots for the second stage were left vacant."</p><p></p><p>"To avoid waste, we had no choice but to select replacement members based on the results of the first round of assessments."</p><p></p><p>"This is also the reason for hastily summoning you back."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't feel that being a substitute was embarrassing in any way.</p><p></p><p>Compared to those inexplicably deceased genius cultivators, his luck was much better.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao waved his hand, interrupting Li Fan's questioning: "This matter has far-reaching implications. Knowing too much will only harm you instead."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and said no more.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan met Huangfu Song again.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, he said with a smile: "How about it, kid? My intuition is quite accurate. I said we'd meet again soon, and before long, you've returned."</p><p></p><p>"Senior's divine might!" Li Fan cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Senior..."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could finish, Huangfu Song's expression changed drastically upon hearing those words.</p><p></p><p>He slapped Li Fan, removing the memory seal while also cutting off Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you can't say such things carelessly," Huangfu Song said with a forced smile, his eyes unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine if you talk nonsense, but if someone takes it seriously..."</p><p></p><p>"These little fellows each have connections and great influence."</p><p></p><p>"Even Guan Xingxiu has been suspended. I definitely can't afford to offend them."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao impatiently said, "Both of you, say less."</p><p></p><p>Ending the conversation between the two.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao's status was clearly above Huangfu Song's. With him saying this, Huangfu Song indeed shut his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"You should return to the villa and wait first."</p><p></p><p>"The Huanyu Token has prepared another Convergence Pearl for you. Don't slack off during this time and seize the opportunity to gain insights," he instructed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your trouble, Senior."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao waved his hand, and Li Fan once again returned to the familiar villa.</p><p></p><p>However, whether it was still the same room he had previously stayed in was hard to say.</p><p></p><p>"Guan Xingxiu."</p><p></p><p>Recalling Huangfu Song's earlier words, Li Fan's heart stirred, and he began searching for information on Guan Xingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Commander of the Tianyu Prefecture Garrison..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, pondering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The so-called accident was likely just an excuse.</p><p></p><p>No matter how one looked at it, this matter reeked of conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Heavenly Venerate stepped down as the Chief Commander of the Garrison."</p><p></p><p>"I suppose the competition for this position has reached a white-hot stage."</p><p></p><p>"At this critical juncture, such a major case occurred in the jurisdiction of Guan Xingxiu, a strong contender. Causing him to be suspended..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that for the sake of this Chief Commander position, some people have gone a bit mad."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... no, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>"This framing method is too low-level and can be seen through at a glance. So it could also be Guan Xingxiu himself using a self-harming scheme."</p><p></p><p>"First, withdraw from the eye of the storm and fade from view. Then, catch the enemy off guard and seize victory through surprise."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's also possible that the opponent is using this mentality to blatantly frame him."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the truth, these so-called geniuses like Dantai Tao were easily crushed and turned into a means to attack political enemies in the eyes of the true power holders of the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"What use is high talent?"</p><p></p><p>"Once dead, it all becomes nothing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed inwardly, took out the golden Convergence Pearl, and skillfully extracted a wisp of his soul.</p>

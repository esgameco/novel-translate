        <h1>Chapter 586</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"After the cultivator dies, they still ascend to the heavens. Although it is said that the golden elixir is the condensation of the cultivator's insight into the laws of heaven and earth, it ultimately still needs to be based on the rare wonders of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Once they ascend to the heavens, the rare wonders lose their uniqueness, and the condensation method in the golden elixir loses its foundation. Not to mention a significant reduction in the quality of the golden elixir, over time, there will also be a risk of dispersion, making it difficult to preserve in the long term.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to involve his professional field. The Daoist Wood, when speaking, is right on the mark.</p><p></p><p>A rare color appeared on his face, and the tight wrinkles relaxed unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>"However, all these problems and troubles can be resolved easily if the cultivator volunteers.</p><p></p><p>"When the cultivator is alive, if the golden elixir is extracted, it will not trigger the mechanism of the malicious intent of heaven and earth. With the rare wonders of the world as the core, the golden elixir can be preserved for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Although the cultivator may lose all their cultivation and become no different from an ordinary person, it's just the realm of the golden elixir after all. Starting over again will not take much effort!</p><p></p><p>"With sufficient resources, in at most ten years, a new batch of golden elixirs can be condensed.</p><p></p><p>"Well, although the production cycle is still a bit long, considering the number of cultivators we have now, we can harvest hundreds of golden elixirs every year."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Wood spoke in the calmest manner, saying unsettling words.</p><p></p><p>"Long-term, stable, and harmless. Can that Zhang Debiao, that lucky rascal, compare with us?"</p><p></p><p>"He can't!"</p><p></p><p>"So, if fellow Daoists have any needs, they must prioritize us!"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Wood looked at Li Fan, a trace of eagerness flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan obviously wouldn't be convinced by such simple words, shaking his head repeatedly. "Fellow Daoist, don't deceive me. How can a cultivator willingly have their golden elixir dug out and go through a cycle of every ten years? Just the thought of it makes me feel horrified..."</p><p></p><p>"Misunderstanding, it's a misunderstanding!" Daoist Wood hastily interrupted Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"We can now extract the golden elixir painlessly and harmlessly. Those cultivators not only won't feel pain but will also experience a different kind of comfort. I even know a guy who, in order to continuously experience the pleasure of having his golden elixir extracted, immediately resumes his cultivation every time the golden elixir is taken out of his body."</p><p></p><p>"He is now one of our most efficient cultivators, on average cultivating a double law golden elixir every three to four years."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Wood completely disregarded any issues with what he was saying, enthusiastically explaining to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even the indifferent Li Fan couldn't help but feel a chill as he looked at Daoist Wood before him.</p><p></p><p>"So, all your worries are completely unnecessary, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"We are inspected and officially recognized by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. Think about it, we have to provide a certain amount of materials to the Immortals Alliance every year. If there were quality issues with these items, the Immortals Alliance would be the first to come knocking! So, fellow Daoist, rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, "The Immortals Alliance also knows what you're up to? But why have I never heard of it?"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Wood muttered quietly, "It's just that our philosophy is too advanced. The Alliance says that if it were to be made public, it would surely cause public misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>"So it's kept secret."</p><p></p><p>"These are all mere ordinary people who cannot understand. But figures like fellow Daoist should be able to understand our methods, right?"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Wood looked expectantly at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I understand to some extent, it's just a bit hard to accept at the moment," Li Fan said half-truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Wood seemed to have found a rare like-minded companion and applauded, "I knew it, I didn't read you wrong! Fellow Daoist possesses great wisdom!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stood up and paced back and forth, excitedly saying, "Like attracts like, it's natural. Fellow Daoist, you may not be able to completely reverse your mindset for now; it's normal!"</p><p></p><p>"However, I believe that once you personally see what we do, you will quickly change your mind!"</p><p></p><p>"So, fellow Daoist, would you like to visit?"</p><p></p><p>Without thinking, Li Fan was about to refuse directly.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, something beyond his expectations happened.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, looking at the aging and frail cultivator before him, and thinking about the countless golden elixirs waiting for him there, Li Fan inexplicably changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Alright! It doesn't hurt to take a look!"</p><p></p><p>He agreed.</p><p></p><p>The moment he said it, Li Fan was filled with shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>This gray-robed cultivator in front of him was undoubtedly many times more dangerous than he had imagined!</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to buy some cultivator's golden elixir, how did he end up in such a mess!</p><p></p><p>His luck was really too unfortunate!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cursed inwardly, silently repeating, "But..."</p><p></p><p>When he was halfway through, Li Fan stopped himself.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he suddenly felt that it wasn't such a big deal after all.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that it hadn't reached a point where things were really irreversible?</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was certified by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and wouldn't do anything as vile as profiting at the cost of lives.</p><p></p><p>And the planning in this world took a long time, and it had developed to its current state with much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts popped up in Li Fan's mind momentarily.</p><p></p><p>It made Li Fan convince himself, changing his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist of Wood, how should I address you, and how should I proceed?" Li Fan now had an expression of genuine interest, asking.</p><p></p><p>Slapping his head, Daoist Wood said somewhat regretfully, "Oops, almost forgot to introduce myself to fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"We are known as..."</p><p></p><p>"Life Extending Herbs."</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Li Fan's misconception, when Daoist Wood said the last sentence, his tone and expression suddenly became somewhat eerie.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment later, Daoist Wood returned to his highly enthusiastic expression.</p><p></p><p>"And as for how to go about it..."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, just hold onto me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally and effortlessly grabbed Daoist Wood's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Stay steady, fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud call from Daoist Wood, he muttered, "As the heavens and earth resemble wood, generating life and longevity day and night..."</p><p></p><p>As if a thick smoke rolled in, in the blink of an eye, everything around turned into a hazy gray.</p><p></p><p>Apart from continuously distorting light and the strange sounds whistling past, nothing else was visible.</p><p></p><p>He felt no sense of danger in his heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Even looking at the enveloping gray mist, a sense of belonging inexplicably surged within his heart.</p><p></p><p>As if he originally belonged there.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period, the gray mist dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery became clear.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, we have arrived!" </p><p></p><p>With Daoist Wood's call, Li Fan also observed the scene of Life Extending Herbs.</p><p></p><p>A tall, upright tree, withered and full of spots, standing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The branches were densely covered with countless cultivators, just like fruits on a tree.</p><p></p><p>The beginning of a new year brought a whole new shock to Li Fan.</p>

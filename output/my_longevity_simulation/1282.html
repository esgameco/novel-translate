        <h1>Chapter 1282</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1278: Seeking Survival Amidst Apocalyptic Destruction </p><p></p><p>"The fear is that the remains of that true immortal will come back to life."</p><p></p><p>As Mu Rubin uttered these words, Li Ping wasn't sure if it was just his illusion, but the depths of this dark sea seemed to have turned even colder. </p><p></p><p>It was as if some unknown existence had suddenly set its sights on him, causing a chill to rise in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor solemnly surveyed his surroundings but did not detect any lurking presences.</p><p></p><p>Looking again at the husk of Fang Dingge from the Great Dao Sect, Li Ping asked, "Having already turned into this state, can it still come back to life?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was naturally not asking about Fang Dingge, but rather that true immortal whose body had transformed into the dark sea and whose consciousness had become the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin also examined the nearby corpse and said softly, "Let me tell you a story."</p><p></p><p>"Our Nine Refinements Sect once enshrined a statue of our patriarch. It's said that it was personally crafted by the patriarch of the Nine Refinements, the Wondrous Dharma Monk, for himself."</p><p></p><p>"This statue was worshipped for thousands of years. Whenever disciples of the sect had any doubts on their cultivation path, as long as they prayed to it sincerely, the vast majority would receive a response from the mysterious void. Therefore, incense offerings never ceased over the many years."</p><p></p><p>"Later, one day, tribulation clouds suddenly enveloped the sky above the Nine Refinements Sect, and bolts of divine lightning struck down, targeting that patriarch statue! A human figure broke out of the statue and shot straight into the ninth heaven! This person's strength was so terrifyingly powerful that the ninth heaven god lightning capable of instantly annihilating Harmonized Dao cultivators was completely ineffective against him. He laughed incessantly amidst the lightning, looking like he would overcome the tribulation and ascend at any moment..."</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin paused again at the critical point. </p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time without the Holy Emperor urging him on, he could only hold his breath and continue, "The patriarch statue fragments that were originally scattered on the ground actually quietly gathered together again. They approached the tribulation transcender. Taking advantage of his lack of vigilance, it swallowed him back into the statue!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, no matter how much that figure struggled, he could no longer escape from the statue's encasement. The statue also broke through the void and ascended together with that figure!"</p><p></p><p>After hearing this somewhat mysterious story, Li Ping couldn't help frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin asked, "Guess which of the two who ascended together is our Nine Refinements Sect's patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered for a moment before answering, "The figure inside the statue needs to face the ascension tribulation. It should be him, right? Unable to ascend in his lifetime, he took the form of a stone statue and was worshipped by disciples, accumulating power for thousands of years in an attempt to ascend..."</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin smiled slightly, "Wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"The patriarch of our Nine Refinements Sect, the Wondrous Dharma Monk, has clear records of ascending to immortality in front of countless eyes. However, what only the successive sect masters of the Nine Refinements know is that the Wondrous Dharma Monk fell for unknown reasons in the second year after entering the immortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin continued with satisfaction, "However, that statue he personally crafted contained his contingency. Even if his divine soul was completely destroyed in the upper realm, he could still be reborn using this statue!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping frowned again, "Then who was the figure inside the statue?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin chuckled, "It was the third generation sect master of our Nine Refinements Sect. This person did not follow the patriarch's instructions and wanted to establish his own sect rules. After a round of internal strife, he was seriously injured in defeat and disappeared without a trace. Who would have thought he had been hiding inside the patriarch statue and actually managed to cultivate all the way to the ascension realm in one go."</p><p></p><p>"But in the end, he still ended up as someone else's stepping stone."</p><p></p><p>"The Wondrous Dharma Monk had only ascended for a year and didn't have much foundation, yet he could still be reborn using the stone statue. Not to mention that true immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Just look at this dark sea and you can imagine how powerful He was in life. To put it bluntly, don't use the perspective of us cultivators to speculate about the means of an immortal. They are truly worlds apart!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because they had communicated for some time, Mu Rubin's emotions had stabilized a lot. He spoke with deep feeling.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He felt there were still some inconsistencies in what the other party said about the Wondrous Dharma Monk being reborn using the statue and the entanglements with the third generation Nine Refinements sect master.</p><p></p><p>But after all, these were ancient secrets. At this moment, having ventured deep into danger, it was not the time to investigate thoroughly. </p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and take a look first. If the true immortal has already resurrected, there's no way He would still remain in the original spot after so many years." As Mu Rubin spoke, he circled around Fang Dingge's remains and continued diving into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>They passed through three formation barriers, some originally part of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation and others set up by later arrivals.</p><p></p><p>With the combined efforts of Li Ping and Mu Rubin, they finally reached the control center of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation after some effort.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they did not find the bones of the other four fallen Eternal Life realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The control center, clearly located in the deepest part of the entire dark expanse, was like a transparent observation deck.</p><p></p><p>Through the formation barrier entities surrounding this place on all sides, resembling panoramic glass, Li Ping and Mu Rubin could clearly see the full picture of the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>Even though it had been magnified countless times, they could still clearly see the human-like outline of the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin had obviously been here before and was not distracted by the magnificent sight before him. Instead, he came to the center of the observation deck.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"One piece of good news and one piece of bad news. Which do you want to hear first?" Mu Rubin asked.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Ping still responded, "Let's start with the good news."</p><p></p><p>"The good news is that the fallen true immortal did not resurrect using the remains," Mu Rubin said in a dark tone.</p><p></p><p>"Then what's the bad news?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin sneered, "You'll know when you come and look."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping walked slowly to where Mu Rubin was standing.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes suddenly changed, as if the lofty observation deck was rapidly falling.</p><p></p><p>The view of the dark sea below quickly approached and continuously enlarged.</p><p></p><p>It abruptly filled his vision, reaching deep into his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery changed, as if they had already left the dark sea and arrived in a completely unknown new place.</p><p></p><p>"Don't move."</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin's voice resounded in his mind. Feeling slightly reassured, Li Ping surveyed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He saw the other four fallen Eternal Life realm experts.</p><p></p><p>They maintained the postures of their final moments in life, but unlike Fang Dingge, their faces were covered in a layer of gray, making it impossible to see their specific features.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping tried to search for the culprit responsible for the demise of these five Eternal Life realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The gray vine-like substances extending from beneath the four Eternal Life realm corpses, intertwining and entangling together, caught Li Ping's attention.</p><p></p><p>In Li Ping's observation, these gray vines absolutely had no life aura and were purely inanimate objects formed from energy condensation.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, when facing them, Li Ping felt a sense of being targeted by a venomous snake.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Li Ping had no psychological barriers about asking when he didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'will to survive.' The will to survive of the true immortal's remains."</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin took a good while before slowly answering Li Ping's question.</p><p></p><p>"Will to survive?" Li Ping carefully pondered the meaning of these four words.</p><p></p><p>"True immortals cannot be judged by common sense. When Brother Xuanyuan was modifying the true immortal's remains back then, he had concerns in this regard. In order to prevent Him from resurrecting, he made many additional arrangements. But who would have thought..."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Ping couldn't see Mu Rubin's figure, he could sense him staring intently at the gray "will to survive" spread throughout this place.</p><p></p><p>"Logically speaking, the true immortal's remains that have already turned into a dark sea shouldn't be able to generate such a strong will to survive."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Mu Rubin's words, Li Ping also became pensive, "Unless someone deliberately triggered it."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. This person is no ordinary figure." Mu Rubin evaluated as such.</p><p></p><p>"Firstly, being able to break Brother Xuanyuan's restrictions is no simple feat. Secondly, being able to trigger the will of the true immortal's remains is also remarkable. Thirdly, being able to escape unscathed after triggering the will to survive... impressive." Mu Rubin praised without any hint of exaggeration in his tone.</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate these things. Even if it were the two of us, if we're not careful and get targeted by them, I'm afraid it would be difficult to escape death. We would end up like these five empty shells."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping frowned slightly. He still had some confidence in his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin didn't argue with Li Ping but continued to explain in a low voice, "When the will to survive of someone who has already died is reignited, it's like grasping the last lifeline, and the power that erupts..."</p><p></p><p>"Instinctively devours all the life it can come into contact with, converting it into nourishment for its own resurrection. Only those with strength like Brother Xuanyuan's can barely resist. Although you and I may appear strong, we still fall far short."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Mu Rubin continued, "Fortunately, the person who triggered this back then didn't destroy Brother Xuanyuan's arrangements. After this 'will to survive' drained these four Eternal Life realm experts, it could no longer find any targets to absorb and thus fell into silence again."</p><p></p><p>"If it were to escape the dark sea..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the entire Xuanhuang Realm would become its prey."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping instantly became extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"But then again, Brother Xuanyuan's methods are not so easily broken. This triggering person, who you call the Dharma Transmitter, also didn't directly destroy the dark sea's restrictions. He didn't even change them and added his own techniques on top."</p><p></p><p>"Let's get to work first." Just when Li Ping was worried that Mu Rubin would become frenzied and out of control, Mu Rubin suddenly became calm again.</p><p></p><p>He transmitted a large amount of information into Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation?" Li Ping immediately saw through the profound mysteries within.</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, it's the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation modified by Brother Xuanyuan. The original version of the Ascension Formation was created by a great demonic cultivator. Heh, this person was a true peerless fiend. He was of humble birth and his cultivation aptitude was also insufficient, reaching his limit at the Golden Core stage. But he stubbornly created this fiendish formation. As long as the formation enveloped an area, everything inside would be refined into the purest energy."</p><p></p><p>"He started with small mortal worlds, gradually increasing in strength. Who knows how many worlds and living beings he exterminated before finally ascending to the immortal realm. The first thing he did after arriving in the immortal realm was to improve the formation, intending to repeat his old tricks there. Hmph, even such a character died as easily as a fly during the immortal realm's tribulation. All the treasures he accumulated in his lifetime conveniently fell into Brother Xuanyuan's hands. However, Brother Xuanyuan was very disdainful of his legacy..." Mu Rubin said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Someone so violent and cruel can also attain the Dao and become an immortal? Is the immortal tribulation in his world different from the Xuanhuang Realm's?" Li Ping asked with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Because in Li Ping's memory, in the Xuanhuang Realm, the difficulty of the heavenly tribulation faced by such villains during their tribulation was dozens of times greater than usual. There was no possibility of successfully transcending the tribulation. Hence, he asked this question.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how powerful the heavenly tribulation is, there is a limit in the lower realms. As long as you're stronger than it, that's enough. Moreover, good and evil... actually have no definitive conclusion..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping could clearly feel that as Mu Rubin spoke, he once again fell into a state of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"What do you need me to do?" Li Ping timely shifted Mu Rubin's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Your attainments in formations shouldn't be much inferior to Brother Xuanyuan's. The control center of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation here cannot be recklessly disturbed. If possible, add another layer of formations to compress this place further into the dark sea. Then, sever the connection between the formation-controlling magic treasure in the hands of the Myriad Immortal Alliance and the grand formation." The clear-headed Mu Rubin said as such.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping nodded. While observing the formation details around him, he...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He compared it with the Ascension Formation diagrams that appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Profound Heavenly King, truly the most outstanding genius in the Profound Yellow Realm in ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>As a fellow formation master, after sensing the exquisiteness of the formation here, Li Ping couldn't help but feel a sense of appreciation and resonance with the other party.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the source power from the prayers of the Youzu people, after being absorbed and transformed by the Dark Sea, which was the remains of the True Immortals, condensed deep within the formation.</p><p></p><p>It looked like just an irregular accumulation, but Li Ping vaguely saw that through some means, these forces that could contend with True Immortals could be instantly unleashed.</p><p></p><p>To propel the Profound Yellow Realm and escape the control of the True Immortals of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Using a mortal formation to harness the power of True Immortals, impressive."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not find any trace of the original grand formation of the Profound Yellow Realm inside the Dark Sea formation. The formation here should have been created by the Profound Heavenly King alone. Even as a fallen True Immortal, it was enough to demonstrate Xuanyuan Hong's extraordinary attainments in formations.</p><p></p><p>"Reinforcing the formation requires some auxiliary materials..." Li Ping observed for a while and then said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"I have them here." Mo Rubin said immediately. </p><p></p><p>It seemed he was prepared. When the two returned from the hiding place of the "Will to Survive" to the formation's core, he took out a pile of materials.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping lightly checked them and they were all needed to reinforce the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me like that, I borrowed your face after all."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, why are you also faceless? Could it be that you have some connection with the True Immortal who saved Brother Xuanyuan back then? I'm timid, don't scare me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping ignored Mo Rubin's crazy talk and began to focus on arranging the formation.</p><p></p><p>With the precedent of the Profound Heavenly King as a reference, Li Ping only needed to follow the example. It was not a difficult task for him.</p><p></p><p>As the formation slowly took shape, the "observation deck" where they were seemed to get higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin nodded with great satisfaction. After Li Ping finished, he took out another pile of materials.</p><p></p><p>"Make it a bit deeper. Completely suppress the True Immortal's 'Will to Survive' deep in the Dark Sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also agreed with this opinion. Without complaining, he continued to work.</p><p></p><p>When the materials were used up, the Dark Sea scene in the field of vision was only half the size of when they first saw it.</p><p></p><p>"In this case, it should be safe enough. If no one maliciously disturbs it." Mo Rubin stood beside Li Ping, looking at the Dark Sea below, and said softly.</p><p></p><p>"It concerns the safety of the Profound Yellow Realm, so it's better to be more cautious. I'm going to set up defensive formations here." It was not a request for Mo Rubin's opinion, but a decided notification.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin shrugged, "Do as you wish. In so many years, no one else has come to this ghostly place except us. Who are you defending against with your formations? If that Will to Survive really breaks free from its cage, your little formations will be utterly useless."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping ignored Mo Rubin's sarcasm and set up the strongest sealing formations he could currently arrange with utmost seriousness.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, next is to sever the hand reached out by the Myriad Immortal Alliance." After Li Ping finished, Mo Rubin urged.</p><p></p><p>"The Dark Power being extracted now is limited. If the Dark Sea shrinks to a certain extent, perhaps the 'Will to Survive' will be able to sense the vibrant life in the Profound Yellow Realm outside. The scene at that time is truly unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>When reinforcing the formation here, Li Ping had noticed that in the formation's core, there were two intermittent thin lines extending outward.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know where they led.</p><p></p><p>"Sever the connection between the two formation controlling magic tools and the core?" Li Ping looked at Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>"The other one, he's probably already dead. Just sever it." Mo Rubin was silent for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping immediately modified the formation's core.</p><p></p><p>It went very smoothly. The Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation let out a soft hum, as if it had restarted.</p><p></p><p>First it darkened a little, then brightened again.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stood at the formation's core, sensing the opening cut by the Myriad Immortal Alliance in the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The clouds rolled, stirring up waves of invisible surges. Sweeping up the drifting "clouds" in the Dark Sea, growing larger and larger. By the time it reached the open wound, it had turned into a shocking giant wave.</p><p></p><p>Several dozen diligent Immortal Alliance cultivators who were supervising the extraction of Dark Power were thus silently engulfed.</p><p></p><p>Vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>And in the violent shaking, the crack was also closing.</p><p></p><p>Facing the sudden change, the Myriad Immortal Alliance was unwilling to give up. In the crack that was about to close, the eye-controlling formation magic tool appeared again.</p><p></p><p>The golden abacus fluctuated rapidly, trying to turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, it could no longer have any effect. It could only watch helplessly as the crack in the Dark Sea healed.</p><p></p><p>The dust settled.</p><p></p><p>Both Li Ping and Mo Rubin watched this scene in silence.</p><p></p><p>Although it took a lot of trouble, they finally severed the Myriad Immortal Alliance's goal of extracting Dark Power and learned many secrets of the ancient Profound Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's heart was tranquil. He felt that his connection with the Profound Yellow Dao was getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>However, he was also very clear in his heart that being able to easily manipulate the power of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation was not only due to his own outstanding attainments in formations, but more importantly, it was thanks to Mo Rubin's help.</p><p></p><p>Without the formation diagrams he transmitted, it would not be possible to break the restrictions left by the Profound Heavenly King in a short time.</p><p></p><p>And more crucially, it was the demon mask that Mo Rubin split and attached to his own face.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the existence of this face that he could move unimpeded in the deepest part of the Dark Sea. And when changing the key structure of the formation, he was not attacked or backlashed by the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, Mo Rubin's face had even higher authority than the two eye-controlling formation magic tools.</p><p></p><p>"Among the twelve Dharma Kings of the Profound Heaven Sect back then, what rank was your strength?" Li Ping suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then he sneered, "To be honest, among the twelve, my strength was the worst. Although you can barely defeat me, you can't win against the others."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin snorted coldly, "In our era, talents emerged in large numbers. Peerless geniuses were as common as carp crossing the river, too many to count. It was undisputedly a great era of cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"If the path of immortality had not suddenly been cut off, it would not have been impossible for a large number of ascenders to appear in a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was silent.</p><p></p><p>In the records of the Creation Stone Tablet, since the information related to those who ascended to immortality was all erased, he had no way to judge the truth or falsehood of Mo Rubin's words.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the various performances of the twelve Dharma Kings before joining the Profound Heaven Sect, Mo Rubin's words might be a bit exaggerated, but they conformed to certain facts.</p><p></p><p>"Even without the Profound Heavenly King, if you twelve joined forces, it would be difficult for the Ten Schools of the Immortal Dao to win, right?" Li Ping asked the question that had been weighing on his mind for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Mo Rubin directly snorted.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, he said somewhat vaguely, "Anyway, losing is losing, I won't deny it either. Those people from the Ten Schools of the Immortal Dao are not to be trifled with."</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's tone suddenly became extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>"Someone was just pretending, suddenly betraying us. Without determining who the traitor was, none of us dared to trust each other. Plus, Brother Xuanyuan disappeared mysteriously..."</p><p></p><p>"One by one, we considered our talents to be no less than Xuanyuan Hong's, but we were just unfortunate in our timing and failed to ascend in time. When it really came down to it, we realized that without Brother Xuanyuan leading us, we were just a bunch of rabble."</p><p></p><p>"In contrast, on the side of the Ten Schools of the Immortal Dao, they were really fighting with their lives, because they knew that if they failed, what awaited them was death."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin suddenly laughed, "But now I'm also at peace. As the saying goes, the Dao of Heaven is good at retribution. Weren't the Ten Schools of the Immortal Dao also destroyed by this so-called Myriad Immortal Alliance later? Hahaha! Serves them right!"</p><p></p><p>"Well done, Profound Yellow Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin patted Li Ping's shoulder and praised.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the core figures of the Ten Schools of the Immortal Dao are probably still alive and well." Li Ping suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"They're just hiding from the world, not showing themselves."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's hand gripping Li Ping's shoulder suddenly tightened.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, hehe..." After abruptly learning this news, Mo Rubin didn't fly into a rage, but instead gradually laughed wildly.</p><p></p><p>"So they're not dead? Even better that they're not dead."</p><p></p><p>"This way, I can take revenge with my own hands. After so many years, they shouldn't be as united as they were back then, right?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin flashed away from Li Ping's side, his figure suddenly becoming much darker.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go."</p><p></p><p>"I was originally going to look for Brother Xuanyuan, but unexpectedly, I came here first by chance. But it's good too. At least I've eliminated one wrong answer."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping felt that the demon mask on his blank face was about to show signs of detaching.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding darkness invaded irresistibly.</p><p></p><p>The whispers from the depths of his soul sounded, corroding Li Ping's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, where was your original destination? To actually need to use that immortal tool command flag?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin remained silent.</p><p></p><p>When passing by the void body of Fang Dingge, the sect master of the Great Dao Sect, he suddenly said to Li Ping, "You should search him, maybe you can still pick up some treasures."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stared at Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin rolled his eyes at Li Ping, "For this person to be able to resist the devouring of the Will to Survive and escape all the way here before dying, it's enough to show his strength. There must be good things on a master. This is what Brother Xuanyuan taught me."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if there are really any relics on him that can be preserved under the erosion of the True Immortal's Will to Survive, they must be extraordinary treasures. You really won't try?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin tempted.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping looked again, but in the end, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The deceased is gone, let him rest here. There are so many treasures in the world, do we have to search for all of them? Insatiable greed will only lead to disaster."</p><p></p><p>"I say you're stupid, and you really are stupid." Mo Rubin sneered.</p><p></p><p>However, he also didn't go to search Fang Dingge's corpse, just letting him lie quietly in place.</p><p></p><p>After a period of hurrying, the two returned to where they came from.</p><p></p><p>The white jade flagpole was still inserted in its original place.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the range covered by the radiance it emitted had shrunk by a whole circle compared to before, eroded by the Dark Power.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a second-hand item that has been reforged, it's really junk." Mo Rubin criticized bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"With you messing around like this, I'll have to go look for the other arrangements I left back then. I don't know if they're still there after so many years. If not, I'll come to you for trouble!" Mo Rubin looked at Li Ping and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping summoned the Youzu people and reopened the door leading to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"I can help you search for the Profound Heavenly King together."</p><p></p><p>"I need his help." Li Ping said very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was the first to fly into the passage, laughing loudly, "You don't think that after walking through the Dark Sea with me, I'll completely trust you, do you?"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, which of those eleven other brothers and sisters didn't go through life and death together with me?"</p><p></p><p>"The facts tell me that no one can be fully trusted!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's voice, cold and detached, slowly faded.</p><p></p><p>By the time Li Ping returned to Jiushan Prefecture, he could no longer find any trace of Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>However, the Holy Emperor did not go after him.</p><p></p><p>This Dharma King of the Profound Heaven Sect was not his enemy.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

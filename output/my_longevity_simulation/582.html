            <p>Alternatively, when the Supreme Law Transmitter created the new law, it did indeed refer to and imitate the scene of the world's creation.</p><p></p><p>In order to solve the problem of cultivators lacking spiritual roots and unable to cultivate, creatures generated by negative human emotions, used to forcefully draw upon the energy of heaven and earth, were also known as the "roots of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Although they share the same name, it is clear that the two are not in the same category.</p><p></p><p>If the "roots of heaven and earth" representing the beginning of creation are sacred and solemn.</p><p></p><p>Then the "roots of heaven and earth" that plunder heaven and earth, enabling everyone to cultivate, appear somewhat evil.</p><p></p><p>This can be observed from the external form that "it" presents.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of wriggling tentacles, all of them are the roots of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they are like sentient beings, continuously extending and approaching the Five Elements Cave.</p><p></p><p>Automatically seeking the most suitable place to take root and occupy.</p><p></p><p>The newly born Five Elements Cave seems to sense its own crisis.</p><p></p><p>The cave trembles, various colors of radiance bloom, attempting to repel these invading "foreign objects."</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It's futile.</p><p></p><p>The protective effect of the cave's radiance is almost negligible to them.</p><p></p><p>Only a tiny, insignificant portion is lost.</p><p></p><p>The remaining black roots penetrate the cave as if entering an unpopulated area.</p><p></p><p>Like thin needles, they silently penetrate the cave one by one.</p><p></p><p>The cave roars.</p><p></p><p>Unintelligible sounds emanate from within, resembling the cry of pain.</p><p></p><p>But it cannot stop the continuous entwining and tightening of the roots.</p><p></p><p>The radiance dissipates, darkness descends.</p><p></p><p>And on the side, Li Fan, the instigator who constantly watches the scene of the cave being swallowed, involuntarily feels a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The new law of the Supreme is indeed strange."</p><p></p><p>"It does not seem to be the right path when looked at."</p><p></p><p>He mutters to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan is not a pretentious person after all.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of how evil it may appear, the new law is the only path he can cultivate on now.</p><p></p><p>Casting aside all distracting thoughts, Li Fan gazes at the cave surrounded by wriggling darkness.</p><p></p><p>The endless roots convey the current situation of the cave to Li Fan's mind like his own tentacles.</p><p></p><p>The power being swallowed, the struggling force weakening.</p><p></p><p>And from among the thousands of tentacles, a uniquely strange energy emanates.</p><p></p><p>This life force is much more refined than the human essence Li Fan sensed while cultivating the "Creation Oven Technique."</p><p></p><p>Vibrant life force is extracted from the cave and continuously injected into Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Just by absorbing a minuscule part of it, a feeling wells up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With this incredibly pure life force, even if he were to be cut into pieces, as long as there are remaining tissues, he could recreate a new body.</p><p></p><p>"Reborn by dripping blood, indestructible..."</p><p></p><p>Originally a divine ability that only powerful cultivators can master according to ancient legends, is now roughly achieved through this clever method.</p><p></p><p>"Transmitting the law..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighs inwardly once again.</p><p></p><p>Next, feeling the time is right, he finally takes action, ushering in the final step of the fetus transformation.</p><p></p><p>The remnants of his body completely dissolve.</p><p></p><p>Turning into a gushing black liquid, they infiltrate the Five Elements Cave through myriad roots.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's perception, he seems to be divided into thousands upon thousands, scattered into billions.</p><p></p><p>Split into countless existences, yet still appearing as a whole.</p><p></p><p>With a unified goal - to occupy the cave and completely make it their own.</p><p></p><p>It's a peculiar experience.</p><p></p><p>The "cave," originally a realm several levels above the human body, now seems to exist as an equal life form.</p><p></p><p>The ethereal "heaven and earth" has become a tangible entity that can be attacked.</p><p></p><p>The struggling of the cave weakens, eventually diminishing to the point of being barely audible.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Five Elements Void.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Did I just hear something?" A Nascent Soul cultivator on duty suddenly raises his head, looking up at the pitch-black hole above his head, and asks.</p><p></p><p>"Old Sun, are you hallucinating again?" Beside him, a lazy-faced cultivator scoffs nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"I've been advising you to take a break and rest properly. After fighting for so long and witnessing so many deaths, if you are not crazy, consider yourself lucky. Yet here you are voluntarily taking the lookout duty here..."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the other's sarcasm, Old Sun just stares fixedly at the black void, looking serious for some reason.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of hesitation, he flies to the edge of the void and carefully investigates.</p><p></p><p>"Paranoid, always suspecting everything. Are you out of your mind?" The nearby cultivator sneers contemptuously under his breath.</p><p></p><p>Stretching lazily, he looks up at Old Sun, seemingly enjoying the show.</p><p></p><p>As expected, after patrolling for a long while, Old Sun couldn't notice anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he can only dejectedly return to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"How about it? I told you it was just your imagination." Seeing the situation, the cultivator mocks repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"This place is deserted, no birds even come to drop their dung here! How could there be any enemies coming? I wonder what those above were thinking, leaving a team here for guard duty."</p><p></p><p>"They are lucky; they can go back to enjoy themselves. We can only suffer here! Ah..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Old Sun's lack of response, the cultivator shifts his complaints, non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Old Sun seems accustomed to it, paying no heed.</p><p></p><p>He still occasionally looks up at the sky, his brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This Sun-named cultivator's spiritual perception is surprisingly keen. He almost detected me." </p><p></p><p>"A bit interesting."</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, hidden Li Fan watches Old Sun, feeling a slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>In the instant the Five Elements Cave descended into the Tianlingzhou void, he managed to successfully devour the cave, narrowly avoiding being discovered by the observant Old Sun.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, Li Fan reacted swiftly, concealing his presence in time.</p><p></p><p>Although their cultivation is now one realm higher, enabling them to easily subdue them with a single move, the situation was still sensitive due to the ongoing war.</p><p></p><p>If any mishap occurred here, it might stir up trouble again.</p><p></p><p>It's better to prosper in silence.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Fan memorizes Old Sun's appearance and prepares to leave.</p><p></p><p>But he suddenly hears voices from below again.</p><p></p><p>"Old Sun, have you heard? Recently, Zhang Debiao seems to have struck it rich."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he responsible for cleaning up the war dead?"</p><p></p><p>"On the Tianlingzhou battlefield, he seems to have taken all the benefits for himself from the scattered corpses!"</p><p></p><p>()</p>

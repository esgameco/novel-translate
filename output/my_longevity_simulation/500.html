        <div class="content">
            <p>Shortly after, the stone man held Li Fan and placed him in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swept his eyes over the densely packed cultivators present, with a serious expression on his face, and said, "Not long ago, I was recognized by my seniors and entrusted with the duty of acting as the island's master to rebuild the Congyun Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"I am naturally laid-back by nature, but suddenly receiving such a heavy responsibility, I feel immense pressure."</p><p></p><p>"However, I dare not disappoint the Immortal Alliance and the trust of my seniors, so I have set a military order in front of Master Jinglun, setting a deadline of six months to rebuild the Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"The time is short, and the task is heavy. But I believe that with the concerted efforts of us Congyun Sea cultivators, we will surely be able to successfully achieve our goal."</p><p></p><p>"An immortal city being abducted in a state, this is truly unheard of!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed to the giant void below and said, "The existence of this ruins for a day is a shame that we Congyun Sea cultivators cannot erase from our faces!"</p><p></p><p>"I hope that all of you will help me to wipe away this shame!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Li Fan bowed deeply to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were moved, some genuinely and some out of obligation, and returned the courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"On the day when the Immortal City is rebuilt, I will still be here to reward merits and punish wrongs, and celebrate with all of you!"</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan straightened up, he spoke loudly again.</p><p></p><p>His voice spread far and wide, echoing for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The people looked at Li Fan with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Fan suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Here!" Gao Yuan, his face flushed, flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Read out the personnel orders for the reconstruction of the Immortal City this time!" Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>With an air of pride, Gao Yuan looked around, cleared his throat, took out a scroll from his storage ring, infused spiritual power into his voice, and began to read out loud with all his might.</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenhao, stationed at Liuli Island, serves as the Chief Inspector, responsible for overseeing and managing all matters related to the acquisition and consumption of resources during the reconstruction of the Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"He Peituo, stationed at Haitong Island, serves as the Commander-in-Chief, in charge of the escort matters during the reconstruction of the Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"He Zhouqingang, stationed at Tai'an Island, serves as the General Commander, coordinating the communication matters among various departments during the reconstruction of the Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As each personnel order was read out, the faces of the cultivators present became subtly different.</p><p></p><p>Because they found that the named cultivators were the group of people who had just stood up to welcome Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And so the crowd suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>So you all knew about Li Fan being appointed as the acting island master early on, and you all pledged allegiance?</p><p></p><p>And this Li Fan is so unorthodox, openly favoring his acquaintances!</p><p></p><p>Look at He Zhenhao, He Peituo, He Zhouqingang, they are all at most at the peak of the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>Their status is even below those Foundation Establishment cultivators. Is this appropriate?</p><p></p><p>Although the cultivators were resentful, they also felt a sense of regret for not being more astute and acting earlier.</p><p></p><p>After the list was read out, Gao Yuan returned to the crowd, and Li Fan smiled, "The reconstruction of the Immortal City is a grand project. My plans may have shortcomings."</p><p></p><p>"And within the Congyun Sea, there are many talents, so there might be oversights. Therefore, I appoint Gao Yuan as the Chief Secretary. Those who are willing to contribute to the reconstruction of the Immortal City can come to him."</p><p></p><p>With these words, the cultivators who had been dissatisfied due to missing the opportunity suddenly became lively.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone!" Li Fan summarized at last.</p><p></p><p>"The attack of the Five Elders has caused heavy losses to our Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The Political Hall, Formation Hall, Martial Hall on the island..."</p><p></p><p>"Almost the whole army was wiped out! This has led to many vacant positions on the island, and we Congyun Sea cannot even function normally."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan paused briefly.</p><p></p><p>Sighed, glanced at the crowd, and said expectantly, "I hope that with your efforts, the glory of Congyun Sea can be restored as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Whether Congyun Sea had glory or not was unclear to the cultivators, but the implications in Li Fan's words were clear:</p><p></p><p>Because of the attack by the Five Elders, there are many vacant positions on the island! With the current hundred or so people under me, I can't possibly fill all the vacancies! Whoever has the ability should come forward! This opportunity is rare! It will be too late when the Immortal City is completed in six months!</p><p></p><p>This realization dawned on the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, these positions currently created for rebuilding the Immortal City are all just "titles."</p><p></p><p>Roles such as Commander-in-Chief, Chief Inspector, although sounding good, their authority stems only from Li Fan's authorized temporary island lord status.</p><p></p><p>On the day the Immortal City is rebuilt, these positions will lose their value and meaning.</p><p></p><p>It is Li Fan's "rewarding merits and punishing wrongs" that will be the main event.</p><p></p><p>If one can establish merit during the reconstruction of the Immortal City and obtain a position within the Wanxian Alliance system...</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of entering the official position exam is very high, and after officially joining the Wanxian Alliance, promotion is even more challenging.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan is right! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!</p><p></p><p>At this point, many eyes had discreetly turned towards Gao Yuan, thinking about how to deal with this influential figure in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After some encouraging words, Li Fan announced the completion of the ceremony and that the formal reconstruction of the Immortal City would commence the next day.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dantai Can on the flying boat did not wait for the crowd to disperse or greet Li Fan, but directly commanded the boat to fly away.</p><p></p><p>From his expression, he seemed extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>But most of the cultivators were immersed in fantasies of making great achievements, and this scene did not attract much attention.</p><p></p><p>Watching Dantai Can's figure go further away, Li Fan smiled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>It was almost akin to what the present cultivators were guessing. Shen Yus, Jing Xuan, Guang Wu, Huang Fu Song, and others were all invited by Li Fan through their contributions.</p><p></p><p>However, this rising star of the Dantai family had no relation to him and even harbored some resentment towards him. He could not be bought off by contributions.</p><p></p><p>The reason he came to congratulate Li Fan was because of the contract he was forced to sign with Jiao Xiuyuan during the Pu Xian Zhen Ye storm.</p><p></p><p>The agreement was to fulfill three requests within his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>So, even if Dantai Can caused hindrances in private this time, he still had to come and congratulate Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>People who were considered geniuses like him, who held themselves in high regard, were now dealt a blow by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Such humiliating affairs were naturally not explained to others.</p><p></p><p>So in the eyes of some people, Dantai Can's contradictory actions were very strange.</p><p></p><p>As for deteriorating his relationship with Dantai Can further, it was not within Li Fan's current consideration.</p><p></p><p>After all, the position as a Tianji Sect cultivator would eventually have to be relinquished, and one can't be weighed down by too many debts.</p><p></p><p>The urgent matter was to build the Congyun Immortal City well.</p><p></p><p>Although he had leveraged influence to attract people and solve the issue of lack of personnel.</p><p></p><p>There was still a bothering problem, which remained lethal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered Jiao Xiuyuan's words: "There are no issues with the quantities of materials listed, enough to successfully build a floating Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"That's under the condition of no mistakes occurring throughout the process."</p><p></p><p>"In reality, in the actual construction process, there will be resource losses caused by mistakes."</p><p></p><p>Some things are easy to handle, as I can sell them at low prices to fellow cultivators through certain channels."</p>

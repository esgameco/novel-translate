        <h1>Chapter 681</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After receiving guidance from Mr. Bai on the perfect version of "Creation Baking Furnace Technique" initially and then completely losing oneself in it, Li Fan was now deeply immersed in the infinite mysteries of the "Broken Heaven Heart Sword" after Mr. Bai's instruction.</p><p></p><p>He was so absorbed in it that he didn't even have the courtesy to say "thank you for your guidance," completely lost. He didn't even know how to leave the competition venue.</p><p></p><p>After some time, or maybe after the loud calls of "Senior Brother" from the outside world, Li Fan was finally awakened from his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Following everyone's gaze, Li Fan saw Situ Yao walking unsteadily, seemingly still not sober, being forcefully brought to the center by two disciples of the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the wine?" Situ Yao burped, ignoring Mr. Bai in front of him, asking left and right in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"Situ, why pretend to be drunk?" Mr. Bai didn't get angry but smiled lightly and said.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Situ Yao couldn't continue pretending to be foolish. He cleared his throat, straightened his body, and looked at Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of helplessness on his face, "I was thinking of saving face as the Senior Brother of the Tianjian Sect. Since you are a bit tough, it seems I have no choice but to take action."</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao took out a wine gourd from somewhere and drank deeply.</p><p></p><p>Then he stared at Mr. Bai for a while with a slightly narrowed gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible to win, impossible." He mumbled softly.</p><p></p><p>Though Situ Yao's words were light, they caused a stir among the onlookers. They knew Situ Yao's actual strength was considered the top in the Tianjian Sect. He hadn't really fought seriously for many years, and no one knew where his true power limit lay.</p><p></p><p>Yet, even such an absolute expert in the Xuanhuang Realm, when facing Mr. Bai, expressed that he wasn't his match before the battle had even started!</p><p></p><p>With Situ Yao's character, he wouldn’t lie if he couldn't win.</p><p></p><p>Who exactly was this seemingly ordinary man and where did he come from?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, all the Tianjian Sect's attention was focused on Mr. Bai, filled with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing it is impossible, yet still proceeding. Isn't this your life motto, Situ?" Seeing Situ Yao hesitating to take action, Mr. Bai encouraged him instead.</p><p></p><p>"You have been hiding your sword for a long time, it's time to bring it out and try." His tone was light, but it sounded like thunder to Situ Yao's ears.</p><p></p><p>An unknown aura suddenly emanated from Situ Yao, his eyes squinted, staring at Mr. Bai with a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>However, being a top expert, his doubts and surprises were quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll be disrespectful." Situ Yao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, Situ Yao extended his right hand, looking around at the disciples of the Tianjian Sect watching the battle.</p><p></p><p>Seriously, he said, "Brothers, bring me your swords."</p><p></p><p>All the disciples of the Tianjian Sect, whether present or not, heard Situ Yao’s words at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, all disciples threw their personal flying swords towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>As the Senior Brother of the Tianjian Sect, Situ Yao always took care of all the new disciples, never showing any seniority towards them. Whenever the disciples were in trouble, the Senior Brother always stood up for them. He was even a bit biased towards relatives.</p><p></p><p>After looking after countless years of younger disciples in the sect, how could he refuse to use their swords now?</p><p></p><p>Immediately, thousands of flying swords filled the sky, all soaring towards Situ Yao.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of the disciples' combat power was concentrated on their personal flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Starting from foundation building, they painstakingly strengthened their flying swords, enhancing their intensity and lethality while gradually achieving unity of heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>So, with Situ Yao's command, it wasn't just thousands of flying swords that were activated.</p><p></p><p>It was almost half of the Tianjian Sect's strength.</p><p></p><p>As countless sword energies crisscrossed the air, emitting various splendid lights, they all converged towards Situ Yao's target, ready to be cut down by Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>The swords gathered in the air, forming a giant sword that seemed to bridge heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Aiming directly at Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the next second, Mr. Bai would be pierced by thousands of swords and die on the spot.</p><p></p><p>However, Mr. Bai's face remained calm. He just smiled gently and raised the wooden sword in his hand, facing the thousand swords.</p><p></p><p>Buzz...</p><p></p><p>A sound of the sword resonated from the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, time seemed to freeze.</p><p></p><p>Where the sword sound passed, the thousands of flying swords first stopped their flight and hung in the air.</p><p></p><p>Then, the sword bodies trembled violently, as if struggling fiercely against something.</p><p></p><p>The first flying sword lost control and fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Stabbing into the ground, the sword edge trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then came the second, the third...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, thousands of flying swords rained down from the sky like a storm, landing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Within moments, a dense field of swords formed on the earth.</p><p></p><p>Without even touching Mr. Bai's clothes, Situ Yao's lifelong killer move was broken.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Tianjian Sect fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's wooden sword emitted a sword sound again.</p><p></p><p>Then, all the disciples, including Li Fan, saw an unforgettable scene.</p><p></p><p>All the flying swords stuck in the ground now bent their bodies towards Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were paying homage to their emperor.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai stood with the sword in hand, his face indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." At this moment, Situ Yao seemed to recall something.</p><p></p><p>His tone trembling, he said, "You are..."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai smiled slightly and waved the wooden sword again.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the thousands of flying swords returned to their owners.</p><p></p><p>"I came here today to ask for something." Mr. Bai threw the wooden sword aside, turned to Situ Yao, and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead," Situ Yao replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, Mr. Bai remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Situ Yao slapped his forehead, "Come with me."</p><p></p><p>With that, he led Mr. Bai towards the main hall of Tianjian Sect, leaving the stunned and unresponsive disciples behind.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true power of the ancient cultivation world's elite." Li Fan was still amazed by Situ Yao's overwhelming sword just now.</p><p></p><p>He had a vague feeling that if that giant sword, gathering the power of the majority of the Tianjian Sect's disciples, had successfully struck, it might have torn a hole in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the fact that Mr. Bai effortlessly resolved the sword left everyone astonished.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 698</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He looked around at the dense ice-sealed coffins and pondered for a moment before replying, "Although these ice crystals are arranged in a disorderly manner, just piled up without any apparent order, it seems to be chaotic. But based on my many years of experience dealing with formations, this place might..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out a set of broken formation jade plates and projected a light screen in front of everyone, starting to deduce on the spot.</p><p></p><p>In the light screen, the countless ice coffins seen before all turned into black dots, positioned and recorded. Then the perspective of the screen kept rising, with the number and speed of black dots increasing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Faintly from the light screen, it could be seen that these ice coffins were not all crowded in one place, but were indeed bound by some kind of force, arranged according to an unknown order.</p><p></p><p>"We still can't see the whole picture now, maybe we can only explore all of this place completely before we can see what kind of formation is shrouding this place." Huangfu Song carefully observed the light screen, and after a long time, he shook his head somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"So don't just stand there, let's hurry and set off. Staying here for too long, who knows what strange things we might encounter." Dongfang Yao urged, and the three of them continued to explore the remaining unknown areas.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!" Dongfang Yao suddenly raised his hand, blocking the path ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Dongfang, what have you found?" Li Fan looked around but didn't see anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao looked puzzled, as if listening carefully and discerning something.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his gaze locked onto the bottom of the black, silent sea.</p><p></p><p>"There seems to be something alive in this sea. Like..."</p><p></p><p>"Some kind of monster?" Dongfang Yao was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song, upon hearing this, suddenly felt a chill, "It's impossible. This sea is completely composed of the breath of death. Even if it's an ordinary monster, if we accidentally fall into it and are contaminated by the dead spirit, we wouldn't last long."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also gazed at the calm black sea surface, pondering, "Extreme death, yet rebirth..."</p><p></p><p>"I believe in Dongfang's judgment." He suggested, "If there really is a monstrous creature in this dead sea, living here year-round, maybe our hope of escaping lies with it. Dongfang, since you understand the language of monsters, why not try to communicate with it?"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao hesitated a bit but ultimately nodded. A strange sound echoed from his throat, rising and falling. It seemed like a genuine ancient monster roaring.</p><p></p><p>Before long, on the seemingly unchanged sea surface for millennia, ripples suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"There really is a living creature?!" Huangfu Song was astonished.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao cursed, "Damn it, this thing can't understand my words and was scared off instead!"</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, let's follow it. Let's follow Dongfang." Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao reacted promptly and quickly identified the movements of the monster under the dark sea, swiftly chasing after it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Huangfu Song followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>The speed of this unknown creature was not fast, so the three of them leisurely followed it.</p><p></p><p>During the chase, almost with the naked eye alone, Li Fan felt that the number of surrounding ice coffins seemed to be gradually decreasing.</p><p></p><p>"It disappeared suddenly here!" Dongfang Yao abruptly stopped and looked back at Li Fan and Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>After flying up for some distance, Li Fan looked around.</p><p></p><p>Countless ice coffins, resembling small dots, formed lines converging like a black dragon coming from the sky.</p><p></p><p>From all directions, they gathered here.</p><p></p><p>These lines were like veins, circulating and converging all the dead spirit of this enchanted area.</p><p></p><p>It became extremely dense, undergoing a subtle transformation.</p><p></p><p>After careful observation, Huangfu Song discovered some clues.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like this is the main eye of the enchantment shrouding this area," his face was grave.</p><p></p><p>"The main eye, does that mean we can get out from here?" Dongfang Yao exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song shook his head, "Without fully understanding the entire formation, we cannot draw a conclusion yet. It is possible to escape from here, but it is also possible..."</p><p></p><p>"To trigger a counterattack from the large formation." Li Fan continued from Huangfu Song, "The scale of this formation here is extremely rare. Especially since it seems to have some connection with life and death, it is incredibly bizarre. Even a strong cultivator might not survive an attack from the formation."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song looked at Li Fan with a hint of surprise in his eyes, "So Brother Li also knows about formations?"</p><p></p><p>"Just a little." Li Fan nodded slightly, admitting.</p><p></p><p>"So what now, just linger here?" East Fang Yao, after some hesitation, took out a longevity pill and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this is much better now." He absorbed the medicinal power much faster than Huangfu Song, instantly rejuvenating.</p><p></p><p>"We need to understand the complete formation layout." Li Fan and Huangfu Song exchanged glances, eventually concurring.</p><p></p><p>"We need to act quickly." Huangfu Song said, and then coughed lightly. His face turned grim, and reluctantly took another longevity pill to slow the draining of his vitality.</p><p></p><p>Having not encountered any danger other than vitality being consumed in this enchanted area for a long time, coupled with the depleting longevity pills, the three of them now put in their all and made a full-speed escape.</p><p></p><p>After Huangfu Song took the last pill, they finally completed the full mapping of the large formation in this place.</p><p></p><p>"The strokes of the divine, the strokes of the divine."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song stared at the image projected on the broken jade plate, involuntarily murmuring.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan was captivated by the exquisite unknown large formation.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, with Huangfu Song's knowledge of formations, they did not need to see the complete formation. They could deduce the basic function of the formation and even infer the remaining parts of the formation. </p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>In the presence of this world-shaking formation made up of billions of ice-sealed cultivators, their knowledge and experience were all rendered useless.</p><p></p><p>Until the last part of the formation appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>The final sequence of the formation instantly connected everything they had seen before. Like the finishing touch on a painting, it made the grand formation divine and complete.</p><p></p><p>This formation was extraordinary, describing it with words was incredibly challenging.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to contain the wonders of heaven and earth, able to reverse the principles of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Huangfu Song were lost in thought, unable to speak in front of the diagram of the formation they had drawn.</p><p></p><p>Could they escape from the eye of the formation after all?</p>

            <p>But Li Fan would not really treat her as a child.</p><p></p><p>Since the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable re-established the Myriad Immortals Alliance from the Wasteland Era, the Dharma Jade had already existed. </p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, the Dharma Jade had been working tirelessly for at least five or six thousand years.</p><p></p><p>This was enough for Li Fan to show her full respect.</p><p></p><p>The little loli looked up at Li Fan and nodded, "Yes, deriving cultivation techniques is very tiring."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her eyes widened as she asked, "You still have one-third of an hour of available time. Do you want to stay here for a while longer or leave now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was naturally very tactful. </p><p></p><p>"I will leave after the time is used up."</p><p></p><p>"It's my honor as a junior to be in the same room as you."</p><p></p><p>A very satisfied expression immediately appeared on the little loli's face.</p><p></p><p>"Great, I can rest for another one-third of an hour." She said with some excitement.</p><p></p><p>During the remaining time, Li Fan did not just stand there foolishly.</p><p></p><p>Under the supervision of that faint gaze around him, Li Fan began to tentatively ask the Dharma Jade a few questions.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask if you are a cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"I was a long time ago. But people need to rest, and they will die. Later, the Heavenly Venerable merged me with the Dharma Jade." The little loli lay on the table and answered lazily, looking indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Now I won't die. I just get a little tired sometimes."</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been deriving cultivation techniques without rest?"</p><p></p><p>"How long? I don't remember. Anyway, it's always been like this. I can't rest until all the techniques have been derived. I can occasionally slack off though." There was some helplessness on the loli's face. "I really want to finish the work early and go out to relax."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the Dharma Jade chatted back and forth, communicating very smoothly. </p><p></p><p>And for some reason, that hidden presence never stopped Li Fan's increasingly presumptuous questions.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, Li Fan gained a preliminary but rather detailed understanding of this first-class treasure of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly, Li Fan's allotted time was finally used up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, it's time to say goodbye." The little loli waved her hand to bid Li Fan farewell.</p><p></p><p>"I hope there will be a day when I can see you again." Li Fan performed a respectful salute.</p><p></p><p>Then he felt the surrounding light suddenly dim.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of darkness.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes, he had already returned outside the black stone tablet of the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator who led them here was still waiting.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yue was also on the side, eyes closed in contemplation, seeming to be studying the newly acquired cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>But Han Yi was nowhere to be seen, not having come out yet.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not disturb the two and quietly stood to the side.</p><p></p><p>His mind recalled the encounter with the Dharma Jade just now.</p><p></p><p>But it was all blank.</p><p></p><p>"As expected..." Li Fan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Except for the contents of the "Marvelous True Spirit Transformation" technique clearly imprinted in his mind, not forgotten.</p><p></p><p>All the other memories from leaving the waiting room to appearing outside the black stone tablet, including meeting the Dharma Jade, could not be recalled.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even remember what the Dharma Jade looked like or how he got the technique.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance's treasure is indeed heavily guarded."</p><p></p><p>"This should be some kind of restriction directly acting on cultivators to prevent those with ulterior motives from spying on the Dharma Jade."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder apart from knowing the Dharma Jade exists, no one in the world knows any other information."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes to conceal the emotions in them.</p><p></p><p>"These restrictions are useless against me."</p><p></p><p>"All the memories have long been synchronized to my true self."</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Mirror of Tianyu City, Li Fan's true self appeared calm on the surface.</p><p></p><p>But in his mind, he was constantly replaying the first meeting with the little loli Dharma Jade.</p><p></p><p>"Forced labor for thousands of years, and even fusing a cultivator with a heavenly wonder to ensure efficiency, turning her into an undying, sleepless laborer."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance is truly heinous and deranged."</p><p></p><p>In the conversation with the little loli, Li Fan learned that the Dharma Jade was her companion wonder.</p><p></p><p>But after being discovered by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable, in order to maximize utilization, he used a secret technique to transform her.</p><p></p><p>Her body disappeared, her consciousness completely merged with the Dharma Jade.</p><p></p><p>She became a strange existence that was both human and wonder.</p><p></p><p>From then on, she would not age or die.</p><p></p><p>But she also could not sleep or cultivate, having to continuously derive techniques.</p><p></p><p>Until there were no more techniques to derive.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable had promised her that the day the techniques were exhausted would be the day she could rest well.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Jade naively believed that the "rest" in the Heavenly Venerable's words really meant rest.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Fan's view, this "rest" was definitely not a kind word.</p><p></p><p>For the public and private good, Li Fan felt obliged to rescue the Dharma Jade.</p><p></p><p>For other cultivators, stealing the Dharma Jade from under heavy guard in a place like the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters would be an impossible task.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, now that he knew her information, it might not be impossible.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan had already come up with a preliminary plan on how to do it in an instant.</p><p></p><p>First, the Dharma Jade was guarded by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Based on deduction, the guarding cultivators had to be at least at the Harmonious Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>So the first step of Li Fan's plan was to cultivate to the Harmonious Dao realm in the Myriad Immortals Alliance and become a guardian of the Dharma Jade.</p><p></p><p>The second step was to develop a relationship with the Dharma Jade through daily interactions.</p><p></p><p>The third step, when the time was ripe, was to activate Returning to Truth, going back to the anchored year. And when preserving, choose the third option: the memories of someone closely related to him.</p><p></p><p>The fourth step was to repeat the actions of the previous life and return to the Dharma Jade's side. Then let her inherit the memories of the previous life.</p><p></p><p>These decades or even centuries of memories would naturally include the process and results of the Dharma Jade's painstaking derivation of techniques.</p><p></p><p>With these memories, the Dharma Jade would no longer need to laboriously derive techniques again.</p><p></p><p>When she needed to show results, she could just take out the techniques derived in the previous life from her memories.</p><p></p><p>With this great gift, he would continue to deepen his relationship with the Dharma Jade.</p><p></p><p>The reincarnation memories of one life after another would surely push the intimacy between Li Fan and the Dharma Jade to the highest level.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan would have the Dharma Jade acknowledge him as her master.</p><p></p><p>In the final step, Li Fan would activate Returning to Truth and choose to preserve one item of his own.</p><p></p><p>He would choose the Dharma Jade.</p><p></p><p>And based on past experience, there would not be two identical wonders in the world.</p><p></p><p>If there was a conflict with what was brought back by Returning to Truth, the weaker would vanish and the stronger would remain.</p><p></p><p>With memories from who knows how many more lives, Li Fan's Dharma Jade would certainly be stronger than the one in the anchored year.</p><p></p><p>So the end result would be that the Myriad Immortals Alliance's Dharma Jade would disappear.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's Dharma Jade would remain.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's preliminary plan to abduct the Dharma Jade.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, it was very tempting.</p><p></p><p>Although various problems would definitely be encountered in this process.</p><p></p><p>For example, the first step of becoming a Harmonious Dao cultivator in the Myriad Immortals Alliance and infiltrating to the Dharma Jade's side seemed incredibly distant for the current Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And for another example, the Dharma Jade likely had the Heavenly Venerable's contingencies on her, making it impossible for her to easily acknowledge someone else as her master.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>In the face of reincarnation through one life after another, these were nothing.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was a sliver of theoretical possibility, for Li Fan, it was a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Jade was the foundation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's establishment.</p><p></p><p>And the Myriad Immortals Alliance was the foundation of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable's path to the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable had now left the world and was unconcerned with worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>But from "the number of cultivators cannot be too many or too few", it could be seen that the Myriad Immortals Alliance was at least still an important means for the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable to maintain a stable number of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very curious, if the roots of the Myriad Immortals Alliance were dug up.</p>

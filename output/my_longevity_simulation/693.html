            <p>"After drinking Brother Li's tea, we are considered brothers from now on," Dongfang Yao nodded satisfactorily.</p><p></p><p>"Dongfang Xiong, you haven't introduced me yet, who is this?" Huangfu Song looked towards Li Fan, who was sitting beside him with a serious expression, and asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"He is Li Fan, whom I happened to meet during my enlightenment at the vortex in the Nangu State this time. We hit it off at first sight. Since you mentioned a great opportunity for merit, I discussed with him and came over together," Dongfang Yao said proudly.</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Huangfu Song's eyes, and he discreetly glanced at Li Fan again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained expressionless, cupped his hands, and said, "I've long heard of Huangfu Xiong's great name, nice to meet you!"</p><p></p><p>However, Huangfu Song did not show particular warmth, just nodded slightly in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>After some small talk between the three of them, Dongfang Yao, who had a straightforward personality, cut to the chase.</p><p></p><p>"Huangfu, stop beating around the bush. What exactly is this once-in-a-hundred-years almost certain opportunity you mentioned before? Speak quickly!"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Huangfu Song slowly said, "Although this matter is still under wraps, it will be officially announced shortly. Since you are both insiders..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't conceal it either."</p><p></p><p>"The Xian Alliance is about to issue an order encouraging all cultivators to explore deep into the White Mist. They will provide the PuXian Zhenzhou needed to venture into the White Mist for free. All gains obtained during the exploration process will belong to the individual cultivator, and the Xian Alliance will not intervene in any way."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, by just reporting the situation in the White Mist, there will be rewards in contribution points, merits, and even exclusive secret techniques."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song continued to explain the new policy that the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was about to implement.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, Dongfang Yao still looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Did I not hear wrongly? Deep into the White Mist? Apart from the white mist inside the white mist barrier, are there still other things?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song looked somewhat helpless as he glanced at Dongfang Yao and explained, "Within the White Mist, there are 'Mystic Realms.' Each Mystic Realm is extensive, even larger than many caves and small worlds that have been mapped out."</p><p></p><p>"This is just the surface of the White Mist that has been explored so far. According to the latest investigation, there are many hidden crevices and passages within the White Mist, mysterious to the extreme, leading to unknown places."</p><p></p><p>"The upper echelons of the alliance are determined to explore the White Mist this time, and the rewards are unprecedentedly generous. Therefore, many cultivators who are privy to the information have already ventured into the White Mist. Once the policy is officially finalized, they will report back immediately to receive their merit rewards."</p><p></p><p>"I know that the news is a bit late, but if we act quickly, we can also benefit substantially. If it weren't for waiting for you, Dongfang Xiong, I would have set off seven days ago."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Huangfu Song drank his tea and looked helplessly at Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>"Good brother, very considerate!" Dongfang Yao slammed Huangfu's shoulder abruptly, causing his round belly to shake continuously.</p><p></p><p>"What are we waiting for? Why not hurry and set off? I'm so broke that I can't even afford to open a pot. The things needed to strengthen the body, they are outrageously expensive!" He urged repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song gave Dongfang Yao a disdainful look, "There are many dangers within the White Mist. Since we are already late, it does not matter for a short while. It is essential to be fully prepared. Let's travel together; there is no need to excel, but at the very least, don't delay the team."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his gaze intentionally or unintentionally swept over Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, "Since Huangfu Xiong said so, I will also not hide anymore. Although my actual combat strength is slightly weaker, I have considerable wealth. You can leave it to me to prepare the PuXian Zhenzhou required for this trip, as well as the treasures that can temporarily resist the devouring White Mist."</p><p></p><p>"If I find it difficult to explore at the Nascent Soul realm during the expedition, I will voluntarily withdraw. I won't make it difficult for you, brothers!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's frankness, Huangfu Song was somewhat surprised. Dongfang Yao, on the other hand, seemed somewhat dismissive, "What is Li Fan talking about? What's wrong with being at the Nascent Soul realm? Am I not also at the Nascent Soul realm? With brothers working together, we can break through any difficulty, how can we be defeated by a mere devouring White Mist?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows and turned to advise, "I know Dongfang Xiong, you have a strong physique, and not even the cracks in the vortex can hurt you. But deep within the White Mist is indeed no trivial matter. I have heard from Shuo Xiong that there is a Mystic Realm within the White Mist named Shizha Abyss. Even he needs to be cautious in dealing with it; otherwise, there will be a looming threat of falling. Shuo Xiong is a powerhouse at the Deity Transformation realm and has a magic treasure gifted by his mother for protection. Even he said so, indicating the dangers in the White Mist are evident."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao were stunned by what they heard.</p><p></p><p>"Shuo Xiong? Which Shuo Xiong?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's expression changed slightly, "Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, "I won't hide it from both of you. I have a close relationship with Shuo Feng and serve as a guest official of the Xuan family at his invitation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Dongfang Yao had not reacted much.</p><p></p><p>However, Huangfu Song abruptly stood up, looking at Li Fan in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, is what you're saying true?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "I think the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance hasn't had any Nascent Soul cultivator dare to impersonate a guest official of the Xuan family, right?"</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the confirmation firsthand, Huangfu Song immediately changed his attitude.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, such a thing! Why didn't Brother Li say so earlier! With your help, this exploration of the White Mist will surely be fruitful."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the conversation filled with praise, he subtly inquired about matters related to Shuo Feng from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After revealing some details, Huangfu Song finally confirmed and became even more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>"With the great help of Brother Li Fan, the certainty of this expedition has increased by a few points. Time is of the essence; we need to set off as soon as possible," Huangfu Song said decisively.</p><p></p><p>"Preparing supplies will only take a day," Li Fan stated.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao shrugged, indicating that he is ready at any time.</p><p></p><p>So the three of them agreed to meet at the same place the next day at this time.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to the other two for the time being, Li Fan came to a mirror, took out a communication talisman, and inquired about the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance's decision to explore the White Mist on a large scale with Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Shuo Feng replied.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it seems there is such a thing. Why, are you interested? However, there are too many strange things inside, not worth taking the risk. If you lack contribution points or anything, I will talk to my family to increase your offerings. Don't join in for excitement; it's not worth dying inside." Shuo Feng still had that light and indifferent tone.</p><p></p><p>After politely declining his offer, Li Fan inquired further about the original species of the Tianling Flower before ending the communication.</p><p></p><p>"Mystic Realms..."</p><p></p><p>The endless White Mist was indeed eerie and filled with crises.</p><p></p><p>Just from the information Li Fan had gathered in his previous life, there were the Shizha Abyss and the Luanzi Mystic Realm within it.</p><p></p><p>Even the Eternal Immortal Stronghold guarding the Shizha Abyss was constructed with the severed palm of an ancient Heavenly Venerable who had fallen.</p><p></p><p>This severed palm of the Heavenly Venerable drifted out from the White Mist itself.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1180: Wanderer of the Starry Sea</p><p></p><p>(The end of the previous chapter has been modified, please re-read if you read it early.)</p><p></p><p>Although the technological development of both the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association was not slow during their confrontation, with various means emerging one after another.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this period of rapid development only lasted for less than three thousand years. Since the great catastrophe that cut off the path of immortality, for tens of thousands of years, most of the time in the Xuanhuang Realm was spent in mutual slaughter and struggle.</p><p></p><p>Civilization regressed instead of progressing.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is true, then it's simply unbelievable to what extent the gap between civilizations inside and outside the high walls will reach."</p><p></p><p>A closed civilization, claiming to be the strongest in the world. Then one day, the passage to the outside world is suddenly opened, and in the face of the enemy's military power that is far ahead by several eras, there is no resistance at all, and it quickly falls and perishes.</p><p></p><p>Such things are not uncommon in the history of civilization's development.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention before crossing over, even now, there are still some small worlds that have lost contact with the Xuanhuang Realm and forgotten the existence of cultivators. They have established prosperous mortal forces, and the historians have made a big deal of their achievements.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it only takes one Foundation Establishment stage cultivator to easily overthrow the so-called "prosperous dynasty".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's goal has always been to transcend and achieve immortality.</p><p></p><p>For this, he has reincarnated countless times, just to forge a path in the Xuanhuang Realm that is full of crises and great calamities.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he is going to leave this darkest starry sea and go beyond the high walls.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the guess about the possible existence of a civilization outside the high walls made Li Fan secretly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"If a cultivation civilization really exists and has developed for so many years, it may even have mastered the power comparable to true immortals. It may even be able to influence Huanzhen to a certain extent..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, his thoughts surging.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Huanzhen was his biggest confidence.</p><p></p><p>Being able to trace back again and again, and bring back memories and experiences to a fixed anchor point, even if it is millions of years ahead outside the high walls, he can easily catch up with the gap between the two sides through a few reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Just need to be a little careful. Before finding out the situation, use avatars and holy fetuses, and never go out in person. Stability comes first in everything!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid of the existence of any monsters outside the high walls, I'm just afraid that there is nothing outside the high walls."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the dark void, the sword light transformed by the holy fetus Li Fan closely followed the twenty-nine puppets.</p><p></p><p>From the time he broke through the realm, only more than half a year had passed in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>And from the perspective of the holy fetus Li Fan, he had left the Xuanhuang Realm for a full ten years.</p><p></p><p>The difference in time flow rate further expanded after entering the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>It reached a peak value not long ago, a daunting fifty to one.</p><p></p><p>But as the holy fetus Li Fan continued to advance, the time difference between where he was and the Xuanhuang Realm slowly returned to synchronization.</p><p></p><p>From fifty to one, all the way down to ten to one.</p><p></p><p>Compared with just leaving the Xuanhuang Realm, it was not much different.</p><p></p><p>"The starry sea is vast. Even if I use this unknown great power and my speed reaches hundreds of times the limit of flying in the Xuanhuang Realm, it still took me so long to reach my destination." The holy fetus Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>During these ten years, he cut his soul a total of more than three hundred times.</p><p></p><p>From the peak period, when he could almost rival the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao cultivators, to now, when he only has the strength of a normal mortal.</p><p></p><p>The pain he suffered during this...</p><p></p><p>The pain was so intense that even with Li Fan's tenacious and unyielding spirit, he did not want to experience it a second time.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, in the last few years, perhaps because his strength had declined to a very weak level, the infection rate of the black spots had also significantly decreased.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after more than 300 divisions and insights, the Holy Fetus Li Fan had gained some of his own experience in dealing with this inexplicable plague.</p><p></p><p>"Although the principle behind its appearance is still unclear, it can be certain that these black spots are related to the immortal realm that has already been destroyed and disappeared in the Darkest Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>If it were just one of the more than 300 divided souls that had been stained by the black spots, it might not have been enough for Li Fan to sense anything.</p><p></p><p>But now, all these desolate dead souls that he had left behind in the Darkest Star Sea added up, allowing Li Fan to find their commonality.</p><p></p><p>After seemingly complete silence, they did not stay in place.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they quietly flowed towards different parts of the Darkest Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>The way they moved was also quite mysterious, not moving normally through space.</p><p></p><p>It was more like water droplets naturally rolling from high to low, shuttling rapidly through the Darkest Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>After reaching their destination, they disappeared one by one from Li Fan's senses forever.</p><p></p><p>"Those locations, deep in the star sea and between the Xuanhuang Realm, seem to overlap with the [voids] I have passed through."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan looked back and gazed, silently.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the various incredible phenomena within the Darkest Star Sea may all be related to each other."</p><p></p><p>"Then what exactly is going on with this star sea power that can rival the Immortal Ruins? Why did I not sense it at all when I was in the Xuanhuang Realm before, and it only suddenly erupted recently?"</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with doubts, and the Holy Fetus Li Fan became more and more curious about the unknown journey ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As he was deep in thought, he suddenly became alert and looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>That feeling of being stared at by something appeared again.</p><p></p><p>And this time, it was much stronger than what he had experienced in the past ten years.</p><p></p><p>It made the Holy Fetus Li Fan's hair stand on end and his heart pound wildly.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan first manipulated a stone puppet to crash into where he sensed the crisis.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a sword light slashed out from afar.</p><p></p><p>The stone puppet seemed to collide with something, making a muffled sound.</p><p></p><p>Then the puppet disappeared from Li Fan's senses.</p><p></p><p>Affected by the reduction of his divine soul, the sword light Li Fan slashed out was far less dazzling than when he first left the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But it could still illuminate the surrounding dark space.</p><p></p><p>A pair of huge eyes suddenly appeared out of the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Staring intently at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And a withered large hand had quietly appeared in front of the Holy Fetus Li Fan at some point, about to grab him into its palm!</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>In the dark void, he had been navigating for more than ten years.</p><p></p><p>He had not encountered any other living beings besides himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly encountering such a terrifying existence, Li Fan's heart immediately jumped wildly and his scalp went numb.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, countless sword shadows flew out.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if it was because his own strength had become too weak, or if the monster was too strong.</p><p></p><p>These sword shadows that could split mountains and seas in the Xuanhuang Realm actually failed to cause even a bit of damage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he was about to completely fall into the monster's grasp, Li Fan was about to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he discovered something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The huge, skinny human body in front...</p><p></p><p>Had no vitality at all.</p><p></p><p>Its movements and expressions also remained the same.</p><p></p><p>That's all for today..</p>

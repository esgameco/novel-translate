        <h1>Chapter 742</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan was surprised to see that Fang Renzhai's group had made such rapid progress. Under the guidance of the All-Seeing Eye, Li Fan arrived at the testing ground.</p><p></p><p>The [Doomsday Plate], which was originally indistinguishable from ordinary stones, was now suspended above Fang Renzhai's group. Around it, the space seemed to be separated according to different rules, forming a series of concentric circles of different colors. It looked quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>A black aura, under Jiang Yushan's control, was cutting into the circular rings around the Doomsday Plate.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not interrupt, but stood aside and observed. Before long, he noticed something. Jiang Yushan's cutting method was not to cut out a part from the plate, but rather to "peel off a layer of xuan paper" and cut out a plane from the plate.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that she had done this before, as her movements were very skilled.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, a thin "Doomsday Shard" separated from the main body. The moment it left the main body, the shard, which was originally the same size as the plate, began to rapidly "shrink".</p><p></p><p>The surrounding rings and its own volume were constantly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Feed it!" Fang Renzhai shouted.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he threw a few stones at Jiang Yushan. Li Fan recognized them as the [Sword Embryo Primal Stones] he had previously handed to Fang Renzhai.</p><p></p><p>The primal stones melted away gradually as they approached the Doomsday Shard, just like ice falling into water.</p><p></p><p>But the shard's shrinking speed slowed down and it gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>After a total of six primal stones were fed, the ring-shaped space around the shard converged inward and returned to the shard itself.</p><p></p><p>In this way, a miniaturized version of the [Doomsday Plate] was formed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's really not easy, even more difficult than delivering a baby. Isn't that right, Yushan?" Fang Renzhai sighed with satisfaction as he held the plate in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"You really have no filter, how can you compare it to that!" Liu Sanxu frowned angrily.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan spoke: "Mr. Fang, you said you've discovered the specific use of the Doomsday Plate?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Renzhai waved the plate in his hand proudly and explained:</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Fang Renzhai had been unable to figure out the use of the Doomsday Plate for a long time, until he finally decided to follow Li Fan's guidance and try cutting the plate.</p><p></p><p>However, they found that the parts cut from the plate would almost instantly dissipate into the air. After trying various methods, they still couldn't prevent this.</p><p></p><p>In desperation, Fang Renzhai decided to throw out everything he had in his storage ring, and unexpectedly found a way to stabilize the plate.</p><p></p><p>That was to feed it with things that contained the "understanding of the principles of heaven and earth". Not only the Sword Embryo Primal Stones, but any treasures that had condensed the enlightenment of the Dao would work.</p><p></p><p>Fang Renzhai had just used the primal stones because they had the most remaining, as treasures containing the understanding of heaven and earth were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>"This thing is just like a cultivator. When it's first born, it's weak and unstable, but as it's nourished with the understanding of the Dao, it gradually becomes stronger and more stable."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"They don't understand. So they didn't show any abnormality. But as long as it is nourished by the principles of heaven and earth, and let it 'grow up'. Then its true talent will be revealed!" Fang Ranjie said with some emotion as he stroked the round plate in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Just as the Patriarch said, this thing has no other use, its only ability is that it can shield the perception of the Heavenly Mirror to a certain extent!"</p><p></p><p>Holding a small Heavenly Mirror, his expression was restrained.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Patriarch!" He first paid his respects to Li Fan, and then greeted the elders like Liu San in turn.</p><p></p><p>This person, Li Fan, was familiar with him. His name was Meng Wushi, and he was one of the first Yao Wang Sect cultivators to awaken. He had already obtained the status of a Wanxian League cultivator, and after switching to a new cultivation method, he had even broken through to the Golden Dan realm.</p><p></p><p>"Please demonstrate it for the Patriarch," Fang Ranjie instructed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Wushi nodded, first taking out a pile of top-grade spirit stones and placing them around the Terminus Disc.</p><p></p><p>Then he activated the exchange function of the small Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>A beam of dim light shot out from the mirror surface, first shining on the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Shall I exchange?" The prompt from the Heavenly Mirror appeared.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Wushi confirmed, the spirit stones disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Meng Wushi then placed the Terminus Disc in the range of the dim light.</p><p></p><p>However, this time...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mirror did not react at all.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it couldn't even see the existence of the disc!</p><p></p><p>"Although it was born from the Heavenly Mirror, its only function after growing up is to go against the Heavenly Mirror. It's truly a rebellious child!" Fang Ranjie said with his mouth, but his eyes revealed a very admiring expression.</p><p></p><p>"For now, we have only tested it with the small Heavenly Mirror. We don't know if it can still guarantee the shielding effect when encountering the Heavenly Mirror branches in each state, as well as the Heavenly Mirror itself," Liu San supplemented more cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held the disc in his palm and observed it carefully for a moment. He found that it was indeed very similar to the "Calamity Stone" created by the Covering Heaven League in the previous world.</p><p></p><p>"How many discs can this Terminus Stone Disc produce?" This was a crucial question. If the number produced was not many, then it could only be worn by key figures. If it could produce them endlessly...</p><p></p><p>In response to Li Fan's question, Fang Ranjie's answer was very rigorous: "From the current situation, the Terminus Stone Disc does not seem to decrease due to our cutting. But this may also be because the number of discs we have cut out is too small. The specifics will require further observation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and handed over the remaining more than a hundred sword embryo spirit stones to him. He also instructed Liu San, "You can purchase treasures that have condensed the principles of heaven and earth through Jiao Xiuyuan. With the contribution points we have accumulated over the years, we should be able to maintain the disc production for a while. This thing is very useful for us in the future..."</p><p></p><p>As if confirming Li Fan's words, a line of golden characters suddenly appeared on the Heavenly Mirror in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Due to special reasons, the Heavenly Mirror function is temporarily unavailable, please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience."</p><p></p><p>Liu San and the others were all slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>They knew that the Heavenly Mirror was a precious treasure of the immortal world. But now it had become unusable...</p><p></p><p>They simultaneously fixed their gaze on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Has the final transformation of the Heavenly Mirror finally arrived?"</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight appeared in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, however, a sense of crisis surged in his heart.</p>

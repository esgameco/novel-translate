            <p>Chapter 1064: The Golden Sword of the Immortal Alliance Appears</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, through the [Fake Dao], determined after several observations that the attributes of the spiritual energy that once again filled the world would, to a certain extent, have a reverse impact on the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example, if the spiritual energy carried the attribute of "killing", it might cause the Xuanhuang Dao to encourage cultivators to kill.</p><p></p><p>If the spiritual energy carried the attribute of "chaos", it would likely cause the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm to become unpredictable and strange.</p><p></p><p>"Before I transmigrated, I had heard urban legends about people's personalities gradually changing to resemble the original owner of a transplanted organ."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao is like a person, the Heavenly Doctor truly did not deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's apocalyptic space, more than ten types of mutated Dao-insects were sealed. Each type possessed a unique spiritual energy release attribute, allowing Li Fan to reshape the Xuanhuang Realm to a certain extent according to his own ideas after the spiritual disaster.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this process did not require the help of the Dharma Transmitters like Zhou from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>He could accomplish this by his power alone. In each future reincarnation, he could easily replicate it.</p><p></p><p>The so-called cooperation with the Dharma Transmitters in this life was nothing more than spreading the various arrangements that would trigger the apocalyptic tribulation to the Xuanhuang Realm in advance.</p><p></p><p>It had nothing to do with this spiritual disaster.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dharma Transmitters Zhou and Wei appeared to be the masterminds behind the spiritual disaster, they had long been trapped in Li Fan's apocalyptic scheme.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The situation in Shilin Prefecture was progressing according to Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>When the Immortal Alliance headquarters received the distress call from Shilin Immortal City, out of habitual arrogance, they did not take it very seriously. After all, it was just an insect disaster. A Harmonized Dao cultivator could easily suppress and resolve it. Compared to the various emergencies reported in other prefectures, this was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>So after some assessment, the Immortal Alliance headquarters decided to handle it according to the general affairs process.</p><p></p><p>First, they sent a special envoy to Shilin Prefecture to verify the authenticity of the matter.</p><p></p><p>Then, they would dispatch the corresponding Harmonized Dao cultivators to solve this small trouble.</p><p></p><p>By the time the Immortal Alliance envoy reached Shilin Prefecture and witnessed the horror of the insect disaster firsthand, hastily returning.</p><p></p><p>With the first-hand information brought back by the envoy, the Immortal Alliance headquarters' attention to this matter increased. But not by much.</p><p></p><p>After a long discussion and inquiries sent to many Harmonized Dao cultivators about their availability.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they decided on the person to handle the disaster - Golden Sword Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>When the Golden Sword Immortal Venerable unleashed his myriad golden swords, the spiritual power was restrained, only harming with sharp sword edges. It was most suitable for dealing with these black insects.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sword Immortal Venerable readily agreed after receiving the appointment from the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Sword Immortal Venerable stated upfront that he was participating in a very important exchange conference and could not break away.</p><p></p><p>He would only have time about seven days later.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance headquarters assessed this sudden situation again.</p><p></p><p>The attendees unanimously believed that in just seven days, the insect disaster would not cause any particularly significant changes. Waiting a bit was fine.</p><p></p><p>After all, the efficiency of other Harmonized Dao Immortal Venerables might not be as high as the Golden Sword Immortal Venerable. And regardless of which Harmonized Dao Immortal Venerable, they were all extremely busy. Even if they changed to another candidate, they might not be able to find the time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there were quite a few Harmonized Dao cultivators in the Immortal Alliance headquarters who were idle.</p><p></p><p>Deliberately finding a tricky mission to remove the Harmonized Dao cultivators from the headquarters for a period of time was often seen as...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The deployment of certain provocations or conspiracies is not easily set in motion.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the Immortal Alliance headquarters keeps a low profile. Most adhere to the idea of harmony bringing wealth.</p><p></p><p>In any case, due to various customary reasons, when Golden Sword Immortal Master, full of pride and satisfaction, bid farewell to the two Dharma-transmitting masters and officially set off for Shilin Prefecture to deal with the insect disaster, nearly half a month had already passed since the outbreak of the insect disaster.</p><p></p><p>According to convention, after arriving in Shilin Prefecture, Golden Sword Immortal Master did not rush to the insect disaster site immediately. Instead, he participated in the enthusiastic welcome ceremony held by the cultivators of Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The guests enjoyed themselves to the fullest, and it was a perfect event.</p><p></p><p>The next day, as per usual, Golden Sword Immortal Master rested for a day.</p><p></p><p>On the third day, accompanied by everyone, he finally reached the Hundred Stones Grotto Heaven, which was covered with black insects.</p><p></p><p>After personally witnessing the dense swarms of black insects covering the underground caves, even these originally confident Immortal Masters of the Unified Dao couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>However, as veteran Immortal Masters, they maintained their composure. Golden Sword immediately summoned his myriad golden swords and began slaughtering these black insects.</p><p></p><p>Once he took action, Golden Sword felt slightly more at ease. Under his sharp sword edge, these black insects, which had a strong resistance to spiritual power techniques, were as flimsy as paper.</p><p></p><p>They died in large swaths, and in just a short moment, he had cleared out the cave in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the overjoyed and admiring gazes of the Shilin Prefecture cultivators, Golden Sword Immortal Master felt quite pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>"How big is the scale of this underground grotto heaven?" he asked casually, planning to seize the momentum and deal with the troublesome matter here as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>However, the answer from the crowd caught him off guard.</p><p></p><p>"Don't know? What do you mean?" Golden Sword Immortal Master's expression turned somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>After an explanation from the Shilin Prefecture cultivators, Golden Sword Immortal Master couldn't help but gasp.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the so-called Hundred Stones Grotto Heaven was a huge underground cave system on the border of Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave, countless branching paths crisscrossed.</p><p></p><p>Every certain distance, it would suddenly open up into a spacious underground hall.</p><p></p><p>In the great halls, strange rocks jutted out from the top to the bottom and from the walls to the outside, growing wildly.</p><p></p><p>The shapes varied, resembling humans and beasts, making one's heart palpitate.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had gotten lost in them, never to return.</p><p></p><p>As for how big this Hundred Stones Grotto Heaven actually was, it had not been fully explored to this day.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators speculated that the ancient beast responsible for digging out the Hundred Stones Grotto Heaven should be a creature called the Returning Origin Clam.</p><p></p><p>Although for thousands of years, no cultivator in the world had seen such a beast, perhaps one or two Returning Origin Clams still survived deep within this endless underground maze.</p><p></p><p>The entire underground of Shilin Prefecture might have already been hollowed out.</p><p></p><p>"Why wasn't such an important matter mentioned earlier?" At the thought of potentially facing a number of black insects equivalent to the area of an entire prefecture, Golden Sword Immortal Master's face couldn't help but darken.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? When we reported to the Immortal Alliance headquarters, we did inform them of this matter in its entirety," the Shilin Prefecture cultivators also had an innocent expression in the face of Golden Sword Immortal Master's questioning.</p><p></p><p>Golden Sword Immortal Master's complexion turned ashen. Deeply sensing the severity of the situation, he wasted no more words and charged into the depths of the cave with his sword raised.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Because the colony was being massacred, the First Way Insect Queen seemed to become a bit irritated. She rolled her round body.</p><p></p><p>But it was merely irritation and nothing more.</p><p></p><p>This level of population reduction couldn't even compare to the rate of the insect colony's own natural die-off.</p><p></p><p>Even if three more Golden Sword Immortal Masters came, they would still be unable to pose any threat to the First Way Insect colony.</p>

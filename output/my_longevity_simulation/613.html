        <h1>Chapter 613</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From this moment on, people will no longer be troubled by the so-called qualifications, everyone can cultivate!</p><p></p><p>The course of history in the Mystic Yellow Realm also changed because of this.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, the cultivation world did indeed experience a brief golden age due to the popularity of the new methods.</p><p></p><p>Yuanying below dogs, Nascent Soul roaming freely.</p><p></p><p>But just like Li Fan's previous experiment with Kunpeng's blood, such unbridled reproduction and devouring would inevitably invite the backlash of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the restriction "Different techniques cannot be practiced together" was nothing short of a blow to the cultivators at that time.</p><p></p><p>Then the sudden appearance of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma dealt a fatal blow to the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the Mystic Yellow cultivation world entered a long period of darkness.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the passing on of methods began.</p><p></p><p>Summoning the surviving cultivators on the wasteland, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was rebuilt.</p><p></p><p>The background of the Passing on of Methods Grandmaster has always been a mystery.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the ten major sects of the Immortal Dao back then or the current cultivators, they have never been able to figure out his origins.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Passing on of Methods Grandmaster delved into the mysteries of heaven and man, dominating the world, yet remained elusive.</p><p></p><p>Even if people wanted to probe into his identity, it was as unattainable as reaching for the sky.</p><p></p><p>Was he born with this knowledge? Without a master, how could he create such a world-shattering new method?</p><p></p><p>What was his purpose? If it was truly for the sentient beings, why did he not appear during the great calamity, when the living were suffering? Why did he only show up thousands of years later? Where had he been during that time?</p><p></p><p>And now, where is he?</p><p></p><p>There were too many secrets surrounding the Passing on of Methods Grandmaster that people could not fathom.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in the process of realizing the Bloodline Passage divine ability, the inspiration that had been forcibly suppressed by Li Fan re-emerged.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he deciphered the possible means of the Passing on of Methods Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator practicing the new method seemed like "mutant blood" assimilated by the Passing on of Methods Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Originally part of the world, they had turned into beings that devoured the world.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Passing on of Methods trying to dominate the Mystic Yellow Realm through this method?"</p><p></p><p>"Like how I control cultivators through the Bloodline Passage?"</p><p></p><p>"From the current results, one could say he has already achieved it. All affairs of the Mystic Yellow Realm are at his fingertips!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but sigh slightly.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the original Passing on of Methods Grandmaster was not as powerful.</p><p></p><p>It was even possible that he was just an ordinary cultivator at the Harmonization stage.</p><p></p><p>But he had paved a different path through such means, performing a staggering feat.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand years, he had transcended the Mystic Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan felt that "dominating the Mystic Yellow Realm" was not the Passing on of Methods Grandmaster's ultimate goal. Instead, it might be a step he needed to take in order to achieve a certain objective.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Medicinal King Sect cultivator before Li Fan's eyes using the Bloodline Passage divine ability, it was not just for controlling themselves but to assist in refining the Elixir of Immortality.</p><p></p><p>So, what would be the Passing on of Methods Grandmaster's ultimate goal?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think of the figure he glimpsed in the Immortal Burial Ground. It sent a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, the Immortal had not died and was trying to be reborn using the power of the world?</p><p></p><p>"This possibility cannot be ruled out. Even if there is such a thing as being born with this knowledge, there should be a limit. The Passing on of Methods reaching such a level... "</p><p></p><p>"Either he is a transmigrator like me, or a reborn person like Senior Zhang, or he comes from the outside! Whether the Immortal descends or other cultivators sneak in from other cultivation realms..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged in his mind, unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the Medicinal King Sect cultivator, already tainted by Li Fan's blood, slowly regained consciousness that he shifted his attention.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you..." Xia Ye looked around in confusion, his mind a mess.</p><p></p><p>He only remembered that shortly after leaving the Mystic Yellow Realm, the Medicinal King Cauldron experienced a violent tremor. Subsequently, the Sect Leader activated the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Array, forcing him into a state of sleep.</p><p></p><p>The scene here didn't seem to be inside the Medicinal King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Where was this?</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the figure not far away, Xia Ye felt an inexplicable intimacy.</p><p></p><p>"You are awake," Xia Ye heard the other person say in a very pleasant voice.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, that person recounted the cause and past events to him.</p><p></p><p>Encountering a fiery meteor falling from the sky above the heavens, feeling a resonance between the meteor and a small cauldron he had acquired by chance before, so he came to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Entering the cauldron, he found all the compartments tightly locked.</p><p></p><p>Only the place where Xia Ye resided opened for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>Finding Xia Ye severely injured, he brought him out for treatment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I am truly grateful to Senior." Xia Ye overlooked the many inconsistencies in Li Fan's words, filled with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>In the following conversation with Li Fan, he was constantly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"What, this is the Mystic Yellow Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"How did I come back again?"</p><p></p><p>"It has been thousands of years already?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't doubt Li Fan's words at all, Xia Ye was in a daze, finding it momentarily difficult to accept this reality.</p><p></p><p>【Currently the best app for audiobooks, integrated with 4 major speech synthesis engines, over 100 voice options, and support for offline reading switch sources artifact, switch app sources】</p><p></p><p>"I was too careless. I should have let you recover a bit more before telling you the truth."</p><p></p><p>"You rest for now, I will be here to take care of you, so you can rest assured." Looking at the bewildered look on the other's face, Li Fan said very gently.</p><p></p><p>Xia Ye nodded, somewhat pleasantly surprised. Lying on the stone bed in the secret room, not long after, he fell back into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Not treating me as an outsider at all, is this the power of the Bloodline Passage?" Li Fan's eyes shimmered.</p><p></p><p>"The effect turned out unexpectedly good and immediate. However, it's probably due to this kid only having Foundation Building stage strength."</p><p></p><p>"The stronger the target strength, the longer it takes to completely change one's mindset."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." Li Fan pondered for a moment, before finally taking out a green fruit from the Dongtian Realm.</p><p></p><p>This green fruit seemed to exist between reality and illusion, disappearing from Li Fan's hand every fixed interval, only to reappear soon after.</p><p></p><p>"A real-inducing fruit." Li Fan looked at this treasure derived from the Five Elders' Assembly, and with a step, he once again entered the Medicinal King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>According to Leng Hu Chang's memory, he arrived at the side of a Dao Fusion elder in the Medicinal King Sect: Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"I am Dao Fusion Master Liu Yihang of the Medicinal King Sect, the disciple of Master Liu Ruchen. Today, receiving Master's posthumous injunction, I am in charge of the Medicinal King Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pressed the green real-inducing fruit against his forehead, chanting softly.</p><p></p><p>An imperceptible light emitted from his sea of consciousness, flowing towards the real-inducing fruit.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the fruit lost its ephemeral state, becoming no different from an ordinary fruit. It just emitted a peculiar fragrance, enough to make Li Fan swallow involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the temptation, Li Fan exerted a slight force, grinding the real-inducing fruit into green liquid.</p><p></p><p>He administered it to the Dao Fusion Liu San in front of him.</p><p></p><p>While lifting the Grand Dream Spring and Autumn Array here, Li Fan once again activated the internal protective formation of the Medicinal King True Cauldron, then stood outside the door, patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Liu San slowly regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Xia Ye's dazed state, once Liu San woke up, he sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>A hint of brightness flashed in his eyes as he abruptly stood up, scanning his surroundings with his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Li Fan standing at the door, a hint of astonishment appeared on Liu San's face.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master?"</p><p></p><p>"You are awake too?"</p><p></p><p>Liu San asked subconsciously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan immediately felt relieved.</p>

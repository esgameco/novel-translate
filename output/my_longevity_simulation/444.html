            <p>"I don't want it to be any better! For this reason, we can send away some of these people so they won't keep bothering me!"</p><p></p><p>In his heart, He Zhenghao was thinking like this, but he said, "Senior, rest assured. During this time, there have been too many cultivators chasing after me for inquiries. Even if only a very small part of them is willing to transfer their contributions to you for handling, it would still be a considerable amount."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, when Senior displays extraordinary abilities and returns the contributions with interest, actions speak louder than words. Those willing to rely on Senior in the future will definitely increase."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment with a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, he nodded slowly, "It just so happens that I have also seen many unique techniques in the Tianxuan Mirror recently and can't wait to try them out. Besides, in this era of cultivation, contributions are indeed indispensable in various aspects."</p><p></p><p>"If you can truly raise a substantial amount of contributions, I will help multiply it several times when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Listening to Li Fan's casual words, He Zhenghao's eyes lit up involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, he hastily advised, "No need for so much, no need for so much!"</p><p></p><p>"You see, if one can increase half of their principal in a year, those willing to entrust their contributions to Senior will undoubtedly grow in numbers!"</p><p></p><p>"As for the remaining part, Senior can keep it for himself, even as a reward."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if some can be shared as compensation for juniors, it would be even better!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Are you content with a fifty percent increase in a year?" Li Fan was initially surprised but then nodded, "That will do."</p><p></p><p>"Then this matter is tentatively settled. Go and contact your friends."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, make sure to select those who are completely trustworthy. Contributions from cultivators with unclear backgrounds are not to be accepted."</p><p></p><p>After a few more instructions, He Zhenghao finally excitedly took out the sealed communication symbol and started responding to each one.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhang, there's an opportunity for wealth in front of you now. Would you be willing to give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The first batch of contributions collected may not be much, but that's okay."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe it once, you'll hesitate the second time."</p><p></p><p>"By the third or fourth time, seeing everyone else profiting but missing the chance themselves."</p><p></p><p>"By the fifth time, they will come crying to offer their contributions willingly."</p><p></p><p>Watching He Zhenghao busy beside him, Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Don't get it wrong.</p><p></p><p>Although what Li Fan did in this world seemed like some kind of scam.</p><p></p><p>But in reality...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan indeed had the ability to lead everyone to make big money.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the simple events of profiting hundreds of times easily like the speculation of spiritual mist grass.</p><p></p><p>Just by utilizing the various information he gathered through countless reincarnations, having foresight, and buying and selling at the right time.</p><p></p><p>Profiting fifty percent each year was a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Even something that some naturally gifted individuals could achieve, Li Fan, an unusual one in constant reincarnation, couldn't do.</p><p></p><p>So why should Li Fan bother seeking immortality and not just return to Daxuan, becoming his ordinary mortal master for eternity?</p><p></p><p>In other words, asset appreciation, for Li Fan who held a sufficient amount of advanced information, was not even remotely challenging.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were certain conditions and restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Such as not letting the scale of assets under his control become too significant.</p><p></p><p>Such as not attracting the direct sanctions of forces like the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But in truth, Li Fan had no intention of making a big fuss.</p><p></p><p>His goal was to enhance his cultivation while gathering a reasonably useful force.</p><p></p><p>And when things grew out of control and exceeded Li Fan's capacity for control...</p><p></p><p>Blazing flames, sea of flames, wiping out everything.</p><p></p><p>Ending it all at once.</p><p></p><p>If all the creditors were dead, there wouldn't be any debts to talk about.</p><p></p><p>He could openly claim these contributions as his own.</p><p></p><p>This was his preliminary plan for now.</p><p></p><p>The specifics would depend on how things unfolded.</p><p></p><p>After making some contacts, He Zhenghao went to Wuxian Island and met with his fellow cultivator friends.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until half a day later, with a pleased face, that he returned.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he brought back more than two hundred thousand contributions.</p><p></p><p>After all, no one's contributions came out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>As an Ancient Heavenly Machine Sect cultivator, your guidance was helpful, but when it came to handing over contributions...</p><p></p><p>Not many were willing.</p><p></p><p>With this over two hundred thousand contributions raised this time, a cultivator named Zhou Peng suddenly contributed fifty thousand, taking the lion's share.</p><p></p><p>Excluding him, the rest all contributed, each not exceeding five thousand contributions.</p><p></p><p>Despite this, He Zhenghao was still extremely excited at the moment.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, he transferred the two hundred and thirty thousand contributions to Li Fan through the Tianxuan Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he didn't forget to transfer another hundred thousand contributions from his own small treasury.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was about to say something, but he ultimately stopped.</p><p></p><p>He just looked at Li Fan with fervent eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Just five hundred thousand contributions after a year. It's a trivial matter! You can rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Handing over a communication charm to He Zhenghao, Li Fan said, "If there's an urgent matter, I will contact you. At other times, do not disturb me!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao nodded repeatedly and eagerly received the communication charm.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Li Fan returned to Wuxian Island.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be any problems..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Gone was the zealous blood of the past, and He Zhenghao, whose mind gradually calmed down, couldn't help but feel a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>But now that the die was cast, he could only pray that this senior from the Heavenly Machine Sect wouldn't run into any trouble.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan released Lan Xiao's several scrolls of legacy.</p><p></p><p>While procuring the supplies needed by the Empire, he patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>As expected, three days later, Shen Yuzi contacted Li Fan to express his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"I have some unique volumes here, but I need Senior to help me with a trivial matter," Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Shen Yuzi was slightly stunned but listened with interest to Li Fan's request.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." It seemed that this fellow had some kind of illicit activity going on.</p><p></p><p>But Shen Yuzi didn't care about that.</p><p></p><p>After all, who didnâ€™t have secrets in this world?</p><p></p><p>Shen Yuzi shrouded his aura and quietly appeared on Wuxian Island.</p><p></p><p>After meeting up with Li Fan, the two headed straight towards the island where the Emperor and others were located.</p><p></p><p>In a secret chamber, the Royal Saint of the Empire, Qing, who was deeply engrossed in drawing something, suddenly stood up and looked towards the direction where Li Fan was coming from, his expression turning serious.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan and Shen Yuzi landed on the island, her expression changed even more slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance of Myriad Realms does seem to have some weight to throw around."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 491</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The island of Wanxian was almost leveled to the ground, and the group of cultivators from the Five Elders Association began digging underground. Li Fan wanted to look again, but was scolded by a Jiawei cultivator and forcefully moved from the place.</p><p></p><p>Several groups of Jiawei cultivators formed a formation, herding the members of the Wanxian Alliance like a flock of sheep to a small cave at the bottom of the valley.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the cave, there was a chilling demonic wind, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>"Get in! Stop dawdling!" The leading Jiawei cultivator slammed the weapon in his hand on the ground, thundering in anger.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, some showed discontent, exchanging glances as if secretly discussing rebellion.</p><p></p><p>However, the situation prevailed, and after hesitating for a moment, they eventually submitted.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they walked into the dark cave.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was just borrowing a puppet's body, so he naturally did not feel much fear. But in order not to attract attention and buy more time, he pretended to look very frightened and followed behind the others.</p><p></p><p>As they stepped into the cave, the light vanished before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a completely different scene from what they expected appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Instead of a winding dark mountain passageway, they found themselves in a lush green valley.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, they could see a wooden pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of people were sitting in front of the pavilion, listening to a scholar-like cultivator speak. </p><p></p><p>Seeing that they didn't seem to be facing torture or punishment, the Wanxian Alliance cultivators who were previously restless and attempting to resist, calmed down once again.</p><p></p><p>They decided to first assess the situation before taking action.</p><p></p><p>Escorted by the Jiawei cultivators, the group slowly approached the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan, hidden among the group, keenly noticed a certain change happening in their bodies during this process, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that as they moved closer to the scholar at the pavilion, it seemed like their bodies were also gradually shrinking.</p><p></p><p>This change was only limited to the captured members of the Wanxian Alliance; the Jiawei cultivators, scholars, and even the scenery of the surrounding valley remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Thus, although their speed did not lessen, it felt as if they were getting farther away from their target.</p><p></p><p>This abnormal sight caused a stir among the Wanxian Alliance group, but it was quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up!" In their eyes, the Jiawei cultivators seemed to have swelled into giant mountains.</p><p></p><p>Showing no mercy, they continuously urged them forward.</p><p></p><p>Viewing from a perspective akin to ants, the Wanxian Alliance members struggled to stay composed.</p><p></p><p>Their faces gradually paled, subconsciously obeying the manipulation of the Jiawei cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As they continued onwards, the shrinking of their bodies did not stop.</p><p></p><p>After nearly spending close to a dozen days, the group finally arrived in front of the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the cultivators, the scholar already appeared as majestic as a towering mountain. </p><p></p><p>"Take a seat," the scholar said in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>But to the cultivators, it sounded like thunder, overwhelming and all-encompassing.</p><p></p><p>It echoed incessantly in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly reaching deep into their souls, even isolating themselves couldn't stop them from hearing the scholar's words in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Thus, they obediently sat down.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sorcery is this?" Everyone felt amazed.</p><p></p><p>The Jiawei cultivators silently paid their respects to the scholar, seeing that the Wanxian Alliance members were seated and then quietly left.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the group, the scholar sighed, "Another flock of lost sheep."</p><p></p><p>"However, since you have come this far by fate, I will not let you go astray again."</p><p></p><p>The members of the Wanxian Alliance, hearing this, naturally felt resentful.</p><p></p><p>"How do you perceive the Five Elders Association?" The scholar asked softly at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Using soul contracts to control cultivators is extremely evil! Lingering on the brink, within a thousand years, you will be annihilated by the Wanxian Alliance for sure. Ignorant and backward!"</p><p></p><p>Although not good characters, but being able to contest with our Wanxian Alliance for this long inevitably means they have their merits.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Their shocked expressions made it clear that their answers were not entirely voluntary at that moment.</p><p></p><p>However, not all cultivators lost control and responded to the scholar's question on their own.</p><p></p><p>At least the puppet that Li Fan was inhabiting did not seem affected.</p><p></p><p>Some core formation cultivators also resisted the scholar's manipulation with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"This is like the mass version of the Heavenly Physician's Inquiry technique?" Li Fan thought in shock.</p><p></p><p>Although seemingly not as powerful as when personally displayed by the Heavenly Physician, it was being cast on so many people.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained highly vigilant, ready to discard the puppet's body at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, the scholar did not pay too much attention to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The people spoke while the scholar smiled, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>After some time, everyone finished speaking, and the area outside the pavilion slowly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The scholar shook his head and said, "Great folly indeed!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know where the Five Elders Association originates from?" The crowd shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>After the Supreme Law Transmitter founded the Nine Laws and the Loose Cultivators attacked the immortal sects due to their astonishing cultivation speed, there was chaos and internal factions within the sects emerged, engaging in constant conflicts and battles. But before we could decisively determine the victor...</p><p></p><p>The scholar didn't give a direct answer but started narrating the history.</p><p></p><p>When the catastrophe of heaven and earth descended, the laws could not be co-cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The immortal sects suffered a devastating blow, with only a few surviving. Despite ruling the Huang Realm for thousands of years with profound heritage, these survivors who escaped the disaster secluded themselves, waiting for the storm to pass.</p><p></p><p>After the carnage ended and darkness dissipated, they united once again on the ruins.</p><p></p><p>That was how the Five Elders Association took shape today.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the stunned reactions, the scholar continued slowly.</p><p></p><p>"The conflict between the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association is essentially a struggle between the old and new forces in cultivation. All conflicts in the world mainly stem from the oppression of predecessors on successors. Thus, after millennia, the battle still continues without a definite outcome. Without settling it completely, it will never cease. You, being in the Wanxian Alliance and being deceived, are only normal, so I can't blame you."</p><p></p><p>With a compassionate expression, the scholar addressed the seated Wanxian Alliance cultivators, who all showed shock on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Though they were accustomed to the existence of the Five Elders Association, it was the first time they had heard of its origin.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, didn't seem as surprised as the other cultivators. The leader of the Five Elders Association, Zhao Shijie, was once the head of the Great Path Sect, one of the Ten Immortal Sects and Creation Deity, one of the Five Eternal Heavenly Sovereigns.</p>

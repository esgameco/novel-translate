            <p>Chapter 1247: Insisting on Exploring the Starry Sea</p><p></p><p>"All supernatural powers in the world have disappeared, and the lifespan of ordinary people is limited to a hundred years at most."</p><p></p><p>"However, people's eternal pursuit of the Dao remains unchanged."</p><p></p><p>"Through research, analysis, and utilization of the laws, even mortals can burst forth with astonishing power."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blank world before Sun Erlang's eyes, a sphere suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The sphere rotated, and countless black spots representing humans moved at an extremely fast speed on its surface.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the buildings on the ground were only a little over one zhang tall, but as time passed rapidly, more and more skyscrapers rose from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, there were even flying vehicles appearing in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>As Sun Erlang wove the world he envisioned in his mind, he recalled the teachings of his master.</p><p></p><p>"The predicament of the Xuanhuang Realm is essentially the same as those worlds without supernatural powers. Ancient scriptures often speak of the eternity of the immortal Dao. This statement may not be false."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'immortals' are those beings who have exhausted the principles of the Dao and have taken its application to the extreme. Standing at the other end of all living beings, on par with the Dao, overlooking the masses, immortal and imperishable."</p><p></p><p>"But what if the 'Dao' itself undergoes change?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao will still be the Dao. However, those existences that cannot adapt to the changed Dao will inevitably head towards extinction."</p><p></p><p>"Unable to harmonize with the Dao, immortals are not worthy of being called immortals. They will fall."</p><p></p><p>"Among the masses, there will always be new 'users of the Dao' born. The power they wield will also grow stronger and stronger."</p><p></p><p>"Becoming the new 'immortals'."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Faceless Sacred Emperor's words were extremely profound. Not only Sun Erlang, but also the other personal disciples under the Sacred Emperor, none of them could understand the principle within.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, with the help of the power of the Reality Fruit, having the fortune to experience the taste of being a creator.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at the world he had created before his eyes and suddenly had a realization.</p><p></p><p>In that spherical world, after countless years of natural evolution, there would always be a race that conformed to the ultimate laws of the world he created.</p><p></p><p>They could discover the ultimate secrets of the world that other living beings could not perceive, and thereby become the so-called "Dao-using" beings of this world.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's vision rapidly traversed and descended upon the sphere he had created.</p><p></p><p>Inside one of the ordinary buildings, a young scholar was frowning and pondering under the lamplight.</p><p></p><p>On the blackboard in front of him were written complex formulas and diagrams.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no..."</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly did the problem occur? Why is there such a large deviation between my calculation results and the actual motion trajectory?"</p><p></p><p>"It's as if there is a force binding us, not allowing us to leave this planet."</p><p></p><p>In the dark night, it seemed to be directly facing Sun Erlang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's vision blurred, and the scene shattered with a boom.</p><p></p><p>When he came back to his senses, he was surprised to find that some spaceships on the sphere had already begun attempting to fly out of the "world's boundary."</p><p></p><p>But outside the world, Sun Erlang had not yet created anything, and it was still empty.</p><p></p><p>They naturally would not succeed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's thoughts turned rapidly, and he began to open up a new map.</p><p></p><p>The white space slowly turned dark. In the starry sky, in addition to the original initial planet, thousands of other planets also began to appear.</p><p></p><p>The scope of the map suddenly expanded more than a hundred thousand times, and Sun Erlang's Dao-shaping stone suddenly had some difficulty keeping up.</p><p></p><p>In order to reduce the workload, Sun Erlang set these planets to be basically desolate places full of death, with no life existing.</p><p></p><p>And in order to prevent the natives of the original planet from expanding too quickly, he pulled the distance between each planet very far apart.</p><p></p><p>So far that without longevity power, it was almost impossible to achieve interplanetary crossing in a small person's lifetime.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With great effort, Sun Erlang barely managed to save the world that was on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>But soon, before he had time to perfect and expand the starry sea scene, the world became precarious again.</p><p></p><p>After some investigation, Sun Erlang suddenly realized that the natives had actually begun to doubt the reality of the world they were in.</p><p></p><p>It was not only due to the inability to fly out of the world but also because they had observed the countless planets in the starry sea that they had not observed before.</p><p></p><p>These planets appeared as if they had suddenly emerged, shattering their perceptions.</p><p></p><p>"One cannot crudely set rules, but must root the appearances of all things in the fundamental principles of the world."</p><p></p><p>This sentence suddenly surfaced in Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he made corresponding adjustments.</p><p></p><p>Next, in the natives' unrelenting attempt once again, a spaceship actually succeeded in breaking free from the planet's restraints and entered the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>The humans on the spaceship unexpectedly discovered that outside the planet, there existed a ring of blue light.</p><p></p><p>It was the existence of this light ring that interfered with the internal observations of the planet and prevented their previous attempts to break out of the planet.</p><p></p><p>This spaceship, after experiencing a life-and-death crisis, finally returned to the ground and made this discovery public.</p><p></p><p>And the scholars on the planet, after including the variable of the star ring in their calculations, finally achieved a temporary consistency between theory and reality.</p><p></p><p>People cheered, welcoming the arrival of a new era. At the same time, they regarded the members of the first ship that flew into space as heroes.</p><p></p><p>With successful experience, the development speed of the planet's natives, who had been suppressed for a long time, reached a peak.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, by this time, Sun Erlang had already roughly depicted the desolate starry sea scene.</p><p></p><p>And due to the vastness of the created starry sea, he temporarily stabilized these natives with space and time.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Erlang knew that this was only a temporary measure.</p><p></p><p>One day, they would realize the abnormality of this starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to be discovered, you have to continue expanding this starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"And the speed of expansion must exceed the speed of these little people's exploration."</p><p></p><p>The macroscopic perspective was raised again by tens of thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>Endless nebulae and star rivers were born in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Dao-shaping stone had also been running to its limit.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called pulling one hair affects the whole body. Every object in the starry sea is connected to each other."</p><p></p><p>"It's not as simple as adding them on later. We also need to consider the impact of their appearance on the original planets."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering, Sun Erlang felt that the Dao-shaping stone was in danger of collapsing. He simply made up his mind and brutally reduced these impacts to a minimum using the span of space.</p><p></p><p>"It should be a long time before these little people notice something is wrong."</p><p></p><p>The natives were still progressing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>They studied the star ring and invented the counter-current boat that could reversely utilize the binding force of the star ring.</p><p></p><p>Like a slingshot, it threw the spaceship out at high speed.</p><p></p><p>Although unable to turn back, it was also extremely...</p><p></p><p>The acceleration of the native people's exploration of this starry sea greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>"This is too fast?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang stared in amazement at the first retrograde boat, constantly using the power of the star rings of passing planets to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Sun Erlang guided a meteor to change its original trajectory and smash it fiercely towards that retrograde boat. </p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the people on the flying boat managed to dodge it to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the scene on the retrograde boat appeared before Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, thanks to you! Otherwise we would have really perished this time!"</p><p></p><p>A serious-looking middle-aged man with a long beard did not relax his expression: "This piece of debris came a bit strangely. The starry sky is so vast, yet it happened to meet us..."</p><p></p><p>"Be on guard! Don't be careless!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Hearing this little man's words, Sun Erlang couldn't help but be embarrassed. He indeed did it a bit crudely.</p><p></p><p>But he also instantly thought of a way to make amends. </p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang lightly pointed to the planet closest to the retrograde boat.</p><p></p><p>Before long, it was seen disintegrating with a bang.</p><p></p><p>Turning into thousands of pieces of debris, like a torrential downpour, smashing towards the retrograde boat one after another.</p><p></p><p>Luck may strike once but not twice.</p><p></p><p>Such a dense group of debris was still precisely guided.</p><p></p><p>The retrograde boat naturally had no more chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>In the collision, it turned into a ball of fire and disappeared from the starry sea forever.</p><p></p><p>However, an accident was fundamentally unable to curb the natives' curiosity about the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Next, more and more huge and advanced retrograde boats flew out from the initial planet.</p><p></p><p>They began to explore in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Although he really wanted to destroy all these spaceships again using the old method, Sun Erlang knew that his previous actions had already shaken the rules of this world-creating game.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to intervene so directly, this world would instead collapse faster.</p><p></p><p>So Sun Erlang could only think of another way.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the countless spaceships bouncing on the star rings, he soon had an idea.</p><p></p><p>It was a year later that the native little people discovered something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The planets generally ushered in record-breaking extreme weather.</p><p></p><p>Cold currents and droughts ravaged.</p><p></p><p>Food production decreased, and even the birth rate of the natives began to decline slightly.</p><p></p><p>The little people noticed something was wrong, gathered the most elite scholars on the planet, and began to study the reasons for these disasters.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Although the star rings restrained them and prevented them from going to the starry sea,</p><p></p><p>They were also a protective umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Isolating the planets from the extreme environments in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, with the abuse of the star ring's elasticity, the star rings have shown a subtle degree of shrinkage.</p><p></p><p>Although this degree of shrinkage was negligible for the star rings themselves,</p><p></p><p>The fragile ecology of the planets simply could not withstand the impact it brought.</p><p></p><p>After a fierce discussion, the native little people finally temporarily gave up the plan to explore the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>The retrograde boats were also sealed from then on.</p><p></p><p>"It can last for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long has passed in the real world outside."</p><p></p><p>Looking at this starry river he personally shaped, his expression became a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>Time flies.</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye, another hundred years passed on the initial planet.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the third decade, there were boats approaching the star rings to take samples for research.</p><p></p><p>In the fifth decade, after the unremitting efforts of all the little people, they finally found a way to repair the damage to the star rings.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang personally saw these little people recreating the power of the star rings in the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>His mind was shocked, and thousands of thoughts surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"But these little people are also the manifestation of the laws of this world. As part of the world, they have the ability to explore the essential source of the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Because it truly exists, it can be studied and utilized."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The changes on the initial planet continued.</p><p></p><p>After the little people confirmed the effectiveness of repairing the star rings through multiple experiments, they, who had been holding back for a long time, finally could not bear it anymore.</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented era of exploration arrived.</p><p></p><p>Countless retrograde boats set off from the initial planet again, exploring the endless starry sea.</p><p></p><p>In the seventh decade, the little people invented a method to sail far without relying on the elasticity of the star rings, but only on the star ring's power furnace.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the natives officially realized the round trip of exploring the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>From the eighth decade to the first century, the little people ushered in a new era of pioneering the starry sea and colonization.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Sun Erlang knew it was only a matter of time before his world of lies was exposed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the countless little people who still sacrificed for this, Sun Erlang felt an inexplicable emotion in his heart for some reason.</p><p></p><p>He no longer tried to expand the boundaries of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>But silently watched the footsteps of the little people walking towards the edge of the world.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>When a retrograde boat with a peculiar shape finally reached the edge of the starry sea,</p><p></p><p>The world in front of Sun Erlang suddenly shook.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Like exploding stars, it burst out with dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>And disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Erlang did not return to the real world.</p><p></p><p>There was still a blank in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was a little surprised, looking around, not knowing what had changed.</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly sounded from behind Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart jumped, and he immediately turned his head.</p><p></p><p>I saw a Taoist priest with long eyebrows and white hair, holding a duster, smiling and looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang vaguely guessed the identity of this person in his heart, and said tentatively in a bold manner: "Greetings to the Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest did not respond, still smiling and looking at Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Sun Erlang recalled the civilization of the little people on that initial planet.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he realized in surprise: "Something is a bit wrong. Those little people on the planet..."</p><p></p><p>"Too united."</p><p></p><p>"There were actually no major wars or infighting. Even when the planet was in crisis, they were always able to put aside their differences and join hands to solve it."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Compared with the current situation in the Xuanhuang Realm, it's really a bit incredible."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest nodded, and then asked again: "This is one thing. What else?"</p><p></p><p>"What else?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The little people's obsession with exploring the starry sea is a bit too deep."</p><p></p><p>"Even after suffering multiple dangers, they still never gave up."</p><p></p><p>"Even the top level of the planet's hierarchy held the same belief..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at the Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>"This may be unimaginable in the real world."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please move your fingers and share this website to Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

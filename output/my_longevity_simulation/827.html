        <h1>Chapter 827</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The faint pressure emanating from the other party made Yu Dayi almost certain that she was undoubtedly at the Harmonious Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>If they had chosen to take action just now, it would definitely be his group who would have died!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how he had nearly brushed shoulders with death, cold sweat immediately appeared on Yu Dayi's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"This Myriad Realms Alliance is indeed extremely treacherous! They actually have a Harmonious Dao expert pressuring a mere Golden Core cultivator who came to trade." Yu Dayi couldn't help but curse inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I was cautious enough!"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to salute Lin Ling, he saw a layer of green light envelop the two of them.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, their figures disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Only the group from the Five Elders Association was left behind, their hearts filled with lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>"How did they leave? Did any of you see it?" Yu Dayi narrowed his eyes to observe, then turned his head and asked.</p><p></p><p>"There were no spatial fluctuations. No matter how fast one flies, there should still be traces left behind. Disappearing without a trace in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked down at the ground in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Earth veins..." After pondering for a moment, a hint of solemnity appeared in Yu Dayi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shuttling through the surging earth veins once again, Lin Ling did not directly return to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, at Li Fan's indication, she rushed towards the Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, news came from Tian Yang. He had already reached the vicinity of the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he had not yet discovered any cultivators from the Myriad Immortals Alliance guarding the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan told Tian Yang to wait on the side first and not to rush into entering.</p><p></p><p>After about half a day, Lin Ling brought Li Fan and Tian Yang to meet up.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was very curious about the dull-witted Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>However, Tian Yang seemed to not even see Lin Ling at all, and just stood quietly beside Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first observed the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entrance to the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven was still in a state where cultivators rarely passed by.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what triggered its discovery."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was thinking this, his hands did not slow down in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the Dissociation Disk emitted a glowing white light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first laid down the "One Hand Covers the Sky" secret technique in the periphery to prevent the leakage of aura. Then, he quickly laid down the infinite formation derived from the Dissociation Disk to seal off the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Actually, doing this was somewhat akin to trying to hide a needle in a haystack. It might even cause other cultivators to discover the abnormality here instead...</p><p></p><p>"If I don't do this, the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven will definitely be discovered. With the arrangement, I can at least delay for some time."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with the infinite formation plus the One Hand Covers the Sky secret technique, even if an ordinary Harmonious Dao expert comes, as long as they don't deliberately search carefully, they probably won't be able to discover it."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can delay until my Golden Core is perfected and devour it, it'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he brought Lin Ling and Tian Yang into the grotto-heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" As soon as she entered this grotto-heaven, Lin Ling appeared very surprised.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze looked towards the wood-attributed grotto-heaven inside.</p><p></p><p>There, a towering giant tree that reached the heavens also existed.</p><p></p><p>If only comparing size, it was probably even larger than Lin Ling's main body in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is your senior there?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Lin Ling shook her head somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, her expression was also a bit strange: "According to what the earth vein senior said, having grown this big, it should be able to awaken its own spirit. How strange. Is it lacking something here..."</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"What did you discover?" </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan also seemed to have some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"The difference between Dongtian and small worlds is not just in size. This Five Elements Great Dongtian is much more vast compared to Lingmu, and even Daxuan and Lijie."</p><p></p><p>"But it still falls within the scope of a Dongtian."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully recalled the process of Bai Xiansheng creating a miniature Xuanhuang world with his bare hands in the 115th world, comprehending where the specific dividing line between Dongtian and small worlds lies.</p><p></p><p>After some fruitless pondering, Li Fan could only put it aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He didn't rush to explore this wood-attribute Dongtian, but first searched for traces of other Dongtians.</p><p></p><p>"At this point in time, among the Five Elements, only the wood-attribute Dongtian is visible on the outside. The others - metal, water, fire, and earth - are all hidden."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Five Elements circulate and are actually one body. I also have the experience of personally witnessing the full picture of Dongtian, so it's not difficult to find them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes and swept his divine sense through the wood-attribute Dongtian, tracing the changes of wood-attribute spiritual power in this world.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he had already discovered the passages leading to the fire and water Dongtians.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't enter directly.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he searched for the passages and went to the void outside the intersection of the Five Great Dongtians.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the vast passages he had experienced before, they had not yet been developed by the Wanxian Alliance at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Not only were the passages narrow and hard to find, even the "void" outside the Dongtian was only thinly covered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan simply transformed into a Realm-Splitting Whale through the Melting Furnace Myriad Transformations technique.</p><p></p><p>This made the void slightly more vast and easier to stand on.</p><p></p><p>Five circular rings that seemed to be connected end to end, but also like mixed paints.</p><p></p><p>Since they had not yet been over-exploited and excavated by the Wanxian Alliance, the Dongtians were still full of vitality at this time.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the several Dongtians from afar, one could even vaguely sense their thick aura as if they were one body.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, this scene is completely different from what I saw before, ravaged by the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"But I still don't know what exactly the Wanxian Alliance did in that world, mobilizing a huge force to almost hollow out these Five Elements Dongtians."</p><p></p><p>"However, if we are forced to a dead end in this world, there might be a chance to see it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood and admired for a long time before flying back into the wood-attribute Dongtian.</p><p></p><p>He also took the opportunity to widen the passages again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan and the other two have the chance to carefully observe the full picture of the wood-attribute Dongtian.</p><p></p><p>A huge tree with a canopy occupying almost a third of the sky immediately caught their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Ling seemed to feel a trace of discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, although the spirit tree occupied the vast majority of the space in the wood-attribute Dongtian, it did not erode the survival of other living beings. Instead, it released wisps of rich vitality, nourishing all directions.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the spirit tree itself, the more concentrated the vitality, almost forming a light green mist.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of various plants competed to bloom.</p><p></p><p>Even well-versed in the "Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture", Li Fan couldn't name the vast majority of them at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Li Fan finally understood what the Tianxuan Mirror meant when it mentioned the wood-attribute Dongtian, saying "The scale of this Dongtian is extremely large, with extremely high wood-attribute spiritual energy. Various spiritual plants and herbs are extremely abundant."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this Dongtian belongs to Li Fan!</p>

            <p>天絕 trembled all over.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I killed them all!"</p><p></p><p>"Qin Tang, little bug, Fu Yun…"</p><p></p><p>"I killed them all!"</p><p></p><p>Even Confucius found it difficult to accept this answer for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Why…" he asked in a daze.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Tian Jue suddenly changed his expression.</p><p></p><p>"No…"</p><p></p><p>"It's not true!"</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't me!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Jue raised his head abruptly and stared fiercely at Tian Yi: "It's all your doing!"</p><p></p><p>"All the memories in my mind, they're all fake!"</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the day I met you, things have become twisted."</p><p></p><p>"Everything is out of control..."</p><p></p><p>Tian Kill Sword pointed directly at Tian Yi: "Was it you after all!"</p><p></p><p>Facing Tian Jue's question, Tian Yi's face remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"I thought this time, you guys would make some progress."</p><p></p><p>"Turns out, it's still the same."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that?" Tian Yu sensed a different meaning in Tian Yi's words and asked suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi did not answer, but continued, saying to himself: "I've explained it to you many times. Sometimes, even what you see with your own eyes might not be true."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he inexplicably took out a set of nine silver needles from somewhere and placed them in the air one by one.</p><p></p><p>"They went crazy, trying to kill me."</p><p></p><p>"I had no choice but to deal with the problem in my own way."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu watched as Tian Yi took out the nine silver needles, his expression suddenly darkening.</p><p></p><p>Without listening to Tian Yi's explanation anymore, he immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>"No breaking of laws!"</p><p></p><p>"Bind!"</p><p></p><p>As if something was entwining Tian Yi's body, his movements in manipulating the silver needles stuttered slightly.</p><p></p><p>Weak! Hurt! Stagnant! Decayed! Damaged!...</p><p></p><p>Several different words continuously came out of Tian Yu's mouth.</p><p></p><p>With each word, Tian Yi's movements slowed down a bit more.</p><p></p><p>With eyes turning red, the old fisherman who had been watching Tian Yi's actions closely at this moment also grabbed the Tian Kill Sword.</p><p></p><p>His body turned into a black aura, merging with the Tian Kill Sword.</p><p></p><p>Like a sharp arrow, it aimed straight at Tian Yi.</p><p></p><p>And Tian Yi, controlled by Tian Yu, seemed to have no strength to resist, unable to make a move.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the black sword aura passed straight through his chest.</p><p></p><p>The black aura surged angrily, engulfing Tian Yi like a tide, devouring him.</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye, Tian Yi, who had a calm expression, disappeared within the Cloud Water Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yi is dead?"</p><p></p><p>Hidden in a corner, watching the battle between the three, Zhou Qing'ang was suddenly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The battle between Tian Yi, Tian Yu, and Tian Jue did not produce any aftermath.</p><p></p><p>So, the clone watching secretly was temporarily safe.</p><p></p><p>But the scene in front of him was obviously beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that Tian Yi, with his strong abilities, could not have fallen so easily under the joint attack of Tian Yu and Tian Jue...</p><p></p><p>"With his strength, it's absolutely impossible to be so helpless, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>He looked up and gazed at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, two dark clouds appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>As he recognized what they were, Li Fan's breath caught in his throat.</p><p></p><p>Those were two giant hands, crossing through the sky, coming from the outside and landing inside the Cloud Water Temple.</p><p></p><p>Confucius and the fisherman both looked up in astonishment at the two hands above.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to resist, they found themselves already firmly restrained.</p><p></p><p>A horrified expression crept onto their faces.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, this surgery will soon be over."</p><p></p><p>A thunderous sound came from the sky, the voice of Tian Yi!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart thumped violently, almost stopping his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Yes, from start to finish, the confrontation between the fisherman, Confucius, and Tian Yi was just his image.</p><p></p><p>And now, these two hands were the true form of Tian Yi!</p><p></p><p>Vaguely sensing Tian Jue's strength, and Confucius.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in front of these two giant hands, they were like bugs on an operating table, utterly powerless to resist.</p><p></p><p>They could only let the hands catch them and hold them in the air.</p><p></p><p>Then Tian Yi's two giant hands beckoned the nine silver needles taken out by the clone earlier and began to "treat" both of them.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this scene from afar, Li Fan shivered uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yi, what is he..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a single thought completely occupied Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Crisis! Great danger!</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi's true strength far exceeded his estimates. </p><p></p><p>Even if he was not in the realm of immortals, he was not far off.</p><p></p><p>He immediately abandoned this clone, not wanting Tian Yi to follow the clues and find his main body!</p><p></p><p>Quickly!</p><p></p><p>However, he soon awoke.</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi had obviously discovered that someone was scheming behind his back.</p><p></p><p>But his first thought would probably be the group of people with strength similar to his own, not to search among the ants watching the battle beside him.</p><p></p><p>This was a fixed way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>But if at this crucial moment, a random ant inexplicably died...</p><p></p><p>It would be too obvious!</p><p></p><p>Under Tian Yi's terrifying power, not only would all leads not be destroyed, there was a high possibility that it would attract Tian Yi's attention!</p><p></p><p>What to do?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flooded Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Wait and see!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to gamble on whether Tian Yi still retained a "human" way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>Or if he had elevated himself and could no longer be reasoned with.</p><p></p><p>If he guessed right, then even though he was defeated miserably, at least it wouldn't be entirely without gain.</p><p></p><p>If he guessed wrong...</p><p></p><p>Following the signal from the clone, it would take some time to reach the main body.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, his main body was not in the Cloud Water Sea, but deep within the Wuxian League.</p><p></p><p>He believed that even if Tian Yi discovered some clues and wanted to find him, it wouldn't happen in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Enough for him, Li Fan, to escape!</p><p></p><p>This was based on his experience from the last encounter with Tian Yi.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan bet!</p><p></p><p>With immense fear in his heart, Li Fan resisted the urge to kill the clone directly.</p><p></p><p>Eyes widened, all other thoughts cleared from his mind, he watched Tian Yi's surgery intently.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current vision, he still couldn't make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>Just silver lights flying around, the angry shouts of Tian Yu and Tian Jue becoming weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they seemed to fall into a deep sleep, barely audible.</p><p></p><p>After the surgery was completed, the fisherman reverted to his original forgetful appearance.</p><p></p><p>After scanning around, his face was filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the two hands in the sky, he simply walked out of the Cloud Water Temple.</p><p></p><p>As for Confucius, he loaded his cart again and disappeared amidst the tranquil sound of reading.</p><p></p><p>Having done all this, the two giant hands put away the silver needles.</p><p></p><p>Gently pressing down.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Water Temple, which had been filled with screams moments ago, fell quiet.</p>

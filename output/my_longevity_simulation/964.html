        <h1>Chapter 964</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan was completely immersed in the study of "Patching the Heavens". </p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a slight tremor that occurred throughout the entire Spirit Wood Realm awakened him.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his gaze towards the center of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an astonishing phenomenon appeared on the originally lush and towering giant tree that pierced straight into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The branches and leaves swayed slightly without wind, enveloped in a layer of hazy, lustrous white light.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the ancient tree, a beam of light shot up into the sky, directly piercing a hole in the firmament.</p><p></p><p>This was not an exaggerated figure of speech, but a real hole that appeared in the sky of the Spirit Wood Realm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The hole seemed to have a terrifying suction force, swirling and absorbing the surrounding clouds.</p><p></p><p>Below the giant tree, all the tree people stopped their work at hand and knelt down in worship.</p><p></p><p>Their faces showed no panic, but a joy that came from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"World upgrade?"</p><p></p><p>By now, the Spirit Wood Realm could be considered half of Li Fan's magic treasure. With a slight sense, he knew exactly what had happened.</p><p></p><p>The nourishing feedback from Lin Ling, the transformation by Shang Tian using the Heavenly Scenery Gourd. Most importantly, more than a thousand Heaven and Earth Blast Furnaces released spiritual energy day and night without stopping...</p><p></p><p>Under the superposition of several factors, it finally led to the metamorphosis of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was a rare and strange scene that occurred only once in thousands of years, and was rarely recorded even in immortal cultivation classics.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the crowd in the Spirit Wood Realm all held their breath and concentrated, watching and comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, in the void, it seemed that something was being extracted, and poured into the Spirit Wood Realm through the hole in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A slight rumbling sound resounded through the world. On the surface, the scenery of the Spirit Wood Realm did not seem to have changed much.</p><p></p><p>But as the lord of the Spirit Wood Realm, Li Fan keenly noticed that the overall strength of the Spirit Wood Realm was rising rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious was the giant tree that created this realm.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan could easily destroy the giant tree with a single move.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, from the roots to the trunk to the leaves, every part of the giant tree was constantly becoming tougher.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it even became able to withstand Li Fan's blow without being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The vortex hole gradually shrank and finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The upgrade of the Spirit Wood Realm was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>Although the actual size of the Spirit Wood Realm did not seem to change, everyone in this realm who witnessed the process of the world upgrade with their own eyes inexplicably felt a sense of rising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The sky became more vast, and the earth became more expansive.</p><p></p><p>Even the air became more refreshing.</p><p></p><p>Vitality was invisible, but its existence could be clearly felt.</p><p></p><p>Finally breaking through that threshold, the combat power was equivalent to that of a Xuanhuang Realm Dao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The tree people had almost shed their tree form and became almost indistinguishable from human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Only the natural patterns on their faces showed their original tree people identity.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a verdant green dress, the female chief of the tree people gave orders, commanding all the tree people to continue bowing and chanting, praising the grace of Li Fan, the lord of the Spirit Wood.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Li Fan's calm voice came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Wood has been upgraded, and you have been reborn. From now on, your destiny is no longer limited to this realm..."</p><p></p><p>"I will bestow upon you the name..."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Xin!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Xin showed an excited expression and led the tree people to kowtow again.</p><p></p><p>Kneel.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci, Tian Yang, and others also had a look of emotion on their faces.</p><p></p><p>After instructing everyone to continue manufacturing the "Heaven and Earth Furnace", Li Fan's attention shifted to the Lingmu Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, if it hadn't already been captured by the Xuanhuang Realm, based on the current specifications and level of the Lingmu Realm, it should have been able to meet the minimum standard requirements of the Immortal Cultivation Realm."</p><p></p><p>Combining the descriptions of the worlds in the Butian Records, Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Immortal Path was severed, the recent world upgrade could have left a mark in the Immortal Ascension Passage. Cultivators in the world who reached a certain level of cultivation could ascend in broad daylight and transform into immortals. What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Immortal Path is broken and it has fallen into the hands of the Xuanhuang Realm, even though it is said to have been upgraded, it is still just a small subsidiary world of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, "The Xuanhuang Realm has really done a lot of harm!"</p><p></p><p>"However, to put it another way, since the Lingmu Realm can still complete the world upgrade, then can the Xuanhuang Realm do it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned and pondered for a long time, and finally came to a conclusion: "Theoretically speaking, it is still possible for the Xuanhuang Realm to be upgraded."</p><p></p><p>"That is... to be elevated to an Immortal Realm!" Li Fan's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the gap between the Immortal Cultivation Realm and the Immortal Realm is too great. Even if the Xuanhuang Realm has now devoured countless Immortal Cultivation Realms, it has only expanded its territory a little. It is still far from meeting the requirements for promotion to the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>"Only when it is a hundred times larger than the current Xuanhuang Realm, will there be a glimmer of possibility for promotion to the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"But even then, perhaps it won't be worthy of the term 'Immortal Realm'. It may be more appropriate to describe it as an 'Immortal Domain'."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but imagine.</p><p></p><p>As for what the reality is...</p><p></p><p>Even Tian Yi, the author of the Butian Records, had never seen the Immortal Realm with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to verify it in the first place.</p><p></p><p>However, based on Li Fan's understanding of Tian Yi, this person was very rigorous in his studies. If it was just a simple guess without substantive evidence to support it, he would not easily write it in his own book.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm Lord of the Tianfa Realm enforces the law on behalf of heaven, and may be able to grasp some secrets from before the Immortal Path was cut off."</p><p></p><p>Observing this world upgrade also brought some inspiration to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Thoughts on the essence of the world's operation and the ultimate cultivation method suitable for himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not one to get up early for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Although he had come into contact with a lot of cultivation methods in the reincarnation, he still felt that only the "Sitting Immortal Technique" from the Zuoshan Jue was the most suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>However, with Li Fan's current level of cultivation, what he needed to face were old monsters like Tian Yi, Ruo Mu, and Shi Ban.</p><p></p><p>Simple cultivation methods could no longer help him.</p><p></p><p>He was already more than a step behind others in terms of the fundamentals of cultivation, so how could he compete with them?</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi's guidance surfaced in Li Fan's mind again.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the cultivation method is secondary. What's really important is the contemplation of the operation of the Heavenly Dao and the essence of the world."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how powerful a cultivation method is, it ultimately belongs to someone else. Only what truly suits you is the most perfect cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, his gaze distant.</p><p></p><p>The Butian Records, the Sitting Immortal Technique, the world upgrade...</p><p></p><p>It was as if a fierce storm was blowing in his mind, and all his past experiences and insights were thrown into it.</p><p></p><p>After being tempered like a furnace, it finally exploded with a bang!</p><p></p><p>It turned into three characters in Li Fan's mind!</p>

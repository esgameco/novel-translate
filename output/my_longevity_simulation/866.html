        <h1>Chapter 866</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>With the stone tablet scholar's words, Li Fan's heart had in fact already become extremely tense. </p><p></p><p>However, the current Li Taishi already possessed the battle power of Uniting the Dao. Moreover, he had the Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light and many other great divine powers at his side.</p><p></p><p>He would no longer be easily frightened by someone's few words and "truly believe it".</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party was the Eternal Life Venerated One!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided...</p><p></p><p>To further probe the other party's background!</p><p></p><p>So, Li Fan pretended to be somewhat doubtful and a bit surprised: "Beyond the Primordial Yellow Realm? What does that have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar smiled slightly: "Since you refuse to admit it, then let's take a look at the records about you on the stone tablet."</p><p></p><p>Behind the stone tablet, a surge of cyan light welled up.</p><p></p><p>An aura of the vicissitudes of time flowed from the scholar's body. Various images began to continuously revolve and appear around the two of them.</p><p></p><p>It was like falling into the long river of history, with scenes of past events in the Primordial Yellow Realm unfolding like a scroll painting.</p><p></p><p>The scholar even let out a muffled groan as his body began to expand.</p><p></p><p>His facial features and the clothes on his body, for some reason, rapidly changed in succession.</p><p></p><p>One moment he was a handsome scholar, the next a robust woodcutter.</p><p></p><p>Then he became a charming beauty.  </p><p></p><p>Sometimes he wasn't even human.</p><p></p><p>But a tree, a flower.</p><p></p><p>Birds flying in the sky, beasts walking on the ground.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Only the stone tablet behind, with its eternal cyan light, remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the images revolving on the surrounding screens gradually began to stabilize.</p><p></p><p>Glowing brightly, what appeared on it was precisely Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>However, there was no scene of him flying out from the Great Mystery.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't even the scene in the beginning of him coming to the Primordial Yellow Realm through a spatial passage and heading straight for Tianyang Cave Mansion to subdue Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>It only showed him bringing Tianyang and entering Shilin Prefecture. </p><p></p><p>Finding the entrance to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Entering and exiting again, then capturing Shang Tianci in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Finding Mr. Bai's secret room underground in Taihua Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Spirit Wood Realm, then bringing out Lin Ling who had the power of Uniting the Dao.</p><p></p><p>First completing a transaction with the Five Elders Society, then heading straight for the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven in Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The scenes kept changing.</p><p></p><p>However, the vigilance in Li Fan's heart instantly relaxed quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>"It's just as I thought."</p><p></p><p>"The Creation Stone Tablet automatically records all things that occur in the Primordial Yellow Realm in great detail. But it's limited to just the original Primordial Yellow Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"You should know, the current Primordial Yellow Realm was formed from the fusion of the original realm with countless grotto-heavens, small worlds, and even fragments of many other immortal cultivation realms!"</p><p></p><p>"The Creation Stone Tablet may not necessarily have records of these outsiders!"</p><p></p><p>To use a house as an analogy:</p><p></p><p>The original Primordial Yellow Realm was just a single small room.</p><p></p><p>But after so many years of expansion by countless cultivators, the Primordial Yellow Realm has become much larger than before.</p><p></p><p>The Creation Stone Tablet born together with heaven and earth in that initial small room has complete recording authority.</p><p></p><p>But for these lands that came from outside, the Creation Stone Tablet has lost its ability to record!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scenes continued to change.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan anticipated, it was intermittent.</p><p></p><p>Most critically, Congyun Sea, Spirit Wood Realm, Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven... where he often appeared were not within the scope of the records.</p><p></p><p>So it was basically all scenes of him hurrying on the road, constantly hurrying.</p><p></p><p>"Then when this scholar said he came for me..."</p><p></p><p>"Where did the flaw appear?" Li Fan's mind raced.</p><p></p><p>The scenes shown on the stone tablet were already approaching the current point in time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ji Shaoli's avatar appeared in the scene.</p><p></p><p>The moment he entered Yong Yun State, the scene abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>After Ji Shaoli left Yong Yun State, he headed straight for the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Was it the seven-colored divine light that caught his attention?" Li Fan couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by the stone tablet scholar next also confirmed his guess.</p><p></p><p>"I don't actually care about the truth or falsehood of that so-called Myriad Realms Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"What I'm more interested in is where you obtained this seven-colored divine light from in Yong Yun State." The scholar looked at Li Fan, his eyes burning with intensity.</p><p></p><p>"The level of this object is not something that can be nurtured in the remnant states."</p><p></p><p>"Can't it be a divine ability that I comprehended myself?" Li Fan retorted.</p><p></p><p>The scholar laughed in spite of himself.</p><p></p><p>"I possess the Creation Stone Tablet, so I am naturally very familiar with the aura emanating from your seven-colored radiance. It is a power that has nearly condensed the Dao of a world. If you had such abilities, then the one asking questions here today would not be me."</p><p></p><p>"But you." The scholar said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no mocking intent, coupled with his expression and tone, it still made Li Fan snort coldly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan not answering, the stone tablet scholar continued, "Rest assured, I won't snatch your belongings. This seven-colored divine light, while powerful, is just a burden to me."</p><p></p><p>"What I truly want to know is the place that nurtured the seven-colored divine light." The stone tablet scholar stated frankly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, "What does Senior mean by this? How do you know that the seven-colored divine light was produced by something? Can't it be that there's just a single treasure hidden in Yong Yun State?"</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar sighed.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery on the light screens suddenly turned pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Then, a point of seven-colored light abruptly appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, it was incomparably dazzling and eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>The scholar looked at Li Fan, "Do you understand now?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as such a treasure exists in the world, regardless of whether it has been refined by someone or not. It is always like this."</p><p></p><p>"In the past..."</p><p></p><p>"Some people thoroughly searched the Xuanhuang Realm. Apart from that Tianxuan Mirror, there are no longer any treasures above the realm-grade in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, your seven-colored divine light must have appeared not long ago..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan's expression turned somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that while this seven-colored divine light was powerful, in the eyes of true powerhouses, it was actually so eye-catching?</p><p></p><p>Faced with the stone tablet scholar's inquiry, Li Fan's mind also raced, thinking about how to answer.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he had a plan.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a very troubled appearance, full of struggle, he finally let out a long sigh, "Forget it, I knew this matter couldn't be kept hidden after all."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, follow me, and you'll know at a glance."</p><p></p><p>With that, he awakened Lin Ling, who had been in a dazed state and watching from the side, not daring to interject.</p><p></p><p>Then, he dove underground, heading straight for Yong Yun State.</p><p></p><p>In the earth veins, the stone tablet scholar followed closely behind, as if taking a leisurely stroll, unhurried.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Li Fan inwardly clicked his tongue.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, "No wonder in the previous life, even though he had a treasure like the Fishing Pond, Zhong Shentong didn't always guard it later on. Instead, he wandered around everywhere."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that after he left Yong Yun State and revealed the seven-colored divine light, it was discovered by this stone tablet scholar. Causing the other party to come knocking on his door."</p><p></p><p>"He was forced to lose ownership of his ultimate treasure."</p>

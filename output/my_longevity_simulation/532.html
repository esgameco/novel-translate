        <h1>Chapter 532</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The dragon's roar, as if thunder echoing, seemed to be coming from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Through the rifts in the clouds, one could vaguely see the scales and claws of the green dragon.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's body seemed endless, as if it extended to the edge of the sky.</p><p></p><p>The inadvertently revealed dragon tail, seen by the two figures, turned out to be as large as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke stared in astonishment, looking up. His body swayed a bit, "How can this dragon be so big?"</p><p></p><p>"I have seen a green dragon in the sect. But compared to the one in front of us..."</p><p></p><p>"That can't even be called a dragon. It's more like a small loach!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke wasn't stupid, he knew that the Southern Darkness was the territory of demon beasts and quietly whispered to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Dragon is rarely seen...," Li Fan ignored him.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he stared at the green dragon in the sky, checking the memories originating from the bloodline of the mysterious bird.</p><p></p><p>The existence of this green dragon could almost rival the longevity of the Emperor Shouzu.</p><p></p><p>Different from the Emperor Shouzu acting as the leader and guide of the demon beast tribe, this Divine Green Dragon never interfered in the internal affairs of the demon beast tribe.</p><p></p><p>It played more of a role as a "protector god", not visible in ordinary times.</p><p></p><p>It would only intervene when the demon beast tribe faced extinction.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Green Dragon usually conceals its form, hiding in the waves and clouds. I wonder why it suddenly emitted such a dragon roar today."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that something significant might have happened in the Southern Darkness."</p><p></p><p>"Coming here at the right moment, truly worthy of being the chosen one."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan secretly contemplated, he also gave Xu Ke a claw.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke felt a bit puzzled and was about to fight back in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan ruthlessly suppressed him.</p><p></p><p>The Qing Luan Bird beneath Xu Ke seemed to sigh helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Its speed did not decrease, continuing to sprint towards the south.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Darkness Sea was vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, apart from the sky above, there was nothing but endless blue seawater.</p><p></p><p>After flying for more than ten days in a row, the scenery had not changed at all.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the demon mountain, they hadn't even seen the shadow of an ordinary demon beast.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they occasionally saw groups of strange fish in the sea, playfully emerging from the water's surface.</p><p></p><p>Some even chased after the shadows cast by Xu Ke and his group on the surface of the sea, following along.</p><p></p><p>However, these fish had no intelligence, relying solely on instinct, clearly not demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei, where exactly is this demon mountain?" Xu Ke leaned on his chin, looking dispirited.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu Ya didn't explain clearly and only told me to head south," he continued sarcastically, "I actually believed him. It's really frustrating."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was about to reply when his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>He felt a surge of killing intent and a strong smell of blood approaching from behind.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 801</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Still anchored at 1 year!</p><p>Still detached from the mountain peak!</p><p>An invisible wave burst out from Li Fan, who was in the middle stage of the Golden Core. </p><p>Although his eyes were still a bit red, the feeling of hunger had indeed weakened a lot!</p><p>Li Fan, who was well-prepared, immediately started to operate the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p>Once again, he silently struggled against this deadly hunger.</p><p>The feeling of hunger was only weakened a little, but it made Li Fan feel much more comfortable.</p><p>In the eight years of his previous life, he himself didn't know how he persisted.</p><p>If it weren't for the blessing of the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra and his obsession with [Longevity].</p><p>He probably would have given up long ago and devoured everything in this small world of Daxuan cleanly!</p><p>Li Fan didn't know what consequences would result if he did this.</p><p>But he vaguely felt in his heart that if he really did so, the consequences probably wouldn't be much better than the remains on the immortal ruins!</p><p>With the experience of being tortured for eight years, Li Fan in this life was much more patient in dealing with the hunger that had been weakened by a layer.</p><p>He could already think about other things while fighting against the hunger that couldn't be resisted.</p><p>"It still won't decrease with the passage of time... It seems that we can only rely on [Huan Zhen] to reduce its impact." Li Fan thought in his heart.</p><p>Since this time, the inheritance option chosen was to speed up the charging progress.</p><p>So when it was anchored for 4 years, [Huan Zhen] was already fully charged.</p><p>With great willpower, Li Fan maintained his clear thoughts while flying to Yi Yin's tomb and absorbing that Hua Dao stone.</p><p>Only then did he activate Huan Zhen.</p><p>?? Returning to Mount Jieli anchored at one year, this time Li Fan's eyes were no longer red.</p><p>Even without using the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, he could suppress the feeling of hunger with his own willpower alone.</p><p>"The degree of effect reduction has increased a lot again."</p><p>"But it still exists."</p><p>"It seems that we need to do it one more time."</p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes: "It takes four consecutive [Huan Zhen] to completely eliminate the negative effects."</p><p>"Is this the price of facing a true immortal directly?"</p><p>Undoubtedly, the remains Li Fan saw in the immortal ruins were the legendary true immortals.</p><p>Moreover, because the other party opened his eyes, it's hard to say whether he was really dead or not.</p><p>After all, everything Li Fan experienced has already explained the horror of [True Immortal]. It really can't be considered by common sense.</p><p>"It's the same as the [mark] left after I was devoured for ten years in Yuan Dao State."</p><p>"But this does not mean that the existence that occupies the sky above Yuan Dao State, or the so-called [True Immortal], their status exceeds [Huan Zhen]."</p><p>"It's just because I am the carrier of [Huan Zhen]."</p><p>"Because my memory will not be erased during the process of Huan Zhen. So [Huan Zhen] is not absolute and pure either."</p><p>"These negative factors exist after Huan Zhen precisely because they accompany me."</p><p>"Just like the Hua Dao stone crystal in my mind. Every life does not need special preservation, as long as it is with my [Hua Dao Shen Yi], the growth can be brought back to the set anchor point."</p><p>"Divine consciousness and divine soul are the same."</p><p>"Although the actual growth is also reduced after [Huan Zhen], this is also how I can continuously become stronger in the cycle of reincarnation."</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The fundamental reason."</p><p>Li Fan suppressed his hunger with sheer willpower while slowly pondering.</p><p>Diverting attention was equally effective in getting rid of the feeling of hunger.</p><p>Recalling the experiences from three lifetimes ago, Li Fan contemplated his future action plans.</p><p>He had witnessed the Dharma Transmission's moves and seen the power of true immortals.</p><p>As his horizons broadened, Li Fan's plans for action must also change accordingly.</p><p>Soon, another four years passed.</p><p>After absorbing another low-grade Dao Transformation Stone, making the Dao Transformation Stone crystal in his mind even more dazzling and bright, Li Fan activated the Huan Zhen technique again.</p><p>This time, when he returned to the peak of the Isolated Mountain, his body and mind felt no abnormalities.</p><p>Not daring to let his guard down, Li Fan carefully examined himself up and down.</p><p>He also circulated the Purple Dawn Vast Intent to cleanse his soul and eliminate any potential hidden dangers.</p><p>In this way, a whole year passed.</p><p>On the cliff at the mountain top.</p><p>"The Huan Zhen activations add up to just over a decade."</p><p>"But I truly feel like it's been a lifetime. It feels even longer than the centuries spent building my foundation in the past."</p><p>"[Hunger]..."</p><p>The extremely complex symbol on the vast wilderness of the Immortal Ruins suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p>Not daring to attempt it rashly, he could only imagine it in his mind.</p><p>"In the white mist, on the broken stone at the center of the inverted maze, I saw the character 'Chaos'."</p><p>"And above the Immortal Ruins, there exists a character 'Hunger'."</p><p>"This 'Hunger' character is likely the ultimate reason why the Immortal Ruins continuously attract external objects."</p><p>"Immortal techniques?"</p><p>"Isn't it a bit too terrifying?"</p><p>Li Fan's eyelids twitched slightly.</p><p>Calming his mind, he vaguely felt something was amiss.</p><p>"The 'Hunger' character in the Immortal Ruins is a complex symbol. Although I don't understand its meaning, the moment I saw it, I naturally grasped what it represented."</p><p>"But the 'Chaos' character in the white mist maze is the same as the commonly used script in the cultivation world."</p><p>"The 'Hunger' character can thoroughly bring countless cultivation worlds to a desperate situation."</p><p>"While the 'Chaos' character I encountered, even inverted monsters that haven't reached Dao Integration can survive..."</p><p>Li Fan pondered and instantly understood: "It's not the original 'Chaos'."</p><p>"But an imitation created by someone after witnessing the immortal technique 'Chaos'."</p><p>Upon reaching this conclusion, Li Fan fell silent.</p><p>Even the clumsy imitation he used, which had changed hands three times, could cause quite a disturbance in the Xuanhuang World.</p><p>Then how terrifying would the power of the true 'Chaos' character be?</p><p>The one that could be mentioned in the same breath as the 'Hunger' character above the Immortal Ruins?</p><p>Immortals were all suppressed by a single 'Hunger' character, their life and death unknown.</p><p>The severance of the immortal path.</p><p>The inexplicable loss of contact with other cultivation worlds.</p><p>Could all of this be related to 'Chaos'?</p><p>In an instant, Li Fan fell into endless contemplation.</p><p>This time, the gains were too many.</p><p>It had even impacted Li Fan beyond the limits of his horizons.</p><p>In fact, it was not a beneficial thing.</p><p>After all, even the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate didn't know how to confront it.</p><p>Let alone the true immortals above Heavenly Venerates.</p><p>"I can't aim too high."</p><p>"I still need to take it step by step and first walk out of the life-and-death crisis in the Xuanhuang World."</p><p>It took a long while before Li Fan came back to his senses.</p><p>He thought with a hint of wistfulness.</p>

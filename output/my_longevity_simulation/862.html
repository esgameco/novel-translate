        <h1>Chapter 862</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"No wonder this seven-colored divine light is almost inexhaustible when used in actual combat against enemies, without any need to worry about depletion. It turns out that it has the essence power of a cultivation world as a backing." </p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's dantian, as the power of the world's origin was continuously extracted, the seven-colored pearl seemed to have dimmed slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, in contrast, the world-covering roots and tendrils deeply penetrated every corner of the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The roots nourished by the origin power were somewhat different from those derived from the spiritual power of ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They became more ferocious and...</p><p></p><p>More greedy.</p><p></p><p>As if having tasted the marrow and known its flavor, without Li Fan needing to deliberately control them.</p><p></p><p>In just a single thought, the densely packed black tentacles eagerly expanded towards the untouched virgin lands.</p><p></p><p>The originally vibrant and colorful grotto-heaven world gradually became overshadowed.</p><p></p><p>Falling into a heart-wrenching darkness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene that was quite indescribable, Li Fan even had a premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't deliberately control it, these enhanced roots could complete the devouring process in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"The annexation between worlds..."</p><p></p><p>"When the Dharma Heavenly Venerate created the new method back then, he must have personally witnessed the scene of worlds merging." Li Fan had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>Not caring about the loss of the seven-colored pearl at all.</p><p></p><p>He increased the speed of devouring to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Three months later.</p><p></p><p>"It's time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The black roots had completely entangled the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Looking from outside the void, all that could be seen was a bizarre furball with countless tentacles wrapped around it.</p><p></p><p>The magnificent and vast living grotto-heaven from before was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the countless roots below immediately bared their fangs and danced.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The incomparably pure vitality was transmitted to Li Fan's body through the roots as conduits.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>The body that was originally in its twenties seemed to instantly return to its teenage growth period.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, every tissue, bone, and flesh of the body underwent earth-shattering changes under this pure and quintessential vitality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, adapting to this surging vitality.</p><p></p><p>Despite such severe injuries, the wounds automatically healed at a visible speed in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that Li Fan had not yet formally devoured the Nascent Soul Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Just relying on the vitality fed back from the grotto-heaven, he could achieve this level!</p><p></p><p>"It's much stronger than the previous nascent grotto-heaven." Li Fan sighed slightly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, his body slowly dissolved, transforming into gurgling ink, surging towards the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven along the countless tendrils.</p><p></p><p>The grotto-heaven wrapped by the black roots seemed to have also sensed the crisis.</p><p></p><p>Huge rumbling sounds resounded within the grotto-heaven world, the earth crumbled and split apart, the oceans stirred up shocking giant waves...</p><p></p><p>The countless creatures inside involuntarily let out cries and wails.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't affect Li Fan's devouring speed in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>As the blackness continuously poured in.</p><p></p><p>A part of the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven began to turn transparent and disappear.</p><p></p><p>The struggle of the grotto-heaven also grew weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it completely calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Although the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The void here still existed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Emptiness and void.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Li Fan, who had successfully advanced to the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>Surging power coursed through every part of his body. Since he began cultivating, Li Fan had never felt this strong before.</p><p></p><p>He even had a feeling that even ordinary Harmonious Dao cultivators might not be a match for him.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary Harmonious Dao cultivators have power covering the land of Xuanhuang Province."</p><p></p><p>"And the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven I devoured is almost equivalent to five provinces combined."</p><p></p><p>"Quantitative change leads to qualitative change. Just by relying on absolute power, I can crush a group of weak Harmonious Dao cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I still have many divine powers within me."</p><p></p><p>As long as the Eternal Life realm experts do not appear, even if he acts recklessly in this world, he should be able to escape with ease!</p><p></p><p>"With such a vast increase in power, it will be more convenient to scheme in the future," he pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>After completing his advancement, Li Fan did not rush to leave.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his spiritual sense kept sweeping through the void here, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>Once, twice.</p><p></p><p>He tried multiple times but did not discover anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still did not give up.</p><p></p><p>After his strength greatly increased, he keenly sensed that within this Five Elements void, there seemed to be some other existence.</p><p></p><p>It was deeply hidden.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment when Li Fan successfully broke through and completely devoured the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven, due to the drastic change in the environment, it revealed a trace of a flaw.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan noticed it.</p><p></p><p>This hidden existence did not belong to the "Roots of Heaven and Earth" of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was the one that had been lingering around Li Fan from time to time...</p><p></p><p>The Crossing Calamity Sect!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>A circle of seven-colored light surged from his body, and then, in an instant, the seven-colored light became countless times brighter.</p><p></p><p>It expanded outward towards the surrounding void.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light was like a physical object.</p><p></p><p>It completely filled and occupied this empty space.</p><p></p><p>All foreign objects were to be rejected and revealed!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, what Li Fan displayed, compared to the Divine Bell Technique from his previous life, was simply the difference between the bright moon in the sky and the light of a firefly.</p><p></p><p>Only with the support of the vast Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven could Li Fan be so unscrupulous in his extravagance.</p><p></p><p>But the effect was also excellent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's goal was ultimately achieved.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed as he reached out and took it.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, what he held in his hand was actually a small figurine made of yellow talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have existed for too long, and the yellow color of the talisman paper had turned slightly white.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this small figurine was quite bizarre.</p><p></p><p>There were no facial features on its head, only a single eye occupying the entire face.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan feel a bit apprehensive was that the single-eyed paper figurine seemed to be alive.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan grabbed it, its eye slightly rotated and stared intently at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly felt a scorching heat in his hand, as if being burned by fierce flames.</p><p></p><p>"Playing tricks!"</p><p></p><p>A ball of raging flames suddenly appeared in his hand, enveloping the single-eyed paper figurine.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to burn it to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But even after the flames danced for a long time, the paper figurine was not affected in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had no physical form at all, and no matter how high the temperature of Li Fan's fierce flames was, it could not destroy it in the least!</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan tried various methods.</p><p></p><p>Five Elements techniques, Annihilation Sword, and even formations.</p><p></p><p>None could destroy it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, a phrase couldn't help but pop up in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Jumping out of the Three Realms, not within the Five Elements."</p><p></p><p>The yellow paper figurine's eye slightly rotated.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1230</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have also seen the cultivator in Duan Xian Lou who is said to have entered the Dao using a new method. It is said that he only took three years to attain the Dao. Moreover, his ability to control the power of true immortals is not inferior to mine," Yu Shuo said with an inexplicable tone.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, why do you still seem to have many doubts in your heart, Old Yu?" </p><p></p><p>"Because in the entire Duan Xian Lou, the cultivators who are currently claimed to have 'entered the Dao' and have publicly shown their faces in public occasions, the true immortal power they control is all of the same kind," Yu Shuo said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"What does this indicate?" Zhao Xian was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Yu Shuo glanced at Zhao Xian with an inexplicable expression. After a long silence, he finally spoke very calmly, "Zhao Xian, you must remember. When dealing with the power of true immortals, never be careless."</p><p></p><p>"The deeper one enters the Dao, the more dangerous one becomes to oneself."</p><p></p><p>Yu Shuo did not directly explain but said this sentence for no reason.</p><p></p><p>"Today's lesson ends here. Next time, it will be Nan Gong's turn." Yu Shuo's figure disappeared along with his voice.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian still stood in place, pondering Yu Shuo's last words.</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration in his mind made him suddenly realize the implication behind it.</p><p></p><p>"The power of true immortals is like a net. By relying on the true immortal net, although one can invoke the power of true immortals, the result can only be getting more and more entangled..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian, who suddenly realized this principle, felt a chill all over as if a basin of cold water had been poured on him in winter.</p><p></p><p>"If this is true, wouldn't my Zheng Dao Academy and even the entire Xuan Xian Boat be..."</p><p></p><p>But soon, Zhao Xian laughed bitterly. </p><p></p><p>"In order to survive, we have no choice but to do so. After all, survival is the first priority that the immortal boat needs to maintain. Moreover, we have been wandering in the starry sea for so many years, only seeing the remnants of true immortals, not their shadows. There are indeed risks, but they can be temporarily excluded from consideration."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhao Xian also understood what Yu Shuo said about the strangeness of Duan Xian Lou.</p><p></p><p>In the darkest starry sea, various true immortal remnant powers are mixed.</p><p></p><p>If one really mastered the method of absorbing the remnants of the destroyed realm harmlessly and perfectly, then the performance of those cultivators in Duan Xian Lou who entered the Dao should also simultaneously have various different states.</p><p></p><p>After all, the true immortal remnant power that each person can adapt to is not the same.</p><p></p><p>In the darkest starry sea, there are no less than five known types of true immortal powers. The three chiefs of Zheng Dao Academy each have different directions in entering the Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, the six cultivators who have currently appeared in Duan Xian Lou and entered the Dao all exhibit the same power of entering the Dao.</p><p></p><p>This probability exists but is very small.</p><p></p><p>"Either, the technique they have mastered is only effective for a single true immortal power."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian felt a chill in his heart and dared not think too much.</p><p></p><p>Now the task given to him by the academy is to temporarily consolidate his Nascent Soul cultivation, and then challenge the Transformation Deity realm again.</p><p></p><p>Once he successfully transforms into a deity, he will slowly start trying to "enter the Dao".</p><p></p><p>"Entering the Dao, it can't be too early. Nor can it be too late."</p><p></p><p>"If one comes into contact with the power of true immortals too early, the weak soul and will are almost impossible to resist the vast and unmatched power of true immortals. It is very likely to directly mutate into a crazy, deformed monster."</p><p></p><p>"And if it's too late..."</p><p></p><p>The teaching voice of Nan Gong Lie, the head of Zheng Dao Academy, echoed in Zhao Xian's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The academy will not overly force it for now. The most urgent task is still to advance as soon as possible..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Improve my own strength."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Infant Tribulation indicates that I can only break through after the age of fifty, the Palace Master said that the restrictions of the broken Starry Sky Dao in this Shattered Starry Sea are not absolute. With the foundation of the Academy and the accumulation in my dreams, it is not difficult to defy fate and change destiny."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian was very confident about this.</p><p></p><p>In fact, many details in the future dream that Zhao Xian initially experienced have already greatly differed from reality. Under normal circumstances, as long as Zhao Xian was a little more meticulous in his thoughts, he should have long noticed the inappropriateness in this.</p><p></p><p>But under the covert influence of a certain existence, Zhao Xian had intentionally or unintentionally ignored all kinds of unreasonable things.</p><p></p><p>Let alone a small Yuan Ying cultivator, even the three chiefs of the Xuan Immortal Boat's Dao Proving Academy were probably far from being a match for Li Fan's means of manipulating people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Li Fan was using his divine sense to take advantage of Zhao Xian's authority to browse through all kinds of secret knowledge in the Dao Proving Academy.</p><p></p><p>Records related to the power of true immortals were all hidden. Unable to investigate.</p><p></p><p>However, there was not much concealment about the history of the Xuan Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>Consistent with what was known before, the Xuan Immortal Boat was split from the Immortal Boat [Xuan Shang] back then.</p><p></p><p>But what was more detailed was that the main reason that caused the turmoil within the Immortal Boat back then was an outsider.</p><p></p><p>With the identity of an outsider, he quickly won the trust of more than half of the people on the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>They were even bewitched, wanting to try to cross the invisible high wall to the Dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>At a critical moment, an Immortal Boat cultivator named Cai Zheng Jun, who later became the first dean of the Xuan Immortal Boat's Immortal Pivot Institute, led the crowd to stop this kind of suicidal behavior in time.</p><p></p><p>However, it eventually led to a war between the two sides, and the Immortal Boat was broken.</p><p></p><p>As for that outsider, there were only a few lines of records. His true identity was already a mystery.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Proving Academy did have many detailed descriptions of the situation in the Dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the space-time maps recorded by the Xuan Immortal Boat during its drifting and fleeing over the years, the Immortal Boat also had unique theories about the Sea of Relics and the high wall.</p><p></p><p>"In the deeper part of the Sea of Relics, near where the invisible high wall is located, there lies the tomb of the myriad realms and the graveyard of the starry sea. The terrifying suction force from the center of the starry sea spans across the starry sea but is blocked by the high wall, accumulating day by day. Coupled with the influence of the mysterious power of the high wall, the suction force is fixed like tides, forming a reverse force field."</p><p></p><p>"The closer to the high wall, the stronger the suction force. After dozens of explorations, all ending in vain, the Immortal Boat has currently given up on the idea of continuing to investigate."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who unexpectedly found this report, was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to its special location, the Xuan Immortal Boat's understanding of the overall situation of the Dark Starry Sea was much stronger than that of the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Under the high wall, the tides are locked, and the world fragments?"</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, it seemed as if an endless scene of desolate broken worlds spanning across the silent stillness appeared.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, what I originally thought existed in the depths of the starry sea, which could rival the suction force of the Immortal Ruins, is just the reflection of the suction force of the Dark Starry Sea by the high wall?"</p><p></p><p>Although there was a little disappointment in his heart, Li Fan actually breathed a sigh of relief instead.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as it was not another true immortal, everything would be easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"The invisible high wall can actually block all the power of the [Hunger] Spell and even make it gather in reverse."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of unimaginable great power is this?"</p>

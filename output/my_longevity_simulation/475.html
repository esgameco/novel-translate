        <h1>Chapter 475</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Looking at the four cultivators who suddenly appeared in front of him, Li Fan was slightly surprised. Since the world has been in turmoil under the banner of the "Ancient Celestial Sect Cultivators," Li Fan has become exceptionally careful and cautious.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he goes out, he always uses the secret technique "Concealing the Sky with One Hand" to hide his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>The secret technique from the previous life that could shield the perception of the profound net was truly extraordinary. In the vast Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, countless cultivators wished to meet Li Fan, but no one could ever succeed.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, today finally welcomed some unexpected guests.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Li Fan asked, not expecting the other party to disclose the truth, but just to buy some time.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from the four black-robed cultivators, Li Fan felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>They were weaker than Tianyang by more than a mile; they should be in the Yuan Ying realm.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want from me?" Li Fan asked knowingly.</p><p></p><p>"You'll find out soon!" one of them said in a cold voice, "Set up the formation!"</p><p></p><p>Standing at the four corners, each of them shot out a golden light from the artifacts in their hands.</p><p></p><p>The golden threads swirled in the air, and in an instant, they constructed a bright golden formation around Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Resembling a huge bronze tripod, it trapped Li Fan inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered slightly, wanting to dodge, but feeling as if the surrounding space had solidified, he couldn't break free.</p><p></p><p>"Collect!" all four shouted at once.</p><p></p><p>The golden bell quickly contracted, getting smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>The golden outline was on the verge of completely binding Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Splitting Light Dragon Trap..."</p><p></p><p>Although trapped in the formation, Li Fan remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Having studied the ways of array formations for several lifetimes, he immediately recognized the formation these four black-robed cultivators were jointly using.</p><p></p><p>It was the top-notch Trapping Formation circulating in the world today, requiring the cooperation of at least three or more cultivators to set up.</p><p></p><p>The more people involved in setting up the formation, the more powerful it would be. Capturing someone at a higher level was also an easy feat.</p><p></p><p>With the combined strength of the four Yuan Ying cultivators, under normal circumstances, even a Nascent Soul cultivator would be easily captured.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smirked in his heart. Although unable to move, dozens of "Great Five Elements Annihilation Swords" shot out from various parts of his body.</p><p></p><p>Destructive black light scattered around.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the terrifying aura emanating from the black light, all four black-robed cultivators showed a slight change in expression.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously, they wanted to evade.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the black-robed cultivators were shocked to find out that the targets of the black light swords were not them but the various corners of the Splitting Light Dragon Trap!</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>One of the cultivators cried out in alarm because he finally realized that the precise black light emanating from Li Fan had struck various crucial points of the Splitting Light Dragon Trap.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The collision of the gold and black light was intense, and the originally substantial golden bell dimmed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The indestructible Trapping Formation also loosened. </p><p></p><p>"The worm attempts to shake the tree with mere force!"</p><p></p><p>In the changing light and shadows, Li Fan's figure suddenly disappeared from within the trapped formation.</p><p></p><p>"Besides divination techniques, this person is also proficient in array formations?"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this thought flashed through the minds of the four black-robed cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"The information was incorrect, retreat first!"</p><p></p><p>The leading cultivator exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>However, as they were about to retreat, they inexplicably noticed the sky darkening.</p><p></p><p>As if a black cloud had covered the sky.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, dozens of golden lights flew out from the black cloud, drawing a larger golden bowl in the sky that enveloped the four of them.</p><p></p><p>"The Splitting Light Dragon Trap?!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivators quivered, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Although the power of the formation was slightly inferior, compared to the widely circulated version in the cultivation world, it had some unknown improvements.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this change that made them realize breaking the formation would require some effort.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the four black-robed cultivators had no choice but to go all out.</p><p></p><p>In the huge golden bowl, independent snow-capped peaks, misty forests, straight mountains, and vast plains appeared successively.</p><p></p><p>Under the dark clouds and above the golden bowl, Li Fan stood firmly.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the four Yuan Ying cultivators below, a sense of killing intent pervaded his heart.</p><p></p><p>Not all of these people were adept in array formations, as setting up the formation required assistance from magical artifacts. Therefore, the hastily arranged formation naturally had some flaws.</p><p></p><p>Against ordinary cultivators, these flaws would not matter.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Fan's eyes, the "Splitting Light Dragon Trap" set up by them was filled with loopholes.</p><p></p><p>After breaking out of the formation, he immediately counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>First, he activated the secret technique "Concealing the Sky with One Hand" to obscure the sky and isolate any possible external spying.</p><p></p><p>With the "False Speech" artifact purchased from the Celestial Mirror, he interfered with spiritual communications.</p><p></p><p>He then set up the "Exploding Law Shocking Deity Formation" to temporarily elevate his cultivation level to the Yuan Ying realm.</p><p></p><p>Followed by the Splitting Light Formation, he temporarily trapped the four individuals.</p><p></p><p>"When I built the foundation, I could already slay the Yuan Ying."</p><p></p><p>"Now that my cultivation has advanced to the late Golden Pill stage, observing the four of you is like finding a needle in a haystack!"</p><p></p><p>"Overturning Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>A giant palm descended from the sky, and in the golden bowl, the four cultivators were trapped like turtles in a jar with nowhere to escape.</p><p></p><p>The chilling aura of the snow-capped peaks, the eerie screams from the misty forest, the straight mountain crashing down, and the rising smoke in the plain...</p><p></p><p>Various scenes from the realms emerged, and the four individuals displayed all their abilities.</p><p></p><p>The four colored lights intertwined and gathered together, colliding with the Overturning Heaven Palm.</p><p></p><p>But it was futile!</p><p></p><p>Like a paper lake, it collapsed at the touch.</p><p></p><p>The giant palm pressed down, and amidst the screams, the bodies of the four individuals shattered inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the Overturning Heaven Palm did not cease, disregarding the opponents' physical bodies and instead striking towards the four major realms.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The realms trembled, as if the end of the world was approaching. </p><p></p><p>In a loud rumble, huge cracks appeared in the realm.</p><p></p><p>The peaks collapsed, the forest trees fell, the ground cracked...</p><p></p><p>As if the four major realms were about to be completely destroyed in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>However, these black-robed cultivators, cooperating extremely tacitly, did not retreat in this life-or-death situation.</p><p></p><p>With their entire spiritual power running at its peak, the four of them managed to resist the Overturning Heaven Palm with all their strength.</p><p></p><p>The illusion of the giant palm vanished, and the quivering realms gradually returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>The four individuals looked pale and frightened, immediately absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy to mend their realm injuries.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they took out pills to consume and searched for Li Fan's figure.</p><p></p><p>"This supernatural power is tremendously powerful; Li Fan must have consumed a lot of energy. Let's seize this opportunity to break the Splitting Light Dragon Trap!"</p><p></p><p>"This person is definitely not just at the Golden Pill stage as he appears on the surface. He might have already recovered from his injuries."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we must spread this information back. This person is likely a bait thrown out by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance!"</p>

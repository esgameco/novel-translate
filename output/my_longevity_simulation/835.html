        <h1>Chapter 835</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As everyone knows, the wonders of heaven and earth in the Xuanhuang Realm are mostly fallen cultivators. This is what is known as the wonders of man.</p><p></p><p>The wonders of earth and heaven are basically all transformed by the Dao of heaven and earth in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The "Kun Qian Bone Hand" on Ou Shangtian's body can reverse the Qian and Kun, which has truly transcended the category of human wonders and reached a level close to the wonders of heaven.</p><p></p><p>But it still appears in the form of human hand bones.</p><p></p><p>This cannot but make one ponder deeply.</p><p></p><p>Think about the wonders of heaven encountered before, what were they like?</p><p></p><p>The "Yan Fa Jue", the "Sword".</p><p></p><p>As well as the "Dao Wen Compass", "Yin Yang Jade", "Qian Kun Yi Qi" and so on.</p><p></p><p>They are all completely natural creations of heaven and earth, without any "characteristics" belonging to humans.</p><p></p><p>"The remains of man, close to the wonders of heaven."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid only the legendary immortals can do it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the shape of the hand bones shown by Ou Daozi seemed a little familiar...</p><p></p><p>The blue light of the Hua Dao Stone flashed, bringing out a picture from his memory. </p><p></p><p>It was the White Bone Pioneer Realm that was used to deceive the people of Li Jie at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he chose it among the many pioneer realms available for rent was because Li Fan was deeply attracted by its unique and shocking scenery.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other pioneer realms, which were a magnificent immortal landscape, it was built on a huge white bone left hand.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by dark and desolate space, the giant white bone hand floated in the endless void.</p><p></p><p>It was full of a mysterious, strange, and enigmatic atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>According to the Purple Miao Immortal Venerable who sold this White Bone Pioneer Realm, the conception of this scene originated from that "Immortal" who gave birth to the entire Luo Xian Realm with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan compared the two pictures.</p><p></p><p>They were exactly the same!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was definitely not something that could be described as a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was now extremely interested in anything that could be related to the "Immortal".</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan's avatar Ji Shaoli contacted the cultivator who called himself Purple Miao Immortal Venerable under the pretext of planning to rent the White Bone Pioneer Realm.</p><p></p><p>He did not use an anonymous alias, but directly revealed Ji Shaoli's identity.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the cold attitude before, Purple Miao was very enthusiastic towards Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>"Has the senior heard of me?" Ji Shaoli asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"After all, there are really not many cultivators who are willing to spend a large amount of contribution points every year to rent a pioneer realm."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Originally, just relying on the several million contribution points from the Ding Yu Head Award was not enough to attract Purple Miao's attention. It should be that recently, the avatar relied on foresight to frantically speculate and accumulate wealth in the market. Only then did he enter the other party's sight.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was not afraid, but showed an appearance of being very interested in this White Bone Pioneer Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the spot, he proposed a plan to rent it for a hundred years, or even to buy it out permanently.</p><p></p><p>Purple Miao became more and more attentive.</p><p></p><p>He answered almost every question Ji Shaoli wanted to know.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Ji Shaoli gradually learned about the origin of this White Bone Pioneer Realm, and why it was almost exactly the same as Ou Shangtian's "Kun Qian Bone Hand".</p><p></p><p>"The remains of a true immortal?" Ji Shaoli asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, before the great calamity, the Venerable Immortal had</p><p>"Fortunately, I have seen an album recording the 'True Immortal's Remnant Shell'. The images contained within left a deep impression on the Immortal Venerable. Even after thousands of years, it is still difficult to forget. Therefore, when creating this pioneer realm, I imitated its form and captured its spirit." Zi Miao spoke incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli further inquired about more information regarding the True Immortal's Remnant Shell.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Great Calamity descended, when the path to immortality was unbroken. The Profound Yellow Realm actually still had communication with the Immortal Realm. Not only did the major immortal sects have immortal artifacts bestowed by the Immortal Realm for protection."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, a True Immortal's Remnant Shell was circulating in the world. Exactly whose hands it fell into, no one knows anymore. But this matter is absolutely true, with numerous clues that can be verified."</p><p></p><p>"This skeletal hand is one of the Immortal's Remnant Shells. In addition, there are also the Immortal's Body, the Immortal's Skull..."</p><p></p><p>Zi Miao was speaking with great enthusiasm, but the content of his words suddenly changed: "Until before the Great Calamity descended, there were all sorts of rumors appearing in the world about the True Immortal's Remnant Shell manifesting. However, after the Great Calamity descended. That True Immortal's Remnant Shell, and even the supreme treasure immortal artifacts of the sects, all disappeared together!"</p><p></p><p>"The chaos this caused is imaginable, directly accelerating the process of the immortal sects' destruction."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ji Shaoli was instantly somewhat lost in thought: "The Remnant Shells and immortal artifacts all disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Miao lamented: "Yes. Even now it remains a mystery, no one knows where they went. However, in the Profound Yellow Realm, perhaps the only thing that can be associated with 'Immortals' is the Fallen Immortal Realm. So a considerable portion of cultivators who know about this matter believe that the disappeared Remnant Shells and immortal artifacts are most likely hidden within this Fallen Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, there wouldn't be numerous cultivators still in accordance with the Dao, tirelessly exploring the Fallen Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Fallen Immortal Realm..." Ji Shaoli nodded secretly, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Next, no more useful information could be obtained from Zi Miao's mouth.</p><p></p><p>After some bargaining, in the end Ji Shaoli directly bought the White Bone Pioneer Realm at a price of 800,000 contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Clearly not having encountered such a big customer as Ji Shaoli for a long time, Zi Miao's tone was very excited. He promised to provide free pioneer realm maintenance for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>And in the future if there was still a need to purchase pioneer realms, come find him again for a discounted price.</p><p></p><p>The handover and handling of the pioneer realm is naturally omitted.</p><p></p><p>The perspective returns to Li Fan's original body.</p><p></p><p>"The person behind this account shouldn't be Immortal Venerable Zi Miao himself."</p><p></p><p>"Those who can open up a space in the void, even among Dao-harmonized cultivators, are not considered weak. They wouldn't be so snobbish."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also speculated about the connection between the True Immortal's Remnant Shell and the 'Qian Kun Skeletal Hand'.</p><p></p><p>"The True Immortal's Remnant Shell, flowing into the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The power of heaven and earth circulates, wanting to devour and refine it, transforming it into its own law."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the appearance of this 'Qian Kun Skeletal Hand', it should have partially succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"Just don't know, where have the other True Immortal's Remnant Shells gone now?"</p><p></p><p>"Could the Derivation Talisman, Dao Patterned Compass, and such also be related to the True Immortal's Remnant Shell?"</p><p></p><p>"The most crucial point is, regardless of whether it's immortal artifacts or the True Immortal's Remnant Shell. They are all treasures of unimaginable value, the major immortal sects would definitely strictly guard them. Under these circumstances, they were still able to vanish without a trace..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed, pondering the possible reasons.</p><p></p><p>However, these ancient secrets were destined to be impossible for Li Fan to deduce with just his middle-grade Dao Transformation Stone.</p>

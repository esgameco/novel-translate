        <h1>Chapter 985</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"At that time, I indeed saw that immortal open his eyes, so it seems he is still alive."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to extinguish the Xuanhuang realm with a single glance of the character 'hunger' is likely beyond the capabilities of an ordinary immortal. Meditating for tens of thousands of years and gaining insights into the Dao, he is probably not far from breaking through to the realm of the Nameless True Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>A formless pressure suddenly arose in Li Fan's heart. </p><p></p><p>If what this Hundred Flowers Daoist said was all true, then one day this immortal would awaken from his Dao enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>If at that time, he himself had not yet been able to escape from this darkest starry sea...</p><p></p><p>Then he would have to face the consequences.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there was actually an upper limit to the time he could stay in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed there was no need to worry too much about this issue for now.</p><p></p><p>At least from the several reincarnations he had experienced, up until more than 700 years of being anchored, there were no signs of the immortal in the Immortal Ruins awakening.</p><p></p><p>"But in that lifetime, the obelisk built by the Heavenly Alliance later erupted more and more frequently. Perhaps it was because they sensed the crisis of the immortal awakening and had no choice but to do so." Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the awakening of a true immortal, what I should be more worried about is whether forcibly breaking through the attraction of the Immortal Ruins and leaving Xuanhuang, or even crossing the high wall, would startle the immortal in the midst of his Dao enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan couldn't help but ask, "Let's put aside the source of the calamity in the immortal cultivation world for now. What does Fellow Daoist think of that formless barrier surrounding the darkest starry sea?"</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers Daoist was silent for a moment, then gave an answer that somewhat surprised Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there are two possibilities for this formless barrier."</p><p></p><p>"The first is that it was established by existences outside the darkest starry sea to prevent the spread of calamity caused by a true immortal's seal."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly. This was consistent with what the Profound Heavenly King had speculated back then.</p><p></p><p>"As for the second possibility..."</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers Daoist's tone suddenly became solemn, "It is very likely arranged by that immortal in the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"As mentioned before, the true immortal path pursued by each immortal is unique. That immortal who wants to gain enlightenment through the character 'hunger', in order to prevent other immortals from discovering the existence of the character 'hunger' and thus affecting his own process of gaining enlightenment in the Dao, set up means to seal off and isolate this starry region from the inside and outside before his enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>The high wall was set up by the immortal in the Immortal Ruins?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was first startled, but after pondering for a moment, he felt that this possibility indeed could not be ruled out.</p><p></p><p>He inexplicably recalled the Profound Heavenly King's judgment back then.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through to the realm of a true immortal could one bring the Xuanhuang realm and cross the high wall.</p><p></p><p>"The true immortal mentioned by the Profound Heavenly King, based on his claim of being able to reach it very quickly back then, should refer to the ordinary immortal realm, not the realm of Nameless True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Only by approaching or surpassing the strength of the immortal in the Immortal Ruins when he set up the high wall can one cross it. This is also very reasonable."</p><p></p><p>"Back when the immortal realm collapsed, the survivors scattered and fled. The immortal in the Immortal Ruins, however, directly sat down to gain enlightenment in the Dao at the entrance of the immortal realm passage after obtaining the Hunger Character Chant. Such boldness..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it was a rare sight even in the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"So it's not impossible for him to casually set up a high wall to seal off the entire darkest starry sea region."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered, he actually felt that perhaps the second guess was closer to the truth.</p><p></p><p>If that was really the case...</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly something more dangerous and unattainable than fighting against the Dharma transmission.</p><p></p><p>However, wanting to live long and free, who would have thought that as soon as the journey began, one would already...</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He discovered that two great enemies, the Dharma Heavenly Venerate and the Immortal of the Immortal Ruins, stood one after another on the road ahead, which he had to face...</p><p></p><p>How desperate this was!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the vast majority of cultivators in the Darkest Starry Sea would have their Dao hearts collapse and find it difficult to have the heart to advance further the moment they learned the truth!</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan only narrowed his eyes, and his heart did not feel the slightest bit of frustration because of this.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Dharma, or the Immortal. Even if it was the illusory [Nameless True Immortal]...</p><p></p><p>As long as they stood in the way of his path to immortality, Li Fan would definitely crush them!</p><p></p><p>"On the path of immortality, I walk alone; if people obstruct me, I will not be at peace."</p><p></p><p>"A sword splits open the sun of the starry sea, causing heaven to grieve, earth to wail, and immortals to be shocked."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly chanted in his heart, his eyes filled with a determined cold light.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the Hundred Flowers Daoist didn't know what had happened, but she felt that the aura of the person in front of her had suddenly undergone an inexplicable change.</p><p></p><p>It made her heart inexplicably uneasy, as if a great calamity was imminent.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling only flashed by, and when she looked carefully again, it had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>As if it was just her illusion.</p><p></p><p>But the Hundred Flowers Daoist understood that in her current state of [Glazed Body], illusions and hallucinations were simply impossible to appear on her.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist stared at Li Fan, who seemed harmless and righteous, and added another layer of vigilance in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal of the Immortal Ruins was still too far from the current situation. After pondering for a moment, Li Fan suppressed all kinds of thoughts for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Hundred Flowers Daoist, whose figure was hidden in the golden light, and asked again, "The realm of the Immortals is not something we can speculate about at present. In comparison, I am more curious about your experience."</p><p></p><p>"You are a survivor of the catastrophe back then, so why did you appear in the Fishing Pool?"</p><p></p><p>"And what is your relationship with the Daoist child Liuli?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were burning, and the formation seals around him quietly reinforced again.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist glanced around imperceptibly and sighed, "Your vigilance is truly extraordinary, Daoist friend."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the reason why I was in the Fishing Pool was just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"As I said before, I had no control over it."</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist slowly said, "That day, we survivors from various realms were gathered together, discussing ways to escape from the Sinking Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, a wave of fluctuations came from the void and locked onto me."</p><p></p><p>"In an instant, I lost consciousness, and when I woke up, I was already in the Fishing Pool."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "So, you were caught in the Fishing Pool because you were too unlucky?"</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist's voice was a bit helpless, "Yes and no. The Fishing Pool automatically collects scattered treasures in the starry sky. The rarer the ownerless item, the more likely it is to be targeted by the Fishing Pool."</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation technique is complete, and my body is like a dark glazed lotus. Rather than saying I'm like a person, it's more like a magic treasure."</p><p></p><p>"I can only say that it was destined, and this calamity was inevitable."</p><p></p><p>"In the Fishing Pool, I don't know how many years I was submerged. Later, by chance, I attached myself to a glazed wisdom fruit that had a similar nature to me."</p><p></p><p>"By absorbing a portion of the wisdom fruit's energy, I barely managed to maintain a clear state of mind in the Fishing Pool."</p><p></p><p>"And then..."</p><p></p><p>"I sensed a force pulling the glazed wisdom fruit and knew that this might be the only opportunity to escape. So, I was fished out of the Fishing Pool along with Liuli."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, but I hid quite well, and you guys just never discovered me."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"Especially the one that sealed the remnants of the 'Crimson Nine-Headed' was truly extraordinary. Lan Yuchang, that guy, was originally just a slightly stronger ordinary person with some martial skills."</p><p></p><p>"But after absorbing it, his combat power skyrocketed. The ordinary god cultivators in our place, during sparring, are completely no match for him."</p><p></p><p>"According to Lan Yuchang, this is still with some reserve on his part."</p><p></p><p>"If he goes all out, tsk tsk...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke candidly, without any reservation, tirelessly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the name 'Crimson Nine-Headed,' Xiaoqing's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Later on, upon hearing Li Fan say that someone had been able to withstand the ferocious aura of the Nine-Headed Bird, successfully absorbing the beast soul bead.</p><p></p><p>Her delicate body trembled slightly and she blurted out, "Impossible! How could an ordinary person withstand the ferocity of that guy..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then showed a displeased expression decisively, "Seeing is believing. Our Multiverse Alliance has many talents, what kind of remarkable individuals do we not have?"</p><p></p><p>"Just because your empire couldn't find a suitable candidate, doesn't mean we can't."</p><p></p><p>"You must not think that by trading with us once, you can be compared to us?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed like a naive youth, speaking his mind without any understanding of tact.</p><p></p><p>He looked disdainful, "We're here to help you in the Multiverse Alliance, that's why we're trading with you. novelseed.com"</p><p></p><p>"There are so many small worlds around the Yellow Realm, we don't need just you."</p><p></p><p>"It's you who needs the help of the Multiverse Alliance, not us who can't do without you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Li Fan's extremely unpleasant words, Xiaoqing's face turned extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, she held back and did not erupt.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan kept talking incessantly, he noticed the lack of response from the other party. Perhaps feeling uninterested himself, he also stopped midway.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoqing's gaze towards Li Fan turned slightly unkind.</p><p></p><p>However, after this incident, she no longer doubted Li Fan's identity.</p><p></p><p>Continuing the previous topic, she asked softly, "Since everyone thinks that the trade is beneficial for both sides, why then make a sudden decision to stop?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed and truthfully replied, "It was due to an uncontrollable factor."</p><p></p><p>Leaning slightly forward, he whispered, "According to our intelligence, a major war could break out between the Ten Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>"You also know, the period before the outbreak of war is the most tense for both sides."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, strengthen internally before dealing with external threats, if at this time, the Ten Immortals Alliance discovers any traces of our Multiverse Alliance, they might concentrate their forces to eliminate us before engaging with the Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head nonchalantly, without a hint of embarrassment, "Truth be told, although we have always proclaimed our goal of counterattacking the cultivation world. But currently, in comparison to the Ten Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association, our organization still has a gap in strength. This is undeniable."</p><p></p><p>"We need to gather more strength, so for now, we can only lie low."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan's face became somewhat excited, "Moreover, this is a rare and excellent opportunity. The Ten Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association haven't engaged in a major conflict for many years."</p><p></p><p>"This upcoming war will surely be unprecedented in terms of scale and ferocity, with them biting each other, while we lurk in the shadows, taking advantage of the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can make some gains."</p><p></p><p>Watching Li Fan's self-satisfied appearance, Xiaoqing was skeptical about his mention of the 'impending war.'</p><p></p><p>The empire also had its own sources of information.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, although the number of lawbreakers was small, they were scattered all over the Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>During her return to the cultivation world, Xiaoqing had already established contact with the majority of them.</p><p></p><p>Because of their presence, Xiaoqing actually had some understanding of the current situation in the Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a great wind arises from a slight breeze.</p><p></p><p>There must be reasons for the outbreak of war, right?</p><p></p><p>If the upcoming war is indeed as brutal as he claimed.</p><p></p><p>Then there should be some signs of the impending war now.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe they missed some details..."</p><p></p><p>While Xiaoqing was lost in thought, Li Fan, on the other hand, paid no attention to what she was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Instead, shamelessly asked Xiaoqing for the 'Beast Soul Bead.'</p><p></p><p>"Oh, my visit this time has made my brothers very eager. Just let me have some local specialties to take back."</p><p></p><p>"Madam Qing, Holy Master Qing."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, you can give me as much of this thing as you have in your empire, just let me have some. I also need to report back."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's carefree appearance, Xiaoqing almost burst out laughing in anger.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need to bother about such a person.</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Xiaoqing took out two Beast Soul Beads equivalent to the Gold Core strength and handed them over.</p><p></p><p>This time, Xiaoqing did not hold back, and directly issued a leave command.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't have the Beast Soul Bead with me now, so please just leave, friend!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>He had just been addressing her respectfully, but upon hearing Xiaoqing's words, he immediately made a face, snorted coldly, and flew away without even saying goodbye.</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such people in the Multiverse Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"If it were in our empire, he would have been thrown to feed the Crack Realm Whale long ago!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaoqing was infuriated.</p><p></p><p>"That friend from last time was much better."</p><p></p><p>She remembered the situation during the previous trade, where both parties were very satisfied with each other.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent exchange of goods was also handled very properly.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, that person must be quite busy and can't free up time," Xiaoqing thought somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Regaining her composure, she began to contact her empire's operatives and inquire about any abnormalities in the Ten Immortals Alliance recently.</p><p></p><p>Whether there were any signs of an impending war.</p><p></p><p>Soon, her subordinates, the lawbreakers almost unanimously replied.</p><p></p><p>Everything was as usual, there were no signs of any war.</p><p></p><p>This left Xiaoqing somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Is it true or false?"</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>While this imperial master was in a bit of a dilemma, He Zhenghao had already counted the money to the point of cramps.</p><p></p><p>His face was beaming, and after each transfer of contributions, he would accurately record them and conscientiously reply to the lenders.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Qin, rest assured, I have received the contribution points. Just relax and wait for the big fortune!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wei, I've noted down your ten thousand contribution points. Oh, I know you've saved them up through hard work. Who hasn't done that? Just rest assured, can the Master of Secrets really cheat you?"</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

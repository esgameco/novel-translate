        <h1>Chapter 418</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The "White Mist Barrier" that serves as the boundary line between states inexplicably began to expand outward.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Alliance dispatched Tianmagicians to investigate this matter.</p><p></p><p>In the year 469, the expansion of the White Mist Barrier ended. However, the Tianmagicians' investigation yielded no results.</p><p></p><p>In the year 490, a group of cultivators emerged from the white mist. They were dressed in the attire of the Wanxian Alliance from years ago; seemingly deceased, yet still able to move freely. They were unaware of their own demise.</p><p></p><p>As they did not know about the establishment of the Heavenly Alliance, when the Tianmagicians arrived to seal off the area, a fierce conflict erupted between these deceased Wanxian Alliance cultivators and them.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it took a team of Level 6 Tianmagicians proficient in Dao combat to forcefully take them away.</p><p></p><p>In the year 524, Han Wuyou broke through to the Nascent Divinity realm.</p><p></p><p>In the year 539, the Golden Square Stele in the Xuánhuáng Realm erupted for the third time.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth still trembled, but the effect was much milder compared to the previous two times.</p><p></p><p>In the year 580, Han Wuyou received a secret invitation to meet at a hidden outpost in Tianyuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Being cautious, Han Wuyou chose not to attend.</p><p></p><p>In the year 592, Han Wuyou learned that the Tianxuan Soul Locking Array in Zhengqiongzhou malfunctioned for about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Alliance once again issued a "Heavenly Punishment Order," offering a reward for the capture of a cultivator named Liu Yihang.</p><p></p><p>In the year 595, Han Wuyou received another invitation. Along with the invitation, there was a small round stone disc.</p><p></p><p>According to the belief, the original disc was named "Calamity Stone," which, when activated and carried on one's person, had the effect of shielding oneself from the perception of the Tianxuan Soul Locking Array.</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Han Wuyou ultimately decided to go and meet as specified in the invitation.</p><p></p><p>This time, the meeting place was changed to a secluded valley within the territory of Tianyunzhou.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator introduced himself to Han Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>They called themselves the "Sky Reverse Society," one of the resistance organizations that called on cultivators from all over the world to fight to the death against the Heavenly Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After suffering a major defeat, they went into hiding underground, waiting for the right moment to act.</p><p></p><p>Over hundreds of years, they quietly absorbed suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>The individuals who issued the "Cultivator Announcement," Gu Xinghan, who risked his life to reveal the existence of the "Eternal Immortal Wall," and Liu Yihang, who recently successfully caused the Soul Locking Array to malfunction, were all members of the Sky Reverse Society.</p><p></p><p>In the Sky Reverse Society, the most elite remaining cultivators in the world were gathered.</p><p></p><p>Although their numbers were few, their talent was exceptional.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, they had also developed many methods on how to counteract the Tianxuan Soul Locking Array.</p><p></p><p>The "Calamity Stone" was one of their achievements.</p><p></p><p>It was created from the secondary body of the Tianxuan Mirror, the "Calamity Elimination Stone Disc."</p><p></p><p>In the Sky Reverse Society's years of research, they discovered a blind spot in the Soul Locking Array that might exist.</p><p></p><p>That was the secondary body of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Being the accidental offspring of the Tianxuan Mirror, they more or less retained certain characteristics of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the existence of these characteristics that, to some extent, it would cause a misjudgment of the Soul Locking Array.</p><p></p><p>They would be seen as a part of themselves, thereby neglecting its monitoring.</p><p></p><p>There were only a few secondary bodies of the Tianxuan Mirror, and the Sky Reverse Society had sacrificed many cultivators to find the "Calamity Elimination Stone Disc."</p><p></p><p>In addition to the "Calamity Stone" that could shield the Soul Locking Array, the Sky Reverse Society also possessed a great weapon called the "Fensky Arrow."</p><p></p><p>It was with this Fensky Arrow that Liu Yihang was able to temporarily disable the Soul Locking Array. The source of its materials, however, arose from the increasingly frequent "anomalies" in various places in the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>These anomalies were like a virus infecting the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Since anomalies could affect the heavens and earth, the current Soul Locking Array could naturally be influenced by anomalies.</p><p></p><p>After understanding many things within the Sky Reverse Society, Han Wuyou raised his doubts.</p><p></p><p>Why were such detailed secrets of the meeting revealed on the first encounter, without fearing that he, Han Wuyou, might report to the Heavenly Alliance?</p><p></p><p>The other party smiled and introduced Han Wuyou to a person.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, it was the one who was originally a member of the "Resurrected Immortals," Linghu Chang from the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that when the Resurrected Immortals encountered a disaster, the survivors each fled for their lives.</p><p></p><p>In subsequent manhunts, Linghu Chang, by virtue of the Medicine King True Cauldron, managed to escape capture.</p><p></p><p>He had been lurking in the wilderness ever since, but by a twist of fate, he joined the Sky Reverse Society.</p><p></p><p>It was also with the protection of the Medicine King True Cauldron and its many resources that the Sky Reverse Society was able to develop under the blockade of the Heavenly Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of more than three hundred years, some disciples of the Medicine King Sect who had been in slumber within the Medicine King True Cauldron were gradually awakened by him.</p><p></p><p>The reunion reminded Han Wuyou of the scene where many people tragically died when they left the realm.</p><p></p><p>With tear-filled eyes, he officially joined the Sky Reverse Society.</p><p></p><p>After staying at the outpost for only half a day, Han Wuyou returned to the Heavenly Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the year 603, the Golden Square Stele began its fourth eruption.</p><p></p><p>This time, the duration was longer than the sum of the previous three times.</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, green lines crisscrossed like a giant net, enveloping all living beings in the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>From that point on, cultivators privately referred to the Tianxuan Soul Locking Array centered around the Tianxuan Mirror as the "Mystic Web."</p><p></p><p>In the year 610, Han Wuyou received a message from the Sky Reverse Society that within various states, a giant mountain emerged from the ground, destroying the original terrain.</p><p></p><p>The creatures in these states, amidst this upheaval, barely survived.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Mystic Web in those states was also affected.</p><p></p><p>The headquarters of the Sky Reverse Society subsequently shifted to those states.</p><p></p><p>In the year 690, during a gathering, Han Wuyou learned that in recent years, the Sky Reverse Society had produced as many as three thousand "Fensky Arrows."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, with peripheral formations protecting the Mystic Web, such a quantity of Fensky Arrows alone would probably not be enough to penetrate the core of the Mystic Web.</p><p></p><p>Patience was required once again.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>In the year 698, Han Wuyou comprehended various array blueprints from the broken formation disc.</p><p></p><p>In the year 710, Han Wuyou secretly met with Linghu Chang and Liu Yihang, presenting them with the array blueprints.</p><p></p><p>In the year 711, Han Wuyou received confirmation from the Sky Reverse Society that these were the original array framework of the Mystic Web. He excitedly inquired about the source of the blueprints.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou stared at the broken formation disc in the secret room for a long time, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>He then used a secret method to seal the broken formation disc.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the year 934, a street child accidentally picked up the broken formation jade disc from the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it was a treasure, he kept it by his side day and night with joy.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, a connection was established.</p><p></p><p>In the year 935, the surviving people on the earth passed down a legend from a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>The earth trembled, cracks appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Above the heavens, figures of the gods battling were reflected.</p><p></p><p>The world was continuously struck by catastrophic thunder, turning large swathes of land into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, a pair of giant hands tore open the sky.</p><p></p><p>As the dust settled, calmness returned.</p><p></p><p>But the discord among the gods had angered the great Father God.</p><p></p><p>The world had been forsaken.</p><p></p><p>Magnificent buildings became ruins.</p><p></p><p>The gods who once soared high in the sky were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>The world was descending into ruin.</p><p></p><p>In the year 936, the street child met his demise during a hunting expedition.</p><p></p><p>The broken formation jade disc lay quietly in the desolate land.</p><p></p><p>Only occasionally curious wild beasts would come to investigate.</p><p></p><p>In the year 1032, no more wild beasts appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the year 1573, the sky darkened, and the earth fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In the year 2078, the world fell into deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>In the year 3024, the long-awaited sunlight shone on the broken formation jade disc.</p><p></p><p>In the year 3036, it was truly activated. </p><p></p><p>Special thanks to Juchenchis, due to the inability to access this chapter recently, I hadn't checked the author's helper much, and only just discovered it now, which gave me a shock. I am honored and surprised!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 295</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The memory space kept shaking and swaying, extremely unstable. </p><p></p><p>The various things that happened next between the protagonist and Senior Sister Zhao in the book also became blurred.</p><p></p><p>It made people feel like they were looking at flowers in the fog, unable to glimpse the details, which made them restless.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's shock in his heart was no less than that of this dead Five Elders Society cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The information in the remnant memories of the soul really surprised him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Zhao turned out to be one of the Immortal Venerables of the Five Elders Society?"</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan learned before that the Five Elders Society passed down the secret teachings of the Great Dao Sect and the Enlightenment Pill, he guessed that there might still be powerful figures from the Great Dao Sect surviving in the world in the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Combining the true manifestation of Senior Sister Zhao's "Great Dao is Mine Alone" divine ability during their discussion, and the various erotic storybooks based on her as the original model, which were a bit abnormally numerous.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan guessed that the Great Dao Sect cultivator surviving in the Five Elders Society was this Senior Sister Zhao, who was said to have been promoted all the way from an outer disciple to the sect master of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Li Fan subconsciously believed that Senior Sister Zhao should only be a high-level figure in the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals deliberately allowed the spread of the storybooks in order to disgust their opponents, and even helped to promote them behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>However, what Li Fan never expected was that Senior Sister Zhao was indeed a high-level figure in the Five Elders Society, that's right.</p><p></p><p>It's just a bit too high.</p><p></p><p>The actual controller of the Five Elders Society; the top powerhouse in this world, an Immortal Venerable hidden behind the scenes, overlooking all living beings.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of learning about Senior Sister Zhao's identity, Li Fan's first reaction was the same as this fallen Five Elders Society cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"How dare Storyteller Weng and Marvelous Brush Immortal use a Venerable as the protagonist of this erotic novel?"</p><p></p><p>You should know that although the status gap between cultivators of different realms in this world is not so vastly different due to the extremely fast cultivation of the new method.</p><p></p><p>Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivators, and even Qi Refining cultivators, can call each other brothers.</p><p></p><p>But this is only in the first few cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>As the strength increases, the promotion becomes more and more difficult.</p><p></p><p>The status gap also gradually becomes apparent.</p><p></p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators almost all hold important positions in a state, showing their noble aura.</p><p></p><p>Void Refinement cultivators dominate a state, controlling the lives of countless cultivators. In their eyes, even Nascent Soul cultivators can be regarded as chess pieces in their hands, to be manipulated at will.</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's previous experience in the Source Dao State, as well as the performance of that black-clothed Void Refinement cultivator and Immortal Venerable Blue Feather, one can get a glimpse of the might of Void Refinement.</p><p></p><p>As for Immortal Venerables...</p><p></p><p>Immortal Venerable of Dharma Transmission established the new method and founded the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals. If cultivators in the world want to cultivate, they have to follow the path he has drawn.</p><p></p><p>That Venerable who makes people forget their worries has imperceptibly influenced and changed people's thoughts. Although his name is unknown, it is terrifying to think about it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The Venerables seem to rarely show their faces, but they have already penetrated into every aspect of the cultivators' lives, and are everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators can only feel fear and awe towards such level of powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>How dare they do such a blasphemous thing?</p><p></p><p>Aren't they afraid that Senior Sister Zhao will come to them?</p><p></p><p>With the means of a Venerable, no matter where Storyteller Weng and Marvelous Brush Immortal are hiding, it's a dead end.</p><p></p><p>Being able to turn words into an experience almost like the real world, the cultivation of Storyteller Weng and Marvelous Brush Immortal must not be weak.</p><p></p><p>It's impossible for them to risk their lives for a little petty gain.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan speculated that either they are certain that this Senior Sister Zhao doesn't care about these circulating banned books at all.</p><p></p><p>Or there is another force behind them that can rival a Venerable, so they dare to be so rampant.</p><p></p><p>Will Senior Sister Zhao mind that her erotic novels are circulating all over the world?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't know.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, any normal female cultivator should feel angry to varying degrees about this matter.</p><p></p><p>But when it comes to the level of Immortal Venerables, Li Fan didn't dare to speculate.</p><p></p><p>The Venerables who have transcended the laws of heaven and earth and attained immortality have already surpassed the category of normal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If they are not of the same species and are still judged with the same mindset, it will only make a fool of oneself.</p><p></p><p>Even if you think about it carefully, that "Ancient Cultivation Secret History" which is widely circulated in the Mysterious Yellow Realm and can be viewed for free by every cultivator after entering the path of immortal cultivation, is also full of doubts.</p><p></p><p>The owner is not only not dead, but also an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Which cultivator would dare to use the first-person "I" presumptuously when writing a biography?</p><p></p><p>Many things of the ancient times have long been buried in the long river of history.</p><p></p><p>Who would be so familiar with everything that happened in the Great Dao Sect thousands of years ago, as if counting their family valuables?</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid that this book, which Li Fan previously only regarded as a novel for leisure, has a very high possibility of being an autobiography written by Senior Sister Zhao herself.</p><p></p><p>Many places that were previously skimmed over now have a different meaning in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The book uses a large amount of psychological monologue to describe Senior Sister Zhao's initial weakness as an outer disciple, the hardships and difficulties she experienced during her promotion, until many years later when she became the sect master of the Great Dao Sect, but sadly discovered that everything had changed and there was no one to talk to anymore, all without reservation and in great detail.</p><p></p><p>The emotions are delicate and the sense of substitution is very strong.</p><p></p><p>It really feels like Senior Sister Zhao herself is narrating.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"No wonder there are so many derivative storybooks. The character is really too vividly portrayed."</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable really has a unique hobby."</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, it may not be as simple as a hobby, and there may be some special factors involved." Li Fan secretly said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan recovered from the shock of Senior Sister Zhao's true identity, he once again savored the unending and unforgettable feelings of the possessed cultivator until his death.</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of him could still vaguely see the scenes of Senior Sister Zhao and the protagonist in the book entangled together.</p><p></p><p>"The taste of a Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it was in the past when she had not yet become a Venerable, such a forbidden pleasure is enough to make people forget about life and death."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder this person still couldn't forget it even after death."</p><p></p><p>Tasting the remnant thoughts in the memory of this Five Elders Society cultivator, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Happy times are always shorter.</p><p></p><p>When the protagonist in the book and Senior Sister Zhao separated after a great battle, the remaining memory fragments of the cultivator also came to an end.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the memory space, the red light ball also slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>This soul became no different from an ordinary soul.</p><p></p><p>This thread of soul consciousness brought back the knowledge to the main body. Li Fan couldn't help but close his eyes for a long time before fully digesting the information it brought back.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed again.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he didn't forget the main business. He continued to comprehend the existence of the soul contract in this soul in front of him, making use of the waste.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no miracle happened.</p><p></p><p>Like the hundreds of attempts before, Li Fan still couldn't find its existence.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 965</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Sitting Heaven Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed with brilliance: "Not bad, this is my true path! Investing in cultivators is but a minor way. Absorbing the changes in the world, and even the feedback brought about by the world's advancement, that is the true unparalleled power!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a surge of excitement that he hadn't felt in a long time, and the more he thought about it, the more excited he became: "As powerful as the Dharma Transmission, it is also a force that goes against the heavens and earth, becoming a part of the laws of the world. Only then can one transcend afterwards."</p><p></p><p>"It can be seen that the power of the world is indeed not something that cultivators can contend with."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm has already been completely eroded by the Dharma Transmission, and can be said to be riddled with holes. Even if I want to benefit the heavens, it would be extremely difficult."</p><p></p><p>"It can be said to be struggling to survive on its own, and I still want to rely on Xuanhuang's feedback to cultivate..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, temporarily abandoning this idea.</p><p></p><p>"But the many small worlds captured by Xuanhuang are the perfect testing grounds for me."</p><p></p><p>"Just like what happened to the Lingmu Realm, with Shangtian Ci transporting the wonders of Xuanhuang, plus the replenishment of external resources and spiritual energy..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly stood up and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"It really is the most suitable technique for me, and it unexpectedly aligns perfectly with the plans I've had all along in this life."</p><p></p><p>"It can truly be said that there is a predestined arrangement in the unseen, a unity of knowledge and action, and a natural arising of the mind."</p><p></p><p>Becoming more and more convinced of the compatibility between the [Sitting Heaven Technique] and himself, Li Fan had already decided on the path he wanted to strive for in the future.</p><p></p><p>The only problem at the moment was how to develop and elevate the [Sitting Immortal Technique] into the [Sitting Heaven Technique].</p><p></p><p>"Although it's possible to obtain the technique again through the Dharma Derivation Orb, but..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan still suppressed the temptation of gaining without effort.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Derivation Technique, when it comes down to it, is nothing more than a heavenly wonder."</p><p></p><p>"It's very likely that it also uses an exhaustive method to derive techniques, and while it can quickly obtain the desired target technique, that technique is only the most compatible with the fictional owner of the technique in the derivation process of the Dharma Derivation Orb."</p><p></p><p>"And not the real me in reality. Unless I'm willing to let the Dharma Derivation Orb have a complete view of all the secrets in my body and soul."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan would never do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"So if I want to seek the perfect [Sitting Heaven Technique], I still have to rely on myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, although Li Fan's comprehension ability is quite good, wanting to derive a heaven-defying technique that uses the power of the world's changes and advancement as nourishment...</p><p></p><p>Is still far from being qualified!</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not worried at all that he would not be able to do this.</p><p></p><p>If not in one lifetime, then ten lifetimes. If not in ten lifetimes...</p><p></p><p>He can still borrow and reference from others!</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm is teeming with heaven's proud children, and in the end, all the divine powers and techniques they can derive and think of will ultimately belong to Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>"In order to derive the Sitting Heaven Technique, I won't be stingy in sharing the Sitting Immortal Technique with others."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I must choose the most suitable person with the highest comprehension ability."</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that in my next life, I have already planned to truly hide behind the scenes and verify that guess of mine..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan already had a faint plan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, while helping the myriad realms advance in this lifetime, I can collect data."</p><p></p><p>Integrating, comprehending, and suddenly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>These eight words could aptly describe Li Fan's current state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators will bring feedback and cultivation. The feedback of the world</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"...and what other surprises will it bring me..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but secretly look forward to it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His mind was immersed in fantasy, not knowing how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a movement from a demon god thought that came from the "Three Disasters and Hundred Tribulations Divine Method".</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly located that demon god.</p><p></p><p>It occupied a Yuanying stage cultivator named Feng Qiran.</p><p></p><p>This person was cautious in his actions. Since obtaining this "Divine Possession" secret technique, he had never revealed it in front of others.</p><p></p><p>He only practiced in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>But some things cannot be avoided just by being careful.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Feng Qiran brushed shoulders with a young cultivator in green robes. </p><p></p><p>A moment later, he was horrified to find that he had lost control of his body.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even release his demon god avatar.</p><p></p><p>That young cultivator in green robes carefully observed Feng Qiran, and actually revealed a look of being torn between laughter and tears.</p><p></p><p>Then, without saying a word, a thread that was like an abyss, and also like a bright mirror, appeared between Feng Qiran and the young cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the obscure light, it didn't take long for that young cultivator to become exactly the same as Feng Qiran!</p><p></p><p>Reaching out his hands towards the inexplicably shocked Feng Qiran, the thread exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, through the demon god left in his body by Li Fan, Feng Qiran realized a reverse connection with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>There were no formal words, only a sinister and mysterious power that invaded Li Fan's sea of consciousness along the invisible connection in the void.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long sensed the abnormality, how could he not take precautions?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, thousands of demon gods appeared.</p><p></p><p>Gloomy ghosts and demons descended into the sea of consciousness, and five strange blood moons appeared in the sky. Li Fan revealed a ferocious face, staring at Feng Qiran who was surrounded by countless demon gods below.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you invade my sea of consciousness..."</p><p></p><p>"You're really seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan laughed wildly, and immediately wanted to launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>He had already seen that the Feng Qiran in front of him was actually Moru Bin, the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why he had changed his identity to a young Dharma transmitter and went out alone.</p><p></p><p>However, since he hadn't revealed his identity at this time, it wouldn't hurt to test the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect first.</p><p></p><p>Without mercy, thousands of ghosts and gods roared and sprayed black rays of light towards Moru Bin.</p><p></p><p>Those were all physical manifestations of consciousness attacks.</p><p></p><p>It was not only Li Fan's power alone, but also the drawn and borrowed power of consciousness from countless cultivators who practiced the "Divine Possession" technique.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with Li Fan's own extraordinary strength of consciousness...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that even if it was the Eternal Venerable on the opposite side, he would be severely injured!</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment..."</p><p></p><p>As expected, before Moru Bin could finish speaking, his consciousness avatar was devoured by the terrifying destructive power.</p><p></p><p>Unable to even resist for a moment, it was immediately annihilated and expelled from Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Very satisfied with his battle results, although there was a bit of a sneak attack flavor, after all, he had directly repelled the invasion of an Eternal realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the fatigue from the thousands of demon gods inhabiting the cultivators, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little regretful: "It's a pity that there is only the power of one strike and it cannot last."</p><p></p><p>Without withdrawing his attention, Li Fan still waited for Moru Bin's return.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan thought, it was only a consciousness that was dispelled.</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin did not give up on establishing contact with Li Fan.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 502</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Even Li Fan could make a guess decisively that perhaps the inspiration source of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array was this "Xuantian Locking Yin Array".</p><p></p><p>The term "Xuantian" was hard not to associate with the Xuantian Sect that had vanished into the river of history.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be possible that the bizarre occurrences in the world could be traced back to the period when the Xuantian Sect still existed?"</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean that perhaps one can encounter strange things even in the Meteor Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered over the formation diagram he was studying, his thoughts diverged.</p><p></p><p>The formation diagram was made through some special means, encrypted with several bans, making it impossible for outsiders to glimpse the complete structure of the Locking Yin Array.</p><p></p><p>It enabled those unfamiliar with formations to output formations externally through simple operations.</p><p></p><p>"This thing is truly ingenious!" After studying for a while, Li Fan temporarily gave up on the idea of obtaining the complete structure of the Locking Yin Array, sighing softly.</p><p></p><p>In the intervals of daily patrols checking the progress of constructing the Suspended City, Li Fan inscribed the "Xuantian Locking Yin Array" in the slowly forming Cloud Immortal City without anyone noticing.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was painstakingly planning the construction of the Suspended City, far away in the Elders' Domain thousands of miles away, the consciousness attached to the puppet's body was also experiencing some pain.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to the bamboo house and listening to the lectures of the scholar for nearly two months, Li Fan had not gained much understanding of the Five Elders' Association.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he was forced to memorize many legends in the "Human Realm Heaven Realm" where cultivators changed the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Wang Linlang loved beauty and pledged not to let others see her age, so within the Human Realm Heaven Realm, even elderly mortals had shiny black hair.</p><p></p><p>Yue Chengjin was abandoned by his beloved and harbored resentment, leading to a curse that "lovers in the world become siblings." This resulted in various tragedies of illicit love occurring for decades. Fortunately, eventually, under the wishful force of a couple truly in love, the rule of "becoming siblings" was reversed.</p><p></p><p>Qu Su loved fishing but often returned empty-handed. So he made a grand wish that all the fish in the world would bite the bait they saw. Thus, everyone became fishing masters.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These countless stories sounded interesting at first, but after listening for three months in a row, it became unbearable.</p><p></p><p>However, like the other cultivators in front of the bamboo house, Li Fan couldn't control his body.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even block the scholar's words and had to accept them forcibly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan even discovered that everything the scholar said seemed to be deeply engraved in his mind, making it impossible to forget.</p><p></p><p>Thus, everyone's faces were full of frustration as they accepted the brainwashing from the scholar.</p><p></p><p>One day, the scholar, who had talked for a long time, finally felt a bit tired.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, stretched lazily, and said, "As the saying goes, seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times. Even if I talk for another hundred years, it's not as good as you going to see for yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance present, he showed a gentle smile. "I'll give you three years. Within these three years, you are free to go to any place under the jurisdiction of the Five Elders' Association."</p><p></p><p>"After three years, you will come back here. By then, I hope you will tell me your thoughts on the Five Elders' Association."</p><p></p><p>With that, the scholar turned and walked slowly into the bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>As the bamboo door slammed shut, the restraints on everyone disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean? They are letting us leave just like that?"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Immortal Alliance were puzzled and suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a conspiracy?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this fellow cultivator simply scared, acting so unpredictable? We are like lambs to the slaughter now. Is there a need for any conspiracy against us?"</p><p></p><p>"Humph! Why suppress others' ambitions to maintain one's own authority?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I think what Lu Fan fellow cultivator just said, although a bit harsh, makes sense."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although everyone talked incessantly, not a single person dared to get up and leave the valley.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, ignoring them.</p><p></p><p>He walked straight towards the direction he came from, drawing curious looks from the others.</p><p></p><p>The farther he got from the bamboo house, the more his compressed body slowly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there was no hindrance.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the long tunnel and reaching outside the cave, Li Fan found that the senior cultivators who had been supervising had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Flying into the air, trying to find the traces of the Immortal Island, Li Fan discovered that where Immortal Island had been located before was now empty, without a trace left.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Five Elders' Association found what they were looking for in the end."</p><p></p><p>Looking around, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a sense of loneliness in the vast world, not knowing where he should return to.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was feeling melancholic, he suddenly realized something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't one to indulge in self-pity and melancholy; why would he have such thoughts all of a sudden?</p><p></p><p>The image of the scholar involuntarily flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was inwardly shocked, he suddenly heard shouting from far below, "Friend Jiao, Friend Jiao!"</p><p></p><p>Startled, Li Fan realized it was calling out to him.</p><p></p><p>Looking in the direction where the voice came from, he found that it was the cultivator named Lu Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going, Friend Jiao? Why not let's travel together?" Lu Fan followed out of the cave, looked around, found Li Fan, and hurriedly caught up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan was staring at him without responding, Lu Fan explained, "The territory of the Five Elders' Association is vast and not under the Immortal Alliance. In this unfamiliar land, it's better to travel together to take care of each other."</p><p></p><p>"I hear that in the various domains of the Five Elders' Association, the 'Land of No Worries' is the most appealing. Not only are there various unimaginable pleasures known, but there are also extraordinary items like the Wuyou Crystal Grid, which, when used, makes one feel like a celestial being, as if in paradise..." Lu Fan's tone was slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at him for a while and asked, "I remember, friend, you previously held the position of 'Deputy Recorder' at the Hall of Administration in the Cloudy Immortal Sea. Enjoying the pay of the Immortal Alliance, why are you now so eager to join the Five Elders' Association rather than thinking about returning to your homeland?"</p><p></p><p>At his words, Lu Fan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>Then, beads of sweat appeared on his forehead, and his face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan understood.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's the scholar's doing."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders' Association indeed plays with people's hearts."</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan mumbled, "A really clever move. If it weren't for the reminder from Friend Jiao, I might not have noticed by now."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Lu Fan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Five Elders' Association is so confident in letting us leave. Even though I now realize my thoughts are being influenced, I still can't make a change."</p><p></p><p>"Even though I know the Immortal Alliance is my homeland, I still can't bring myself to want to return..."</p><p></p><p>As Lu Fan prattled on, he suddenly found that Li Fan had flown off into the distance without looking back.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, where are you going? Take me with you!"</p>

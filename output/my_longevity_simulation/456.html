        <h1>Chapter 456</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Even a phenomenon of falling against the trend had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, on the day Xuanjing single-handedly determined the storm, after the Lingwu Grass triggered the collapse of the vast majority of herbal prices in the market.</p><p></p><p>Its price remained strong without any significant fluctuations from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>"Universal Sageleaf Grass..."</p><p></p><p>In the mind, the blue light of the Dao crystal flashed, and Li Fan began to search for more information about it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan showed a little interest.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Fan’s later memories, after the Lingwu Grass incident, with the abundant by-products in the Five Elements Grand Cave continuously being mined and released into the market, almost all Lingzhi herbal medicines experienced a significant decline.</p><p></p><p>However, the Universal Sageleaf Grass was an exception.</p><p></p><p>In the following decades, the price of Universal Sageleaf Grass continued to steadily rise.</p><p></p><p>But it was too obscure, and there weren't many cultivators paying attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan, who had previously made a fortune in the speculation of the Lingwu Grass event and had subsequently devoted most of his energy to building the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Array, naturally overlooked it.</p><p></p><p>Now that it seemed the Lingwu Grass incident was not going to happen, Li Fan needed to find an alternative and clearly noticed the unusual aspects of the Universal Sageleaf Grass.</p><p></p><p>"In my past life, I remember that after the popularity of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Array, the Wise Identification Symbols gradually disappeared. However, its price remained high, indicating that it should have other unknown uses."</p><p></p><p>"The various anomalies indicate that behind this, there should be someone manipulating. Nou6bookshu1x.com"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully considered his methods of attacking Lingwu Island, artificially inflating the price of Lingwu Grass, and using Universal Sageleaf Grass as a substitute, weighing the feasibility of these two methods.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the method, the final result will definitely cause a stir. The Tianji Hall will surely investigate."</p><p></p><p>"From the final outcome of the previous life, through free market operations, buying low and selling high, within the allowed rules."</p><p></p><p>"However, if maliciously disrupting the market, disturbing the economy, that's another story. You might end up being accused of disrupting the stability of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I have a hand-covering-the-sky technique, it may not withstand scrutiny."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After serious consideration, Li Fan subtly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"But I still need to see if this Universal Sageleaf Grass can really deliver."</p><p></p><p>True to his words.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw out all the Lingwu Grass he had previously acquired regardless of cost and began purchasing Universal Sageleaf Grass instead.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Mirror, the current price of Universal Sageleaf Grass was basically stable at 280 contribution points per piece.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spent a million contribution points at once, frantically buying.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the number of surviving specimens in the market began to decrease at a visible rate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, its price slowly started to rise.</p><p></p><p>Wiping out the previous decline, it returned to a normal price level of about 300 contribution points. Nou6bookshu1x.com</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained calm and continued to increase his purchasing power.</p><p></p><p>Another million contribution points were spent.</p><p></p><p>301, 302...</p><p></p><p>The price of Universal Sageleaf Grass was about to break through 305.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, its price visible to the naked eye suddenly started to plummet.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, it dropped from over 300 back to 292 contribution points.</p><p></p><p>"This situation indicates that someone has released a large amount of Universal Sageleaf Grass into the market."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror determines that supply exceeds demand, leading to a rapid price drop in a short period."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes as he temporarily stopped to carefully consider.</p><p></p><p>"With a large amount of Universal Sageleaf Grass in hand, actively manipulating the market to lower prices? Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in the Lingwu Grass incident in my previous life, amidst the general rise in the prices of Lingzhi herbal medicines, they were still able to control the price of Universal Sageleaf Grass to a high level."</p><p></p><p>"It can be basically confirmed that the other party has formed some kind of monopoly."</p><p></p><p>"Seems like the game is almost in hand..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, thinking of a certain operation from his past life, Li Fan vaguely thought of a possibility.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly got up, left the Tianxuan Mirror, and went straight to the Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>Outside, he heard Jiao Xiuyuan's dissatisfied complaint, "Wasn't it agreed to take this Flying Star Disk? I dug it up with so much effort, and now you say you don't want it?"</p><p></p><p>"These days, can people still do business with some integrity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted with a smile, "If nobody wants it, I'll take it!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan, who was originally speaking to someone, was immediately delighted upon hearing Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>He handed over a rusty copper plate.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at it but didn't see anything special. However, based on his experience from his past life, he paid for it, and then stored it away carefully in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao friend, let's put aside these trivial matters. I came to you this time for a big deal!" Li Fan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiao Xiuyuan also recognized Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking he had come to inquire whether the Broken Delusion Stone Eye had been sold, Jiao Xiuyuan's dark face showed a hint of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>"Oh! It's Li Fan friend! I'm really sorry, about that Broken Delusion Stone Eye, maybe..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand to interrupt him, then pulled Jiao Xiuyuan closer and said in a deep voice, "Let's not worry about that for now. Jiao friend, what I just said, I'm serious."</p><p></p><p>"If you miss this opportunity, I’m afraid you'll lose half of your sanity and puppetry will be greatly damaged!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan speak so alarmingly, Jiao Xiuyuan's face changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>Hiding the smile on his face, Jiao Xiuyuan closed the gates of the Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Li Fan friend, what do you mean by that?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Universal Sageleaf Grass? Its price has been abnormal lately. Take a look, and you'll see what I mean." Li Fan answered.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiao Xiuyuan closed his eyes in thought.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his eyebrows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan shared his probing actions with Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?" Li Fan asked, with a hint of reassessment in his tone.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Jiao Xiuyuan said, "If I'm guessing correctly, the other party should have borrowed a certain amount of Universal Sageleaf Grass from somewhere."</p><p></p><p>"And he might also happen to have some excess inventory in hand."</p><p></p><p>"So by attempting to release a large amount of Universal Sageleaf Grass into the market to temporarily lower the price and pay off some of his debt, he seeks to profit."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan gave his judgment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clapped, "Great minds think alike, that's what I thought too."</p><p></p><p>With a slightly dissatisfied expression, Jiao Xiuyuan asked, "Is this what you call a big deal? Why didn't I see it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan revealed a mysterious smile.</p><p></p><p>"Assuming, well assuming."</p><p></p><p>"If the time comes when the other party must return the Universal Sageleaf Grass, but the total circulating amount in the market is not enough for him to return, what will happen then?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan suddenly failed to understand the meaning behind Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>He was momentarily perplexed.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a glint flickered in his eyes.</p>

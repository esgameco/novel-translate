            <p>The wailing from outside grew louder, and Jiao Xiuyuan, who had received contributions, said to Li Fan in a deep voice. [Website address]</p><p></p><p>With that said, a new branch suddenly extended from his palm.</p><p></p><p>A single green leaf, standing tall and proud on the branch.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's consciousness split in an instant and flew towards the branch in Jiao Xiuyuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>As he got closer, he sensed an inexplicable attraction coming from the green leaf on the branch.</p><p></p><p>Unable to control himself, he plunged into it.</p><p></p><p>His vision gradually became clear, and in a moment, Li Fan felt that besides his main body and clone, there was another body.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had the secret art of transformation, accustomed to multitasking. Otherwise, it might have been difficult to adjust.</p><p></p><p>Controlling the puppet body wasn't much different from his clone technique in terms of sensation.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly perceive the gap between consciousness and physical body, unlike his clone which felt more unified.</p><p></p><p>It was more like "driving" rather than inhabiting a living body.</p><p></p><p>"The transaction is complete. This body is now yours to dispose of, Daoist friend."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you don't intentionally do anything disgusting, even if you destroy it, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, when the puppet body is damaged, to prevent the attached consciousness from being captured, it will activate a forced destruction measure. You might experience a bit of soul shock then..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's voice resounded in Li Fan's mind. [Website address]</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could respond, the voice faded, becoming barely audible.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan familiarized himself with the puppet's body, his main body hurried towards the remembered location of Qingfeng Hall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Wanxian Island had been transported to the sky in front of a purple gate.</p><p></p><p>Being continuously swallowed by the teleportation array, it entered the territory of the Five Elders' association.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had attempted to break through the blockade due to their numbers had all been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Under the lesson of bloodshed, the remaining cultivators sat despondently on the ground, waiting for the unknown fate.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan strode into the inconspicuous shop of Qingfeng Hall.</p><p></p><p>The place was now empty, devoid of the messy old man.</p><p></p><p>Calling out a few times yielded no response.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan took out a pile of high-grade spirit stones from his storage ring and placed them on the floor of Qingfeng Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Will these be enough to buy a way out?," Li Fan tentatively asked aloud.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, there was still no response.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan added another pile of valuable spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Altogether, the value was close to one million contributions.</p><p></p><p>This time, the seemingly deserted Qingfeng Hall finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>A green ripple floated in the air, forming a familiar green gate. [Website address]</p><p></p><p>Feeling a stir in his heart, Li Fan stepped into it.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he appeared in the same space he had visited before.</p><p></p><p>The ancient tree mentioned by Jiao Xiuyuan stood right in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, the human face on the tree had disappeared, making it look like an ordinary tree.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, you are quite generous."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was about to inquire, a crisp female voice suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Awu, since you have received benefits from the other party, help him leave here."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Miss." A human face suddenly appeared on the ancient tree, glanced at Li Fan, and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Guest, please come in." The ancient tree opened a passage with its huge mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, miss!" Without hesitation, Li Fan bowed towards the direction of the voice, and then walked into the entrance on the ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's figure disappeared, the ancient tree closed its mouth and revealed its appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Miss..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, ancient cultivators speak in an amusing way."</p><p></p><p>In the air, a laughter as clear as silver bells rang out. The leaves of the ancient tree trembled slightly in response.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Feeling similar to using a long-distance teleportation array, the surroundings shifted from darkness to colorful splendor, then into full brightness.</p><p></p><p>After adjusting to the discomfort of his body, Li Fan looked around.</p><p></p><p>There were a few cultivators still in Qingfeng Hall, and the bustling sounds of the market in the distance were calm.</p><p></p><p>All these signs indicated that Li Fan was no longer in danger, no longer in the midst of the chaotic clouds and seas.</p><p></p><p>Casually exploring, Li Fan finally understood his current location.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, he had arrived in the heartland of the Ten Thousand Immortals League, near the Xuanwei Prefecture of the Tianyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, news of Wanxian Island's fall had not yet reached here. For now, Li Fan shifted his attention back to the puppet body on Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the despairing cries of Wanxian League cultivators, the island was completely engulfed by the purple teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>After a long period of darkness, when the sky lit up again, what appeared before everyone was a peculiar scene.</p><p></p><p>It had just been daytime, but after passing through the purple gate and arriving at the Five Elders' territory, it was already nighttime.</p><p></p><p>There was no moon in the sky, but countless shimmering stars twinkled, reflecting each other's brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Streams of starry rivers flowed, creating a dazzling and enchanting display.</p><p></p><p>For most present, it was their first time witnessing such a magnificent starry sky, with nine out of ten being dazzled and entranced by the sight.</p><p></p><p>The previously wailing Wanxian Island fell into a sudden silence.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome, Wanxian League members, to the Heavenly Realm of Human Dao."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged cultivator dressed in white Daoist robes flew to the top of the group and spoke loudly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand that you may have deep misunderstandings about our Five Elders' association. However, it's okay. Soon, you will completely dispel these misunderstandings."</p><p></p><p>"By that time, I believe you will make the right choice to join our Five Elders' association."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator spoke with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Five Elders' association didn't seem as ferocious as rumored, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, they were entirely skeptical of the "misunderstanding" mentioned by the white-robed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"First of all, please leave this island," said the white-robed cultivator, and a group of burly figures flew out.</p><p></p><p>They wielded blades and wore heavy armor.</p><p></p><p>Instead of cultivators, they looked more like soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Sensing their aura, it was apparent that each of them had the cultivation of Yuanying.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian League cultivators present all changed their expressions, unable to resist, they were escorted by them, leaving Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>"It seems they didn't come for me specifically but simply for Wanxian Island."</p><p></p><p>"It's odd, what's so special about Wanxian Island?"</p><p></p><p>Blending in the crowd, Li Fan watched the distant white-robed cultivator fly into Wanxian Island with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Following that, dozens of powerful cultivators appeared one after another, entering the island.</p><p></p><p>Explosive roars were heard, and buildings on the island collapsed.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be searching for something.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

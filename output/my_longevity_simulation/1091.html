            <p>Chapter 1089: Leaping Over the High Wall</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible. The vast amount of immortal power gathered within my body is clearly not an illusion." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced, and he quickly used the Water Mirror Technique to examine himself.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that, just as he had guessed, his appearance was no longer that of Mr. Bai, but his own!</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>"The immortal power obtained from the damaged immortal tools in the Fallen Immortal Mirror has actually manifested in reality..."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was feeling a bit lost, the image of Mr. Bai's face suddenly appeared in his mind, like a flash of lightning, piercing through the fog.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood there, stunned.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>That's right, although everything Li Fan had experienced in the Fallen Immortal Realm was fake, in real history, Mr. Bai had indeed collected and destroyed many immortal tools, thereby gaining the power to cross the high wall.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, Mr. Bai chose not to leave the Xuanhuang Realm. So..."</p><p></p><p>A glint of light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>His heart also began to beat wildly: "The vast immortal power from back then was preserved intact!"</p><p></p><p>"It was stored in the Fallen Immortal Realm! In this final test scene for becoming the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt the immense power surrounding his body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he understood.</p><p></p><p>He had to make the same choice as Mr. Bai did back then.</p><p></p><p>Either inherit this immortal power and cross the high wall, becoming free and unrestrained from then on.</p><p></p><p>Or choose to give it up, stay in the Xuanhuang Realm, and take on the role of the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know for what reason Mr. Bai had made the choice to stay back then, Li Fan was not as noble as Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>If there was a chance to leave, how could he choose to be bound by the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>Almost without hesitation, Li Fan was about to make the decision to inherit the immortal power.</p><p></p><p>But at the last moment, he suddenly changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the high wall, beyond the high wall..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it really safe beyond the high wall?"</p><p></p><p>His current true cultivation was only comparable to that of an ordinary Harmonious Dao Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, with the help of the Lingmu Realm and people like Tian Yang, he could barely protect himself.</p><p></p><p>But if he left Xuanhuang and went beyond the high wall...</p><p></p><p>The degree of danger would likely far exceed that of coming to the Xuanhuang Realm as a mortal back then.</p><p></p><p>One must know that true immortals existed beyond the high wall.</p><p></p><p>The burst of power fluctuations from crossing the high wall was very likely to attract Their attention.</p><p></p><p>Especially in this life, Li Fan was still within the web of the Faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much a Nascent Soul realm cultivator struggled, it might not necessarily attract the attention of a true immortal. But if a Nascent Soul realm speck of dust suddenly turned into an immortal...</p><p></p><p>By then, Li Fan might not even have time to react before being captured and taken away for research by the Faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan finally let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>He completely suppressed the urge that was stirring within him.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity for transcendence that he had desperately sought for over a hundred lifetimes was now before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But when there was really a chance to escape, Li Fan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>At its core, it was because Li Fan's current strength was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>And he knew absolutely nothing about what lay beyond the high wall.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he couldn't leave now, but that the risk of leaving was too great.</p><p></p><p>So great that even with the real Li Fan, he didn't dare to easily attempt it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wait a little longer, just a little longer."</p><p></p><p>"It's not time yet."</p><p></p><p>"For others, once the opportunity to leave the Darkest Star Sea is missed, it will never come again."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm different."</p><p></p><p>"Since I already know about the existence of this vast immortal power, I can come and take it whenever I need it."</p><p></p><p>After a rational analysis, Li Fan's state of mind finally returned to a state of calm.</p><p></p><p>Since he had temporarily given up on the plan to cross the high wall, there was now another problem facing Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>With almost no consideration, Li Fan made a decisive choice.</p><p></p><p>If in ancient times, the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate could still be the only one above the law.</p><p></p><p>But now times have changed.</p><p></p><p>The benefits may not be many, but the obligations and responsibilities that need to be shouldered are visibly huge.</p><p></p><p>Bringing order out of chaos, dealing with the Dharma transmission, restoring the normal order of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Saving the Xuanhuang Realm from the fate of being devoured by the Immortal Ruins...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no interest in being a savior.</p><p></p><p>He had no real sense of belonging to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had found a way to cross the high wall, what he needed to do next was to increase his strength as soon as possible, or to plan and attempt to see if this method was truly effective and safe for escape.</p><p></p><p>As for this Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate, whoever wants to be it can be it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan certainly wouldn't join in this excitement.</p><p></p><p>Since this test was created by Mr. Bai, Li Fan believed that it would not force cultivators to make a choice.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when Li Fan expressed in his heart the idea of giving up both choices.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, the surrounding scenery began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Like boiling water, it shattered with a bang.</p><p></p><p>After a slight dizziness, Li Fan finally returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Seems to have a bit of a temper."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan muttered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the experience in the Fallen Immortal Realm this time, it was a bit of a pity that, like before, there were only vague memories.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it involved specific divine powers and secret techniques, none of it could be recalled.</p><p></p><p>"If I became the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate, perhaps the history in the Fallen Immortal Realm would be inherited."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"The gains do not make up for the losses. Especially in this world that has already fallen into the net of true immortals."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmed his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he looked at the time.</p><p></p><p>He was surprised to find that this trip to the Fallen Immortal Realm had actually lasted for more than a year.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the time flow ratio of this test illusion was not the same as that of ordinary Fallen Immortal illusions, but was closer to reality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a vague realization in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This test illusion was not created casually. It may require the consumption of a certain amount of energy."</p><p></p><p>"Although Mo Rubin entered the test illusion more than a year before me, I have already experienced it in advance and am familiar with the plot. His actions may not be as swift as mine."</p><p></p><p>"It's possible that he is still in the illusion."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan began to check what had happened in the past year.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma transmitter Zhou couldn't get in touch with Li Fan for a long time, so he guessed that Li Fan had actually successfully entered the test illusion.</p><p></p><p>He intermittently sent many messages, in addition to asking Li Fan to reveal some of the scenes experienced after leaving the illusion.</p><p></p><p>The rest were about the many things related to the remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although Dharma transmitters like Chen had passed the Dharma Transmitter's Oath, everyone knew that they were no longer suitable to stay in the highest management positions of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After a re-vote by the Dharma transmitters, they finally compromised and voluntarily left.</p>

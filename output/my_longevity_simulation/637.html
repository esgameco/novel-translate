        <h1>Chapter 637</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Is it true? Why have I never heard of such a powerful formation?" He scrutinized Fang Zaiji, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji snorted coldly, "You are just a servant, who has never left the territory of the Medicine King Sect in your entire life. How can you compare to me, who has traveled around the world?"</p><p></p><p>"And who were the people I befriended back then? Almost all of them were true disciples of the Ten Immortal Paths. Knowing such secrets is not surprising." Fang Zaiji said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Being called a servant, Liu San was not angry. Instead, he sarcastically retorted, "If you are so powerful, why didn't anyone help you when you were being chased? Weren't you saved by the former sect master to survive?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's face changed, disgruntled, "When the Heavenly Sword Sect issued a death order, what could I do? Being able to survive was already considered lucky for me. If it were you, you would have turned into a pile of bones long ago!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two about to argue further, Li Fan quickly interjected and interrupted them.</p><p></p><p>"Does Mr. Fang know the name of that formation?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I am not sure about that." Fang Zaiji shook his head. "It was mentioned by a direct disciple of the Supreme Sect casually in the past."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the people I associated with back then were remarkable figures, almost all of them were true disciples of the Immortal Path. Knowing such secrets is not surprising." Fang Zaiji said.</p><p></p><p>"With the help of mortals, locking down the other world of immortals. My previous guess that the Xuanhuang Realm anchors the 'ropes' in the distant void seems to be achieved through this formation." Li Fan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"At present, the Ten Immortal Paths seem to have repaired a part of the grand formation, but not completely. And this formation definitely wasn't built by the Ten Immortal Paths. It originated from the ancient days of the Xuantian Sect." Li Fan pondered secretly, connecting all the existing clues.</p><p></p><p>With the help of an additional Daoist practitioner, Li Fan began his transfer plan.</p><p></p><p>The people on the island of Li Realm, including all the awakened Medicine King Sect practitioners, under the escort of Liu San and Fang Zaiji, rode the Pu Hsien True Boat and headed to Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>"There are still some matters left unfinished in the Cloud Mist Sea, I will come later." Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>Although Liu San and Fang Zaiji were somewhat worried, they could not defy Li Fan's wishes.</p><p></p><p>So they had to repeatedly remind each other, then reluctantly leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, within the ruins of the Chao Yuan Sect, many anomalies had already appeared. Between reality and illusion, it seemed as if one could be transported to ancient times, bringing back the sect's techniques, elixirs, and artifacts. The news spread, causing a stir, and numerous cultivators who had heard the news rushed over. Among them, the group from the Medicine King Sect was inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>After sending off the crowd, Li Fan first checked on Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>In the Enhanced Version of the Earth Fire Return Formation, all the heavenly treasures had been absorbed completely by Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>He himself seemed to be undergoing a transformation, as his puppet body was enveloped in a thick layer of black solid matter.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time; I hope that my junior apprentice brother can make it to this banquet." Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Tian Yang, Li Fan did not return to Cloud Mist City but traveled a long distance to the Yin Island.</p><p></p><p>Under the surveillance of the invisible killing intent, the Yin clansman seemed to have once again completed the verification of the secrets of the immortal and mortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>The result was consistent with before.</p><p></p><p>He seemed almost hopeless, sitting motionlessly on the ground for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently approached him, sensing a strong sense of desolation from him.</p><p></p><p>The Yin clansman was not surprised at the sudden appearance of the cultivator Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But he simply glanced at him and then withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Yin, what did you find in the immortal and mortal miasma?" After a long silence, Li Fan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, the Yin clansman's cultivation was indeed at the Foundation Building stage. Even with Li Fan's true body standing in front of him, he did not sense any danger.</p><p></p><p>"So it was you who has been watching over me." The Yin clansman didn't answer but suddenly said, "I thought it was a heavenly thief."</p><p></p><p>He stood up abruptly from the ground, dusted off his clothes, ignoring Li Fan, and walked straight to the underground chamber on the island.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he said, "Back then, I was just an ordinary Qi Refining junior cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"But one day, it started raining in my hometown."</p><p></p><p>What was eerie was that all the cultivators and familiar people around me disappeared in that rain. Can you imagine how that feels..."</p><p></p><p>"One moment they were talking to you, and the next moment, under your gaze, they vanished into the air. The world fell silent, and I went crazy searching for these missing people, but there was no harvest."</p><p></p><p>"It seemed as if only I remained in the world. Yet I didn't know why I was the only one left alive."</p><p></p><p>"And then..."</p><p></p><p>The Yin clansman arrived at the passage filled with his collection.</p><p></p><p>His tone inexplicably became agitated. He waved his hand, setting fire to his collections one after another.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not try to stop him, but watched as the Yin clansman, with ever-changing expressions amidst the flickering flames, continued his narrative.</p><p></p><p>"The rain kept pouring. It overflowed from the river and seemed to submerge all lands. And alongside the raindrops, countless bodies fell from the sky."</p><p></p><p>"Most were incomplete, just fragments. But some were complete skeletons."</p><p></p><p>"I was almost driven crazy by this terrifying scene. Yet, when a relatively intact corpse fell in front of me, I knew what true fear was."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Yin clansman had reached the deepest part of the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>A light illuminated, revealing countless bodies that looked exactly like the Yin clansman.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Fan had advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, his observations were more meticulous. In his perception, these bodies seemed to be alive in some way.</p><p></p><p>The vague flesh and blood tissues were subtly moving imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>The Yin clansman pointed at the bodies on the ground, his face gradually showing a mad expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what fell in front of me back then was actually my own corpse!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I saw that all the bodies that fell from the sky had faces exactly like mine!"</p><p></p><p>"And they were all smiling at me!"</p><p></p><p>The Yin clansman's dual voices echoed constantly in the underground chamber. The eerie facts he described sent shivers down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>"How could such a terrifying thing happen in this world? Can you explain it?" He turned to Li Fan, staring blankly, and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"There is a problem in this world." The Yin clansman looked up at the sky.</p>

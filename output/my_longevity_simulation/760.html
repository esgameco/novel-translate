        <h1>Chapter 760</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Before Zi Qiong could respond, Xu Bai looked impatient and asked with puzzlement: "This transaction is of great importance. It's understandable that a senior like yourself would handle it personally. However, with your capabilities, senior, it should be easy for you to conceal your identity. Why..."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid that our Overturning Heaven Society will find out about this and try to blackmail you in return?" Xu Bai stared intently at Zi Qiong.</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong calmly said: "Blackmail? Heh, don't misunderstand. Although I'm representing the Council of Elders this time, it doesn't imply anything."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just running an errand, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong appeared completely unperturbed, an attitude that left Xu Bai somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be surprised. After all, the Myriad Immortal Alliance belongs to the Dharma Propagation Heavenly Venerable. And I have always been loyal only to the old Venerable from beginning to end. Everything else is inconsequential."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, there are fifty paths to the Great Way, and the Heavenly Evolution encompasses forty-nine. If the Celestial Mirror wishes to comprehend all in this world, then it stands to reason that there should exist things beyond its control."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, this 'New Heaven' would be imperfect."</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong looked up at the sky and explained slowly.</p><p></p><p>"So even if the Venerable knows about my actions, she won't blame me. She might even commend me."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, but those mortals may not necessarily understand my intentions."</p><p></p><p>Although just a few sentences, the amount of information contained was quite terrifying.</p><p></p><p>After these words, Xu Bai fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't reach that realm, knowing too much may not be a good thing." After a while, the Immortal Lord Zi Qiong spoke, interrupting Xu Bai's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>With a casual gesture, he tossed over the "Void Clarity Mother Stone" containing the transaction goods.</p><p></p><p>This time, however, he did not establish any contract.</p><p>It seemed he was very confident in his abilities and wasn't afraid that Xu Bai would try any tricks.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Xu Bai still checked and verified the inventory list in the Mother Stone before handing over the fifty "Terminal Discs" they had agreed upon earlier.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first batch. The rest will need to be delivered gradually later on," Xu Bai explained.</p><p></p><p>The fifty Terminal Stone Discs were not stored in his personal space. Instead, they were stacked like thin sheets of paper.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, they would separate into individual entities.</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong examined one of the discs in his hand.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he remarked thoughtfully: "This object appears ordinary, yet it can block the perception of the Celestial Mirror Treasure..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Putting away the Terminal Disc, Zi Qiong then instructed: "For future transactions, others will liaise with you. If your Overturning Heaven Society has any urgent situations, you can also find Liu Wenyu."</p><p></p><p>"But try not to associate with me too much. I don't mind..."</p><p></p><p>"But if those people set their sights on you, even I can't protect you."</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong's figure gradually faded, leaving as abruptly as he had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, faced with the Celestial Mirror's relentless pressure, why does the Council of Elders keep retreating without any countermeasures?" Xu Bai asked as Zi Qiong was about to disappear completely.</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong didn't answer, only glancing up vaguely before...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The azure firmament.</p><p>And then it disappeared from sight.</p><p>Shortly after, he was startled and alarmed.</p><p>This "heaven" was obviously not referring to the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p>The Venerable Immortal of the Purple Firmament said that from beginning to end, he had been loyal to the [Transmitter of the Dharma Venerable].</p><p>Then his actions before departing were also quite clear.</p><p>It was not that the Five Elders did not want to counteract.</p><p>It's just that now that the Transmitter of the Dharma Venerable is here, they don't dare to.</p><p>In Xu Bai's heart, the sigh of the illusory scene of the previous Mr. Xu resurfaced.</p><p>"There is a Immortal Path that cannot be trodden, for the Transmitter of the Dharma Venerable is above."</p><p>Xu Bai unconsciously clenched his fist: "In the previous life, perhaps it was because of the departure of the Transmitter of the Dharma that Zi Qiong turned back to the side of the Five Elders and became a pure spy."</p><p>"And in this life, I used the [Disorder] technique to bring the Transmitter of the Dharma, who had already departed, back. Therefore, Zi Qiong still insists on his somewhat unique position and has not fully acted as a spy for the Five Elders."</p><p>In an instant, Xu Bai, who had clarified the origins of the matter, had many doubts arise in his heart.</p><p>That is the true purpose of the Transmitter of the Dharma.</p><p>If her ultimate goal is to transcend and leave the Mysterious Yellow Realm, then even if she is very concerned about the [Disorder] technique, after returning and finding no trace, she should choose to leave again.</p><p>But now a long time has passed.</p><p>The [Transmitter of the Dharma Venerable] seems to still be lingering in the Mysterious Yellow Realm and shows no signs of leaving.</p><p>"It seems that the Mysterious Yellow Realm has a special meaning for the Transmitter of the Dharma, and it is not something that can be casually abandoned."</p><p>"Moreover, the promotion of the Heavenly Profound Mirror in this world must have been approved by the Transmitter of the Dharma herself. She needs the Heavenly Profound Mirror to complete its transformation, but she also tacitly permits the possible loopholes..."</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao has defects. So she also needs to impose restrictions on the Heavenly Profound Mirror."</p><p>...</p><p>Many possible conjectures suddenly surfaced in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p>Although this physical body was blessed by heaven and earth, and had extraordinary talents, he still seemed to be seeing things through a fog, unable to fathom the intentions of the Transmitter of the Dharma.</p><p>His mind was a bit confused, and after returning to the Heavenly Spirit City, he was also called over by Nangong Shirong.</p><p>"There have been some unpleasant rumors circulating in the territory recently. You go and handle it." Nangong Shirong only said this in a puzzled manner.</p><p>Logically speaking, Xu Bai was only the Interlink Commissioner of Tian Liang Prefecture. Whether it was the Garrison Office or the Martial Arts Hall, it would be natural for them to take care of such rumors. But surprisingly, Nangong Shirong secretly entrusted this task to him alone.</p><p>Xu Bai immediately understood.</p><p>This matter should not be blown up, and it needs to be handled quickly and neatly.</p><p>It was precisely because Nangong Shirong valued Xu Bai's abilities that he assigned this task to him.</p><p>When the superior gives an order, the subordinate naturally cannot refuse.</p><p>"My lord, rest assured, I will handle it properly." Xu Bai cupped his hands and promised with a raised head.</p><p>After leaving under the other's gaze, Xu Bai inquired about the matter, only to learn what the "unpleasant" rumors that Nangong Shirong mentioned were all about.</p><p>It turned out that within the territory of Tian Liang Prefecture, there was a cultivator named Peng Qing who, just before his death, suddenly went mad and fled everywhere.</p><p>While flying around in a frenzy, he also ranted and raved, saying that he was originally supposed to live for 500 years, but now he had only lived less than 400 years and was about to die.</p><p>He must have been a thief who had arbitrarily reduced his lifespan limit.</p><p>Peng Qing cursed and swore, and then in front of everyone, he died abruptly in a tragic state, with blood flowing from his seven orifices, and aged hundreds of years in an instant.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 795</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable of Dharma Transmission, indeed worthy of being the strongest existence in the world, suppressing the universe. With Mr. Bai's strength, he could hide for a time. But in the end, he couldn't hide forever. After finally perfecting the "Foundation Establishment Method" and successfully obtaining actual verification, the Heavenly Venerable of Dharma Transmission still found Mr. Bai's whereabouts based on some clues.</p><p></p><p>"Buzz..." It was as if the air was instantly drained, and the huge pressure difference made everyone in the Medicine King Valley cover their heads in pain. In the sky of the secret realm, cracks appeared one after another. It seemed that the secret realm itself couldn't bear the great power and was about to shatter. Changsheng Valley was like a small boat in a stormy sea, shaking violently and on the verge of collapse...</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in an instant. However, it wasn't actually the Dharma Venerable himself who arrived. It was just that He cast his gaze down from the sky. Mr. Bai walked out slowly, flew up into the air, and stepped lightly. The cracks in the sky of the secret realm gradually recovered. The shaking Changsheng Valley also slowly became calm again. The people who recovered from the Dharma Venerable's pressure all had pale faces and their bodies couldn't stop trembling slightly. Even the three-person Hedao group was like this. In front of the Dharma Venerable, ordinary Hedao was no different from the so-called Foundation Establishment and Nascent Soul stages. They looked at Mr. Bai in mid-air, who single-handedly blocked the Dharma Venerable's pressure, with varied expressions.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's clothes moved without wind, rustling. "Take good care of the children." "Without them, the Foundation Establishment Method would not have been born." Without looking back, he just calmly left these words. After that, Mr. Bai broke through the void and left Changsheng Valley. "Sir!" From beginning to end, the people of Changsheng Valley didn't know Mr. Bai's name. They only referred to him as "Sir". Just like the group of orphans who lived in the Xuantian Broken Temple in Ningyuan City back then. It seemed that the Dharma Venerable had finally locked onto the person he was looking for, and his pressure gradually dissipated from Changsheng Valley. Instead, it all concentrated on Mr. Bai. After Mr. Bai tore apart space and went to the Xuanhuang Realm. It was unknown whether it was due to the influence of the Dharma Venerable's power or Mr. Bai's intention. In any case, the sky of Changsheng Valley did not return to its original state. Instead, a huge crack opened up from it, through which one could clearly see what was happening in the Xuanhuang Realm at this moment. Mr. Bai flew into the sky, his figure growing larger and larger. In the blink of an eye, he became as huge as a giant standing between heaven and earth. As the tracking target appeared, the Dharma Venerable didn't say much either. In the sky, black vortexes suddenly appeared one after another. They were like holes, exerting endless suction power towards Mr. Bai. They also seemed like pairs of eyes, staring at the other party tightly without any expression.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the Devouring Primordial Mist Barrier, at this moment in the Xuanhuang Realm, only Luoyan Prefecture and Lueying Prefecture, where Changsheng Valley was located, could see this world-shocking scene unfold. And all the cultivators who stared at the black vortexes at the top of the sky instantly became dazed. There were even many people who directly flew towards the sky. Like moths to a flame, they went to chase the changing black holes in the sky. That kind of attraction was unknown and nameless. But it seemed to be even more tempting to cultivators than the spirit of heaven and earth. This was just the external manifestation of those black vortexes. Mr. Bai, who bore the full power of them, his towering figure...</p><p></p><p>(Translation incomplete as the excerpt ends abruptly)</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it became slightly distorted.</p><p>Continuous explosions kept occurring inexplicably in various parts of his body.</p><p>This was still just the initial means of the Dharma transmission.</p><p>What followed next was the beginning that made the children inside the Medicine King Valley exclaim in surprise.</p><p>A strange purple hue suddenly and quietly occupied the sky of the Luoyan and Lueying prefectures.</p><p>It obscured the sky and replaced the scorching sun.</p><p>Under the purple glow, Mr. Bai's clothes, hair, and even his eyes seemed to be tainted by that eerie color.</p><p>A mass of flesh and blood burst open from Mr. Bai's body.</p><p>Then, as if a human-shaped phantom inexplicably dispersed and returned to the sky.</p><p>If Li Fan were still here at this moment, he would surely be able to see that this was the phenomenon of the distorted spirit of heaven and earth being stripped away from Mr. Bai's body.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The huge explosive sounds kept reverberating through the universe.</p><p>And the later moves of the Dharma transmission followed one after another.</p><p>Numerous black worm-like thin threads, densely packed. Like a pack of hunting hyenas, they surrounded Mr. Bai and frantically devoured.</p><p>At every moment, countless threads were lost from his body.</p><p>They were transformed into a part of these squirming black threads.</p><p>...</p><p>The Dharma Transmission Celestial's moves had already exceeded the scope of ordinary magic and divine powers.</p><p>There was no dazzling brilliance, no earth-shattering might.</p><p>There were only all kinds of strange and abnormal [phenomena].</p><p>The terrifying power that caused these [phenomena] to occur must be beyond the level of cognition of cultivators.</p><p>The cultivators of the Luoyan and Lueying prefectures who witnessed this scene all lost their voices.</p><p>Faced with the Dharma Transmission's continuous attacks, Mr. Bai seemed to have no ability to resist at all.</p><p>He just stood there silently and passively took the beating.</p><p>Just when everyone thought so, Mr. Bai finally made a move.</p><p>He stretched out his hands, his long sleeves flying up, and in an instant, they drilled into the white fog barrier that also spanned the heavens and earth and divided the various prefectures of the mortal world in front of his body.</p><p>Then, a huge force surged from his arms.</p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble!"</p><p>The huge muffled sound seemed to come from every corner of the world.</p><p>"That is..."</p><p>"Quick, look, the white fog barrier is moving!"</p><p>The white fog barrier, which had been silent for ten thousand years and seemed to be unchanging since ancient times, was actually slowly flowing.</p><p>The rumbling sound became louder and louder, and the speed of the white fog's flow also became faster and faster.</p><p>And the source of the flow was none other than Mr. Bai's arms.</p><p>A huge suction force appeared from his hands.</p><p>It frantically sucked all the element-devouring white fog that the cultivators were afraid to avoid into his own sleeves.</p><p>From a trickling stream to a turbulent river, and then to a surging great river!</p><p>The white fog enveloping the entire mortal world was being continuously drawn, rushing rapidly towards Mr. Bai!</p><p>And this action finally seemed to truly enrage the Dharma Transmission.</p><p>In the dark purple sky, a face appeared faintly.</p><p>Then, two fingers, like pillars supporting the heavens, descended from the sky!</p><p>In an instant, the sky became gloomy.</p><p>The wailing sound, as if an evil wind was raging, coming from the ninth heaven, resounded through the lands of the two prefectures.</p><p>Wind and thunder roared together, and cracks in space, like densely woven spider webs, extended from the sky to the earth in an instant.</p><p>Those who were unfortunately affected by it were instantly pulverized into powder, leaving no trace of their bones.</p><p>And those who were lucky enough to escape were trapped by the huge pressure brought by the two fingers descending from the sky.</p><p>They couldn't move at all!</p><p>Those who couldn't bear it even knelt down on the spot!</p><p>-----------------</p><p>There is one more chapter being written, it may take until one or two o'clock!</p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 579</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, trying to see clearly what was blocking the way ahead in the darkness. But what surprised him was that, whether using divine sense to sense or using his body to touch, there was no indication of any obstacles ahead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly. This time, he didn't try to harmonize with the ripples appearing in space, but deliberately avoided the timing of the ripples and flew directly forward.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, the "wall" he had just sensed in the ripples seemed to be nonexistent now.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could clearly feel that his position in this void space had changed.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, a part of his positional attributes had changed, while another part remained stagnant.</p><p></p><p>It was like his movement on his own and the ripple's fluctuation were two different levels, not interfering with each other.</p><p></p><p>This elusive phenomenon was a bit beyond Li Fan's current understanding. He had no intention of thinking about the cause behind this phenomenon for now. He simply emptied his mind again, waiting for the ripples in the void space to come again.</p><p></p><p>Instead of merging with them, he boldly headed towards the obstacle that he knew was there, even though the ripples showed no sign of it.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Li Fan saw stars in his eyes and was forced to break free from the ripples.</p><p></p><p>Checking himself, he found that though his body was unharmed, his spiritual soul seemed to have been shaken.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a while, temporarily giving up on these rash attempts.</p><p></p><p>He didn't leave; instead, he stood quietly in the void, concentrating every time ripples approached, trying to understand why he was separated while the ripples flowed smoothly.</p><p></p><p>When his mind was focused, the ripples in the absolute darkness and silence became very prominent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recorded the timing of each ripple appearing.</p><p></p><p>After patiently collecting tens of thousands of samples, he reproduced them in his sea of consciousness using the Hua Dao Shi, trying to find the hidden patterns among them.</p><p></p><p>His hard work paid off. Li Fan discovered that after about every one thousand pulses, there would be a special existence with a different intensity and speed from the other ripples.</p><p></p><p>This special existence would spread in the void at nearly twice the normal speed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calculated the numbers in his mind and concentrated, waiting for the abnormal fluctuation to come again.</p><p></p><p>Merging his mind into it, this time, he felt friction with the surrounding obstacles instead of hitting a wall directly like before.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of being cut by a knife emerged deep within his spiritual body. Li Fan endured the pain, gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>As the ripples pushed deeper, the "incompatibility" with the surroundings became more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>The cutting sensation gradually turned into a violent tearing, almost causing Li Fan to lose consciousness instantly.</p><p></p><p>Triggered by his primal protection instinct, he broke free from the state of unification of his mind and soul.</p><p></p><p>"Phew…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan breathed heavily, his body soaked with sweat from the pain.</p><p></p><p>Even though he didn't merge with the ripples, the pain of his soul being torn felt as real as ever.</p><p></p><p>After the time it took for two "thousand-motion ripples" to pass, the feeling in his soul slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Relieved, Li Fan hesitated for a moment. However, when the next "thousand-motion ripples" arrived, he immersed himself again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he seemed to endure a bit longer than the last time, or perhaps it was just his illusion.</p><p></p><p>Taking a short break and not waiting for the pain to completely fade away, Li Fan once again merged his mind into the ripples.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face contorted, and his body twitched continuously due to the pain affecting his spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>A hint of fierceness flashed in his eyes, and the thoughts of "giving up" that surfaced in his mind were instantly dispelled by the reverse training method of the Xuan Huang Refining Heart Spell.</p><p></p><p>"Could a mere pain stop me?"</p><p></p><p>"Bring it on!"</p><p></p><p>In the process of attempting to ride the "thousand-motion ripples" to the depths of the void again and again, Li Fan endured unbearable verbal torment.</p><p></p><p>The pain in his soul kept escalating, from tearing to a sensation of being stabbed all over and enduring constant crushing.</p><p></p><p>Only the obsession in his heart kept him going, preventing him from giving up halfway through.</p><p></p><p>In this process, the Xuan Huang Refining Heart Spell played a crucial role.</p><p></p><p>Human nature tends to choose to escape from pain. Especially in a scenario where the soul is seemingly tortured, thoughts like "Forget it," "Why bother," or "It's not necessary at all" would naturally surface in Li Fan's mind every second.</p><p></p><p>All these thoughts that could have shaken Li Fan's resolve were turned into nourishment for his soul under the effect of the Xuan Huang Refining Heart Spell.</p><p></p><p>Without this support, even if Li Fan's will was strong, he likely wouldn't have been able to endure the torture.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Li Fan ultimately succeeded.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time had passed, when he regained consciousness from the state of his mind, he found himself in a mysterious yet somewhat familiar space.</p><p></p><p>In this space, lines intersected in all directions, with various colored particles moving swiftly along them.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, particles collided in mid-air, erupting into a dazzling rainbow of light before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first checked his body. Surprisingly, it seemed to be drawn with rough lines, comical yet bizarre.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no difference in the sensations his body felt compared to his normal physical state.</p><p></p><p>Avoiding the colorful particles whistling by, Li Fan carefully observed this magical space.</p><p></p><p>"It seems somewhat similar to the Tian Xuan Mirror space I saw before."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Tian Xuan Mirror only had black and white colors, unlike here, with a variety of colors."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I remember…"</p><p></p><p>With a sudden realization, Li Fan retrieved the images stored in the Hua Dao Shi and carefully reviewed them.</p><p></p><p>He noticed that at the edge of the black and white world in the images, there was a presence of colorful brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The black and white and colorful seemed to represent two different opposing energies.</p><p></p><p>In the black and white world, the colorful brilliance was separated and transformed into a part of itself.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Xuan Newborn Mirror…"</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, Li Fan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, his own speculation began to form.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the black and white world represented the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>And the colorful brilliance likely symbolized a condensed version of the real world.</p><p></p><p>The crisscrossing lines represented the various laws of the real world, much like the principles of the world seen through the Ren Dao Xingchen.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Xuan Mirror interprets the real world in its way…"</p><p></p><p>"And here…"</p><p></p><p>A hint of realization flickered in Li Fan's eyes.</p>

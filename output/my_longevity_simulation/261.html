            <p>Li Fan remained motionless within the Tianxuan Mirror, quietly awaiting the outcome.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, the exploration of the ruins had yet to make any significant progress.</p><p></p><p>However, He Zhenghao eagerly sent a message in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Li Fan, I have good news."</p><p></p><p>"After some maneuvering on my part, I've secured three potential positions, each located in a different province."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please advise me on this matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately replied, "Oh? Do tell."</p><p></p><p>"The first one is the leader of the Martial Arts Hall in Taihua Province."</p><p></p><p>"Taihua Province is not far from the Congyun Sea. A mountain range called Taihua spans the entire province, earning it the nickname 'the province on the back of the mountains.'"</p><p></p><p>"Countless peaks stand tall. If I go to this province, my cultivation speed will be much faster compared to the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The second one is a consultant position at the Strategy Formation Hall in Qingwei Province."</p><p></p><p>"Qingwei Province is located south of Tianyu Province. Although it's still quite far, it's much closer compared to the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The third one is city guardian in Tianyun Province," He Zhenghao concluded.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun Province is not far west of Tianyu Province. Therefore, the competition for this position is extremely fierce."</p><p></p><p>"The transfer would only be to an equivalent city guardian position."</p><p></p><p>"The advantage is that it's closer to the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, making promotions a bit easier compared to other places."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao slowly revealed the results of his efforts during this period.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun Province..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment before replying, "Let's not rush to make a decision. I have an acquainted cultivator in Tianyun Province. I'll inquire on your behalf and see if we can take it a step further."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was quite surprised upon hearing this. "Fellow Daoist, you actually have connections in Tianyun Province?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I can't guarantee it. Let's give it a try. Fellow Daoist, wait for my news," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao repeatedly agreed.</p><p></p><p>So, Li Fan contacted Shenyu Zi and explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you have any means to help?"</p><p></p><p>Shenyu Zi simply replied, "I'll ask around for you."</p><p></p><p>And then there was no further response.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't in a hurry and patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, a cultivator named Jingxuan Daoren requested to add Li Fan as a friend.</p><p></p><p>He was also from Tianyun Province.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred, and he quickly accepted.</p><p></p><p>Jingxuan's hearty voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you must be Junior Li Fan? I heard from Shenyu that you have a good friend who wants to take up a position in our Tianyun Province?"</p><p></p><p>"Fourth-stage Golden Core, tsk tsk, the younger generation is truly formidable."</p><p></p><p>"How about this? Ask him if he's interested in joining our Tianyun Province Garrison Institute."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, due to that great war a few years ago, there are still some vacant positions that haven't been filled."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly startled and couldn't help but ask, "Senior Jingxuan, may I ask about this Garrison Institute..."</p><p></p><p>Jingxuan was also taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Li Fan to be unaware of what the Garrison Institute was.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon realized that Li Fan came from a remote area and understood, explaining, "The Garrison Institute is an organization unique to the heartland of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It reports directly to the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, and its main responsibility is to suppress evil and maintain stability in the heartland."</p><p></p><p>"When necessary, it will also follow emergency orders to engage in battles in other provinces."</p><p></p><p>With Jingxuan's explanation, Li Fan understood.</p><p></p><p>In essence, it was similar to the garrison camp stationed outside Xuanjing City in Daxuan, which only listened to Li Fan's orders and guarded the safety of the capital.</p><p></p><p>"It should be considered an important position."</p><p></p><p>"However, it seems to involve frequent battles. I don't know if He Zhenghao, with his current temperament, would be willing to agree."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan bid farewell to Jingxuan and contacted He Zhenghao, explaining the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Garrison Institute?" This time, He Zhenghao was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>In his youth, he had spent some time in Tianyu Province, so he naturally understood what the Garrison Institute was.</p><p></p><p>Like the Dharma Protector Hall, they were both institutions that directly took orders from the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Only below the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Li Fan is truly unfathomable, actually being able to secure this position."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit dangerous, but..."</p><p></p><p>A graceful figure suddenly flashed through He Zhenghao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He immediately gritted his teeth and agreed.</p><p></p><p>After learning of He Zhenghao's determination, Li Fan also relayed the information to Jingxuan Daoren.</p><p></p><p>"Great!" Jingxuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Have your friend come to our Tianyun Province first and serve as a city guardian."</p><p></p><p>"After three years of accumulating experience, I will use my connections to transfer him into the Garrison Institute."</p><p></p><p>Next, Jingxuan carefully explained some precautions before ending the communication.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, now in a quiet state, thought for a moment. Although the matter had not been fully resolved, he still transferred 100,000 contribution points each to Shenyu Zi and Jingxuan.</p><p></p><p>As a gesture of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this expense was recorded under He Zhenghao's account.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianyun Province.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the contribution points, Shenyu Zi was slightly startled and laughed in silence.</p><p></p><p>Jingxuan immediately sent a message inquiring, "Old Shenyu, did you receive the contribution point transfer from Junior Li? 100,000 contribution points! I remember he's only at the Foundation Establishment stage, right? Such a generous gesture!"</p><p></p><p>Shenyu Zi replied with a smile, "In any case, it's much more generous than when we were at the Foundation Establishment stage."</p><p></p><p>"I merely passed on a message and received the same reward as you. Jingxuan, you won't be angry, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jingxuan laughed heartily, "Hahaha, treating us equally, this little kid is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. I find him more pleasing to the eye than that old man Guangwu."</p><p></p><p>"Mess it up? Who are you looking down on?" Jingxuan snorted coldly and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, He Zhenghao's appointment order arrived.</p><p></p><p>There were no major issues.</p><p></p><p>City guardian of Guang'an City, Tianyun Province.</p><p></p><p>For this, a total of 80,000 contribution points were spent from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was borrowed from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, He Zhenghao's debts didn't weigh him down, and he had no mental burden.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also generous, lending as much as needed.</p><p></p><p>Before departing, He Zhenghao made a solemn vow.</p><p></p><p>Once he had a stable footing in Tianyun Province, he would try to arrange for Li Fan to be transferred there as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't say much and simply patted He Zhenghao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>After He Zhenghao left, Li Fan hid in the Tianxuan Mirror all day, not going out at all, and diligently cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Soon, time arrived at the 23rd year of the Maoding Era.</p><p></p><p>The ruins that had risen into the sky were finally discovered.</p><p></p><p>They had fallen into a thousand-mile swamp in the center of Jiushan Province.</p><p></p><p>As cultivators began exploring the ruins, the origins of these ruins were also unearthed.</p><p></p><p>The ancient immortal sect, Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although not as renowned as Taishang or Dadao Sect, whose prestige remained well-known even thousands of years later, it was still a famous and prominent sect before the great calamity descended.</p><p></p><p>Based on previous experiences of exploring sect ruins, there were definitely abundant treasures stored here.</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, it immediately attracted many cultivators to venture to Jiushan Province for exploration.</p><p></p><p>Jiushan Province, which was already in a state of chaos, became even more turbulent.</p><p></p><p>The extent of their arrogance was evident.</p><p></p><p>The weakness of the Wanxian Alliance's control over Jiushan Province could also be seen.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it was just a normal ruins exploration, and the Wanxian Alliance had no intention of interfering too much.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, a piece of news arrived, causing the Wanxian Alliance to be furious.</p><p></p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator named Luo Xi from the Five Elders Council came to explore the ruins, which was fine.</p><p></p><p>However, not only did he not conceal his identity as a cultivator from the Five Elders Council, he even relied on his profound cultivation to injure and kill many exploration members of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After entering the ruins and obtaining unknown treasures, he left with his head held high.</p><p></p><p>On my turf, and still being so arrogant?</p><p></p><p>It was simply a slap in the face.</p><p></p><p>However, suspicions also arose.</p><p></p><p>Such behavior carried a clear provocative intent.</p><p></p><p>Could there be some hidden scheme?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Five Elders Council wanted to start another war?</p><p></p><p>Regardless, face could not be lost.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance swiftly dispatched several Nascent Soul cultivators to Jiushan Province to maintain order.</p><p></p><p>And they issued a stern warning.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators from the Five Elders Council were prohibited from coming to Jiushan Province.</p><p></p><p>Those who dared to come would face death!</p>

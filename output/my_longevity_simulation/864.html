        <h1>Chapter 864</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Although one could rival a Harmonious Dao Realm cultivator after advancing to the Nascent Soul stage, Li Fan did not act too arrogantly during this sensitive time when the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Society were on the verge of conflict.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light was too eye-catching, so Li Fan simply consumed more spiritual power to condense the seven colors into a faint white light, just as he had done before when destroying the yellow one-eyed paper man.</p><p></p><p>Flying at low altitude while using secret techniques to conceal his aura, his speed was astonishingly fast, crossing the Tianling State in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>Facing the obstruction of the white fog barrier ahead, he charged straight through without dodging or evading!</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored Jade Void Flowing Light was extremely domineering and intolerant of external objects.</p><p></p><p>Even this mysterious white fog that could devour one's lifespan was unable to find any gaps to invade and could only linger outside.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the nearly inexhaustible pure spiritual energy of the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, Li Fan was able to fully utilize the seven-colored divine light's speed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Before setting off, he had notified Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>The two arrived at Shilin State almost simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"The escape technique of the seven-colored divine light is not much slower than rapidly shuttling through the earth veins!" Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>With this, his shortcoming of fleeing was compensated for. In the future, when encountering life-threatening crises, he wouldn't always have to think about using the Huan Zhen technique, but could try escaping first.</p><p></p><p>"Master." Lin Ling sensed the earth-shattering changes in Li Fan and couldn't help but be surprised as she looked him up and down.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go." Li Fan gazed into the distance at the array of cultivators gathered at the border of Shilin and Jiushan States and instructed.</p><p></p><p>During the time he was in closed-door cultivation for advancement, due to being misled by the false information he provided, the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Society had already had some minor frictions in the bordering states.</p><p></p><p>There were also varying degrees of unrest appearing in both of their hinterlands.</p><p></p><p>Now, the protective arrays of each state had been continuously activated.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because the mole within the Strategy Formation Hall had not been found, the protective grand array this time was the [God Annihilation Array], which had never appeared before and was newly created by the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>The name sounded quite domineering.</p><p></p><p>The actual effect was indeed remarkable.</p><p></p><p>The usually infallible Terminal Dissociation Disc was unable to break this array formation for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly: "It seems to be more than just a simple array formation. There are also some cultivators with considerable strength acting as the array eyes within the God Annihilation Array to make up for possible flaws in the formation."</p><p></p><p>In the results deduced by the Dissociation Disc, even if a cultivator suppressing the array at a certain point was defeated, as long as the complete structure of the array remained, it could quickly regenerate a new array formation by drawing power from other parts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this newly generated array formation would have changes compared to before.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the God Annihilation Array will continue to increase as the cultivators presiding over the array formation become stronger."</p><p></p><p>"If there are four Harmonious Dao Realm cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>"Then only a Longevity Celestial Venerate can break it."</p><p></p><p>This was the conclusion reached by the analysis of the Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the array formation only covered the territory, sky, and shallow surface of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Ling's guidance, Li Fan passed through the Wanxian Alliance's defensive line and arrived in Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiushan also had a tense atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that the Five Elders Society had constructed on the nine mountain peaks...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Many fortresses were built.</p><p></p><p>Like a black sphere buried underground, only the topmost arc was exposed.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of the black spherical fortress, there seemed to be a faint red dot.</p><p></p><p>It kept moving around.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan's gaze fell upon it, this red dot immediately sensed it and stared back.</p><p></p><p>A faint sense of crisis surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, it quickly disappeared as the locked-on red dot moved away.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be because Lin Ling had already sent out the contact signal.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for the other party to arrive, Li Fan observed Jiu Shan State.</p><p></p><p>It had nothing to do with the Wulao Society's defense line arrangement. Li Fan was just trying to see if he could find traces of the Duyao Sect's yellow paper men here again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the short-lived effect brought by destroying the paper men had disappeared. Li Fan looked carefully for a long time but couldn't find where those hidden talisman papers were concealed.</p><p></p><p>"Although out of sight, out of mind, there's always a bit of a mental knot." Li Fan frowned to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was pondering, a figure suddenly appeared from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Traversing a thousand miles in an instant, in the next moment, the figure appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous contact person, the one who came to negotiate this time was a young cultivator with a righteous aura and a scholarly appearance.</p><p></p><p>Oddly enough, this scholar had a stone tablet on his back.</p><p></p><p>The text on it seemed to be concealed by some kind of power, making the content unclear.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the two Taoist friends from the Alliance." The scholar politely bowed with a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>"Actually unable to discern his cultivation level." Li Fan's heart trembled, not daring to be negligent.</p><p></p><p>"This Taoist friend seems unfamiliar. Where is the previous one?"</p><p></p><p>"Some time ago, the Wanxian League launched a surprise attack. He unfortunately lost his life." The scholar said calmly, but his face showed no grief.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing if it was true or false, Li Fan didn't care about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Only then did a trace of surprise appear on the scholar's face.</p><p></p><p>However, he reacted quickly: "Although it was a transaction before, we indeed benefited greatly. If there are any difficulties, please feel free to speak."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced left and right, then set up a formation to isolate the myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>Then, lowering his voice, he quietly said, "Not long ago, after one of our Alliance's elders came out of seclusion, he suddenly discovered something that shocked him greatly."</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanhuang realm is actually filled with one-eyed little men made of yellow talisman paper."</p><p></p><p>"Not only in the Xuanhuang realm itself but also in the surrounding small worlds, it's all this stuff."</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of being watched all the time is really terrible. But we've tried many methods, and none can eliminate these talisman papers..."</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, Taoist friend, do you have any good strategies?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke slowly, he observed the other party's reaction.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that the scholar had no special reaction to the statement about the talisman paper men, Li Fan knew.</p><p></p><p>This person's identity was certainly not simple and should have known about the existence of the Duyao Sect's talisman papers long ago.</p><p></p><p>The scholar with the stone tablet on his back said with a serious expression, "There are indeed quite a few methods that can thoroughly clean up these talisman papers. However, the price is a bit high. It's not recommended for you to do so."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet on the scholar's back emitted an almost imperceptible cyan light. He paused and added, "This [Observing World Divine Eye] has almost merged into the fundamental laws of the Xuanhuang realm. If they are all completely swept away, it will inevitably cause immeasurable harm to the Xuanhuang realm as well." At this point, the scholar's meaning was already very clear.</p>

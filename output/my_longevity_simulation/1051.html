            <p>Chapter 1049: The Renegade Dharma Transmitter</p><p></p><p>"To be able to spend 200,000 contribution points to buy her statue, it seems that this Jia Yiyuan was also saved by this 'Savior Fairy'."</p><p></p><p>"And his strength is not bad, he's quite confident in himself. Not afraid that there might be some tricks with the statue..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that he encountered me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan noticed that the methods he left on the statue were gradually being removed, and the sensory image was slowly becoming blurred.</p><p></p><p>However, these methods were just superficial.</p><p></p><p>His true connection with the statue was still through the Faceless True Immortal's essence of source power.</p><p></p><p>That was a power beyond the mortal realm, and Li Fan was not afraid that anyone could remove it.</p><p></p><p>Although the image was a bit blurry, Li Fan could still vaguely see the situation on the statue's side.</p><p></p><p>Jia Yiyuan was seen coming to a cave abode in Jiushan Prefecture, sitting cross-legged in a secret room.</p><p></p><p>His expression was solemn, and he was muttering something.</p><p></p><p>Then, an invisible fluctuation was generated out of thin air, and space was torn open, creating a rift. Jia Yiyuan strode into it.</p><p></p><p>The sensory connection instantly became even weaker.</p><p></p><p>Only vague shadows and intermittent sounds could be seen and heard.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhou's identity has somehow been exposed, go and investigate."</p><p></p><p>"That shop should have something strange about it."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, Senior Zhou has saved dozens more people to come in. I didn't expect that after so many years, the Myriad Immortal Alliance still hasn't given up on hunting us down."</p><p></p><p>"Unwarranted disaster? What's the use of saying these things at this time? No matter what, we are now in a fight to the death with the Myriad Immortal Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>The tone carried a bone-chilling hatred, arousing a chorus of agreement.</p><p></p><p>"They disregard the lives of our cultivators as if we were mere grass, casually cleaning us up. They don't care about the truth at all... Those people are not worthy of the title of Dharma Transmitters!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Only someone like Senior Zhou is a true Dharma Transmitter!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmitter, Zhou?" The information transmitted from the statue surprised Li Fan a bit.</p><p></p><p>In the information Moru Bin had given earlier, there didn't seem to be such a person among the Dharma Transmitters in power in the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Senior Zhou chose to part ways with them back then, unable to tolerate their actions."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, actually if she hadn't left the Immortal Alliance back then, she might have been able to argue based on reason and change the Immortal Alliance's extermination order."</p><p></p><p>Many voices discussed one after another, and Li Fan also learned the ins and outs of the matter by eavesdropping.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that 500 years ago, this Dharma Transmitter Zhou, due to disagreements with the ideals of the Dharma Transmitters Jiang and others in power in the Immortal Alliance, chose to voluntarily leave the Dharma Transmitter Council.</p><p></p><p>Although she had left the highest level of power in the Immortal Alliance, she was still a Dharma Transmitter after all.</p><p></p><p>She still had resources that ordinary people could hardly imagine.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Myriad Immortal Alliance's pursuit is so severe, they've almost turned over every inch of land, yet they still can't find any traces of the survivors."</p><p></p><p>"The private worlds of Dharma Transmitters, even if they wanted to investigate, they would be powerless."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and did not choose to startle the snake by hitting the grass directly.</p><p></p><p>Although he had found clues to the survivors, the involvement of existences at the level of Dharma Transmitters made Li Fan become a bit more cautious.</p><p></p><p>After suffering a hidden loss with Moru Bin, Li Fan deeply understood that those who could survive in the Xuanhuang Realm for over a thousand years...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>None of them were easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the existence of the Dharma transmitters who stood at the pinnacle of power in the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"However, if she is really as she appears to be..."</p><p></p><p>"Then our positions may be consistent. We can try to make private contact first."</p><p></p><p>Based on the investigation results over the past five years, Li Fan could almost be certain that on that day, Mo Rubin had escaped with the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It was not only because of the extremely bloody revenge of the Myriad Immortal Alliance afterwards, but also because the Tianxuan Mirror had many problems in the past five years.</p><p></p><p>At first, the transaction module malfunctioned for some unknown reason. It led to abnormalities in the transaction amounts of millions of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators demanded an explanation to no avail, because the Myriad Immortal Alliance directly announced the closure of the Tianxuan Mirror's transaction module.</p><p></p><p>Recently, there have been rumors circulating among the people. It is said that the living space of the cultivators in the Tianxuan Mirror will be cancelled.</p><p></p><p>This has caused the cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance to panic and frantically grab the idle cave abodes in various states.</p><p></p><p>The price of cave abodes in ordinary states has almost doubled in just three months, even in remote corners like Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the four central states.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Alliance officials quickly came forward to refute the rumors, when the transaction function of the Tianxuan Mirror was closed before, the Immortal Alliance had also issued similar announcements.</p><p></p><p>This also led to more of a confirmation of the rumors.</p><p></p><p>The price of cave abodes is soaring day by day, and there seems to be no end in sight.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror's clone once said that after he escaped, he would leave behind a sub-body that could replace the main body to complete the vast majority of work."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that after all, it still cannot be compared to a real immortal artifact. Over time, various problems will arise."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"Or, has something happened to the main body of the Tianxuan Mirror? Thus affecting this replica?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly denied this speculation.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Rubin and the Tianxuan Mirror seem to have evaporated from the Xuanhuang Realm in the past five years, leaving no trace."</p><p></p><p>"Not only me, but the Myriad Immortal Alliance is also tracking their whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"Yet they still remain hidden."</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt couldn't help but arise in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>He even began to suspect whether they had already left the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Their goal is to find the Xuantian King."</p><p></p><p>"If they are already in the Xuantian King's hiding place, perhaps it would make sense."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Xuantian King disappeared for so many years, he has never been discovered. If he is really still alive, then he must be in an extremely secret place."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the Huadao stone crystal body was rapidly rotating, integrating various clues collected over the past five years.</p><p></p><p>Trying to find some traces.</p><p></p><p>"If something exists, it must leave traces. I don't believe you can hide for a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"If all else fails..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of fierceness flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The phantom image of the Book of Tribulation slowly appeared in the void in front of him, following his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Outside the countless changing silhouettes, there were small seven-colored light spheres floating.</p><p></p><p>Inside the light spheres, there seemed to be a yellow unknown substance slowly flowing.</p><p></p><p>The Book of Tribulation seemed to sense the crisis, and the speed of flipping and transforming had already reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, let's talk nicely. Why the murderous intent again?"</p><p></p><p>A paper man suddenly floated out from the Book of Tribulation, looked at those seven-colored light spheres with great trepidation, and slowly persuaded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly and ignored him.</p><p></p><p>The paper man sighed with a bitter look on his face, as if he was already used to it.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1037</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan had met Gongsun Qixuan a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>In the following few lifetimes, it seemed that this person's shadow was always behind the anomalies in the Profound Net.</p><p></p><p>Including in this lifetime, he was inexplicably transferred into the Wanxian Alliance's Strategy Hall headquarters to participate in the development of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation...</p><p></p><p>All of these indicated that Gongsun Qixuan was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>After communicating with the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar a few times, Li Fan also had some understanding of Gongsun Qixuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>He was the observation subject and human template when the Tianxuan Mirror created human avatars.</p><p></p><p>As for why Gongsun Qixuan was chosen among the many cultivators in the Wanxian Alliance, the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar explained that it was random, a matter of luck.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Fan did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>According to his memories and observations, Gongsun Qixuan's temperament indeed bore some resemblance to the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even suspected that he might be another human avatar of the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>If one searched for information about this person in the Tianxuan Mirror, everything seemed normal on the surface. But if one dug a little deeper, one could discover that all the intelligence was fabricated.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to work at the Congyun Sea, his whereabouts were a complete mystery, unknown to anyone.</p><p></p><p>As if discovering Li Fan secretly peeking, Gongsun Qixuan glanced at the sky almost imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly withdrew his gaze, lightly coughed, and began directing his subordinates to handle the bizarre incident.</p><p></p><p>The handling method was also very peculiar. He took out a small straw doll woven from withered grass from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>He threw it into the air.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the subordinates of the Heavenly Mechanism Hall very tacitly placed smaller straw dolls in various corners of the area where the bizarre incident erupted.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's observation, he discovered that the bizarre dark forces did not corrode these Heavenly Mechanism Hall cultivators who had rashly barged in.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were deeply attracted by the small straw dolls they held.</p><p></p><p>Like long dragons, they were siphoned into the straw dolls' bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately became interested.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful examination, Li Fan discovered that these straw dolls each seemed to have their own lives. As the dark forces surged in, their faces showed different expressions such as strange laughter, pain, anger, and so on.</p><p></p><p>One could even hear faint rustling sounds from them.</p><p></p><p>These straw dolls acted as nodes, absorbing the dark forces and then transforming them into the largest straw doll in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The operation to clear the bizarre incident lasted for three days.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the bizarre forces that had spread in this area completely disappeared, and the normal Profound Realm's Dao once again gained the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>When Gongsun Qixuan retrieved the straw doll in mid-air, something that made Li Fan's pupils constrict occurred.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, it seemed like Gongsun Qixuan put the straw doll back into his bosom.</p><p></p><p>He was more like opening a huge mouth and fiercely swallowing the straw doll.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan felt that Gongsun Qixuan was shrouded in a layer of darkness.</p><p></p><p>And his coughing became more and more frequent.</p><p></p><p>It only slightly improved when he rushed to the next location where a bizarre incident erupted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Gongsun Qixuan did not use straw dolls for all bizarre incidents.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority, after detailed investigations determined that there was no risk of spreading, Gongsun Qixuan ordered people to seal off the location of the bizarre eruption and leave it at that.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, watching from the cloud, pondered: "For those with minor harm, wait for the Profound Yellow Realm's Dao to naturally complete the digestion. As for those that will intensify if not controlled, use..."</p><p></p><p>The paper man absorbed it into his own body."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's eyes now, Gongsun Qixuan had become a collection of various bizarre entities.</p><p></p><p>Many twisted and chaotic rules were intertwined within him, making one shudder without feeling cold.</p><p></p><p>If he were to die suddenly and these bizarre entities inside him were to erupt all at once, I'm afraid that the living beings in several states would be instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder every time I see this guy, I feel something strange."</p><p></p><p>"Containing the Dao within the body..."</p><p></p><p>"This is probably not something that a cultivator's body can do."</p><p></p><p>A trace of wariness flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and he distanced himself a little further while following.</p><p></p><p>He also recalled that Gongsun Qixuan was able to truly deduce the future just based on the nonsense Li Fan made up about the "Heavenly Mysterious Soul Lock and Returning to the Unity of Mysterious and Yellow".</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan had a guess about Gongsun Qixuan's true identity.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror wants to imitate a human avatar. With its arrogant attitude as an immortal artifact, how could it truly observe and learn from ordinary humans?"</p><p></p><p>"And to accomplish something, the easiest way is to find precedents and learn from predecessors..."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of insight flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and numerous clues suddenly converged.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, the object of learning for an immortal artifact should also be an existence that has successfully transformed into a human and is also an immortal artifact!"</p><p></p><p>"Gongsun Qixuan should be one of the immortal artifacts that had disappeared in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, taking on human form!"</p><p></p><p>Judging from the Yin-Yang Bone Hand that Ou Shangtian possessed earlier, which might be the remains of an immortal.</p><p></p><p>Everything within the Mysterious Yellow Realm is participating in the operation of the Heavenly Dao and the cycle of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Taking on human form, either becoming a wonder of heaven, or..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly had a slight understanding of how the Dharma Transmitter Jiang's almost heaven-defying abilities came about.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it also comes from the transformation of immortal artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>Having figured out the key points, Li Fan's gaze towards Gongsun Qixuan was now completely different.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the wariness, there was a hint of greed, as well as a bit of caution and vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Immortal artifacts, as long as they are tainted with the word "immortal", are existences that absolutely cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Gongsun Qixuan had already fallen into the sight of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, and was even more like a ticking time bomb with countless bizarre entities attached to him, ready to explode at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a rare treasure, it can be seen but not touched."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently for a long time, but eventually sighed softly and slowly withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in this world, we are currently in a cooperative relationship with the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror. The main task is still to sever the web of true immortals first."</p><p></p><p>"No rush. I have already discovered his true identity. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future..."</p><p></p><p>The desire in Li Fan's eyes slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, Gongsun Qixuan below had a slight frown on his brows, seeming to have sensed something.</p><p></p><p>He made calculations with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't figure out the reason.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of his interactions with Gongsun Qixuan once again surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that his original form might have been an immortal artifact related to deduction."</p><p></p><p>"But judging from his current performance, it seems that after transforming into a human, his power has diminished quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>"However, this does give me some inspiration."</p><p></p><p>"In the Mysterious Yellow Realm, there are still many secrets waiting to be uncovered."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, there were quite a few existences close to immortal artifacts. Not to mention the fusion of many cultivation realms. With so many worlds, could there really be no existences of the same caliber?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Dharma Transmitter took away a portion of them, there should still be some that slipped through the net."</p>

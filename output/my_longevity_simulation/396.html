        <div class="content">
            <p>After a moment of dizziness, Xiao Heng was shocked to see the scene around him clearly. The White Bone First Sentient Realm was a mess, with traces of battles everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The magnificent scenery had become somewhat ruined at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Skull..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng's heart tightened, hurrying towards the place where Elder Skull was in hibernation.</p><p></p><p>However, as he approached, the signs of the battle became more prominent.</p><p></p><p>The white bones, once smooth and clean, were now pockmarked and pitted.</p><p></p><p>An ominous feeling grew stronger as Xiao Heng rushed over, and he was completely stunned when he arrived.</p><p></p><p>As if a violent explosion had occurred, there was no trace of Elder Skull left.</p><p></p><p>There was only a dark, deep pit, telling of a recent fierce battle that seemed to have taken place here.</p><p></p><p>"What happened exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng's expression turned grim.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance has caught up?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Elder Skull's instructions before his slumber, Xiao Heng subconsciously thought so.</p><p></p><p>Having been active in Stone Linzhou for more than a decade, Xiao Heng was no longer the ignorant youth about the world of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, his heart grew even colder.</p><p></p><p>When cultivating his Qi, he dared to say the resounding words, "Destroy the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, restore the glory of the Immortal Realm; we have an obligation."</p><p></p><p>But now at the Golden Core Realm, he no longer dared to boast so boldly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder's instructions were that if he couldn't be contacted, it means this place has been exposed. For safety's sake, we must quickly destroy the Hand Bone to sever all connections with this place," although there was some reluctance in his heart, Xiao Heng was not indecisive.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he searched the First Sentient Realm one last time.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng unexpectedly discovered that the bone altar in the Secret Realm seemed to have not been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>There were still faint familiar fluctuations emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Something moved in Xiao Heng's heart, and he called out as he had prayed before.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Skull!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Elder Skull's figure indeed appeared above the altar ruins.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng was extremely excited, but in an instant, he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Because what stood before him was only a mirage.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao kid, I didn't have time to say goodbye to you. New 69 Book Bar - 69𝒔𝒉𝒖𝒙.𝒄𝒐𝒎"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that even hidden here for so long, they still haven't given up on their plans for me."</p><p></p><p>"If you can see this image, it means something unfortunate has happened to me."</p><p></p><p>Even though mentally prepared, hearing Elder Skull say it himself at this moment, Xiao Heng's eyes couldn't help but redden.</p><p></p><p>"...Although I led them away, preventing your exposure."</p><p></p><p>"But this place is no longer safe."</p><p></p><p>"After you go back, cut off all contact with here, and never come back."</p><p></p><p>"I left four mini Medicine King Cauldrons for you in the altar."</p><p></p><p>"They are keys to entering the true Medicine King Cauldron."</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years ago, the Master of the Medicine King Sect, Liu Ruchen, led all members of the sect to cross boundaries. But a dozen years ago, I sensed their return to the Xuanhuang Realm. It was that fire meteor that illuminated the sky and ultimately fell into the depths of the Cangwu Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"If everything goes as expected, something must have happened to the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>"However, I sense a great opportunity in the true Medicine King Cauldron."</p><p></p><p>"If you have the chance, you can explore it."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, there should be other mini Medicine King Cauldrons lost out there. Perhaps others can locate each other's positions through secret methods using the mini Medicine King Cauldrons."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful about your safety. If necessary, selling the mini Medicine King Cauldrons for a good price isn't a bad idea."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, there are some items I scavenged stored in the mini Medicine King Cauldrons. Remember to retrieve them."</p><p></p><p>"Consider it my final gift."</p>

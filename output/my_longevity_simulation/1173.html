        <h1>Chapter 1173</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"However, the source power that fellow Daoist gave me seems to be, compared to what is normally obtained through cultivation, more..." </p><p></p><p>"More advanced?" Baihua Daoren asked slowly after carefully choosing his words.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally wouldn't tell Baihua that the reason this source power's effect far surpassed the ordinary was because he wanted to use the power of the faith of all living beings to sublimate the source power into source power essence. </p><p></p><p>However, all current attempts ended in failure. </p><p></p><p>After all, even for an existence abandoned by true immortals, it was still a power that transcended the mundane. It was not so easy to control.</p><p></p><p>"It's just fellow Daoist's misconception. How is your recovery? If it's about done, let's hit the road soon." Li Ping said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren smiled awkwardly, having no other choice. He could only sigh and bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>"After ensuring the absolute safety of the headquarters, we can consider conquering other small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Knowing the specific locations of each small world like the back of my hand, I can even directly lurk in first and move the entrance to the void near Daqi."</p><p></p><p>"Lingmu, the Empire..."</p><p></p><p>"And the Youkai Realm."</p><p></p><p>Just as Sacred Emperor Li Ping returned to the Sacred Emperor's seat, sitting in contemplation of the future direction of the Sacred Dynasty,</p><p></p><p>His disciple Sun Erlang sought an audience.</p><p></p><p>"Um, Master. An item fished out of the fishing pond earlier..." Sun Erlang looked a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Speak freely."</p><p></p><p>Then Sun Erlang recounted the whole story.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that since the end of the last fishing tournament, those anglers who ultimately obtained rewards were basically all absorbed by various institutions of the Sacred Dynasty. </p><p></p><p>And among them, a middle-aged man named Quan Ruochu was valued by Sun Erlang and taken under his command.</p><p></p><p>What he fished out of the pond was a white glowing orb.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Ping personally inspected it. It was an ordinary object called "Youlan Dark Flower" at most Foundation Establishment level quality, so he didn't pay much attention.</p><p></p><p>But now, according to Sun Erlang, this Youlan Dark Flower, which on the surface was at most Nascent Soul level quality, displayed abilities completely defying common sense after Quan Ruochu carefully cultivated it for some time.</p><p></p><p>"Although Quan Ruochu is already middle-aged, he has accomplished nothing in life. His parents are deceased and he has no wife or children. In his life, he only loves fishing and tending to flowers, with an indifferent temperament and not much ambition. So after fishing up the white glowing orb, he wasn't very disappointed. He even loved this Youlan Dark Flower more than other treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Originally thinking this Youlan Dark Flower was like normal flowers, growing in soil nourished by spiritual energy, no matter how meticulously Quan Ruochu cared for it after planting, it always remained on the verge of withering away. Deeply loving the flower, in order to save this Youlan Dark Flower, Quan Ruochu actually did something unimaginable." Sun Erlang bowed his head and spoke to the Sacred Emperor in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"He actually planted the Youlan Dark Flower in his own body! Using his own flesh as soil, irrigating it with his essence and blood..."</p><p></p><p>"In just a few days, he went from a fairly robust man to skin and bones, his breath as weak as a floating thread! But he still didn't give up, still intending to irrigate it with his last bit of heart's blood."</p><p></p><p>"When I went to look for him after not seeing him for a few days, this was the scene I encountered."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's voice was low and heavy: "I originally wanted to directly eliminate this demonic flower, but Quan Ruochu used his own life to threaten me, saying the flower lives, he lives; the flower dies, he dies..."</p><p></p><p>"And considering this was after all a treasure bestowed by Master, I hesitated and didn't take action. But</p><p></p><p>As Quan Ruochu's body grew weaker and death approached, his disciples could no longer remain indifferent.</p><p></p><p>The moment Sun Erlang spoke, Li Ping had already locked onto Quan Ruochu's location and carefully examined his internal condition. </p><p></p><p>After waiting for Sun Erlang to finish speaking, Li Ping shook his head, his tone stern.</p><p></p><p>"Erlang, you have disappointed me greatly."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's body trembled slightly, his head bowing even lower.</p><p></p><p>"As a commander, one should lead the entire army, not waver emotionally for an individual or even a few dozen to a hundred people."</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time you've actively sought me out since joining my sect, right? And it's merely for this matter?"</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Sun Erlang said hoarsely, "Master sees clearly. If Shana had died instantly, I might have remained unmoved. But to watch helplessly as a familiar person's life is slowly drained and withered away, this disciple's heart indeed cannot remain calm."</p><p></p><p>"I still hope Master will punish me."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's voice, rumbling like heavenly thunder, echoed in the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>"My disappointment in you is not only due to your indecisiveness, but more so because you cannot distinguish right from wrong. The Demon Flower..."</p><p></p><p>"Go back and take a careful look again!"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Li Ping expelled Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart tightened at first, but then seemed to understand something. Overjoyed, he hurried to Quan Ruochu's residence.</p><p></p><p>After his master's guidance, Sun Erlang carefully observed again and finally discovered the secret of the Hidden Orchid Flower.</p><p></p><p>Although on the surface, the Hidden Orchid Flower seemed to be constantly devouring Quan Ruochu's essence and blood, it simultaneously differentiated a miraculous power that sustained Quan Ruochu's life force from extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>In this state between life and death, the Hidden Orchid Flower grew and thrived.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Quan Ruochu was slowly undergoing a complete transformation.</p><p></p><p>"His lifeline is entirely dependent on this Hidden Orchid Flower. If I had rashly severed it back then, it would have ended with both the flower and person dead. I nearly made a grave mistake!" Sun Erlang couldn't help feeling a lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Sealing the entrance to prevent any outsiders from disturbing, he also moved a miniature [Heaven and Earth Furnace] nearby to ensure the surrounding spiritual energy density.</p><p></p><p>Only after doing all this did Sun Erlang finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Master's guidance." He said with some gratitude.</p><p></p><p>However, what Sun Erlang didn't know was that while the Hidden Orchid Flower did indeed protect a thread of Quan Ruochu's heart pulse, it wasn't out of gratitude for his planting grace, but merely a survival instinct before finding a new host.</p><p></p><p>And with only Qi Refining stage cultivation, Quan Ruochu simply couldn't withstand the Hidden Orchid Flower's unbridled absorption. His complete death was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was external assistance.</p><p></p><p>As for why he appeared to be in better and better condition, it was purely because Holy Emperor Li Ping had lent a hand.</p><p></p><p>"Right or evil, correct or mistaken."</p><p></p><p>"Before reaching the final outcome, no one can make a proper judgment."</p><p></p><p>"Only by walking step by step to the very end can one vindicate oneself."</p><p></p><p>"The process... is unimportant."</p><p></p><p>Holy Emperor Li Ping sat on the Holy Emperor's seat, his mind slightly fluctuating with thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a certain maze within the endless white fog.</p><p></p><p>"This... just how many frozen corpses are here?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun, brought into the Reverse Life and Death Grand Formation by the Holy Fetus Li Fan, cried out upon seeing the horrifying scene before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>With a glance, the reward for more updates goal has unexpectedly been reached? The boss is muddled!</p>

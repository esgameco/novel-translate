        <h1>Chapter 896</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Heretic!" </p><p></p><p>The young preacher exclaimed in shock, fear, and anger as he saw the wicked smile on the other's face. However, his actions betrayed his true inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>A black, mysterious light enveloped his body. Space seemed to be torn apart as the young man slowly sank into the void, his figure gradually becoming obscure.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense the fear in your heart," the Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect murmured, gazing at the young man before him. "Why do you run? What are you afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>"Face your inner self... Let you... Return to your true self..."</p><p></p><p>The Dharma King's words seemed to contain a strange power. As he chanted softly, a transparent dividing line abruptly appeared between him and the young preacher. </p><p></p><p>The two ends of the dividing line were like the worlds inside and outside a mirror, corresponding to and completely identical to each other. The figures of the Dharma King and the young preacher instantly overlapped.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the same black mysterious light that the young preacher had unleashed also appeared beside the Dharma King, as if he were truly the young man's mirror image!</p><p></p><p>Even when the young man saw this and showed an increasingly frightened expression, the same expression appeared on the Dharma King's face!</p><p></p><p>The dividing line between them brightened a little. After a moment, the area between them seemed to be cut out. The distance between the Dharma King and the young preacher had narrowed considerably.</p><p></p><p>"You forced me to do this!" The young man's heart surged with indescribable panic. He gritted his teeth and said hatefully.</p><p></p><p>Then, a golden thread drilled out from between his eyebrows. This thread seemed to possess a unique power that could not be replicated by the Dharma King. </p><p></p><p>The mirror world that formed did not show the image of the golden thread, causing some disharmony. The mirror world trembled slightly, on the verge of collapse. Even the Dharma King's figure became somewhat blurry.</p><p></p><p>"You and I are originally one," the Dharma King's murmur resounded in the young man's ears at the critical moment. "Do you hate yourself so much that you need to use such a treasure? Why go this far?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's expression changed from ferocious to somewhat dazed, and finally slowly calmed down. Even that golden thread actually retracted back between his eyebrows. The distance between him and the Dharma King shrank again.</p><p></p><p>"Having lived for so long, the road ahead seems hopeless. I can sense the confusion and unwillingness in your heart," the Dharma King whispered incessantly. "After regaining your true self, you will unleash your hidden supreme potential. The Great Dao is within reach..."</p><p></p><p>As the Dharma King continued, the young man and he became closer and closer. In the end, they were separated by only a dividing line. The two stared into each other's eyes, their facial expressions completely identical. There was no more fear or confusion, only the joy of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The dividing line burst into a strong light and vanished the next moment. The mirror world also descended into reality! The figures of the young man and the Dharma King completely overlapped. Only the young preacher remained on the scene!</p><p></p><p>After completing the fusion, the young preacher stood silently in the air with his eyes closed, seeming to be digesting the vast information in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Heavenly Venerable? League of Ten Thousand Immortals?" Soon after, he suddenly opened his eyes, his expression somewhat puzzled. </p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that even in this era, they would still be on guard against our Xuan Tian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Exterminate Xuan Secret Technique..." The "young preacher" snorted coldly, "I don't know who gave them the confidence. Thousands of years have passed, yet the contents of the secret technique remain unchanged."</p><p></p><p>"They really underestimate us a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>"This should be enough to deceive them, as long as I don't use the sect's secret arts."</p><p></p><p>The young man nodded with some satisfaction. Then, a hint of doubt appeared on his face again.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't an occasional discovery, but being guided here..."</p><p></p><p>"Recruiting under our Xuan Tian Sect's name, and even knowing my location..."</p><p></p><p>"Directly shifting the blame after being exposed."</p><p></p><p>"Cong Yun Mutual Aid Society, Red Dust Compassionate Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he pieced together the truth of the matter based on the information he had.</p><p></p><p>The young man who had been schemed against did not become angry, but had a solemn expression as he recalled the faceless Xuan Tian deity statue mentioned in the intelligence.</p><p></p><p>He made a slight gesture with his fingers, then showed a startled look on his face: "Actually unable to sense the location?"</p><p></p><p>"But it is indeed undoubtedly a Xuan Tian deity statue."</p><p></p><p>The doubt in the young man's eyes grew thicker.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the handiwork of one of our sect brothers?"</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, this style of doing things does indeed resemble what our Xuan Tian Sect members would do."</p><p></p><p>Possible faces flashed through the young man's mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing that the truth has been revealed and the matter can no longer be handled, he thought of borrowing my hand to settle this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this brother has most likely also just awakened not long ago."</p><p></p><p>As for why the other party chose not to meet, the young man had no doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the immortals</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Daoist Ten Sects took advantage of the critical moment when the Heavenly King was in seclusion and launched a sudden attack.</p><p></p><p>They conquered the Xuantian Sect in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>The timing they chose could be said to be an extreme coincidence.</p><p></p><p>They even had a clear understanding of the distribution of the sect's defensive forces and the loopholes in the protective formations.</p><p></p><p>The defense system was practically useless.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, the Xuantian Sect suffered a crushing defeat.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King and the precious Xuantian Mirror disappeared without a trace, and the Dharma Kings were either killed or injured.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the defeat was so thorough that there must have been traitors within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there might have been more than one.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all the surviving Dharma Kings were extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Heavenly King, they trusted no one.</p><p></p><p>The young man himself was no exception.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Heavenly King disappeared, he sent a message using a secret technique, telling us to lay low and preserve our lives."</p><p></p><p>"Waiting for his summons."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, many years have passed, and there is still no news."</p><p></p><p>Even so, the young man had no doubt about whether the Heavenly King was still alive.</p><p></p><p>After the battle between the Xuantian Sect and the Heavenly Capital, although the Heavenly King was severely injured,</p><p></p><p>He forcibly seized some of the opponent's immortal spiritual energy, hoping to achieve a true immortal body.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King's seclusion that time was precisely for this reason.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can reconstruct an immortal body in the mortal world, I can lead my brothers out of this [Darkest Star Sea]."</p><p></p><p>The young man still vaguely remembered the Heavenly King's bold words before his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the young man had not chosen to betray the sect after so many years.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years of time, for him, was nothing more than sleeping a little longer.</p><p></p><p>But if he were to be trapped here for the endless years to come, that would be true despair.</p><p></p><p>So he couldn't understand why someone would choose to betray the sect back then.</p><p></p><p>The only reasonable explanation he could come up with over the years was that the Daoist Ten Sects had also promised a way to escape the [Darkest Star Sea].</p><p></p><p>And it was more reliable than the Heavenly King's plan.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the young man didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>But after receiving the full memory of this Dharma transmitter, he began to waver in his judgment.</p><p></p><p>Because he learned that during the great tribulation when different cultivation methods could not coexist, some high-level cultivators of the Daoist Ten Sects had disappeared together.</p><p></p><p>They had never appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm since then.</p><p></p><p>"If that's really the case, I'm afraid those traitors are already at ease."</p><p></p><p>A hint of murderous intent flashed in the young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Without the power of a true immortal, escaping the Darkest Star Sea will inevitably require an extremely painful price. It should be impossible to replicate."</p><p></p><p>"So my only hope of escape still lies with the Heavenly King."</p><p></p><p>The young man was not worried about the possibility that the Heavenly King might have escaped before him.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King cultivated the path of [Unity of Words and Deeds] and did not make promises lightly.</p><p></p><p>Once promised, he must fulfill it. Otherwise, it would be self-destructive to his path, and even if he became a true immortal, there was a risk of falling to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>So as long as he was alive, he would definitely gather the Dharma Kings again and fulfill his promise from back then.</p><p></p><p>If not for this reason, the Heavenly King would not have been able to easily gain the allegiance of twelve top-level cultivators with just his silver tongue.</p><p></p><p>"If I find that faceless Xuantian statue, perhaps I can determine the Heavenly King's location."</p><p></p><p>The young man suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian statue was not modeled after the Heavenly King's own image.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was based on the image of a true immortal the Heavenly King encountered in the ascension passage.</p><p></p><p>According to the Heavenly King, the aura emanating from that true immortal was as vast as mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>He, a newly ascended immortal, was as insignificant as an ant in comparison.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had just broken through the void and entered the ascension passage.</p><p></p><p>Before he could fly to the long-awaited immortal realm, a terrifying rumbling sound came from afar.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King then witnessed a scene he would never forget in his life.</p><p></p><p>From far to near, the ascension passage ruptured in succession.</p><p></p><p>Countless figures were desperately trying to escape but were sucked into the terrifying black ruins.</p><p></p><p>Innumerable corpses fell from the cracks of the ascension passage.</p><p></p><p>The immortal realm must have suffered an extremely terrifying disaster!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King turned and ran, not forgetting to search the corpses of immortals he encountered along the way.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to fall into the black abyss like the other ascending cultivators,</p><p></p><p>A figure flashed by his side and casually lent him a hand.</p><p></p><p>Pulling him out of the collapsing space passage.</p><p></p><p>After the Heavenly King's soul-stirring experience, he reacted and thanked the figure for saving his life.</p><p></p><p>That figure was obviously an existence with extremely high cultivation among immortals.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King was actually unable to see the other party's appearance clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and escape, it will be too late if you're any slower."</p><p></p><p>The faceless true immortal shook his head, left these words, and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only a bewildered Heavenly King.</p><p></p><p>It was not until much later that the Heavenly King figured out what the faceless true immortal meant by escape.</p><p></p><p>The ascension passage collapsed, and the immortal path was severed.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only the existence known as the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>And the impact of the Immortal Ruins on the mortal world was just beginning to manifest.</p>

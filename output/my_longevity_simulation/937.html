        <h1>Chapter 937</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the obstruction of the Heavenly Venerables, the Heavenly Patrolling Arrow Net transformed back into nearly ten thousand silvery-white thin arrows in an instant.</p><p></p><p>They then quickly flew towards the various states of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Although many cultivators from the Five Elders Council tried to stop them, the number of these Heavenly Patrolling Arrows was truly too great. Moreover, it should be known that each Heavenly Patrolling Arrow possessed the power of a Harmonious Dao strike. With the incident happening so suddenly, it was no easy task for even the Harmonious Dao cultivators of the Five Elders Council to intercept them.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the ten thousand Heavenly Patrolling Arrows, like scattered fireworks, formed countless different trajectories and fell upon the lands of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Even through the Heavenly Profound Mirror, Li Fan could feel the tremendous tremors coming from afar.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Patrolling Arrow Net, which the Myriad Immortals Alliance had thrown out at the cost of the lives of all thirty-three Immortal Chosen, was definitely not as simple as just a bombardment.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, from each landing spot of the Heavenly Patrolling Arrows, thousands of silver threads suddenly burst out.</p><p></p><p>They formed a huge light cocoon that was wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, resembling a strange pair of pliers.</p><p></p><p>Deeply rooted into the depths of the earth.</p><p></p><p>From the very top of those light cocoons, extremely thin threads were simultaneously ejected towards the location of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, crossing a distance of tens of millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand thin threads converged at a single point in the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance!</p><p></p><p>These changes occurred in just the blink of an eye, before the five Heavenly Venerable Dharma Images in the sky had completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene in the Heavenly Profound Mirror, even with his experience of multiple reincarnations, Li Fan did not know what the Myriad Immortals Alliance was planning to do.</p><p></p><p>However, his heart's spiritual sense gave rise to a vague premonition of something amiss.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the masses, it seemed as if a giant standing as tall as the heavens and earth forcefully pulled at the Myriad Immortals Alliance's end.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous rumbling sound arose once more.</p><p></p><p>The more than ten thousand light cocoons deeply embedded in the depths of the Five Elders Council's lands, like tenacious ropes, seemed to be pulling something, guiding it to distort towards the location of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling continued incessantly, as if some major change was occurring between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And the five beams of light confronting the remaining Heavenly Venerable Dharma Images also seemed to become more urgent.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, their offensive somehow weakened instead.</p><p></p><p>This unexpectedly allowed the Heavenly Venerable Dharma Images, which were on the verge of completely shattering, to persist for even longer.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's unease grew more and more severe.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful consideration, it was not a concern for himself. Rather, it was more like an instinct of living beings, just as all sentient creatures would feel restless before the arrival of a natural disaster.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Profound Mirror, the Five Elders Council's side finally seemed to react.</p><p></p><p>They dispatched a large number of cultivators to launch attacks on those huge light cocoons.</p><p></p><p>Only the attacks of those leading cultivators, who seemed to be at the Harmonious Dao realm, caused the threads ejected from the light cocoons to slightly distort.</p><p></p><p>But this light net covering the entire Five Elders Council region was extremely tenacious. The slight bending had no effect on the overall situation.</p><p></p><p>The changes continued to occur with determination.</p><p></p><p>The lights in the sky representing the five Heavenly Venerables also became increasingly dim.</p><p></p><p>As if...</p><p></p><p>The powers of these few Eternal Heavenly Venerables were subjected to some kind of restriction!</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration suddenly struck Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Like lightning tearing through the fog, in his field of vision, the picture...</p><p></p><p>The expressions on their faces changed!</p><p></p><p>The cocoons of light and thin threads were no longer connected to the land of the Five Elders, but to a similarly vast network!</p><p></p><p>A vast network representing the principles of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally understood.</p><p></p><p>Each of the Celestial Venerables of the Five Elders had their own territories.</p><p></p><p>Within these regions, their reversal of the principles of heaven and earth was more solid compared to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Even the weaker ones among them would lose the effect of reversing the principles of heaven and earth once they left their territories.</p><p></p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that these places were the enlightenment grounds of these few Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, through some unknown method and those light cocoons, had actually caused the inherent principles of heaven and earth in these places to become distorted.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the pillars supporting a bridge had bent.</p><p></p><p>Although the bridge would not collapse immediately, it began to sway uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>Reflected in reality, the powers of the five Celestial Venerables were now inevitably affected!</p><p></p><p>"It won't affect the strength of the Celestial Venerables of Eternal Life, but it can temporarily make them lose absolute control over the territories of the Five Elders."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood up, a look of shock appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>He never thought that when fighting against the Celestial Venerables of Eternal Life, such a method could be employed.</p><p></p><p>"The distortion of the principles of heaven and earth has a time limit. Those five Celestial Venerables will definitely try to slowly eliminate this influence. But before that, it is a perfect opportunity for the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals..."</p><p></p><p>As if echoing Li Fan's speculations, one after another, teleportation gates suddenly appeared above the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>Expressionless, with murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>They began to sweep through various regions of the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Technique Masters..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was no stranger to these elite soldiers trained by the era.</p><p></p><p>Their powerful combat strength was also as always.</p><p></p><p>The incident happened too suddenly. Moreover, it was a situation of a group of dragons without a leader, and the Five Elders had no time to organize any semblance of resistance.</p><p></p><p>Fighting separately, they were quickly defeated one by one by the black-robed cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The offensive of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, like thick dark clouds, rolled over the Five Elders in an unstoppable manner.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Celestial Profound Mirror, the cultivator sects, who originally had the mentality of watching a show, went crazy one after another.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? What is this again? Is this still the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals I know?"</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance actually hid so deeply? Their various combat readiness forces are so powerful that it's hard to imagine!"</p><p></p><p>"I say, is there a possibility, I'm just saying a possibility, that these images are actually false appearances fabricated by the Celestial Profound Mirror? After all, no matter what, they have been in a confrontation with us for thousands of years. How could they be defeated so easily? I find it a bit hard to believe."</p><p></p><p>"What you said makes sense, I also find it very unreasonable. Is there any courageous fellow who can go to the Five Elders' side and take a look? After all, seeing is believing."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I actually knew a secret route leading to the Five Elders for a long time. Wait a moment, fellow cultivators, I'll go and personally verify it."</p><p></p><p>"Bah! You rebels are still being stubborn. I really want to see your grief-stricken faces after the Five Elders are completely conquered!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In front of the Celestial Profound Mirror, all kinds of human conditions were displayed.</p><p></p><p>But the battle situation between the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and the Five Elders did not change according to their will.</p><p></p><p>The number of black-robed cultivators seemed endless, still flying out of the teleportation gates in an endless stream.</p><p></p><p>And they needed no command, yet had exceptional tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the teleportation gates, they each did their own thing, swift and decisive.</p><p></p><p>Occupying strongholds, building defensive fortifications.</p><p></p><p>Steadily advancing forward.</p><p></p><p>They did not exterminate everyone, but instead took all the captured cultivators of the Five Elders away through the teleportation gates.</p>

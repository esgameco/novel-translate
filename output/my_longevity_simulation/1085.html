        <h1>Chapter 1085</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>However, the experiences of these years had made his mind mature long ago, and he quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>He methodically commanded his subordinate demon beasts to suppress and subdue those out-of-control disciples of the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've been looking down on them for a long time. This time, there's finally an opportunity to openly take revenge."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to stretch our muscles and bones. These years, cooped up in this small mountain, we're almost suffocating."</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, use some strength. Don't let others look down on us!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the tens of thousands of demon beasts lurking in the Beast Taming Sect surged out like a dragon rising from the sea, covering the entire territory like dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying demonic wind and killing intent even temporarily suppressed the threat of the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, those demon beasts have rebelled!"</p><p></p><p>"I said long ago, those not of our race must have different intentions. Without subduing them with the True Art of Beast Taming, it will inevitably cause endless troubles! Hateful sect master, not listening to my words!"</p><p></p><p>"My life is over!"</p><p></p><p>Under the calamity where different cultivation methods cannot coexist, the Beast Taming Sect, which already had difficulty protecting itself, was naturally no match for these demon beasts who had been conserving their strength for many years.</p><p></p><p>In just three days, they were completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Although in this process, they might have been a bit heavy-handed. But with Xu Ke present, the demon beasts did not harm the lives of human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, what should we do next?" Chi Jiutou asked with a somewhat solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The great calamity where different cultivation methods cannot coexist naturally also had a certain impact on the demon beast groups.</p><p></p><p>The inherited cultivation methods in each tribe were often only one.</p><p></p><p>However, the demon beast tribes had a strict hierarchy. For now, they could still stabilize the situation.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that Lord Di Yi's prophecy would actually be true. If I had known earlier, I should have left together with them back then." You Xuan Huang sighed.</p><p></p><p>"At present, there are only two strategies. One is to go against the principle that different cultivation methods cannot coexist. The second is if that cannot be done, then we can only adapt to the changes in the world." Xu Ke responded calmly and composedly.</p><p></p><p>"Since different cultivation methods cannot coexist, then each should cultivate a different method! Our Beast Taming Sect's methods are not enough..."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go borrow some from the surrounding sects." Xu Ke said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding demon beasts were stunned upon hearing this, not understanding what it meant. But very quickly, they reacted and were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After all, plundering was the nature of demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xuan Niao, do we really have to do this?" In Xu Ke's heart, he was not as resolute as he appeared on the surface. He still felt conflicted and couldn't let go.</p><p></p><p>"Don't have the kindness of a woman. With the descent of the great calamity, I'm afraid not even one out of ten human cultivators will survive. Since you are now the nominal leader of the Beast Taming Sect, naturally you have to be responsible for their life and death."</p><p></p><p>"Others dying is always better than us dying." Li Fan's tone was full of coldness.</p><p></p><p>Deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Xu Ke finally made up his mind: "I understand."</p><p></p><p>He raised his head, his eyes full of determination.</p><p></p><p>Exterminate sects and collect resources and cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Bypass those powerful sects and only target the weak ones. Strive to win quickly and decisively.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of demon beasts, united as one.</p><p></p><p>Under the outbreak of the calamity where different cultivation methods cannot coexist, it was definitely an unstoppable force.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month, they had already exterminated over a hundred sects of all sizes.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, this beast disaster would have long attracted the attention of the Ten Immortal Sects and faced the joint encirclement and suppression of countless human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Ten Immortal Sects</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone was too busy to take care of themselves. How could they have the time to manage the affairs of other sects?</p><p></p><p>All the cultivation techniques plundered by the demon beasts were uniformly handed over to Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the quantity collected was almost enough, Xu Ke immediately ordered to stop.</p><p></p><p>After decisively slaughtering dozens of demon beasts that had gone crazy and disobeyed orders, Xu Ke immediately issued the order to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Are we going to escape too?"</p><p></p><p>"Retreat? Where to?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Beast Taming Sect, including all the demon beasts, were a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Ke's explanation, everyone finally realized.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Xu Ke had made preparations for a rainy day. As early as when he returned from Nanming Sacred Beast Mountain that year, he had already sent people to find a hidden small world where they could settle down.</p><p></p><p>"The catastrophe in the Xuanhuang Realm is likely to last for thousands of years. If we want to preserve ourselves, we can only temporarily withdraw into a small world and slowly plan for our revival." Xu Ke said with a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>During this period, everyone had seen the tragic situation of sects fighting each other in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the death rate of the Beast Taming Sect was pitifully low.</p><p></p><p>And this was all thanks to Xu Ke's foresight.</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought that after Lord Di San Mo mysteriously disappeared, our future would be uncertain. I didn't expect the boss to be so brilliant, not inferior to Lord Di San Mo at all."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, if it weren't for this, would Di San Mo and Di Yi easily hand over the Beast Turning Wheel to the boss?"</p><p></p><p>"I said long ago, follow the boss and there will be meat to eat."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's operation finally made everyone completely convinced and no longer had any doubts.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, under Xu Ke's command, they quickly migrated to the unknown small world.</p><p></p><p>And then their figures slowly disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the scene in the Fallen Immortal Realm also began to freeze.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings suddenly changed from bright to pitch black.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this counts as passing the test of the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable." Li Fan actually had no idea in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, coordinating the harmonious coexistence of human and demon beast tribes.</p><p></p><p>When the catastrophe arrives, using all means to maintain the survival of the group.</p><p></p><p>These were already the most perfect methods Li Fan could think of at present.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for several previous experiences, even if Li Fan pondered more, he probably wouldn't be able to come up with such methods in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The test illusion seemed to be evaluating Li Fan's actions.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the first scene, the waiting time required was even longer.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately...</p><p></p><p>Streaks of white light abruptly appeared out of the darkness.</p><p></p><p>After a dizzying spin, a new scene was generated again!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan successfully passed the test and arrived at the third scene, the Sword Forging of the Heavenly Sword Sect!</p><p></p><p>"This time, what needs to be tested?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had not experienced the Sword Forging scene of the Heavenly Sword Sect many times.</p><p></p><p>So in fact, he was not fully confident.</p><p></p><p>However, during those years in the Beast Taming Sect, Li Fan had already made sufficient preparations.</p><p></p><p>He had been quietly following the established plot, reasonably playing the role he was attached to.</p><p></p><p>Until the cultivator disguised by Mr. White came to challenge!</p><p></p><p>None of the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect were a match for Mr. White.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was shocked and afraid, Li Fan walked out with his head held high.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to learn from your skills, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with his hands clasped.</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look at my swordsmanship, sir."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke loudly and casually broke off a branch from a nearby tree.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same as what Mr. White had done before!</p><p></p><p>Such behavior caused an uproar among the people of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 828</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, the Medicine King Valley from my previous life was simply a small fry compared to a big shot. The wood-attribute cave-heaven here alone could support the rise of a major power."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention, there are still the other four attribute cave-heavens."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had arrived in the Xuanhuang Realm ahead of time and intercepted the discovery of the Wanxian Alliance, felt quite pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>After roughly strolling around, he went to the fire, earth, metal, and water cave-heavens in turn.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had stayed in the water-attribute cave-heaven for a long time before.</p><p></p><p>But only now did Li Fan realize that what he saw back then was almost the scene after it had been emptied out.</p><p></p><p>Unlike now, beneath the vibrant sea, there were countless fish species reproducing and surviving.</p><p></p><p>Countless water-attribute spiritual medicines and spiritual ores filled the entire sea area.</p><p></p><p>Even the knowledgeable Li Fan couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The metal-attribute cave-heaven was a vast underground world, filled with various rare mineral veins and metallic lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The fire-attribute cave-heaven was not much different from the fire world on the back of Dali. However, it was not as violent.</p><p></p><p>As for the earth-attribute world, it was a scene of endless mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After a cursory tour, Li Fan was satisfied, but a question also arose.</p><p></p><p>That was, these five-element grand cave-heavens were really too big.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to devour them with his Golden Core cultivation to form the Nascent Soul realm,</p><p></p><p>It would be almost impossible without three to five years.</p><p></p><p>This was still under the premise that no one else would discover it, that he would not be disturbed,</p><p></p><p>And that the five-element grand cave-heavens themselves would not resist.</p><p></p><p>In fact, once the scale reached the level of the five-element grand cave-heavens, even if they did not belong to the level of a "small world",</p><p></p><p>They were almost no different from a "world".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still clearly remembered that when they wanted to lay down the [Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation] covering the entire cave-heaven again,</p><p></p><p>They encountered fierce resistance from the cave-heaven's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It generated countless bizarre and endless monsters to launch attacks.</p><p></p><p>Even with Lin Ling guarding him, he might not necessarily be able to handle it.</p><p></p><p>"Having too big of an appetite is also a problem." Li Fan couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some difficulties, Li Fan would never give up on the five-element grand cave-heavens here.</p><p></p><p>His own cultivation level didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that he couldn't let the Wanxian Alliance get it.</p><p></p><p>"While I haven't perfected my Golden Core, I'll think of a way. If it really doesn't work, I can only use the slow grinding method."</p><p></p><p>He stayed in the five-element grand cave-heavens for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>Until the appointed time with the Five Elders was approaching, Li Fan finally left.</p><p></p><p>"With the help of two Harmonized Daos, I could try to transfer the entrance of the five-element cave-heavens. But the movement would be too big, and there might be a risk of being discovered by the Wanxian Alliance." Li Fan, who re-concealed the entrance, thought so before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Still relying on Lin Ling, they shuttled through the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the three of them returned to Jiushan Prefecture again without a sound.</p><p></p><p>When leaving the earth veins, Li Fan even felt a very rare emotion of "reluctance" coming from Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang's puppet body was created with the [Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation]. It seems that the power of these earth veins has some special use for him."</p><p></p><p>"I can let Lin Ling take him for more trips. The earth veins in the Xuanhuang Realm are so powerful, taking a little advantage, I think the ancient earth vein tree won't mind, right?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan instructed Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Ling's attitude towards Tianyang...</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a very good impression of the other party and immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at another location, Li Fan once again crushed a jade talisman, releasing a wave of fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Yu Dayi hurriedly arrived.</p><p></p><p>This time, there was no grand mobilization. Only one other person accompanied him.</p><p></p><p>And the moment he saw the other party, alarm bells instantly rang in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Although they had never met before, Li Fan felt an extremely familiar aura from the other person!</p><p></p><p>The answer was already on the verge of being called out. The other party was a member of the "Wanzhong Yixin" Zhao Shijie!</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, Zhao Shijie did not come in her female form, but as an extremely handsome young man of only fifteen or sixteen years old.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the Daoist friend from the 'Wanjie Alliance', right?" He looked at Li Fan and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>A pair of eyes swept over Li Fan, almost seeing through all the secrets.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled, but he remained calm despite the shock.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie had many bodies, and the one in front of him was only at the Huashen cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even a Chuanfa Tianzun could not know everything.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan was not worried that his secrets would be seen through with just one glance.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, to think that it would attract a Tianzun to personally come. What an honor!" He showed a strange smile and stared at Zhao Shijie.</p><p></p><p>The smile on the young man's face instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally took a serious look at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And Yu Dayi, who was standing to the side, seemed to be unaware of the true identity of the cultivator beside him. Upon hearing Li Fan's words, he was slightly stunned and somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>But after all, he was a cultivator born and raised in the Five Elders Council. After just a moment, he reacted.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly turned his head and looked at the somewhat playful smile on the young man's face, his expression frozen.</p><p></p><p>His body also began to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, I've been seen through."</p><p></p><p>"How interesting. It seems that your so-called 'Wanjie Alliance' does have some skills."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, would you welcome this servant to join?"</p><p></p><p>The young man chuckled.</p><p></p><p>His tone, however, was like a coquettish woman, full of temptation.</p><p></p><p>It should have made people feel horrified, but when Li Fan heard it, he didn't feel the slightest discomfort.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, actually I also want to join the Tianzun's Great Dao Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly and bluntly countered.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie was not angered, but giggled coquettishly, "If we merge, it's not impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi, who was listening on the side, was sweating profusely and his legs were weak.</p><p></p><p>He only hated that he was not deaf and had heard the Tianzun's unbridled conversation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in his heart, he had already listed the "Wanjie Alliance" and Li Fan as the most untouchable level.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gave an awkward laugh and avoided answering.</p><p></p><p>He just changed the subject and asked about the matter at hand, "Where are the things we need?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie threw over a piece of "Kongling Shimu".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan skillfully caught it and checked. It was exactly the same as the list he provided, without the slightest difference.</p><p></p><p>He put it away.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid that this servant has tampered with it?" Zhao Shijie suddenly said in a faint tone.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie, you handle matters with integrity. You're not someone who would do such a thing," Li Fan replied.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie's expression completely changed at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Considering that Shijie has personally appeared, let me provide you with another top-secret piece of information for free."</p><p></p><p>"Puxian Zhenye can be used to create a divine boat. It can shuttle through the white fog, avoiding the side effects of the devouring primordial white fog."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan transmitted his voice.</p><p></p><p>Then, without waiting for a response, he was enveloped in a green light and disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi did not dare to move.</p><p></p><p>"A woman's heart is difficult to guess."</p>

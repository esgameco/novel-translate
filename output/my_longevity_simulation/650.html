        <div class="content">
            <p>"How is this possible?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's description of unbelievable facts shocked Liu San. new69shuhux.com</p><p></p><p>"How could there be true immortals in the Mysterious Yellow Realm? Why have we never heard of it before?" </p><p></p><p>Even as a strong practitioner in the Dao, when Liu San heard about the existence of the Meteor Immortal Realm, his reaction was no better than Li Fan's. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said, "Liu Lao, there is no need to doubt it. This matter is absolutely true, I have personally experienced it." </p><p></p><p>"Seeing it with my own eyes, just like back then. Truly the handwriting of a true immortal," he shook his head, full of emotion. </p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's words, Liu San was completely convinced, feeling more and more shocked. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, his eyes flickering with excitement. "Young Master, you said that the Meteor Immortal Realm is the true projection of the ancient Mysterious Yellow Realm. So, does this mean that the Medicine King Sect still exists within the Meteor Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"We, the former Sect Leader, perhaps even you and I, along with all the other practitioners of the Medicine King Sect..." </p><p></p><p>"Could we possibly encounter them during our exploration?" Liu San's voice trembled, slowly asking. </p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan nodded and gave an affirmative answer. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, in the history of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, there had been occurrences where ancient sleeping practitioners encountered another version of themselves after entering the Meteor Immortal Realm. </p><p></p><p>However, there were no strange phenomena such as "they cannot meet," or "they resonate with each other." Ultimately, when the ancient practitioners came to the present, everything from the past had already passed. What existed in the Meteor Immortal Realm was merely a projection of their past self at a certain moment. Besides feeling sentimental and nostalgic, encountering another version of oneself was no different from encountering other beings. </p><p></p><p>Similarly, the "native inhabitants" in the Meteor Immortal Realm would not mistake the external practitioners who entered as projections of their past selves. Even if their appearance and aura were exactly the same as their past selves, they would only consider them as disguised by some kind of magical technique. </p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had once seen a discussion in the Celestial Mirror [Seeking Immortals] section, stating that if a practitioner survived from ancient times to the present and cultivated to an unimaginably profound realm, they might achieve the ability to "reflect through all ages and exist eternally." </p><p></p><p>This "eternal existence" referred to the ability for the practitioner to exist in the past, present, and future simultaneously. At each point in time, they would be the version of themselves transcending time. In this way, the projection in the Meteor Immortal Realm might be considered the same person as the actual practitioner. </p><p></p><p>Though it was just a fantasy, it was the ultimate pursuit of practitioners on the Dao path, which intrigued many people. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, some practitioners proposed that if such individuals truly existed, they would have encountered cause and effect long ago, forming a continuous loop in time and space. How could they be brought into the Meteor Immortal Realm by mere true immortals? Therefore, the speculation that the projection in the Meteor Immortal Realm might be the actual practitioner was ultimately a paradox. new69shuhux.com</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan roughly explained to Liu San, who, although nodded in acquiescence on the surface, was still eager to personally enter the Meteor Immortal Realm. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan did not mind and simply shook his head with a gentle smile, then carefully explained the ritual steps to him. </p><p></p><p>"Fusheng, Mysterious Yellow Celestial Master!" Without any guard up, Liu San initiated the ritual in front of Li Fan and entered the Meteor Immortal Realm. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly squinted his eyes and looked towards the sky. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to achieving the Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra, Li Fan's perception became more acute than before. </p><p></p><p>At the moment when Liu San's spiritual consciousness disappeared, Li Fan distinctly sensed a shadow passing over the sky in the real world. </p><p></p><p>"It's not an illusion. The Meteor Immortal Realm..." </p><p></p><p>Though the shadow only appeared momentarily and disappeared in his perception, Li Fan's gaze remained fixed for a long time. </p><p></p><p>After browsing the [Seeking Immortals] section for a long time, Li Fan knew that many practitioners had tried to find traces of the Meteor Immortal Realm in the real world, but reportedly, they all failed. They knew of its existence and the method to enter it, but they couldn't observe it. </p><p></p><p>However, as a Nascent Infant practitioner, Li Fan had now broken this rule. </p><p></p><p>"My previous experience in the Meteor Immortal Realm was different from others, constantly looping through a certain scene. I just didn't know the reason behind it. Now, it seems that it might be related to the Mysterious Yellow Mantra." </p><p></p><p>"True immortal inheritance, true immortal remembrance. Perhaps there is indeed a connection between these two." </p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I entered the Meteor Immortal Realm. I hope this time, with the blessing of the Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra, it will bring me some surprises." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated to himself. </p><p></p><p>Next, he did not rush to take action, instead, he wandered around the Changsheng Valley while waiting for Liu San to awaken. </p><p></p><p>The valley was divided into separate areas by formations, used to cultivate different spiritual plants and herbs. Despite being sealed for thousands of years, and even with formations isolating them, Li Fan could still sense the thriving life force emanating from the plants in the spiritual field. </p><p></p><p>Occasionally, practitioners from the Medicine King Sect traversed through, using secret techniques to select and harvest materials suitable for refining elixirs. </p><p></p><p>In the distance, one could vaguely see several nearly completed architectural structures. </p><p></p><p>These were the new sect gates being constructed under Fang Zaiji's command for the Medicine King Sect. </p><p></p><p>"Impressive in its momentum," Li Fan nodded in admiration. </p><p></p><p>Having observed the situation, the next step was to consider plans for the future. </p><p></p><p>There were two main objectives. </p><p></p><p>First, to figure out a way to acquire the latter part of the "Mountain Sitting Secret." Since the events like the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance luring out hidden spies and setting up the "Virtual Reality Heavenly Master Plan" had not occurred in this world yet, the Five Elders did not send out Daoist Strongmen to probe, leading to a large battle and the Supreme Being Elder being ambushed when nearing the end of life. So, an alternative method was needed to obtain the "Foresight Jade Plate" that could allow one to see the Law of Yafa. However, Li Fan was prepared for this, and it shouldn't be a big issue. </p><p></p><p>Second, to accumulate experience and insights for reaching the realm of Nascent Divinity. The entire Nascent Infant realm was a process of nurturing and perfecting one's celestial domain. Transitioning from Nascent Infant to Nascent Divinity was a crucial threshold in enhancing a practitioner's actual combat strength. Take the recently fallen Immortal Lord Hongxi as an example. Achieving the Dao Foundation with the "Five Elements Mountain" and attaining the Golden Core with the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. With outstanding talent and a favorable start, everything looked promising. However, during the stages of seizing the essence of heaven and earth to form the Nascent Infant and extracting the essence of heaven and earth to obtain its divinity, the once favorable situation rapidly turned downward. Concepts like the "Hundred Peaks Cave Heaven" and "Taihua Will Give Birth to Thousands of Mountains" seemed weaker by comparison. This led to Immortal Lord Hongxi displaying a lackluster combat strength. He could only be trapped in the remote borderland of the Cloud Haven, facing countless hardships on the path to further advancement. Conversely, if Immortal Lord Hongxi cultivated his Nascent Infant with the "Five Elements Grand Cave Heaven" like Li Fan did, how would his future unfold?</p>

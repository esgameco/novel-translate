        <div class="content">
            <p>In the purple-gold vortex, there was a surging of wind and thunder. ‚ô†üê≥‚ûÖÔºôsƒßùì§◊ê.·∂ú‚ìû‡πìüëªüë§</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the funnel-shaped energy vortex, there was the somewhat panicked and flustered figure of Xuanhuang Enian.</p><p></p><p>Different faces of various lives flashed rapidly in the wind and thunder vortex. Like a hurricane, it tore at Xuanhuang Enian.</p><p></p><p>As a result, His body gradually became distorted and blurred.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xuanhuang Tiandao! The father and mother of you cultivators! How dare you treat me like this!"</p><p></p><p>"Again! Again! You humans should all die!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Enian roared.</p><p></p><p>Not choosing to sit and wait for death, the appearance that originally resembled Mr. Bai finally revealed its true form.</p><p></p><p>The body swelled up like a balloon, and in the blink of an eye, it formed a hideous monster covered in blue-purple lumps all over. What was even more spine-chilling was that Xuanhuang Enian's face had disappeared. Or rather, the countless black shadows quickly moving on the surface of His shell were now His many faces!</p><p></p><p>The expressions were all different, but none of them showed positive emotions. Madness, hatred, despair, tyranny...</p><p></p><p>All the darkest and most twisted parts of living beings were fully displayed on Xuanhuang Enian's body.</p><p></p><p>Substantial black evil energy surged out from within Him, soaring into the sky, directly confronting the rotating power of wind and thunder in the purple-gold vortex.</p><p></p><p>In the silent collision, it actually caused Li Ping's Heaven and Earth Great Millstone to have a slight pause.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping noticed that about one-third of the faces on Xuanhuang Enian were all staring at him.</p><p></p><p>"Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!"</p><p></p><p>Sharp curses erupted and swept over.</p><p></p><p>The three people guarding the formation for Li Ping all frowned slightly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>On the empty face of Holy Emperor Li Ping, the impact of this evil thought even vaguely revealed blurry features.</p><p></p><p>Countless tentacles covered in blue-purple tumors extended from Xuanhuang Enian's monstrous shell, frantically flailing and trying to break free from the restraint of the Wanling Great Formation.</p><p></p><p>However, how could this unparalleled great formation, which could be said to be the ultimate limit of the Separation Disk's derivation, be so easily broken through?</p><p></p><p>After a brief stagnation, the purple-gold vortex slowly rotated again.</p><p></p><p>The howling sound of wind and thunder was even greater than before.</p><p></p><p>There were also bursts of human prayers coming from it, forming a unique rhythm in resonance, forcibly suppressing Xuanhuang Enian's earth-shattering roars.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, evil can never triumph over justice."</p><p></p><p>"Look at your current appearance, are you even worthy of the four words 'Xuanhuang Tiandao'?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's voice was calm, with a hint of mockery, penetrating through the various noises in the confrontation between the formations and accurately reaching Xuanhuang Enian's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Bastard! Who caused this?!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of stupor, He was completely enraged.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that even Xuanhuang Enian himself found it a bit unacceptable to have fallen to such a state.</p><p></p><p>The body suppressed by the Heaven and Earth Great Millstone once again showed signs of rising up and struggling.</p><p></p><p>The fragments peeled off from Xuanhuang Enian's body were absorbed into Li Ping's body through the vortex.</p><p></p><p>Negative emotions flowed into Li Ping's consciousness like a trickle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the three people guarding the formation couldn't help but become a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>Because they were in the formation, they could more clearly feel the terror of this Wanling Great Formation.</p><p></p><p>Even though it had been sealed for thousands of years, it was still a part of the Dao of Heaven in this great world. However, in the face of this formation, it could be said that there was not the slightest power of resistance.</p><p></p><p>It even rendered the preparations of the three people useless. They only needed to quietly watch Holy Emperor Li Ping's performance.</p><p></p><p>The more terrifying this formation was, the more it made them unable to suppress their worries.</p><p></p><p>If the Holy Emperor was affected by the evil thoughts and lost control...</p><p></p><p>It would probably be a disaster ten thousand times more terrifying than Xuanhuang Enian breaking free.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had great confidence in the Holy Emperor's strength, they couldn't help but feel a little nervous at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were still in the formation at this time.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry, I'm fine." Li Ping seemed to have sensed their emotional fluctuations and calmly explained through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Li Ping's own tenacity of will, just based on the blessing of the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, it was impossible for him to have his personality distorted by Xuanhuang Enian's evil thoughts. Not to mention, he was not violently swallowing it in one gulp, but using the Heaven and Earth Great Millstone to slowly grind Xuanhuang Enian bit by bit and slowly absorb it. This minimized the side effects.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the thoughts of hundreds of millions of people are anchored to me."</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of millions of living beings can refine a god. This is just a part of the original Xuanhuang Tiandao, how could it affect me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's heart was clear as a mirror.</p><p></p><p>Rather than dealing with the "evil thoughts", the greater pressure on Li Ping at this moment was actually to digest the mottled and vast chaotic memories within the other party's body.</p><p></p><p>Although the vast majority had become blurred in the thousands of years of twisted despair.</p><p></p><p>But these fragmented memory shards were already deeply hidden in His subconscious. At this moment, along with the dismemberment of the body, they flowed into Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene of fragmented images flashed rapidly in Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were difficult to discern the details.</p><p></p><p>Only one scene kept appearing repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>It was very obvious that this was a memory that left a deep impression on Xuanhuang Enian. During the years of His sealing, it replayed in His mind more than once.</p><p></p><p>In the endless dark void.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you leaving?" </p><p></p><p>The voice in the memory asked.</p><p></p><p>The original emotion was a bit of relief and excitement.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, there was a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>That figure in white, Mr. Bai, turned around and looked back.</p><p></p><p>His expression kept changing, very complex.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>The perception from the memory gradually became a bit irritable in the deadly silence.</p><p></p><p>"I can't leave."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Mr. Bai took a deep breath and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Why not leave?"</p><p></p><p>"The catastrophe has occurred, the general trend is set, it can no longer be reversed. Rather than staying there, it's better to go to the high wall and make a determined effort. Who knows, there might still be a glimmer of hope." The voice from the memory was stunned at first, filled with incomprehensible emotions. Then it became a bit anxious and hurriedly tried to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>"With the protection of the remnant shell left by the first-generation Great Celestial Venerable, and using the detonation of those few immortal artifacts as power, with our combined efforts, there is a very high possibility of crossing the high wall!"</p><p></p><p>"We've prepared for so long, how can you suddenly change your mind?!"</p><p></p><p>Even after a long time, Li Ping could still feel the confusion and anger in this separated consciousness of the Xuanhuang Tiandao.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps knowing that he was in the wrong, Mr. Bai remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Say something!"</p><p></p><p>When the Xuanhuang Tiandao finally stopped, Mr. Bai slowly responded.</p><p></p><p>"That place is my hometown."</p><p></p><p>"From birth until now, everyone I know, everything I've heard of</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, including those I love and hate, spent their entire lives in it."</p><p></p><p>"Now that it faces calamity, I could indeed walk away. But what about them?" Mr. White asked quietly.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao couldn't understand Mr. White's emotions at all. In Its view, ensuring one's own survival was the most important thing. </p><p></p><p>"As long as I'm around, once we find another suitable world, we can quickly nurture another Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Mr. White just chuckled lightly and shook his head. Without further hesitation, he turned around and headed back to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing things progressing in an uncontrollable direction, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao became increasingly anxious, constantly trying to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>Mr. White simply turned a deaf ear, his mind already made up. </p><p></p><p>"I know you've treated me well."</p><p></p><p>"You always say I'm the reincarnation of that person."</p><p></p><p>"But I know that I am just myself."</p><p></p><p>"Su Bai. An ordinary mortal."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's memory was becoming a bit unstable as Its rage grew. But Mr. White's words remained exceptionally clear, albeit intermittent.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to cultivate at all or become an immortal."</p><p></p><p>"I just want to..."</p><p></p><p>"Save the people I care about."</p><p></p><p>"Sorry."</p><p></p><p>"As for what you've given me - the immortal body of the Great Heavenly Venerate, those immortal artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>"And even this cultivation, I will return them all to you."</p><p></p><p>Mr. White said calmly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The memory burst like a bubble.</p><p></p><p>Having inherited the power of the Xuanhuang Evil Thought, Li Ping now empathized, personally feeling the extreme anger of being deceived and betrayed.</p><p></p><p>"Die! Die!" The voice of the Xuanhuang Evil Thought seemed to echo in his mind.</p><p></p><p>And the deformed Evil Thought entity, suppressed and crushed by the Heavenly Millstone Formation, also seemed to sense the changes in Li Ping. It couldn't help but scream, "Do you feel it?! Can you understand me?!"</p><p></p><p>"This pain of being deceived and then sealed for thousands of years!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Its outpouring was abruptly cut off by Li Ping's words.</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, I am in a human body."</p><p></p><p>"So I can empathize more with the one you hate so much."</p><p></p><p>"I think Mr. White did the right thing."</p><p></p><p>"Some things, you will never be able to understand. So..."</p><p></p><p>"Rest in peace."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's words gradually turned cold.</p><p></p><p>His facial features, which had become a bit blurry from the impact of the Xuanhuang Evil Thought's memories, disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>A chilling and ruthless aura emanated from the Faceless Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he sped up the rotation of the Heavenly Millstone Formation.</p><p></p><p>Like an indestructible, towering dam, it completely blocked the Evil Thought's onslaught.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the three people guarding the formation couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They were truly a bit afraid that the Sacred Emperor would be affected by the Evil Thought.</p><p></p><p>Especially Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>He jokingly said to Xu Ke, "Actually, my nature isn't much different from the Xuanhuang Evil Thought."</p><p></p><p>"If he can so easily devour It, then devouring me would just be a casual act."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like in the future, I should try to stay far away from him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the figure in the formation that seemed to be growing taller and taller, he suddenly felt a bit apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't sure if handing over the Xuanhuang Evil Thought was right or wrong.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Evil Thought's struggle grew weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>It was only a matter of time before It was completely devoured.</p><p></p><p>As the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was absorbed and refined, the imposing figure of the Faceless Sacred Emperor grew even taller.</p><p></p><p>As if wanting to break through the firmament of the Great Enlightenment Small World and reach another realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's figure appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The billions of subjects of the Great Enlightenment could now clearly see the Sacred Emperor's countenance.</p><p></p><p>The boiling hearts of the people reached a peak at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The converging destiny suddenly broke through purple and turned into a dazzlingly brilliant golden light.</p><p></p><p>Even if it only lasted for a moment and seemed about to fall back down again.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping was keenly aware and seized this fleeting opportunity.</p><p></p><p>With a light wave of his hand, he scattered the power of the Xuanhuang Evil Thought absorbed and transformed by the Heavenly Millstone Formation into the Great Enlightenment Small World.</p><p></p><p>Countless purple-gold spots of light, like a rain of flowers, floated down to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>And from the perspective of the ordinary people of the Great Enlightenment below, they saw the rumored Sacred Emperor's grace from a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>Those purple-gold flowers seemed to have a natural, seductive magic.</p><p></p><p>Causing the subjects of the Great Enlightenment to disregard the Sacred Emperor's majesty and try to touch them.</p><p></p><p>And the changes brought about by the purple-gold flowers entering their bodies made those people immediately kneel down and shout the Sacred Emperor's prestige.</p><p></p><p>The destiny of the Great Enlightenment, which had already reached its peak, was catalyzed again and underwent another change.</p><p></p><p>This time, under the chanting of billions of subjects of the Great Enlightenment, that originally extremely unstable golden destiny was completely stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Billions of living beings, shouting like the roar of the sea.</p><p></p><p>Causing the three guardians of the formation above the Great Enlightenment to be stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is the legendary 'when one attains the Dao, even the dogs ascend to heaven', right?" Yin Shangren couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke unconsciously sized up the motionless figure of the Sacred Emperor Li Ping, and for some reason, he saw the figure of Mr. White from him.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I didn't do wrong." Xu Ke thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>And Taiyi Sect's Yi Shu narrowed his eyes, seemingly calculating something. His eyes revealed shock.</p><p></p><p>Under the shifting of power, the Xuanhuang Evil Thought ultimately had no possibility of resistance.</p><p></p><p>"I will wait for you."</p><p></p><p>"You will eventually share my fate."</p><p></p><p>Before Its consciousness completely dissipated, the Xuanhuang Evil Thought suddenly cursed so viciously for some reason.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor Li Ping paid no heed, unmoved.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Millstone Formation came crashing down with a rumble.</p><p></p><p>The power from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao flowed into his body in an endless stream.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sensed that an invisible shackle seemed to have been broken.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, an alternative Longevity Realm."</p><p></p><p>He mused.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Derivation Magic Orb space at the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the avatar's breakthrough abruptly stopped the moment the Sacred Emperor reached the level of the Longevity Realm.</p><p></p><p>So it didn't arouse the awareness of the others in the space.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor's breakthrough was already within Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>But what Li Fan really cared about were the memories from that Xuanhuang Evil Thought.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>"And the immortal body of the first generation Great Heavenly Venerate?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, hiding the shock in them.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. White's words 'I will return them to you' mean that these things are still inside the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1213: The High-Pressure Situation of the Immortal Alliance</p><p></p><p>"Empty Bright Flowing Crystal?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, information related to it surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Empty Bright Flowing Crystal is a silk-like solid crystal.</p><p></p><p>It can float in the air and flow like water. It also emits a dreamy seven-colored glow.</p><p></p><p>It is often mixed in by female cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm when forging magic treasures, causing the magic treasures to release dazzling and brilliant light, whether in normal state or when activated.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Except for being beautiful, it seems to have no other use.</p><p></p><p>So although its production is not high, the price is maintained at a level of 8,000 contribution points per piece, neither high nor low.</p><p></p><p>For such a seemingly flashy but impractical thing, there are now people in the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance who are willing to take the risk of being liquidated after the incident in order to buy it in advance.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this Empty Bright Flowing Crystal should be related to the sixteen Dao-merging omens of the Dharma transmission and leaving the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room of the Sun family, Li Fan's Tianxuan Mirror origin and the Wuliang Mirror's spying worked together, and quickly detected a series of hidden messages and transaction records related to it.</p><p></p><p>These people did it very secretly and cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Most of them chose to trade face-to-face with standard spirit stones after agreeing on the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, when there were purchases on the Tianxuan Mirror, they would still post the information after getting it, seemingly wanting to sell it. This ensured that a certain amount of Empty Bright Flowing Crystals were always circulating in the Tianxuan Mirror market, and the price did not show large fluctuations as a result.</p><p></p><p>But as it changed hands constantly, the vast majority of the Empty Bright Flowing Crystals on the market were slowly controlled by the same group of people. The so-called transactions were just moving things from the left hand to the right.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad methods, much more pleasing to the eye than my crude manipulation of the market in person."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that they are not doing this kind of thing for the first time either."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan praised, and used the power of the Tianxuan Mirror origin to participate.</p><p></p><p>He had the ability to erase the traces of information in the Tianxuan Mirror at any time. Naturally, he would not be as timid as these dark rats.</p><p></p><p>Recklessly sweeping goods.</p><p></p><p>Not caring about the so-called price at all, making purchases at high prices that no one could refuse.</p><p></p><p>Like a giant whale, setting off huge waves in the Tianxuan Mirror trading market.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the price of Empty Bright Flowing Crystals rose with the tide, skyrocketing.</p><p></p><p>This anomaly naturally attracted the attention of more cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not yet know the true use of Empty Bright Flowing Crystals at this time, it did not prevent them from following the trend and making purchases.</p><p></p><p>The false Tianxuan Mirror identity created by Li Fan's avatar soon received several strange messages.</p><p></p><p>"Which family are you from? Being so presumptuous, do you not want to live?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother, restrain yourself a bit. Don't make it so that none of us have food to eat."</p><p></p><p>"Humph, this old man will advise you, greed is useless. Spit out what you swallowed, only then can we all survive."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replied to all these annoying messages with one sentence: "Very good, I've lured you out. Wait to be liquidated!"</p><p></p><p>And those cultivators on the other side all fell silent in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Upon investigation, quite a few of them had already died mysteriously in this short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"So ruthless even when dealing with their own people."</p><p></p><p>"But they are also a bunch of fools."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not take these people seriously, and was just toying with them.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the acquisition of Kongming Flowing Crystals did not stop.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, this time the reaction of the Wanxian Alliance was unusually fast.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, hurry and collect them!" Sun Luyao sent a warning.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's tail-cutting action had already begun.</p><p></p><p>One by one, Kongming Flowing Crystals were taken out from the Tianxuan Small Mirror, and then the generated identity information was directly erased.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan diverted his attention and slashed out a blade of annihilating black light, directly destroying the Tianxuan Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Tianxuan Mirror, the announcement from the Wanxian Alliance finally arrived belatedly.</p><p></p><p>It was a direct classification of Kongming Flowing Crystals as prohibited circulation items.</p><p></p><p>All those currently held by cultivators would be recovered by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance urged all parties to cooperate with the relevant work. If anyone deliberately obstructed, they would be dealt with as a crime against the alliance.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>When the news came out, it caused shock in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This could be said to be the most severe measure announced by the Wanxian Alliance since its establishment.</p><p></p><p>It was actually for the small, previously almost ignored Kongming Flowing Crystals.</p><p></p><p>What profound mystery did these things have that made the Wanxian Alliance go to such great lengths?</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators who possessed Kongming Flowing Crystals but were unwilling to hand them over simply decomposed and studied them.</p><p></p><p>But as before, there were still no discoveries.</p><p></p><p>And the Wanxian Alliance never intended to stand up and explain from beginning to end, and even directly used more forceful means to block it.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Mirror, no information related to Kongming Flowing Crystals could be found anymore.</p><p></p><p>Members within the alliance system who dared to privately discuss Kongming Flowing Crystals were directly removed from their positions.</p><p></p><p>Those non-system cultivators who gathered to discuss would also be targeted and warned by the martial halls of each state.</p><p></p><p>Such a high-pressure posture let the cultivators of the world know that this time was different from before - Kongming Flowing Crystals had truly become a taboo topic.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Xuanhuang world still cherished their lives.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the Wanxian Alliance was as silent as cicadas in winter.</p><p></p><p>Voices could be suppressed, but how could the doubts and curiosity in their hearts be forever suppressed?</p><p></p><p>The control of the Wanxian Alliance had not yet reached every cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So, in the deep mountain caves far from the immortal cities of each state, in the secret rooms with heavy restrictions in private, there was no lack of discussion about Kongming Flowing Crystals.</p><p></p><p>However, all the Kongming Flowing Crystals in the world had been confiscated.</p><p></p><p>They could only speculate based on imagination.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention only being able to imagine, even if they really had the actual item, it would still be difficult to figure out the true usage method of Kongming Flowing Crystals.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room of the Sun family, even when Li Fan used the Wuliang Mirror to conduct a detailed analysis of the Kongming Flowing Crystals, he did not find their unique characteristics.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Kongming Flowing Crystals are just a more important part of the relevant materials. There should be other steps."</p><p></p><p>After consuming more than a hundred Kongming Flowing Crystals, Li Fan temporarily stopped his research in some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"We can only wait until the alliance completes the Sixteen Harmonies Dao's departure from Xuanhuang, and then find a way to inquire."</p><p></p><p>"But we can make preparations for observation in advance."</p><p></p><p>Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu, who was cultivating with her eyes closed by relying on the resources bestowed by Sun Luyuan, did not notice a black shadow drilling out from her storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The black shadow entered her sea of consciousness and quickly gained control of Wu Ninglu's body.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the soul fragment left by Li Fan's true body before entering the Wanxian Alliance's Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the lurking divine sense, the power of this soul fragment was much stronger.</p><p></p><p>After the divine sense slashed out a sword to destroy the Tianxuan Small Mirror and cut off the clues of being searched, it fell into a weakened state again.</p><p></p><p>But this soul fragment, like a cultivator, could use the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to make up for its own consumption.</p>

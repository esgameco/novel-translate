        <div class="content">
            <p>After listening to Qing's introduction, Li Fan carefully observed the complete operation process of the hourglass again. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a little surprised and delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of national destruction and racial extinction, this group of people from the empire had indeed unleashed unimaginable potential.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan didn't expect that they could actually create such a nearly perfect device.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current discerning eyes, it was difficult to find the shortcomings of this device.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of exotic beast, as well as the hourglass device, still don't have names at present." </p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, do not hesitate to bestow names."</p><p></p><p>After Qing finished speaking, she signaled with her eyes. The imperial princess bowed and then said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Li Fan laughed.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew their little thoughts, Li Fan was extremely pleased at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan had an answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that at the beginning of the universe, yin and yang were divided into two."</p><p></p><p>"The combination of yin and yang gives birth to all things."</p><p></p><p>"It is also said that the Dao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, and three produces all things..."</p><p></p><p>"This exotic beast can be named [Dao One Insect]."</p><p></p><p>"This device..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused slightly, and then said loudly: "It can be named [Heaven and Earth Furnace]!"</p><p></p><p>The three imperial princesses looked at each other, their eyes full of delight.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for bestowing the names!" They said in unison.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan learned more details about the [Heaven and Earth Furnace].</p><p></p><p>The forging of the furnace itself was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient resources, producing tens of thousands of furnaces per day was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Just lead some of the [Dao One Insects] into a new blank furnace, pour in nutrients, and wait for ten days.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Furnace could then continuously generate spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"The only possible hidden danger is that the Dao One Insects may mutate during the process of self-reproduction."</p><p></p><p>"The probability of mutation is extremely small, and the direction is also uncertain. But in any case, it will cause the Heaven and Earth Furnace to malfunction."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, because the Dao One Insects have now been directionally cultivated to an extremely simple structure, any mutant species are not competitive compared to them. So they will always be replaced by those newly born mutants."</p><p></p><p>"In order to ensure that the Dao One Insects always maintain the optimal state of spiritual energy output, as soon as mutant individuals are discovered in the furnace, they must be thoroughly exterminated."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, it is recommended to make more backup cultures of the original Dao One Insects. To prevent large-scale mutation and extinction events."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Even after hundreds of generations of improvement, this defect of the Dao One Insects could never be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>But then again, compared to the benefits they could bring, these shortcomings were almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of replacing the Heaven and Earth Furnace every once in a while.</p><p></p><p>"It can't even be considered a shortcoming."</p><p></p><p>"Seal the furnace with a secret method so that outsiders cannot open it. Every once in a while, the furnace will fail. To use it again, one has to go and find a new furnace..."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the perfect means of control?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it is promoted to the myriad heavens and small worlds, it can greatly reduce the risk of losing control."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan deduced all kinds of possible results, and the joy in his heart grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't show a bit of it on his face.</p><p></p><p>Putting away several Heaven and Earth Furnaces, Li Fan looked at the three imperial princesses.</p><p></p><p>After a suffocating silence.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!"</p><p></p><p>"I am very satisfied with your performance this time!"</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Our Myriad Realms Alliance has always been clear in rewards and punishments. How could we not reward you for your great contributions this time?"</p><p></p><p>"From this day forward, your empire officially becomes a member of the Myriad Realms Alliance."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the phantom image of a faceless stone statue appeared before the three women. </p><p></p><p>After guiding them to complete their oath before the statue, Li Fan also imparted the technique of [Divine Possession].</p><p></p><p>"With the protection of the Demon God, it is sufficient to deal with the various crises that will appear in your empire on a daily basis."</p><p></p><p>The three women all had exceptional talent. Under Li Fan's witness, in just a short while, they each summoned their own divine demon.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the powerful aura of the divine demons, the three couldn't help but feel a bit of joyful surprise.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the most basic reward. After I return and report the gains from this time, the Alliance will send down many more rewards."</p><p></p><p>"Including, but not limited to, the advancement of your cultivation. As well as material support for the empire, and so on."</p><p></p><p>"If possible, you may even have the honor of going to the Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually painted a big picture.</p><p></p><p>"The corresponding reward materials will be settled once every ten years. They will be uniformly delivered to you here."</p><p></p><p>"Although the proportion won't be too large, it will definitely be enough to forge and upgrade your small world here."</p><p></p><p>This was a completely unexpected gain, and the three from the empire were even more delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, our Alliance never mistreats our own people."</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who contributes to the Alliance will receive a hundredfold or thousandfold return."</p><p></p><p>As if to prove these words, Li Fan handed a storage ring to the three imperial women.</p><p></p><p>When Qing clearly saw the materials contained within the storage ring, she couldn't help but shrink her pupils.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly bowed to express her thanks to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, not minding it.</p><p></p><p>"Your performance this time was even better than I expected."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I still have a mission to give you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out from the storage ring that Xuntian Arrow, whose surface formations had been erased, leaving only the hibernating creature at its core.</p><p></p><p>"See if you can research the characteristics of this beast and realize its large-scale breeding."</p><p></p><p>"If you can do this, the Alliance will greatly reward you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>In his expression and tone, the importance he placed on this object was revealed.</p><p></p><p>Qing solemnly took the Xuntian Arrow and observed it for a moment, a look of surprise appearing on her face.</p><p></p><p>However, she still quickly expressed her position: "We will definitely not fail the elder's entrustment!"</p><p></p><p>After explaining some related matters, Li Fan left behind a jade talisman, indicating that they could communicate at any time.</p><p></p><p>He quietly left the small world of the empire.</p><p></p><p>Inside the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>Hong frowned slightly as she looked at Qing: "Qing, this thing seems a bit familiar?"</p><p></p><p>Qing shook her head: "It does indeed resemble that thing from the sect back then. But we can't be certain yet. It needs further study."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Hong asked again: "That Myriad Realms Alliance... what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"When people are the chopping block and we are the fish on it, what can we do? We can only take it one step at a time."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, from their current performance, the other party doesn't seem to be a greatly vicious and evil bunch."</p><p></p><p>The imperial palace was quiet for a little while longer.</p><p></p><p>As if remembering something, Qing suddenly said, "Right, about the Demon God bestowed by the elder..."</p><p></p><p>"Unless absolutely necessary, don't use it."</p><p></p><p>"I always feel there's something strange about it."</p><p></p><p>Hong and the imperial princess both silently nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had already returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, sensed the conversation between the few women through the incarnation of the Demon God's will.</p>

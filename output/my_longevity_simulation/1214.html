            <p>"Actually..." </p><p></p><p>After struggling for a while, Ji Hongdao transmitted his voice: "I also only heard about it by chance, and I don't know if it's true or not. Brother Sun, just take it as a joke. However, it's best not to spread this further."</p><p></p><p>He first made a sufficient disclaimer, and then said with some solemnity: "Actually, among the five Venerable Ones of the Five Elders Council, two of them were originally from our Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"But for some reason..." Ji Hongdao shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan heard this rumor for the first time and was instantly shocked beyond words. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to ask more, but saw the other party gesturing with his hand.</p><p></p><p>So he knew better than to bring it up again.</p><p></p><p>After all, this matter was really too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, the two had already quietly returned to the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>"This trip was in vain, and the problem of your younger brother being attached to that mirror hasn't been solved. What do you plan to do?" Ji Hongdao asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's just take it one step at a time." Sun Luyuan was a bit helpless. </p><p></p><p>"However, Brother Ji, you also said that the formation in the ruins is quite old. It shows that my previous guess was likely wrong. After the catastrophe erupted in the Infinite Mirror, it may subside for a long time. At least for now, it seems my younger brother is safe in the short term."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Hongdao nodded: "I still have official duties to attend to, so I'll take my leave first. If anything comes up, contact me anytime."</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Brother Ji!" Sun Luyuan said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, no need to stand on ceremony." Ji Hongdao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few more pleasantries, he turned into a streak of light and left.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Sun Luyuan's face gradually calmed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, besides the reasons stated earlier, he had his own plans for stopping Ji Hongdao from reporting the discovery of the Grand Wizard's remains.</p><p></p><p>"If the news of discovering the Grand Wizard's remains can really cause a great war between the two sides, as the Immortal Alliance suspects..."</p><p></p><p>A dangerous light flashed in Sun Luyuan's eyes. </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"In the Infinite Mirror's extrapolation, even something like the prosperous Holy Dynasty could fight evenly against the Myriad Immortals Alliance at its peak. If encountered after a great war just ended, with heavy losses..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan absolutely did not expect that he actually had the same thought as a certain someone.</p><p></p><p>After the final shock subsided, this strategy emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>However, after weighing the options, he still gave up the idea of using the Grand Wizard's remains as a chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Bringing this half-immortal into play was simply too high of a risk.</p><p></p><p>And to achieve the same effect, Li Fan still had many other substitutes at his disposal. </p><p></p><p>For example, the matter of Dongji being refined into a puppet.</p><p></p><p>For example, fabricating that the Myriad Immortals Alliance was still hiding a Postmortal Venerable One who was about to transcend.</p><p></p><p>As long as Li Fan wanted, he could stir up a great war in the Xuanhuang Realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the rumor Ji Hongdao mentioned just now on the Crossing Dust Boat, Li Fan slightly frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Among the five Venerable Ones of the Five Elders Council, two were actually members of the Myriad Immortals Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Yet they stood on the opposite side of the Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because of what happened to Dongji, grieving for the dead as if it were their own kin?"</p><p></p><p>"Or, is it because they found out about the Dharma Transmission fragmenting and dividing the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>For such matters, the Myriad Immortals Alliance would naturally try their best to cover it up.</p><p></p><p>Except for those who personally experienced it back then, it would probably be extremely difficult to find relevant written records.</p><p></p><p>After all, despite Li Fan reincarnating so many lifetimes, he knew nothing about this.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>As long as you know, it will always be much easier to go and investigate.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering, the conversation between Sun Luyuan and Sun Luyao had already ended.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, is this method really effective?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, brother, it's almost certain. This also naturally came to me after I saw the Great Dharma Master of Tiandu. I think the Infinite Mirror has a certain connection with the Great Dharma Master," Sun Luyao said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll think of a way. But I've never heard of these Youzu people before, and I think it's also a top secret of the Immortal Alliance. It won't be easy to get one." Sun Luyuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush, brother. I should be able to hold on for a while longer." Sun Luyao comforted with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan sighed slightly and left the secret room directly.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the inspiration for Li Fan's solution to dissipate the wind disaster in the Infinite Mirror came from the previous guess.</p><p></p><p>Divert the trouble!</p><p></p><p>Use an immortal artifact, or something close to an immortal artifact, to attract the hidden catastrophe in the Infinite Mirror out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that the catastrophe of destruction, transferred and spread from the Great Dharma Master of Tiandu to the Infinite Mirror, might indicate that it is particularly sensitive to the existence of the "immortal" level.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps as long as it senses the aura, it will actively launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>Then most of the power inside can be transferred out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Fan could not possibly use a real half-immortal artifact as bait, but it was possible to create some props that could have the aura of immortality.</p><p></p><p>It relied on the condensed essence of source power provided by the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's just for show, it's enough."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter even if it fails, just treat it as a test."</p><p></p><p>In addition to the branch captured by the Shengchao Daqi, the Wanxian Alliance still had a large number of Youzu people in their hands.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could think of a way, with the status and connections of the Sun family, they should be able to get some.</p><p></p><p>However, what really made Li Fan a little worried now was the situation inside the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Since receiving the Dharma transmission message that sixteen Hedao should go out of Xuanhuang, the alliance headquarters had been in a closed state.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be brewing something.</p><p></p><p>"With the foundation of the Wanxian Alliance, it would be easy for them to force the growth of sixteen Hedao."</p><p></p><p>"There is absolutely no need to be closed for so long."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing I can think of that is worth treating with such caution and fear of leaking..."</p><p></p><p>"It is the method to escape from the Immortal Ruins and leave the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>One of the main reasons why the various forces in the Xuanhuang Realm are now honestly lurking is the existence of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>There is no way out.</p><p></p><p>If they knew a way to safely leave the Xuanhuang Realm without knowing the existence of the high walls, quite a few people would definitely do so.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Just like what happened in the Xuanhuang Realm thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>When the great calamity is imminent, everyone flees!</p><p></p><p>"Even the Wanxian Alliance itself has to weigh whether there will be people in the alliance who will take the opportunity to escape."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it's impossible to really make the existence of the high walls known to the public. Otherwise, the world will definitely be in chaos."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan once again drove the Infinite Mirror to spy on the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking that it would be fruitless like before, unexpectedly this time, he actually found some clues.</p><p></p><p>"Kongming flowing crystals, quickly acquire them. Don't make a big show, use hidden hands. Once you get them, destroy them."</p><p></p><p>"Kongming flowing crystals."</p><p></p><p>...</p>

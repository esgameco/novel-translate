        <h1>Chapter 871</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The scene of that downfall was indeed somewhat similar to when Blue Feather faked his death.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth mourned together.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just about helping heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Helping these cultivators who were regarded as allies by heaven and earth would still increase the favorability of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>From a rational perspective, in the Xuanhuang Realm, being a running dog of the Heavenly Dao would absolutely not lead to a good outcome. One would only be suppressed to death by the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators with normal thinking would not make such a choice.</p><p></p><p>But with Huan Zhen's help, Li Fan could be without any worries.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan wasn't really going to be the hatchet man of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to gain her trust.</p><p></p><p>If I do things for you, you should at least lend me some power.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Myriad Immortals Alliance and Five Elders Society are not easy to deal with either.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could successfully trick the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao into giving him some of her remaining power, Li Fan's goal would be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Wanting him to really fight the Myriad Immortals Alliance and Five Elders Society...</p><p></p><p>That was naturally impossible.</p><p></p><p>Once Huan Zhen was there, Li Fan wouldn't owe anyone anything!</p><p></p><p>"It's just a matter of how to gain the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's trust step by step, which still needs long-term planning."</p><p></p><p>"This is absolutely forbidden content, there are no records to refer to. I can only carefully try it myself."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, me pushing the Myriad Immortals Alliance and Five Elders Society to fight each other should also count, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly raised his head, his gaze seeming to pierce through the Lingmu Realm and straight to the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No. Keeping a low profile and working hard without anyone knowing won't gain the recognition of the higher-ups."</p><p></p><p>"Accomplishments that the higher-ups don't know about are the same as not having any."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it can be conveyed to the heavens through Senior Stone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly had an idea in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Many of his schemes were completed while hiding in small worlds, Congyun Sea and other places.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao might not know.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he could go to Senior Stone Tablet more often and tell him about any achievements in detail, no matter how trivial.</p><p></p><p>This way he could not only get familiar with Senior Stone Tablet, but also gain the favorability of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"No, if I do this myself, it might be a bit too deliberate."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I can leave it to Lin Ling."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Lin Ling's naturally silly appearance, Li Fan couldn't help nodding to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan called Tian Yang to him.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had been staying in the Lingmu Realm, helping Shang Tianci and Ou Daozi build the headquarters of the joint association.</p><p></p><p>Even though he never had a moment of rest, Li Fan still found that Tian Yang's strength had improved quite a bit compared to when they had just formed their Dao together.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, let's spar a little."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with a kind expression.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang looked at Li Fan with some suspicion, then looked at his own fists.</p><p></p><p>Then he slowly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be afraid of hurting Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, revealing a hint of the aura belonging to the Five Elements Grand Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>He grinned, seeming delighted by Li Fan's greatly improved strength.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry Junior Brother. My combat power now is not inferior to yours."</p><p></p><p>These words, however, stirred up Tian Yang's competitive spirit. He was immediately eager to try.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around the Lingmu Realm, at the joint association and headquarters buildings that had finally taken some shape after much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Lingmu Realm is not small, it can't withstand the impact of the two of us fighting."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan immediately thought of a suitable place.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>The two, one in front and one behind, left the Lingmu Realm and...</p><p></p><p>After crossing through the lands of four states, they arrived at the present-day territory of Langhuan State.</p><p></p><p>Hidden within this state was a small world known as "Hunyin".</p><p></p><p>During the 115th era, among the many small worlds explored by the Wanxian Alliance, this Hunyin realm was an extremely unique one.</p><p></p><p>For unknown reasons, all the mortals who had migrated into this realm had become extinct.</p><p></p><p>Only countless ghost-like soul shadows were left, drifting between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>These soul entities seemed to be related to the power of space.</p><p></p><p>They were actually a great nourishment for the Rift Whales.</p><p></p><p>After these soul entities disappeared, they would be naturally reborn by heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>They became the Rift Whales' natural and best food source.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, among all the small worlds where Rift Whales existed, the Hunyin realm was where the Rift Whale population thrived the most.</p><p></p><p>The Rift Whales opened up spatial passages day and night, and the Hunyin realm was also the farthest from the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"During the 115th era, the exploration team from the Immortal Alliance that went there directly lost contact. Originally, it was thought that they had met with a tragic end, but unexpectedly, it was because the distance was too far, and even ordinary means of communication had lost their effectiveness."</p><p></p><p>"The vast and boundless void space is just right for me and Tianyang to go all out."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan found the entrance to the Hunyin realm.</p><p></p><p>After setting up a concealment formation around it, Li Fan took the lead and flew inside.</p><p></p><p>A sense of darkness and profoundness instantly surged forth.</p><p></p><p>It was a completely different feeling from flying in the spatial passages leading to Dali and Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>A strange and oppressive atmosphere welled up in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Even the usually somewhat dull-minded Tianyang rarely revealed a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, carefully comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he had a sudden realization: "It's like mortals being in the deep sea..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the distance from the Xuanhuang realm is too far?"</p><p></p><p>"In the previously collected information, this point was not mentioned. No wonder the members of that exploration team were never seen again after returning."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that crossing the endless void is not as easy as I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a long time and temporarily suppressed these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He continued flying along the spatial passage for about half a day.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that it was far enough, he finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, please make your move," Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded, and without saying anything further, an imposing aura appeared.</p><p></p><p>He revealed his red and black world-soul body.</p><p></p><p>His limbs also seemed to be shackled with heavy fetters, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of space."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that his junior brother Tianyang was holding back.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the power of space directly acted on his body, it could instantly tear Li Fan into pieces!</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, I said, use your full strength!"</p><p></p><p>Without trying to break free from the spatial shackles, Li Fan's face turned solemn as he said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan only felt that the space around him became even more profound.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible monster had taken a bite.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's head, hands, and feet instantly disappeared into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Only his bare trunk was left, floating helplessly in the air.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ancient cultivator, in this instant, they would have already perished.</p><p></p><p>But for the new cultivators who had devoured the heavenly caves, it was just a trivial injury.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's trunk instantly exploded into a cloud of blood mist.</p><p></p><p>However, his voice was like rolling thunder, echoing in the void space around Tianyang.</p>

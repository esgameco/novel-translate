        <h1>Chapter 1184</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Through comparing the time flow speed with the Xuanhuang Realm, the Holy Fetus Li Fan could roughly judge the distance to the destination.</p><p></p><p>When the time flow speed ratio between the two sides slowly dropped to three to one, the Holy Fetus Li Fan knew that the unknown existence he sought this time was right ahead.</p><p></p><p>On the way forward, in addition to the dried corpse giant, he also encountered some other things from the ancient destroyed cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>These included, but were not limited to, the corpses of cultivators and the ruins of buildings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even picked up some magic treasures that cultivators had used before.</p><p></p><p>However, after floating in the void for too long, they had all lost their spiritual nature and could not be used.</p><p></p><p>But judging from the way the magic treasures were refined and their appearance characteristics, they came from various different cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>These "miscellaneous items", like garbage, seemed to have stayed here quietly due to a delicate balance reached by the two forces in the void, neither being attracted towards the Immortal Ruins nor being pulled towards the depths of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>As if forgotten by the entire world.</p><p></p><p>The further forward, the more of these pieces of garbage there were in the void.</p><p></p><p>They were all bits of evidence of the existence of different cultivation realms in the past.</p><p></p><p>Not sure if these miscellaneous items were still tainted with the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters, the Holy Fetus Li Fan dared not touch them.</p><p></p><p>He only controlled the puppets and sword bodies to constantly dodge.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the speed inevitably slowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I guessed right. The closer to the power of that starry sea, the weaker the influence of the [Sole] Mantra on me."</p><p></p><p>"I have temporarily escaped the danger of being devoured."</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>After all, the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Although not completely eroded, the Holy Fetus Li Fan also felt various changes in his behavior and thoughts.</p><p></p><p>For example, thoughts of avoiding the world and staying away from everything would suddenly surge in his mind for no reason.</p><p></p><p>For another example, the Black Sword Heaven's Wonder, the foundation of his cultivation, actually had a hint of estrangement from him.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the secular world, this was simply an unimaginable thing.</p><p></p><p>You should know that after the Holy Fetus Li Fan devoured it and turned it into his own Dao foundation, they were equivalent to being one entity.</p><p></p><p>The person is like the sword, and the sword is like the person.</p><p></p><p>But the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters could forcibly restore this fusion.</p><p></p><p>"Utterly alone and solitary?"</p><p></p><p>"Loneliness?"</p><p></p><p>Will this power of loneliness affect the True Body and [Huan Zhen]?</p><p></p><p>Although the status of [Huan Zhen] is high enough, it cannot withstand the fact that the True Body's strength is currently not satisfactory!</p><p></p><p>Even if there was only this possibility, it was a risk that Li Fan could not bear.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan slowly made some resolutions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I waste the opportunity of this exploration, I cannot let the power of loneliness affect the True Body."</p><p></p><p>"Before there are signs, I have to end my own life in advance."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, the Holy Fetus Li Fan swallowed the last nourishing divine soul treasure, then activated the Soul Burning Decision.</p><p></p><p>The speed suddenly soared, shuttling rapidly through the gaps of the ubiquitous garbage in the void.</p><p></p><p>These relics from the ancient cultivation realms formed an endless sea, seemingly without an end.</p><p></p><p>The nourishing power in his body was almost exhausted, but he still could not break out of the scope of this sea.</p><p></p><p>"These miscellaneous items can be preserved..."</p><p></p><p>"Then, could the remnants of the past cultivation realms also be preserved relatively intact?"</p><p></p><p>Wandering in this ocean of relics, the Holy Fetus Li Fan suddenly remembered the Dharma transmission and Celestial Doctor from</p><p></p><p>In the starry sea, the act of transporting world fragments and mending the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was deep in thought, Li Fan suddenly felt a tightness in his heart, because he actually sensed a divine consciousness locking onto him from the void!</p><p></p><p>He shouted and looked towards the source of the lock.</p><p></p><p>The locking sensation disappeared in an instant, and he only saw a blurry figure, flashing quickly and disappearing into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan looked grim as he arrived at the position where the figure had originally appeared.</p><p></p><p>"It's not some mysterious and strange existence, but a living person?"</p><p></p><p>"In the darkest starry sea, apart from the Xuanhuang Realm, there are actually other surviving immortal cultivation civilizations?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Not only because he sensed the aura of that figure, but more importantly, the other party had actively left a message.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's view, it seemed a bit inexplicable, and it was quite obvious that only a cultivator could display such a divine sense imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Bingsan, the first day of the seventh month?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at these short two sentences and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"It should be some kind of code. But this is the common language of the immortal cultivation world, and it's definitely a surviving cultivator, without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>Although this trip had not yet allowed him to see the mighty power of the starry sea that caused the Xuanhuang tremor, knowing that there were other sparks of civilization in the starry sea was already of great significance to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Over the years, in order to survive in the darkest starry sea, apart from ensuring the resources for survival, the most important thing is to be able to resist the suction force of the immortal ruins. And this place is located at the delicate balance point of two forces, creating a safe zone."</p><p></p><p>"This also means..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's eyes flickered as he looked at the divine sense imprint of the unknown cultivator, and he was very cautious not to respond.</p><p></p><p>"The mighty power of the starry sea that can contend with the immortal ruins did not suddenly appear recently."</p><p></p><p>"Rather, it suddenly erupted strongly due to some changes. Only then was it sensed by the Xuanhuang Realm far outside the immortal ruins."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The figures of the immortal ruins and the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate appeared in front of Li Fan's eyes again.</p><p></p><p>These two had traveled in the darkest starry sea for a long time and obviously couldn't be unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Due to the power of loneliness, the Holy Fetus Li Fan's somewhat indifferent heart, after learning of the new spark of civilization, once again became restless.</p><p></p><p>But it was forcibly suppressed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Even though there has been no contact with them yet, being able to survive in such a harsh environment, they are obviously not easy to get along with."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in the darkest starry sea, the laws are more complete than in the Xuanhuang Realm. The upper limit is higher, and these people have been here for so long..."</p><p></p><p>"Their strength cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had no intention of worrying about the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm was full of monsters, and there was also the blessing of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's new method.</p><p></p><p>While in this sea of ruins, resources were scarce. If the two sides really fought, the Xuanhuang Realm would definitely crush them.</p><p></p><p>"I was overthinking. The distance is so far that even meeting would be a luxury if not for a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Temporarily putting aside the idea of pitting the two surviving civilizations in the darkest starry sea against each other.</p><p></p><p>The problem now facing Li Fan was that he was running out of time.</p><p></p><p>Should he continue to advance deeper into the sea of ruins to find the source of the mighty power of the starry sea?</p><p></p><p>Or should he try to make contact with the civilization here?</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, after a brief contemplation, the Holy Fetus Li Fan made his decision.</p><p></p><p>He chose the latter.</p><p></p><p>"They have lived here for a long time and must have a better understanding of that mighty power of the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than running around like a headless fly, it's better to ask people."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p>

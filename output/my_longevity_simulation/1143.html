        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1141: Time Leaves Gaps</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, those specks of light seemed like numerous tiny windows.</p><p></p><p>Through the windows, various scenes were refracted to different degrees.</p><p></p><p>Countless characters were flying around, clearly forming different cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Below the dome, there were no guardian hall disciples to be seen, only streams of light constantly shuttling through the space.</p><p></p><p>The Sun family patriarch, Sun Xingyao, seemed to be reporting the situation to someone. Before long, a figure flew down from the dome and landed in front of Li Fan and his companion.</p><p></p><p>The figure was entirely formed by flowing characters, not a real person.</p><p></p><p>He looked Li Fan up and down and nodded slightly, "I saw this little fellow over a hundred years ago when he was still a Golden Core cultivator. In the blink of an eye, he has grown so much..."</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>With that, the characters paved a path leading straight to the dome.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed Sun Xingyao and stood on this path of characters. After a moment, his body seemed to also transform into countless characters, ready to scatter into a piece of writing on the path.</p><p></p><p>A sense of crisis suddenly arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realized that under the influence of the surrounding characters, the memories in his soul seemed to involuntarily diffuse outwards, writing chapters of his past life.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a method of peering into the past experiences of visitors by perceiving the memories in their souls?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then instantly replayed the memories of the first half of Sun Ang's life, whom he had possessed, in his soul. He then released them outwards to be perceived by the surrounding character path.</p><p></p><p>The transformed characters had unique personal quality markers, clearly distinct from the path underfoot.</p><p></p><p>As for Sun Xingyao, he didn't seem to be subjected to any examination.</p><p></p><p>The character path quickly reached its end, and the two arrived inside a starlight window above the dome.</p><p></p><p>Their forms changed back from characters to human, but Li Fan's experiences were separately turned into a volume.</p><p></p><p>The disciple leading the way now revealed his true appearance.</p><p></p><p>He looked even younger than "Sun Ang", with the appearance of a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy.</p><p></p><p>Long hair draped over his shoulders, with a cinnabar mark between his brows. He appeared delicate and gentle.</p><p></p><p>"This is Elder Nangong of the Guardian Hall," Sun Xingyao introduced to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Nangong glanced at the volume in his hand and nodded slightly, "No issues. He has passed the first test."</p><p></p><p>With a casual toss, the volume recording "Sun Ang's" life turned into a stream of light and flew off to an unknown place.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like they were in the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm, with a giant glowing sphere floating ahead.</p><p></p><p>It looked just like the miniature model of the Xuanhuang Realm that Li Fan had seen in the long-distance teleportation array before.</p><p></p><p>"Pass through the [Xuanhuang Realm]. If you don't cause the sphere to vibrate, you'll pass the second test," Nangong said, taking the lead and transforming into a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed closely without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>As he left, he even felt a faint sense of reluctance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also keenly noticed that the circulation speed of his [Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra] had increased several times faster than usual!</p><p></p><p>"This is to verify if one is a native cultivator of the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly had a realization in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The third test was to verify if one belonged to the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>In the void, five stone statues with obscured faces surrounded them in a circle.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan needed to stand still for half an hour within the encirclement of the statues.</p><p></p><p>If there were no abnormalities during this period, he would pass the test.</p><p></p><p>In this life, Li Fan was clean and clear. He had not yet formed any connections with the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>So he naturally passed with ease.</p><p></p><p>"These few stone statues have some tricks. They actually seem to be imbued with a trace of the Five Celestial Venerables' power of reverse principles..."</p><p></p><p>While being observed by the stone statues of the Five Elders Council, Li Fan was also observing these five Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he sensed in his heart: "Even if it's not the Celestial Venerables personally arriving, it can't be too far off."</p><p></p><p>"If I came here after experiencing Senior Sister Zhao's illusion, even if only my avatar had the experience..."</p><p></p><p>"It would likely trigger a reaction from the stone statues."</p><p></p><p>As the five stone statues dispersed, Li Fan also faced the final test before taking up his post.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings suddenly fell into a void.</p><p></p><p>Sun Xingyao and Elder Nangong, who were just by his side, suddenly vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly furrowed his brows and scanned left and right.</p><p></p><p>He didn't detect any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't any trap, nor was there any conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>Here, it was simply a place of pure nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Li Fan, nothing else existed.</p><p></p><p>"What is this testing again?"</p><p></p><p>Standing in the void, he wondered what tricks the Dharma Protector Hall was playing.</p><p></p><p>In the void, even time seemed to lose its meaning.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period, even with Li Fan's level of patience, he started to feel a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had been forgotten by the entire world, and everything in the world besides himself had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Elder Nangong still showed no signs of appearing.</p><p></p><p>"They wouldn't just leave me hanging here like this, right?"</p><p></p><p>Due to his innate distrust of others, this thought couldn't help but arise in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He even had the idea of revealing his true cultivation level, breaking through the mechanism here, and directly leaving.</p><p></p><p>However, in an instant, Li Fan suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>Calming his emotions, Li Fan opened the Huan Zhen panel.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that it was still anchored at 8 years, in an instant, all the unease and anxiety completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>He continued waiting in the void.</p><p></p><p>After what seemed like hundreds or thousands of years had passed, Li Fan suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>He began to show some impatience.</p><p></p><p>No longer quietly standing in place, he flew around and explored, looking like he wanted to find a way out.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan slowly began to amplify the emotions he revealed.</p><p></p><p>However, he never showed any loss of control, only revealing some negative emotions.</p><p></p><p>Like this, another seeming hundreds of thousands of years passed...</p><p></p><p>Finally, light returned to the dark void.</p><p></p><p>Elder Nangong and Sun Xingyao reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly squinted his eyes, putting on the appearance of someone feeling like an eternity had passed. He even carefully looked at the two, as if pondering their identities.</p><p></p><p>"You've also passed this final test." A hint of a smile finally appeared on Elder Nangong's face.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, he praised: "Your state of mind is not bad. In the time crevice, over two hundred years passed before signs of loss of control faintly appeared. And you were still able to maintain your rationality. This result is quite good among all the tests."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Li Fan remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be digesting this news.</p><p></p><p>Elder Nangong continued to explain: "This test is to examine the mental stability of the cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"After all, one must accompany the Dharma Orb for over three hundred years, and cannot leave midway for any reason. If one can't endure this torment at that time and goes crazy, it would be troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly asked: "Have there been any cultivators who remained very calm from start to finish, not showing any irritation?"</p><p></p><p>There's still one more 15-minute chapter.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1157: An Unconventional Xuantian Artifact</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu didn't know the specific name or form of the Sun family's most precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the Sun family's rise to power, the ability of this treasure was likely related to deduction and foresight!</p><p></p><p>More than a thousand years ago, the Sun family was just an ordinary small cultivation clan. </p><p></p><p>The strongest member in the clan was only at the Yuanying stage.</p><p></p><p>But from a certain day onwards, the Sun family seemed to have a sudden turn of fortune. Not only did they consecutively break through several Huashen stages, they also serendipitously saved a severely injured Hedao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of this Hedao master, the Sun family rose to prominence from then on.</p><p></p><p>The sudden rise of the Sun family naturally attracted the attention of many forces. On the surface, it seemed to be purely due to luck.</p><p></p><p>But not everyone thought so.</p><p></p><p>Especially the forces behind the scenes that had schemed to ambush the Hedao cultivator rescued by the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>It was also the mastermind who instructed Wu Ninglu to infiltrate the Sun family at the cost of her charms.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family, one of the largest families in Tianquan Prefecture. Many family members were proficient in alchemy and held important positions in the Alchemy Hall of the Wanxian Alliance. </p><p></p><p>At that time, it was just because of an old grudge that they planned to put that Hedao cultivator to death. But the plan that should have been foolproof was ruined by a small Yuanying cultivator!</p><p></p><p>After elimination, it was confirmed that there were no leakers. Moreover, on the day of the incident, that Yuanying cultivator from the Sun family suddenly crossed several prefectures through a teleportation array and waited on the escape route of the severely injured Hedao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>As if he had known in advance that this would happen!</p><p></p><p>All of this was too abnormal. From then on, the Chen family set their sights on the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Under the Immortal Alliance system, although the strength of the two families was vastly different, the Chen family did not dare to directly kill and seize the treasure. Especially after that severely injured Hedao cultivator recovered, he vaguely suspected that it was the Chen family who made the move.</p><p></p><p>And by the time the Chen family had settled all the troubles and came to their senses,</p><p></p><p>The Sun family had long established connections with the bigwigs at the Immortal Alliance headquarters, and had also relocated from an outer prefecture to Tianquan Prefecture. There was also a Hedao cultivator born in the family.</p><p></p><p>The rise of the Sun family was too fast. The series of coincidences on their path to success made the Chen family even more convinced that the Sun family must be hiding some incredible treasure.</p><p></p><p>But the Sun family acted very cautiously. After their foundation gradually stabilized, they rarely used that treasure.</p><p></p><p>Although the Chen family coveted it, they simply couldn't find a suitable opportunity to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Even the clan had gradually forgotten about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Until more than 50 years ago, the Sun family made another big splash in the Wanxian Alliance, which rekindled their sealed memories.</p><p></p><p>On the way to the Dharma Protector Hall at the Immortal Alliance headquarters, just by brushing past each other, the Sun family patriarch recognized the identity of a Five Elders Society spy who had infiltrated.</p><p></p><p>He directly confronted him and fought with him.</p><p></p><p>This matter naturally alarmed the higher-ups of the Immortal Alliance, who captured them both. After an investigation, it was discovered that the Sun family patriarch's identification was actually true!</p><p></p><p>That Five Elders Society spy carried the Jingfa Jade Tablet and was ordered to use the "Evil Curse" to attack Yan Fazhu.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was discovered in time, avoiding a disaster!</p><p></p><p>After this incident, the Sun family further developed their influence in the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>After investigating past events, that Five Elders Society spy had always been well-hidden. Even his close friends and relatives had never suspected his identity.</p><p></p><p>But it was such a seemingly perfect spy</p><p></p><p>The spy was recognized by the Sun family patriarch at a glance!</p><p></p><p>Although in the subsequent interrogation, the Sun family patriarch insisted that it was his intuition, and the Wanxian Alliance, after a thorough investigation, ruled out the possibility of the Five Elders Association staging the incident themselves. The occurrence of this matter still left many people puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it had to be attributed to the Sun family's "good fortune".</p><p></p><p>However, the few elders of the Chen family who still had memories of the incident back then immediately recalled their speculations at that time.</p><p></p><p>After this, a conspiracy surrounding the Sun family's treasure slowly unfolded.</p><p></p><p>After decades of continuous probing, the Chen family had already grasped several important clues.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, this treasure may not be complete, and over the years, the Sun family had been secretly searching for something.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, every time the treasure unleashed its power, it seemed to require some kind of replenishment. Every time the Sun family displayed a stunning performance, the Sun family patriarch would mysteriously disappear for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, the activation of the treasure seemed to come at the cost of consuming the Sun family's bloodline. Over the years, several descendants of the Sun family had disappeared without a trace, leaving no corpse to be found.</p><p></p><p>Although they had obtained a lot of information, the Chen family had been hesitating to make a move to seize it. Naturally, it was because of the treasure's suspected ability to "know the future without divination".</p><p></p><p>If they failed, they would instead expose themselves. Perhaps they would forever miss the chance to obtain this supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>Until recently, the Chen family, who had been waiting anxiously, finally ushered in the best opportunity for a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The secret agent discovered the whereabouts of the Sun family patriarch. It seemed that he was slightly injured while helping to replenish the treasure. To prevent accidents, he should stop going out and return home as soon as possible to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>The treasure was in a cooling-off period, and the strongest patriarch of the Sun family was seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>This was simply a heaven-sent opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Chen family, at the risk of being discovered, ordered to contact Wu Ninglu and pay close attention to the movements of the Sun family patriarch.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the grudge between the two families to have lasted for nearly a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who understood the ins and outs of the matter, couldn't help but become more interested in the so-called Sun family's treasure.</p><p></p><p>It was simply because the Sun family patriarch's several performances had too many similarities with Li Fan's past actions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan twisted everything through Huanzhen to achieve prescience.</p><p></p><p>What kind of ability would the Sun family's treasure have?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't have to wait long.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Wu Ninglu's body and locking onto her location, Li Fan quietly infiltrated to her side.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Sun family patriarch was very cautious, the formations and restrictions he had set up were all seemingly non-existent in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest perception of a split soul, it had already followed him into the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan, the Sun family patriarch and a Hedao cultivator, actually coughed up a few strands of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>However, regardless of his injuries, his eyes were full of heartache as he took out an object and carefully placed it back in its original position.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he cut open a wound on his wrist and used fresh blood to perform a sacrificial refinement.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan saw this item, both his true body and avatar, which were thousands of miles away, trembled slightly at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>The small mirror that Sun Luyuan nourished with fresh blood looked remarkably similar to the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>However, in previous encounters, the light representing the power of the Tianxuan Mirror was mostly green.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the small mirror in the secret room emitted an eerie black glow.</p><p></p><p>There may be one more chapter around 1:30 AM. Don't wait for it.</p>

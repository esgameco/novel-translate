            <p>Then he asked him, "Hey, young man, what are you looking at?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, what Li Fan cared about was something else.</p><p></p><p>As they say, there is no smoke without fire.</p><p></p><p>Only matters of concern will lead to elaborate cover-ups.</p><p></p><p>If one truly doesn't care, why bother using tactics to deceive others?</p><p></p><p>In the thousands of years of history in the mysterious yellow world, there were countless geniuses and talents.</p><p></p><p>Certainly, there were numerous cultivators, like Li Fan just now, who were on the verge of realizing something due to fortuitous circumstances.</p><p></p><p>But they have all been forcefully suppressed by unknown means.</p><p></p><p>This precisely shows that the previous method of passing down knowledge made even the cultivators in the mysterious yellow world aware of this matter, with a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>The method of passing down knowledge, with the power of one person, changed the landscape of the world, overturning the situation of new and old methods.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, it oppressed the world, making all cultivators behave like cattle and horses.</p><p></p><p>Even such figures had things that gave them pause?</p><p></p><p>"Although it is not quite to the point of fear, the concerns in his heart are unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan, who had understood these thoughts, became genuinely interested in the hidden secrets behind them.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, the method to resist the passing down of methods is within this."</p><p></p><p>"A secret, perhaps can forever deceive some people, perhaps temporarily deceive everyone."</p><p></p><p>"But it absolutely cannot deceive everyone forever."</p><p></p><p>"In this mysterious yellow world, I have enough time to find and explore it."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, I might not be alone."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gazed at the sky, silent.</p><p></p><p>Those who do not plan for the future are not worthy of the present. The Supreme Elder who passed down the method of knowledge, as the most formidable obstacle on his path to longevity, was an existence Li Fan would inevitably have to face.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had fortuitously discovered a possible flaw, it was a stroke of luck for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The world is always full of coincidences. Just like when I was suddenly seized by the decaying wood and then inexplicably released."</p><p></p><p>"Just like my sudden realization just now..."</p><p></p><p>"Itâ€™s inevitable."</p><p></p><p>"But with my 'Huanzhen,' I can eliminate the negative impacts brought by coincidences as much as possible, magnifying their good effects infinitely."</p><p></p><p>With various thoughts surging, Li Fan calmed down after a long while.</p><p></p><p>He focused his attention back on the sixteen golden pellets in his hand.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a while, Li Fan decided to return to the Cloud Sea through the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Using the same old trick, he dug a hidden chamber deep below the sea and hid inside.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any possible spying from Wood Daoist.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear if it was Li Fan's illusion or just his pure psychological effect, but once he returned to the Cloud Sea, he felt much calmer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Holding his breath, concentrating his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out the remaining sixteen pellets and laid them out in a row.</p><p></p><p>Choosing one of slightly inferior quality, Li Fan fed it to Huanzhen once again.</p><p></p><p>As expected, after Huanzhen absorbed it, there was no visible change in the progress of the sixth anchoring charge.</p><p></p><p>"Huanzhen's appetite is getting bigger and bigger."</p><p></p><p>"From foundation-building oddities to golden pellets."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that next, it will devour the essence of cave heavens and the marrow of the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's expression couldn't help but change slightly.</p><p></p><p>Golden pellets were manageable; various means could acquire some. As for cave heavens and the marrow of the heavens...</p><p></p><p>They were inherent treasures of the mysterious yellow world, with limited quantities.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were eagerly waiting; once they appeared, they would be crazily snatched up.</p><p></p><p>Where could he possibly get extra to feed to Huanzhen?</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought that after this life ended, I would use one pellet. Then, starting from the Nascent Soul realm, I would repeatedly cycle through reincarnation to accumulate strength..."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems it's better to be more cautious. Anyway, now that I have understood the location of the 'Root of the Heavens and Earth,' even if I start over, it will be a well-trodden path."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan contemplated, he decided not to feed Huanzhen anymore.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he held one of the remaining golden pellets in his hand and absorbed it slowly.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a single law golden pellet, it contained a rare form of bewitchment method related to mental power, which was exactly what Li Fan urgently needed to replenish.</p><p></p><p>He who learns from others would improve. Although it was not a defensive method, the path led to the same destination. Having a deep understanding of mental attack methods, he would be better prepared next time.</p><p></p><p>For better insights, Li Fan also invoked the power of the Dao Domain, revealing the attributes of the extraordinary object, the "Seven Orifices Exquisite Heart," once again.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, various insights surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immersed himself in them, overwhelmed with joy.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was in seclusion, the atmosphere in the Cloud Sea was somewhat turbulent.</p><p></p><p>Although the battle at Tianling Zhou had ended, the cultivators were still recuperating.</p><p></p><p>However, not long ago, a decree from the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance had caused a huge uproar in the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Due to the heavy losses in the battle, the alliance decided to sell all cultivation techniques at a fifty percent discount starting immediately to aid the recovery of living forces, lasting for a year.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, advanced cultivation techniques that had previously required merit levels to purchase were all unsealed.</p><p></p><p>There were no longer restrictions; as long as one had a contribution score, they could buy directly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were necessary restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Each person was limited to purchasing one, only for personal cultivation, and not to be transferred or sold in any way.</p><p></p><p>If found violating the rules, not only would the right to cultivate the technique be revoked, but severe punishment would also be imposed on the rule-breaker.</p><p></p><p>For most cultivators who couldn't even afford to buy a cultivation technique after going broke, these restrictions were better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>Their attention was now completely captivated by the dazzling list of techniques in the Ten Thousand Immortals Mirror.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivation techniques were the foundation of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The quality of the techniques one cultivated directly determined their future.</p><p></p><p>No comparison meant no harm.</p><p></p><p>However, when these formerly restricted techniques appeared in the public eye, the cultivators realized how inferior the common techniques they had cultivated before were in comparison!</p><p></p><p>Opportunities were rare; missing them was not an option!</p><p></p><p>So the cultivators began to feel envious.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the contributions they could offer, they eagerly picked out and purchased the techniques they desired.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Sea was now bustling with numerous cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They surrounded the Ministry of Administration angrily, demanding an explanation from He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple: they had almost invested all their assets in Li Fan's fundraising plan.</p><p></p><p>With only a small reserve left, how could they afford to purchase techniques now?</p><p></p><p>Rare techniques were in front of them, and the cultivators were not inclined to give way to each other.</p><p></p><p>As they watched one technique after another being chosen, the mentality of these cultivators started to crumble.</p>

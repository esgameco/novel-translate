        <h1>Chapter 1056</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1054: The Shocking Truth</p><p></p><p>"Collectibles, huh..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought of those cultivators who were rescued by the Dharma Transmitter Zhou. In their eyes, Dharma Transmitter Zhou was a true savior-like existence. There were problems with the high-level members of the Immortal Alliance, and there was a need to set things right and recreate the world. The Dharma Transmitter was undoubtedly the leader.</p><p></p><p>However, these passionate cultivators probably never imagined...</p><p></p><p>In Dharma Transmitter Zhou's eyes, rather than being comrades who could work together, they were more like collectibles.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not very surprised. </p><p></p><p>After learning about many deeds of the Dharma Transmitters from Mo Rubin, Li Fan no longer had any hopes for this group.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the "degeneration of the Dharma Transmitter Council" mentioned by Dharma Transmitter Zhou was merely a difference in ideals.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan collected his thoughts and said proudly, "Wanting to make me a collectible..."</p><p></p><p>"Let alone you, even the Dharma Transmitter may not be qualified!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the expressions of Dharma Transmitter Zhou and Wei changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>Although they had now left the Dharma Transmitter Council, in their hearts, the status of the Dharma Heavenly Venerable was always unshakable.</p><p></p><p>Killing intent instantly locked onto Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But soon, with a vague and indistinct faceless stone statue phantom floating above Li Fan's head, the killing intent in the eyes of these two Dharma Transmitters turned into shock.</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect?!" </p><p></p><p>They naturally knew the origin of this stone statue. Dharma Transmitter Zhou immediately looked at Li Fan and exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Although Dharma Transmitter Wei was not overly flustered, his expression was solemn. His aura instantly became as deep as an abyss, slightly revealing the true power belonging to a Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>"No, no." Seeing the other party treating him as a formidable enemy, Li Fan immediately shook his head in denial.</p><p></p><p>"I am not a demon from the Xuantian Sect. It's just that we serve the same master." Li Fan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>The two Dharma Transmitters were instantly a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly recounted the story he had already fabricated: "Back when the Immortal Path collapsed, thanks to the master's intervention and rescue, the Xuantian Sect had the opportunity to rise later. It's a pity that the demons of the Xuantian Sect were fickle and actually dared to betray the master!"</p><p></p><p>"Without the master's support, the Xuantian Sect was indeed destroyed not long after. But there were still some remnants surviving..."</p><p></p><p>"To deal with traitors, we must fight to the death. For ten thousand years, we have never given up the pursuit and killing of the remnants of the Xuantian Sect. Now, there are only a few final targets left..." Li Fan's eyes showed a vicissitudes of life, sighing slightly.</p><p></p><p>These words directly made the two Dharma Transmitters somewhat uncertain.</p><p></p><p>They could vaguely discern that the young man in front of them was at most about thirty-four years old.</p><p></p><p>But what he mentioned, the collapse of the Immortal Path, the Xuantian Sect, was a distant past even earlier than the reign of the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>It was definitely not something an ordinary young cultivator could know.</p><p></p><p>Even the meaning behind this made the two Dharma Transmitters not dare to be negligent.</p><p></p><p>After communicating secretly for a while, it was still Dharma Transmitter Zhou who finally asked, "Since your mission is to kill the remnants of the Xuantian Sect, why are you interested in what happened at our Wanxian Alliance headquarters?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved, and he instantly feigned surprise: "What, you don't know yet? The culprit behind that disturbance was a surviving Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect from back then!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This is somewhat different from what I know..." Dharma Transmitter Zhou looked slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. The ability of that Dharma King is to completely possess and transform into another person..." Li Fan suddenly seemed to remember something and abruptly spoke up to remind them.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Dharma Transmitter Zhou's face instantly became somewhat intriguing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, she muttered to herself, "If this is really the case, then it would make sense. The few of them had no reason to do this. Now it seems that they have likely been possessed and taken over by someone."</p><p></p><p>"To think they could break through the protective measures left to us by the Venerable Heavenly Sovereign. The demons of the Xuantian Sect are truly somewhat unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Wei spoke with a profound gaze, "Possessed by the demons of the Xuantian Sect? This might be an opportunity for us."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've already laid it out honestly. Surely you don't still want to conceal it? In terms of capturing the remnants of the Xuantian Sect, I think our positions are consistent. There should be room for mutual cooperation." Li Fan frowned slightly, his tone a bit impatient.</p><p></p><p>Such lack of composure was very much in line with his youthful appearance.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou didn't mind, and instead recounted to Li Fan what had happened that day at the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, it was the previously agreed upon foundation-laying moment for the 【Xuantian Spirit Sealing】 Formation."</p><p></p><p>"This formation can be used to completely control the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, which is crucial for the Wanxian Alliance. So on that day, more than half of the Dharma Transmitters attended. The Mirror Holder lineage also sent several representatives to participate."</p><p></p><p>After briefly explaining to Li Fan the differences in origins between the Dharma Transmitters and Mirror Holders, Dharma Transmitter Zhou continued, "The location of the formation foundation-laying ceremony was right inside the Alliance headquarters. This matter was extremely confidential, so on that day, besides this group of people, only the formation masters responsible for operating the formation were present."</p><p></p><p>"The remaining guard forces were all waiting outside the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>"They were all the core of the core within the Alliance, and there shouldn't have been any mishaps."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou had a solemn expression, "Just at the moment when the Xuantian Spirit Sealing Formation was about to take shape, someone in the Dharma Transmitter Council suddenly erupted and launched an attack on the other Dharma Transmitters."</p><p></p><p>"The few Mirror Holders in attendance also suddenly made their move."</p><p></p><p>"You should know, among us Dharma Transmitters, besides Jiang, the others' strengths are all on par with each other. Caught off guard, several Dharma Transmitters were controlled."</p><p></p><p>"The chaos of the battle quickly alerted the guard forces outside the secret realm, but faced with the internal strife of the Dharma Transmitters, they were also dumbfounded for a while. They didn't know who they should listen to."</p><p></p><p>"Helping either side was not an option, so the vast majority of them stayed put and waited to see the outcome of the fight."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitters went all out in their confrontation, and the battle became increasingly fierce. Even the space of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror itself, where the Alliance headquarters was located, could barely withstand that kind of power."</p><p></p><p>"The chaos lasted for a good half a day. In the end, the five people led by Dharma Transmitter Chen emerged victorious."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou named the five individuals one by one.</p><p></p><p>What shocked Li Fan to the core was that among these five people, there was actually Dharma Transmitter Feng!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Feng was the young Dharma Transmitter who had been possessed by Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced, and a terrifying idea instantly surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I searched almost the entire Xuanhuang Realm and couldn't find any trace of Mo Rubin and the others."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out he didn't flee in panic at all..."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, he directly took control of the Wanxian Alliance by occupying someone else's position!"</p>

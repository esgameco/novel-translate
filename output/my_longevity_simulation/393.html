        <div class="content">
            <p>"As for what 'it' is that lurks in the sky above Yuandaozhou, perhaps only when I reach the status of a venerable figure in the future could I explore it to the depths," Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>"Before that, let's just walk around it," he decided.</p><p></p><p>A matter of the heart was temporarily settled.</p><p></p><p>As this world was on the verge of ending, Li Fan took stock of his current situation.</p><p></p><p>For over a decade of uninterrupted days of arranging formations, Li Fan, with the secret technique of 'Huadao Shenyi,' had not neglected other matters.</p><p></p><p>He finally completed reading the 'Tianyi Xianjing'.</p><p></p><p>From this magnificent masterpiece, Li Fan could also vaguely grasp the thoughts of Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi believed that all things in the world could be healed.</p><p></p><p>From rocks, grass, and trees, to birds and beasts, humans, mountains, rivers, lakes, seas, and even the world itself.</p><p></p><p>Before a true 'healer,' there was no essential distinction.</p><p></p><p>In medical practice, progress comes from accumulation and persistence.</p><p></p><p>With perseverance, one could transform from a healer of people to a healer of the world.</p><p></p><p>Although the 'Tianyi Xianjing' did not mention any methods of cultivation, hidden within the words, there seemed to be many profound secrets.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that my talent is still lacking a bit. If one is truly a genius, they might be able to discern a technique from it."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps one could make a breakthrough by using a borrowed seed," Li Fan thought with narrowed eyes, a difficult idea flashing through his mind. </p><p></p><p>Soon after, he suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, the risk is still too high."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyi is mysterious and unfathomable. If he were to discover the existence of the 'Tianyi Xianjing' in the world, it might cause unforeseen changes."</p><p></p><p>"Studying it myself will only take a bit more time."</p><p></p><p>Combining the understanding of sentient beings in the 'Tianyi Xianjing,' Li Fan continuously modified and improved the 'Zaohua Honglu Gong' (Creation Furnace Art).</p><p></p><p>"The 'Eternal Remembrance of Tianyang Zhenren' has one last chance to use it. Currently, I don't have much assurance of success in strategizing, but when the time comes, I will give it one final try."</p><p></p><p>"I have gradually grasped the essence of Zhang Zhiliang's 'Infinite Law' over the years. Through continuous formations, my formation skills have made significant progress. Combining theory with practice, even an ordinary Yuan Ying Formation Master might not surpass my level now."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the 'Xuanhuang Lianxin Mantra' and the 'Life and Death Xuangong,' when used together, they can rapidly increase the strength of one's soul. Although I am still in the process of recovery since the initial test, the one thing I have in abundance is time."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The blue crystals in his sea of consciousness emitted a dazzling blue light.</p><p></p><p>Empowered by secret techniques, despite his extensive knowledge, Li Fan remained composed.</p><p></p><p>"Besides what I already know, there are two more things that can be very useful to me."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan used his hand as a brush and, in the empty space in front of him, wrote the character "Chaos" in one stroke.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that an unusual energy was gathering towards the trail of the brush strokes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closely watched the changes taking place.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, perhaps due to insufficient comprehension, the character for "Chaos" ultimately failed to materialize.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of persistence, everything dissipated, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos..."</p><p></p><p>He waved the Five Elements Annihilation Sword, erasing any remnants of the character, and immersed himself in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>This "Chaos" character was inspired by the stone inscribed with the character "Chaos" that Li Fan encountered in the new life mystery realm where he was once trapped.</p><p></p><p>By imitating the "Chaos" character, Li Fan could open the passage in the mystery realm and escape.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan always felt afterwards that the character "Chaos" was not merely a simple trigger for the passage.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre scenes in the center of the mystery realm seemed inseparable from it.</p><p></p><p>"If I can comprehend it, no..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that just by reproducing this 'Chaos' character, it can also become a divine technique comparable to my Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword."</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Chaos character.</p><p></p><p>There was also the Five Elements Unification he had recently observed, the Great Explosion that could destroy everything, and the scene of the Tianxuan Soul Locking Formation's "Reversal of Five Elements Unification."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, my Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword simply uses the generation of the Five Elements as its power."</p><p></p><p>"But in reality, the circulation of the Five Elements can generate tremendous destructive power in itself."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps by combining this force of annihilation with the ability to destroy everything, I can improve and create a new version of the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered as he sensed the power of the Five Elements within his dantian, gradually sinking into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm where different laws cannot be practiced together, there were no respected masters or helpful friends.</p><p></p><p>The true secrets that were not passed down were hidden deep in high towers, beyond reach.</p><p></p><p>In this world of cultivation, if Li Fan wanted to obtain power far beyond others, he had to gradually explore it himself.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, as mundane matters were not yet resolved, only two days later, Li Fan was awakened by a message.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a message from Qi Buyi.</p><p></p><p>First, he inquired about his rest, then asked him to visit the Qianxing Bieyuan.</p><p></p><p>Without interrupting his comprehension process, Li Fan only sent out a part of his consciousness to control his journey.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you don't need to work so hard. Just follow the inspection work for the formation," Qi Buyi said to Li Fan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your partner will be Huangfu Song. As you are acquaintances, it will be convenient for you."</p><p></p><p>"Your points won't be much less than building formations, and you can maintain your second-ranking position."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, this task wouldn't be assigned to rank-competitive formation masters like you. But if it's you, others probably won't say much," she said, handing over another Dutian Record.</p><p></p><p>The previous Dutian Record and the Skyscape Shuttle had already been handed over when leaving the Five Elements Cave, but this one was different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>It didn't contain information on the distribution of goods, only a simple map of the various states in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was very similar to the miniature seen in the teleportation formation space.</p><p></p><p>"You can check the work-related details and your teammates through the Dutian Record," Qi Buyi explained diligently.</p><p></p><p>While most of his mind was immersed in understanding the divine arts, Li Fan, appearing somewhat absent-minded, nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this, Qi Buyi couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "He is getting weaker."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that his downfall is not far off. I wonder when those longevity treasures will be sent over."</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Qi Buyi, Li Fan contacted Huangfu Song through the Dutian Record.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's tone became more polite.</p><p></p><p>After meeting at the Tianchenzhou Transmission Square, the two used the teleportation array to arrive at Lanlinzhou, where the Soul-Locking Formation was about to be completed.</p><p></p><p>This state was located at the extreme south of the Xuanhuang Realm and was relatively remote.</p><p></p><p>They had to pass through several barriers before reaching it.</p><p></p><p>Passing through countless white mist barriers made Li Fan, who was already old, feel even more burdened.</p><p></p><p>His eyes appeared dull and lifeless.</p><p></p><p>Though he was actually immersed in comprehending the divine arts, it did not dispel others' misunderstandings.</p><p></p><p>At least Huangfu Song was somewhat nervous, fearing that Li Fan might die beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoist, just rest shortly after we arrive," Huangfu Song said.</p><p></p><p>"Leave everything to me."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 452</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the mirror of Tianxuan, Li Fan sat dumbfounded, his expression trance-like.</p><p></p><p>Even though he already knew that the items and knowledge obtained in the Falling Immortal Realm could only be brought back if one solved their long-cherished wish.</p><p></p><p>But this time, when he returned to the real world, he couldn't remember a single word of the "Cosmic Oven Technique" taught by Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was somewhat frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Once the sea turns into mulberry fields.</p><p></p><p>It was because he had personally experienced the miraculous nature of that supreme Dao method that Li Fan found it hard to accept the mediocre technique he had created.</p><p></p><p>The disparity was too great, like the stars in the sky and the plants on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Under such a stark contrast, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit emotionally imbalanced.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the treasure mountain he once possessed had now vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who had an unusual determination, couldn't help but feel somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai, Cosmic Oven Technique..."</p><p></p><p>"I can keep trying endlessly and surely one day I'll be able to bring back this true technique."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan took a deep breath and slowly suppressed the negative emotions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Based on his experience in "Harvesting Longevity Fruits in Ningyuan," he knew that in order to bring out an item from the realm, one had to fulfill the obsession of the owner of the item.</p><p></p><p>What would Mr. Bai's obsession be?</p><p></p><p>For the current Li Fan, Mr. Bai was still too mysterious. He could only continue to explore slowly in the future.</p><p></p><p>After sensing a bit, he found out that the next time he entered the Falling Immortal Realm would be half a year later.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the time limit was longer than usual. Li Fan sighed slightly and kept it in mind.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan checked his communication charm and found a message from Chen Ying.</p><p></p><p>It stated that he had already set off for the destination and had made more than enough preparations.</p><p></p><p>If he could survive this time, he would definitely repay Li Fan properly upon his return.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and thought if that was the case, he could use it as a typical deed and spread it widely.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Tianlingzhou Battle will not happen for another 16 years. Before that, the focus should still be on the Spiritual Mist Grass incident."</p><p></p><p>"If the Tianxuan Mirror does not clearly declare it, the Five Elders may not necessarily make a big move for a mysterious cave of unknown circumstances."</p><p></p><p>"And, if it weren't for Jiao Xiuyuan's help, the Spiritual Mist Grass incident would not have spread as far as it did in the past life."</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration for a moment, Li Fan decided to go see Jiao Xiuyuan first.</p><p></p><p>Without concealing his figure, wearing the appearance of a Tianji Sect cultivator, Li Fan arrived outside Qianlitang.</p><p></p><p>It was as quiet as ever inside.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan lazily lay on a long bench, eyes half-closed as if napping.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing footsteps, he suddenly stood up, changing his expression.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, a visitor has come!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan looked at Li Fan, first stunned, then greeted him warmly without a change in tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also did not say he wanted to buy something, but squinted his eyes, staring at Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>The two stared at each other for a while.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan was the first to extend a hand: "The way you control puppets and transform into myriad forms, it's extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"Even in ancient times, it can be considered a rare divine skill!"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, being seen through by a stranger in his first meeting, Jiao Xiuyuan appeared somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>But he concealed it well and immediately responded, "Peeping into the heavenly secrets, delving into cause and effect. The ancient Tianji Sect is indeed renowned!"</p><p></p><p>"Admire! Admire!"</p><p></p><p>"Heard about you for a long time!"</p><p></p><p>After exchanging compliments and formal introductions, Jiao Xiuyuan tentatively asked, "Friend, did you come here just to make fun of me?"</p><p></p><p>"Where did you hear such words regarding Jiao Dao friend, am I someone who has so much free time?" Li Fan waved his hand. "I came here naturally for the sake of 'wealth.'"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan immediately perked up, "Oh? I wonder what you want? Formation charms, magical instruments, elixirs, you name it, I have them all; the more, the..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I lack these?" Li Fan asked with a smile that wasn't a smile.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want then?" Jiao Xiuyuan's expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not here to buy this time. I'm here to sell!" Li Fan shook his head and said in a deep voice. "It depends on whether Jiao Dao friend knows the value of it."</p><p></p><p>"Sell? I don't accept everything..." Jiao Xiuyuan started to say but stopped abruptly when he saw what Li Fan was holding.</p><p></p><p>A strong murderous aura made him subconsciously want to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, he realized that this eyeball did not pose any threat and managed to hold back.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Jiao Xiuyuan squinted his eyes, unable to help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed slightly and said in a somewhat regretful tone, "This is an item left by my senior brother years ago. He has passed away, and this item has become useless to me. It only brings back memories and sadness. So, I want to hand it over to someone else with destiny. Unfortunately, the Tianxuan Mirror did not recognize its value and offered a low price. It's truly an insult to my senior brother."</p><p></p><p>"So I deduced the heavenly secrets and sought the right person to take it. That's why I'm here at Jiao Dao friend's place." Li Fan explained slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't lying.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins of the Hundred Stone Cave, apart from techniques and classics, Li Fan had two other rewards.</p><p></p><p>One of them was the eyeball he was holding.</p><p></p><p>It was identified by the Tianxuan Mirror as the "Illusion-Breaking Stone Eye," similar to a rare existence that embodied the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was said that after absorption and refining by cultivators, it had the ability to break through illusions and foresee the future.</p><p></p><p>Normally, such a treasure would undoubtedly come at a high price.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this "Illusion-Breaking Stone Eye" had already been refined by a cultivator once.</p><p></p><p>The pure laws of heaven and earth had been tainted by the breath of the cultivator's karma.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after several thousand years had passed and drastic changes occurred in the heavens and earth, the power of the laws had undergone significant changes from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Under the dual influence of these two factors, the efficacy of the Illusion-Breaking Stone Eye's deduction was greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>It could hit the target one in ten times, which was considered lucky.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Tianxuan Mirror only offered a retrieval price of sixty thousand contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Although this item was not very useful to Li Fan, who could foresee events, he did not lack those sixty thousand contribution points and had kept it with him all this time.</p><p></p><p>Now, he took it out and associated it with Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>"How about it, does Jiao Dao friend recognize this item?" Li Fan deliberately asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan stood still for a moment and then chuckled, "How could I not know this item, it's just the Illusion-Breaking Stone Eye."</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment and added, "Let me tell you, the Tianxuan Mirror offering a low price has its reasons."</p><p></p><p>"Although this item is rare, if you want to sell it for a good price, you'll have to meet the right person."</p><p></p><p>"I understand this matter. This is also the reason why I came to find Jiao Dao friend." Li Fan replied.</p><p></p><p>He straightforwardly tossed the "Illusion-Breaking Stone Eye" over and said, "I believe that friend will definitely find a suitable new owner for it."</p><p></p><p>"Please help me with this favor. Half of the proceeds from the sale will go to you. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes lit up, "I'll take on this deal!"</p><p></p><p>After a thorough check and finding nothing wrong, he scheduled an MRI scan tomorrow to further examine the brain.</p>

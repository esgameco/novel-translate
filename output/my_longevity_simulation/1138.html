            <p>Chapter 1136: The Mystery of the Heavenly Doctor's Dharma Transmission (Combined Chapter)</p><p></p><p>If the Dharma Transmission Venerable had an avatar suppressing the Xuanhuang realm, there would be no possibility of a large-scale war between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, the Five Elders Society was a tool that the Dharma Transmission deliberately indulged and used to maintain the delicate balance of the Xuanhuang realm. He actually didn't care about the war between them, and might even be happy to see it.</p><p></p><p>However, there were too many hidden demons and monsters in the Xuanhuang realm, and the Immortal Ruins were also looming in the distance.</p><p></p><p>In a situation where the Xuanhuang realm could be destroyed at the slightest disagreement, it would undoubtedly be more appropriate to leave an avatar in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the Dharma Transmission Venerable, who cherished the Xuanhuang realm as a treasure, surprisingly didn't do so.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's two experiences of world destruction, one time the Dharma Transmission came late from outside the world and let out a roar of impotence.</p><p></p><p>The other time, he simply didn't show up at all, and only the Heavenly Doctor appeared.</p><p></p><p>This looked very suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Was it difficult for the Dharma Transmission to refine an avatar?</p><p></p><p>Although the avatar technique was rare in the Xuanhuang realm, Li Fan was able to repeatedly cause a stir through the avatar technique.</p><p></p><p>Let alone this Patriarch of the New Law?</p><p></p><p>He could easily do it, but he just wouldn't...</p><p></p><p>In fact, although the cultivators of the Xuanhuang realm didn't dare to discuss openly why the Dharma Transmission Venerable didn't leave an avatar to suppress, there were many speculations in private.</p><p></p><p>It was nothing more than the Dharma Transmission had already transcended the outside world and was no longer so concerned about everything in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Obviously they neither understood the Xuanhuang realm nor the Dharma Transmission Venerable.</p><p></p><p>And in Li Fan's view, if the Dharma Transmission Venerable himself was an avatar...</p><p></p><p>Then everything would make sense.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he doesn't want to, but he really can't!</p><p></p><p>In the 119th world, the strength of the avatar Li Qing had already infinitely approached the original and reached the peak of the Nascent Soul stage. </p><p></p><p>It was only one step away from surpassing the original.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan had doubts in his heart whether the strength of the avatar could surpass the original.</p><p></p><p>Later, with the help of the authority of the Heavenly Profound Mirror's origin, he consulted various classics and had a vague understanding.</p><p></p><p>The avatar's strength surpassing the original and the avatar refining its own avatar again.</p><p></p><p>The latter should be a little more difficult to achieve between these two.</p><p></p><p>Because if the avatar could also refine its own avatar, then it could be extended indefinitely. In the end, there would only be one person left in the whole world.</p><p></p><p>It's not absolutely impossible, but it has already transcended the limits of mortal methods.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, it's still a bit easier for the avatar's strength to surpass the original.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Doctor, Dharma Transmission..."</p><p></p><p>The two faces appeared one after another in Li Fan's mind. He suddenly remembered that when he first entered the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, he saw the image of the Dharma Transmission Venerable in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>And before this, the only existence above the Dao Convergence that he had seen in the Xuanhuang realm was the Heavenly Doctor alone.</p><p></p><p>"Although their appearances are not the same, there is a subtle resemblance between them."</p><p></p><p>"In the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, there is a trace of the Dharma Transmission Venerable's aura remaining. Cultivators who go there for the first time will have a feeling in their hearts and have illusions. My original body saw the image of the Dharma Transmission Venerable, while the avatar Li Qing saw..."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Transformation Stone emitted a faint white light, faithfully reproducing the recorded images from that time.</p><p></p><p>In a blurry ball of light, several figures stood.</p><p></p><p>Intermittent dialogue came from within.</p><p></p><p>"This time, how much confidence do you have?"</p><p></p><p>"Do one's best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p></p><p>"This doesn't sound like something you would say."</p><p></p><p>"The difference in strength is too great, I can only stake my life."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, you go ahead. I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also recalled the scene he saw in Hanhai's chaotic consciousness when treating him in the 119th world.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Heavenly Doctor has been gone for a long time, I don't know if it can be done."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai sat on the throne of the sect's grand hall, with the Turtle Snake Taiyi, which was only the size of an ordinary turtle under his feet, said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"Before Venerable Heavenly Doctor left, he said that there was at least a 90% chance of success in this matter. You and I should still have some faith in Him." Unlike Taiyi's worried look, Hanhai seemed very relaxed and comforted with a smile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>Under the premise of the hypothesis that "the Dharma Transmission Venerable is the avatar of the Heavenly Doctor", all the fragmentary clues obtained in the past were instantly connected.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flipped through his past memories again.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he found more traces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yinyin Island.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren pointed to the two human skeletons he treasured, leaned close to Li Fan, and said in a very low voice, "These two people are not the same kind of people."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren gestured with his hands for a while, thought for a while, and seemed unable to think of suitable words to describe it.</p><p></p><p>After struggling for a long time, he suddenly clenched his fists, his face full of entanglement: "It's just a feeling, you understand, right? Although they are both human, these two humans lived in different eras and different regions. Maybe they look similar and were both dug up by me from the bottom of the Congyun Sea, but there is a very special boundary that marks the difference between these two skeletons..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren said it in a mysterious way, talked for a long time but couldn't say anything specific.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>During the second simulation process of Tianyang's eternal memory.</p><p></p><p>In order to get rid of Tianyang's weak body as much as possible and wake up from the coma as soon as possible, Li Fan studied the "Heavenly Doctor's Immortal Scripture", prescribed a medicine for himself, and instructed his senior brother to refine it.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed effective, but later when he woke up, his second senior brother Ling Xiao said to him.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, you are really lucky. In the elixir formula you gave, there were several medicinal materials that were unheard of. We searched all the nearby markets and couldn't find anyone selling them. Some people even said that these few medicinal materials don't exist in the cultivation world at all."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I don't believe it. How could it be that among an elixir formula, all the other medicinal materials exist, but only these few don't?"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I argued with them based on reason."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, at this time, a disciple of the Medicine King Sect passed by and heard our argument. Out of curiosity, he asked us about the specific elixir formula."</p><p></p><p>"Then, according to the pharmacology, he selected a few common herbs for us as substitutes."</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, only then could you drink this medicine!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When he met Immortal Venerable Jicheng and obtained the reward of the Dharma Jade Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Venerable Jicheng once pointed to a "Green Cloud Willow" in his courtyard and asked Li Fan, Han Yi, and Ximen Yue if they knew the details of this tree.</p><p></p><p>Both Han Yi and Ximen Yue didn't know, only Li Fan, who had read through the Heavenly Doctor's Immortal Scripture, revealed it in one sentence.</p><p></p><p>Later, Immortal Venerable Jicheng gave Li Fan many pointers because of this.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was puzzled at first, but after further investigation, he realized.</p><p></p><p>Mo Gu Bamboo, Qing Ye Wood, Wu Wang Flower, Hundred Spirits Eagle, Nine Refinements...</p><p></p><p>In this excerpt from a Chinese novel, the protagonist Li Fan is piecing together clues about the history and mysteries of the Xuanhuang and Tianfa realms, two distinct cultivation worlds that seem to have collided and merged in the distant past.</p><p></p><p>Key points:</p><p></p><p>1. Many spiritual plants and creatures mentioned in the "Heavenly Doctor's Immortal Classic" are now rare in the Xuanhuang realm, suggesting they originated from the Tianfa realm.</p><p></p><p>2. Skeletal remains found beneath the Congyu Sea belong to humans from both realms, indicating the two worlds have merged.</p><p></p><p>3. The Xuanhuang realm appears to have been split apart and reassembled with fragments from other worlds, like a precise surgical operation, rather than simply expanding outward.</p><p></p><p>4. A great war likely broke out between the Xuanhuang and Tianfa realms when they encountered each other, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides and the destruction of the "Floating Starry Sky Array."</p><p></p><p>5. The mysterious figure "Chuanfa" and the Heavenly Doctor seem to have appeared in the Xuanhuang realm after a significant time gap, possibly due to the influence of the "Immortal Ruins" outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>6. Li Fan suspects there are still some inconsistencies in the story, such as the exact timing of events and the true identity of Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for half a month, Li Fan decides to create a clone named "Li Ping" using the blood essence of two individuals, Shao Erlang and Wang Xuanba. He removes memories related to "Huan Zhen" and himself from the clone. While the clone, with only Nascent Soul cultivation but lacking actual combat power, heads towards Daxuan Capital, Li Fan's true body remains hidden, planning to subtly adjust the trajectory of events in this life compared to before. Despite his current power, he chooses to bide his time rather than rashly entering the Xuanhuang realm before his preparations are complete.</p>

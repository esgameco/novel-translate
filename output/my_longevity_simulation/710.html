        <div class="content">
            <p>Because, based on the experience of the previous life, when the countdown ends, this space will be directly transmitted.</p><p></p><p>If there is still no result by then, wouldn't it be a wasted trip?</p><p></p><p>According to the "Usage Instructions for Yunfa Jue," such things have happened before. Only blame your own greed, it won't give you a chance to start over.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the sleeping Yunfa little Lolita in a deep slumber, Xu Bai contemplated for a moment and decided not to wake her up hastily.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to wait patiently in silence.</p><p></p><p>Even as the countdown got closer and closer, he remained calm and didn't make a sound.</p><p></p><p>When the countdown reached zero, the surroundings gradually became more illusory.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute..."</p><p></p><p>The sleepy little Lolita suddenly raised her hand in impatience.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Bai saw the previously fuzzy countdown in front of his eyes become clear again, rapidly increasing until it turned back to two days before stopping.</p><p></p><p>This time, the countdown did not disappear but continued to jump in front of Xu Bai as a final reminder.</p><p></p><p>"I was right after all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai ignored the countdown, his expression unchanged, and continued to focus on the Yunfa charm ball above.</p><p></p><p>"If I come here in person, recording every slight change in scenes during this period with the transformation stone. Does this mean that all the spells derived by Yunfa Jue during this time will also be recorded?" </p><p></p><p>"Of course, just the order of characters. If you want to know the details of the techniques, perhaps only Yunfa Jue himself knows the specific correspondence between characters and techniques."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's plan to "entice Yunfa Jue" took a few more steps.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the implementation of the plan would not be immediate.</p><p></p><p>Another day and a half passed, and the huge Yunfa charm ball gradually stopped spinning.</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita suddenly raised her head and woke up from her deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>On her delicate face, two faint dark circles appeared.</p><p></p><p>She rubbed her eyes, yawned, and then said somewhat proudly, "Done!"</p><p></p><p>She lightly tapped the table.</p><p></p><p>Countless characters emerged from the table, transforming into a piece of white paper and flying towards Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Taking it solemnly, Xu Bai did not rush to read the newly derived technique, but bowed to little Lolita again, "You've worked hard!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's alright! I'm very strong!" Little Lolita yawned while scratching her head proudly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the countdown, Xu Bai said gently, "There's still half a day left, so you should rest well."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, little Lolita's face fell, "No way, I worked so hard to save this holiday. I have to use it judiciously."</p><p></p><p>"You better go now."</p><p></p><p>"The next one is a cultivation technique derivation at the Yuan Ying level, you can take the opportunity to slack off. new69book âž” 69shuxi.com"</p><p></p><p>Treating Xu Bai as no stranger, Yunfa little Lolita laughed foolishly.</p><p></p><p>She waved her hand, bidding farewell to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Looking forward to seeing you again next time." Xu Bai bowed slightly, keeping the contents of the paper in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Then the countdown suddenly ended, and the surroundings became illusory.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he was already outside the Protectors Hall black stone monument.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go?" asked the guiding black-robed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Very satisfying." Xu Bai nodded slowly as he checked the collaborative cultivation technique derived by Yunfa Jue.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Sitting Immortal Technique'..." His eyes revealed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>The immortal in the Sitting Immortal Technique was naturally not the true immortal but the immortal of the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Yunfa Jue spared no effort and spent three and a half days to derive this collaborative cultivation technique, which was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It almost perfectly met Xu Bai's requirements.</p><p></p><p>With the core idea of "reaping the fruits of labor," the limits of the technique were raised to the collaborative cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>With this, before looking forward to the longevity realm, Li Fan no longer needed to worry about cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, some improvements were made to the Sitting Immortal Technique.</p><p></p><p>For example, the conditions to achieve feedback cultivation were further reduced.</p><p></p><p>In the 'Sitting Mountain Technique,' only when the favor towards the cultivator reached a certain level and the other's cultivation progressed, would the practitioner of the technique receive feedback cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But the Sitting Immortal Technique was different.</p><p></p><p>Even just a casual mention with a causal link. When the other's cultivation advanced, a corresponding feedback cultivation would be produced, benefiting the practitioner of the Sitting Immortal Technique. Even if the "favor" was minimal, the feedback cultivation was almost negligible but still existed.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, the Sitting Immortal Technique also strengthened the bonds between the main body of the technique.</p><p></p><p>Those who benefited from Li Fan's favor could sense a connection through "causal links."</p><p></p><p>The heavier the favor, the stronger the connection.</p><p></p><p>Like a favor of "transmission," it was probably almost tangible to feel the situation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could deepen the causal relationship with the practitioner benefiting from his favor by relying on this continuous feedback cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When it reached a certain level, he could ignore spatial distances and exert a certain mental influence on them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai looked at the many wonders of the Sitting Immortal Technique, feeling excited.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not real immortal techniques, it can still be called 'Creation True Cultivation'!"</p><p></p><p>As his heart surged with excitement, the idea of making Yunfa Jue his own unavoidably resurfaced.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li? Brother Li!"</p><p></p><p>In the vast white mist, the calling voice by his ear made Li Fan snap out of it.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear any sounds nearby?" Huangfu Song asked.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to listen carefully, Li Fan shook his head after a while.</p><p></p><p>"Identifying these strange sounds in the maze is too mentally draining. It's all thanks to Brother Li that we've completed two relatively low-risk explorations of the maze consecutively."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to let him rest! Huangfu, don't rush him!" Dongfang Yao complained a bit.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huangfu Song looked embarrassed, "I'm sorry. I got too excited!"</p><p></p><p>Linking their minds to the Heaven Mirror, they saw their points skyrocketing to fifteen thousand Qingxuan points. Huangfu Song said with joy, "Brother Li's skills are extraordinary. He can hear the sounds coming from the mist."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how we try, we can't hear a thing!"</p><p></p><p>"I told you Brother Li is reliable and worth befriending!" Dongfang Yao also praised repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and was about to speak when his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Looking in a certain direction in the white mist, after a moment, his face changed slightly, "Danger! Move!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, seizing control of the Purification True Boat, he swiftly veered the boat more than ten yards to the right in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu and Dongfang were still in a daze when they saw a huge black beam of light shoot out from the depths of the white mist, whisking past the Purification True Boat and continuing to strike towards the distance.</p>

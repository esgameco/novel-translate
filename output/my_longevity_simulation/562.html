        <h1>Chapter 562</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On this day, Li Fan, who was about to drag the other party to drink again, received such a response. </p><p></p><p>So he looked puzzled. </p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong's face turned slightly red, wanting to speak but stopped.</p><p></p><p>However, he finally touched the back of his head, somewhat embarrassedly saying, "In this sea of clouds, I don't have many close friends, so I didn't prepare much."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li has been a guest here for some time..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calculated with his fingers, surprised, "I didn't expect time to pass so quickly, and suddenly a year has gone by."</p><p></p><p>He said apologetically, "Since Brother Sima is bothered by me, then it's time for me to leave."</p><p></p><p>"But before that, please tell me the ingredients for making that wine. I will go and get some for you..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Sima Changkong's face turned red, waving his hand hastily, "Brother Li, don't say that. It's not that I'm complaining, it's just..."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong wanted to explain, but for some reason, he shook his head and gave up.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, Brother Li, please wait for me at home for a few days. I'll be back soon!"</p><p></p><p>With that, without waiting for Li Fan to respond, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"This Sima Changkong is quite an interesting person." Li Fan looked at Sima Changkong's back and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Although he had never been out this year, Li Fan was not unaware of what was happening outside.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the clone Zhou Qing'ang was busy.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside many miscellaneous matters, the most important thing was the monthly list of "recruited cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Yes, even though the strength of the Sea of Clouds was already weak, the Immortal Alliance headquarters still issued recruitment orders.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, considering the actual situation of the Sea of Clouds, most recruited cultivators did not need to go to the battlefield in person.</p><p></p><p>They were mainly involved in logistics and transportation work.</p><p></p><p>However, no one could guarantee whether the scale of the war would suddenly expand again, causing unforeseen consequences.</p><p></p><p>So, no one wanted to be recruited to go to Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Arranging this list naturally became a tricky task.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this matter should have been decided by Li Fan, the secret commander.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had "retreated," and theoretically, it should have been decided by trusted confidants like He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan who had been authorized by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, He Zhenghao was too kind-hearted, and Gao Yuan was diplomatic and tactful.</p><p></p><p>Neither of them wanted to do something that would offend people.</p><p></p><p>If the other party died on the battlefield, it would be fine, but if they didn't die and returned with military achievements, wouldn't it create unnecessary enmity?</p><p></p><p>So, the two privately approached the relatively solitary Zhou Qing'ang and asked for his help.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou Qing'ang flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>He had no reason to take on this troublesome task.</p><p></p><p>However, soon, He Zhenghao took out his trump card.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Daoist, look at this." He mysteriously took out a scroll and unfolded it in front of Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Yihang, one million contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Peng, eight hundred thousand contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"Sikong Yi, three hundred thousand contribution points."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced over a few scrolls with familiar names, hesitated, and knowingly asked, "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao cleared his throat, "This is a list of contribution points from last year, which I collected as part of a fundraising project."</p><p></p><p>"The deadline has arrived, and now it's time to return the principal and interest. Thanks to the guidance of the secret envoy, I have been gradually selling them all when the prices of accumulated resources soared to more than three times the original value."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, I sold them for a total of..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao paused and couldn't hide his satisfaction, "314.57 million contribution points."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a sharp breath, saying, "So many? I've only heard that resources on the battlefield are in short supply, but I didn't expect the prices to be so outrageous. Doesn't the Immortal Alliance regulate it?"</p><p></p><p>"Regulate? How could they regulate it? It's a deal, both parties consent. If you don't want to buy, you don't have to. The more prepared you are, the better your chances in battle. If you don't buy, someone else will!" Unlike a year ago when he seemed a bit apprehensive, He Zhenghao was now indifferent to Zhou Qing'ang's reaction, not caring at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just shook his head slightly, no longer commenting on the matter.</p><p></p><p>"So, what does this mean, friend He showing me this?" Glancing again at the scroll, Li Fan pretended to be puzzled and asked.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan exchanged glances, looked around, and then casually laid down a concealment array.</p><p></p><p>Only then did they relax.</p><p></p><p>He took out a pen and circled five names on the scroll.</p><p></p><p>Then, he put a stroke across each of these five names.</p><p></p><p>"Be quiet, be quiet!" He Zhenghao was startled and quickly stopped Li Fan from shouting.</p><p></p><p>"This matter must not be publicized. I told you because I see you as one of us." He complained a bit.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded repeatedly, indicating his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"So, the capital of these people, no one is claiming it now?" He asked quietly.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's tone revealed a hint of excitement, "That's right. I secretly inquired, and indeed, the people I circled on the list fell on the battlefield in Tianlingzhou."</p><p></p><p>"And, they didn't leave any wills either."</p><p></p><p>"The total capital of these five individuals is 330,000 contribution points, plus the deserved bonus..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly interjected, "Didn't it triple? Why is it only 300,000?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao snorted, "300,000 is already a result of the secret envoy's generosity adjusting the bonus ratio to be this much."</p><p></p><p>"According to the original agreement, only 50% of the capital profit was required annually."</p><p></p><p>"But the secret envoy was kind, and I shouldn't say more about it."</p><p></p><p>"In short, this 660 contribution points are now unclaimed."</p><p></p><p>"As long as friend Daoist helps solve this matter, it will belong to you." He Zhenghao's tone was full of temptation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang was obviously tempted.</p><p></p><p>However, he still seemed a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Will we be found out? It's taboo to covet dead people's money."</p><p></p><p>"And, does the secret envoy know about this?" Li Fan asked deliberately.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's eyes flickered, patting his chest, guaranteeing, "Friend Zhou, rest assured, the list of fundraising participants is confidential, known only to a few of us. It will not be leaked."</p><p></p><p>"I also asked the secret envoy, and he said I could handle this matter myself." He said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so..." Li Fan stared at He Zhenghao for a while.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the other party felt a bit creepy that he withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I will take care of this matter." Li Fan agreed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan exchanged glances, showing joy.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 895</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the burst of blue light, not only vision, but also the lock of divine consciousness was interfered with. </p><p></p><p>This caused everyone present to lose their lock on the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, apart from the Heavenly Venerate, the only ones capable of influencing and manipulating the Heavenly Profound Mirror are those from the Xuantian Sect!"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through the youth's mind.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze around but couldn't find any trace of the other party. The youth's heart sank slightly and he was about to order a pursuit.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly he noticed something amiss. </p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"This place has already been pre-arranged with my Nine Heavens Ten Earths Formation. Unless the formation is broken, there's absolutely no possibility for him to escape."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, he's still here?!"</p><p></p><p>The youth once again ordered the group of black-robed cultivators to scan the space here.</p><p></p><p>To the youth's great surprise, they couldn't find any trace of that vanished Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect!</p><p></p><p>The youth's face turned somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Is indeed a bit troublesome to deal with. No wonder back then they managed to survive the joint extermination by the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao."</p><p></p><p>The youth's gaze kept sweeping back and forth across the space here.</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly are you hiding?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze froze.</p><p></p><p>It fell upon this squad of black-robed cultivators under his command. </p><p></p><p>The youth vaguely felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>"How many people did I actually bring out this time?"</p><p></p><p>A doubt couldn't help but surface in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, what made him aghast with fright was that for such an extremely simple question...</p><p></p><p>He actually couldn't remember at all!</p><p></p><p>Having merged with the Dao for who knows how many years, for something like this to happen to him was simply inconceivable!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the strangeness of the Xuantian Sect's techniques..."</p><p></p><p>The youth narrowed his eyes as all sorts of legends about the ancient Xuantian Sect surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the other party was hiding among this group of black-robed cultivators under his command, the youth ordered them to cross-check each other's identities.</p><p></p><p>Although the youth wasn't very familiar with the vast majority of the black-robed cultivators,</p><p></p><p>These cultivators definitely knew each other well.</p><p></p><p>However, what the youth never expected was that after checking each other,</p><p></p><p>Every person's information was flawless.</p><p></p><p>Even in their minds, there were all sorts of past experiences of interacting with one another.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this point, the youth's face turned quite unsightly.</p><p></p><p>By now, no matter how unwilling he was, he had to admit it.</p><p></p><p>He had likely underestimated things this time.</p><p></p><p>As one of the earliest Dharma Transmitters who stood by the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate's side to overthrow the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao,</p><p></p><p>The youth didn't really take this so-called Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao that overthrew the Xuantian Sect were all defeated by him and the others.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the Xuantian Sect was, what could they do?</p><p></p><p>So in order to monopolize the credit, he didn't notify the other Dharma Transmitters when he came this time.</p><p></p><p>He never expected to fall into such an awkward predicament.</p><p></p><p>The youth's expression kept changing.</p><p></p><p>Now he had two choices. One was to notify the Immortal Alliance headquarters to send over the list of names of the black-robed cultivators participating in this operation.</p><p></p><p>With a simple comparison, the hidden Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect could be found.</p><p></p><p>But doing so would inevitably alert the other Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>It might even invite ridicule.</p><p></p><p>The youth pondered for a moment, then made the other choice.</p><p></p><p>He casually pointed at one of them</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk said coldly, "You, commit suicide."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this extremely cruel command, the black-robed monk who was pointed at did not hesitate in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>He forcefully slapped his temples with both hands, and in an instant, his breath dissipated.</p><p></p><p>His body also turned into bits of dust, as if dissolving into the air.</p><p></p><p>Only a beam of green light, wrapped around something, broke through the void and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The young man's face showed no fluctuations as he looked at the next black-robed monk.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, the phenomenon of a monk's demise, which should have appeared in the sky, never occurred from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>A total of thirty-five black-robed monks had come with him.</p><p></p><p>Now, twenty-six of them had already committed suicide, yet the hidden Xuantian Sect Dharma King still hadn't been found.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my luck is this bad?"</p><p></p><p>"Or did I misjudge?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's face was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, there was no room for regret.</p><p></p><p>With a vicious heart, like a gambler with bloodshot eyes, the command for suicide did not cease.</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>Only one black-robed monk remained on the scene.</p><p></p><p>He, like those before him, raised his hand and forcefully slapped it towards his own head.</p><p></p><p>However, he stopped just before smashing his head.</p><p></p><p>Slowly lowering his hand, he looked at the young preacher in front of him with a hint of mockery: "Is this the current ruling cultivation organization?"</p><p></p><p>"Treating subordinates like grass and weeds..."</p><p></p><p>"They say our Xuantian Sect is tyrannical and unrighteous, but in my opinion, it's far inferior to you."</p><p></p><p>The young man was not angered by Li Chen's words.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, those black-robed monks were nothing more than disposable resources.</p><p></p><p>Let alone a few dozen deaths.</p><p></p><p>Even if hundreds or thousands died, he wouldn't feel the slightest heartache.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of evil technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>The young man absolutely refused to believe that it was due to his own luck that the last person he randomly pointed at turned out to be the Xuantian Sect Dharma King.</p><p></p><p>This must have been caused by the induction of the other party's mysterious technique.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Li Chen did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>"Evil technique?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's identity was extremely noble.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, no one had dared to speak so presumptuously in front of him!</p><p></p><p>Especially the deep, heartfelt contempt in the other party's eyes, which made the young man unable to suppress his rage.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's just the two of us here. I'd like to see what other tricks you can play!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's tone was filled with murderous intent, and his clothes moved without wind.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space, sealed by the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths Formation, suddenly appeared with specks of starlight.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if night had fallen, the stars filled the sky.</p><p></p><p>Countless beams of starlight shone, like a sharp arrow, wanting to pierce through the Xuantian Sect Dharma King!</p><p></p><p>Faced with the young man's sudden attack, Li Chen seemed to be scared stiff, standing still in place.</p><p></p><p>Just as countless starlights were about to descend upon him, piercing him with ten thousand arrows.</p><p></p><p>The young man vaguely felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>However, it was already a bit too late.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, numerous tiny holes appeared on the young man's body.</p><p></p><p>Blood spurted out, and the young man was thoroughly pierced by his own starlight!</p><p></p><p>Under the myriad of starlights, the young man's body turned into a puddle of mud.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, with a squirming motion.</p><p></p><p>A complete body emerged from the void.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The young man looked at the black-robed monk in front of him, and a sense of fear finally arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was an emotion he hadn't tasted in a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Me?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't I just you?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed monk looked at the young man, revealing a hint of a strange smile.</p><p></p><p>In the young man's eyes, there was a moment of confusion.</p>

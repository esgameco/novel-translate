        <h1>Chapter 597</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Hu..."</p><p></p><p>"With just a move or gesture, you have unraveled my 'Wuxiang Killing Machine', and even caused a mental impact on me from afar."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the protection of the Visible World Venerable in my possession, my consciousness might have suffered heavy damage."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the Visible World Venerable in his hand, only to see it emit a faint white light before dissolving like it never existed.</p><p></p><p>"The old fisherman is indeed terrifying above the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Though astonished, Li Fan's eyes shimmered with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He had never expected things to go so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>When he noticed Han Yi continuing on his journey sluggishly, heading towards the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and pausing at the Luo Yan Prefecture, Li Fan had already vaguely sensed what was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had previously used the Cloud Water Illusionary Dream technique to secretly implant the whereabouts of the Blue Wind Trapped Sword and the actions of the old fisherman over the years in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to pass on the message about the Blue Wind Trapped Sword to the old fisherman through Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>However, in Li Fan's expectations, Han Yi would probably need additional guidance to find the old fisherman in the vast territory of several states.</p><p></p><p>Yet, perhaps due to fate or some other influencing factor, Han Yi's actions were unexpectedly swift.</p><p></p><p>With hardly any detours, he directly pinpointed the old fisherman's location.</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman was a great opportunity available to all. Therefore, the cultivators in the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance would instinctively search for his whereabouts and spread the news swiftly once discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Help me, help you."</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman often stayed in the same area for a period of time, making his approximate whereabouts traceable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, having experienced many cycles, was naturally well aware of this.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, seeing the old fisherman through the perspective of Heaven and Earth, Li Fan was extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>He could see his plan of orchestrating a great battle between the old fisherman, the Heavenly Doctor, and the Master was on the brink of success.</p><p></p><p>When he initially used the Cloud Water Illusionary Dream technique to implant related thoughts in Han Yi's mind, he had left behind a trace of the "Heavenly Killing Technique" within Han Yi's body, even an almost imperceptible one, but which could erupt under Li Fan's deliberate manipulation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that the old fisherman would definitely not ignore it.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would naturally be able to see the whereabouts of the Blue Wind Trapped Sword through Han Yi's memories.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the old fisherman could also see the scene where the Heavenly Doctor appeared in the Cloud Water Heaven Palace within Han Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Master or the old fisherman, Li Fan firmly believed that they harbored an irreconcilable hatred towards the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Heavenly Killing Sword and regaining some of his strength, engaging in a battle with the Heavenly Doctor would surely bring him some trouble.</p><p></p><p>The plan was perfect.</p><p></p><p>However, Han Yi happened to deviate from it.</p><p></p><p>Despite the old fisherman appearing in front of him more than ten times, he had been unable to detect anything unusual about him.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan, who had been following him all along, shake his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>He surely couldn't risk personally confronting him and had to continue observing from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, although there were some deviations in the process, the outcome eventually followed the predetermined trajectory.</p><p></p><p>When Han Yi, in his state of madness, charged towards the old fisherman, even Li Fan couldn't help but secretly admire his courage.</p><p></p><p>But next, when the old fisherman raised his head slightly, Li Fan couldn't help feeling that something big was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I was well prepared, and I am no longer the junior foundation cultivator of that day."</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fan, feeling reinvigorated, began contemplating his next moves.</p><p></p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, the old fisherman should now be aware of the various incidents in the Cloud Sea, heading towards it."</p><p></p><p>"Immortals fight, mortals suffer. I, as my true self, shall not join in the fray."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind moved, and his attention shifted back to his avatar Zhou Qingang.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Bu Polt Court, there was an unusual calm.</p><p></p><p>Without attracting anyone's attention, Li Fan controlled his avatar Zhou Qingang and made his way to the Cloud Water Heaven Palace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the surroundings were deserted, with only a few cultivators occasionally entering and leaving.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan didn't rush into the Cloud Water Heaven Palace but decided to wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind suddenly blew by, making his clothes rustle.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at the sky, reaching out his hand to feel the increasing wind force.</p><p></p><p>A sense of excitement surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"The old fisherman is in position, will the Master come?"</p><p></p><p>Based on previous observations, Li Fan could almost confirm the answer.</p><p></p><p>Just the faint aura emitted by the Heavenly Doctor's avatar could attract the Master.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the old fisherman being a familiar figure in this world, there was no reason for the Master not to come.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, considering the timing, it wasn't far from the moment of the Master's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan concluded that his plan for this lifetime had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I have to find a good vantage point to watch from."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a gourd of good wine from his storage ring, chuckling as he patted it, before entering the Cloud Water Heaven Palace.</p><p></p><p>After completing three trials at lightning speed, Li Fan did not leave but instead engaged in idle chatter with Senior Qin while holding the wine, patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>As time passed by, Senior Qin seemed unperturbed by waiting, while Li Fan grew anxious as the anticipated scene failed to unfold.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Junior Brother, you are truly unkind. Here you are, holding Senior Brother back for wine, when your mind is elsewhere!"</p><p></p><p>"Come on, spill it. Have you taken a liking to any Junior Sister? It's alright, tell Senior Brother about it. If it's appropriate, I can even help you propose!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, a Senior Sister is also an option!"</p><p></p><p>Taking a swig of wine, Senior Qin suddenly laughed heartily, half-drunk, half-awake.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was about to reply, he suddenly noticed the whole world violently shaking.</p><p></p><p>Senior Qin, who had been drinking, froze in place, then started trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Doctor..."</p><p></p><p>He no longer showed any signs of being drunk, gritting his teeth with hatred.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The illusion shattered layer by layer, and when Li Fan reappeared outside the gates of the Cloud Water Heaven Palace, the scene that greeted him was the confrontation between the old fisherman and the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous life, upon seeing the Heavenly Doctor in the Cloud Water Heaven Palace, the voices of resentment and wailing that emerged from those hidden cultivators were significantly subdued.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as though there was something that made them feel hesitant, preventing them from expressing their resentment and grievances freely.</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman stared at the Heavenly Doctor, his body emanating a boiling dark aura, but no trace of the shattered pieces of the Heavenly Killing Sword could be seen in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Though silent, the hatred in the old fisherman's eyes was unmistakable, yet for some reason, he had yet to make a move.</p><p></p><p>The expression on the Heavenly Doctor's face was not as serious.</p><p></p><p>He only showed a slightly peculiar expression. "Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jue, have you regained your memories?"</p>

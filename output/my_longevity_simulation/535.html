        <h1>Chapter 535</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>His eyes widened, staring intently at the other while turning. Curiously moving closer, he came in front of Him, reaching out to pinch the other's face, and curiously asked, "Are you also human? How come you're on the Demon Beast Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>The child tilted his head, raised his hand, and pulled at Xu Ke's face.</p><p></p><p>"Who said that humans cannot live on the Demon Beast Mountain? Aren't you also a mortal who safely arrived here?"</p><p></p><p>He replied seriously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was initially stunned but seemed to agree with the child's words.</p><p></p><p>Clapping happily, he said, "You're right, demons and humans can coexist harmoniously."</p><p></p><p>"In our sect, that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>"I believe it's the same at this Southern Abyss Demon Beast Mountain."</p><p></p><p>A hint of innocence appeared in the child's eyes as he shook his head, "Beast Taming Sect? I heard that the human cultivators in the Beast Taming Sect control and manipulate the demon beasts through the Beast Taming Decision."</p><p></p><p>"Many demon beasts don't truly wish to be their companions. They are merely controlled by techniques, unable to act of their own free will."</p><p></p><p>"Is this what you mean by harmonious coexistence?" the child asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke hurriedly waved his hand, "No, it's not like that..."</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth to refute but couldn't find the right words. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to think of something, grabbing the little black on his head and showcasing it like a treasure to the child, "You see, this is Xiao Hei. Our relationship is great!"</p><p></p><p>"Although he became my spirit beast because of the Beast Taming Decision," Xu Ke hesitated, trying to get a confirmation from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, instead, flew back to Xu Ke's head and gave him a claw, making Xu Ke quiet down in pain.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Xu Ke's antics, Li Fan stared at the exquisitely dressed child in front of him, feeling a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>His intuition told him that this child must have a remarkable background, not as simple as an ordinary mortal. However, there was not a trace of a demon's aura on him.</p><p></p><p>Even when Li Fan used his special abilities, the aura he saw was ordinary and no different from a mortal's, leaving him perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the harmonious relationship between the pair in front of him, the child laughed gleefully, "Follow me, the city roads are complex, be careful not to get lost."</p><p></p><p>With that, the child walked directly inside, and Xu Ke followed.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were extremely quiet, with no signs of other demon beasts. The demon beasts that were previously together had all disappeared, leaving only the two children with their footsteps echoing in the deserted city.</p><p></p><p>Continuing inward, climbing over dozens of stairs, it was unknown how much time had passed until the child led Xu Ke to a room.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, the walls around them suddenly turned transparent, as if suspended in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The view was excellent, offering a panoramic view of the surroundings. Below in the space, various demon beasts of different shapes and sizes gathered densely, seemingly engaged in heated discussions.</p><p></p><p>"Quiet!"</p><p></p><p>In a lower space under Xu Ke, there were several large luminous spheres hovering.</p><p></p><p>Within the luminous spheres, blurry figures could be discerned.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a nine-headed red bird in the luminous sphere spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Its voice was like metal plates rubbing against each other, extremely harsh and unpleasant. However, it seemed to hold a high position among the demon beasts, as when it spoke, all demon beasts instantly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow beings, let us welcome our great Emperor Yi, who has convened the demon beasts after many years for a council!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>With its words, all the demon beasts in the space seemed to erupt at once.</p><p></p><p>Each expressed extreme excitement, conveying inner joy through enthusiastic roars.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a huge shadow descended suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A grey "fleshy mass," constantly squirming with heads popping up and disappearing, appeared above the demon beasts' heads like dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>All demon beasts present fell silent and bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Looks... so ugly, doesn't it?" he lowered his voice cautiously.</p><p></p><p>The child, upon hearing this, didn't get angry but surprisingly nodded in agreement, "Hehe, I think so too. Indeed, very ugly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>To dare call the most respected demon beast in the demon beast's stronghold ugly.</p><p></p><p>This child...</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could figure it out, the words of the Emperor Beast One below drew his attention.</p><p></p><p>"Fellows, I have summoned you all here today because it is once again time to decide the life and death of the demon beast tribe."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's voice was very peculiar.</p><p></p><p>Coming from different parts of the flesh mass, it sounded like a fusion of countless different voices, difficult to distinguish yet strangely uniform.</p><p></p><p>It sounded slightly mechanical and yet ethereal, incredibly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Emperor One continued, "An impending calamity is approaching the realm. This time's calamity will be more cruel than ever before."</p><p></p><p>"Not only humans, but we demon beasts, and even the entire world, will face a destructive crisis. Even with our bloodline memories containing enough experience to deal with disasters, it seems we may not escape this one..."</p><p></p><p>The demon beasts below erupted into a commotion upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The flesh mass wriggled, and shadows of light flickered over the demon beasts' heads.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, all the demon beasts quieted down and lowered their heads, showing respect.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, for the future of our tribe, I need to listen to everyone's opinions."</p><p></p><p>In the light spheres below the flesh cloud, a demon with a striking resemblance to Emperor One, a faceless spherical being, also spoke up, "Emperor Yi, whatever you say, we will do."</p><p></p><p>"I, Purple Soulless, will always be your most loyal subject!"</p><p></p><p>With Purple Soulless's words, many other demon beasts below echoed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Then I decide to lead you all to leave the realm of Xuanhuang and seek a new homeland, agreed?" unexpectedly, Emperor Yi asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Purple Soulless evidently did not expect Emperor Yi to propose this, looking somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Before it could reply, the ancient Blue Dragon next to it spoke up first.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor One, what is the reasoning behind your decision? Are you saying that with our demon beast's immense power, we cannot survive the so-called calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes. We have endured so many calamities, and even if we leave, where can we go?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 667</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Like a huge swirling storm, with continuous flashes of lightning and thunder, the sky also grew dark.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan tried to use the Xuan Bird Feather and its control over the fate to no avail. It was clear that his efforts were in vain. Compared to just a feather, the black Xuan Bird at the top of the three-legged tower was the true ruler of this beast world.</p><p></p><p>Even in the face of the powerful suction force, Li Fan faintly felt the signs of the loose and plundered fate that had already been absorbed into his body.</p><p></p><p>Although Fang Zaiji could not see the changes in fate, the increasingly restless appearance of the black Xuan Bird was visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of seriousness on his face but still with disdain in his mouth, he said, "Even if one is dead, can a plea for mercy bring them back to life!"</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Zaiji was very cautious. Before the ceremony of the many demon beasts was completed, he transformed into a towering giant palm, holding a large dark gray hammer, and swiftly smashed it towards the black bird on the top of the tower.</p><p></p><p>"Buzz!"</p><p></p><p>The gray hammer filled the sky, making even the towering three-legged tower seem like a toy before it. With a deafening roar, the hammer fell, causing a deafening explosion.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in the next moment, the black three-legged tower and the thousands of beasts below would all be smashed to death by this hammer!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a bolt of lightning suddenly struck from the sky, hitting the gray hammer hard. The gray hammer paused in the air for a moment, then dozens of lightning bolts the size of water buckets suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>With each strike, the shape of the hammer shrank a bit. But after a moment, the hammer, the size of a mountain, had turned into something as ordinary as a human object. And as the lightning struck on the top of the tower, Fang Zaiji's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not just because the hammer was under attack, but also because the location where he stood began to undergo a drastic change.</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds rolled in the sky, dark and heavy as if they could drip water. The yellow demon wind howled like sharp blades, cutting through the earth, as if with intelligence, all aiming straight towards Fang Zaiji. The surging earth fire erupted suddenly from under Fang Zaiji's feet, like an angry fire dragon ready to devour him; golden chains of runes emerged from the void, coiling around Fang Zaiji's limbs without warning. And overhead, the black lightning kept flashing...</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji seemed to have become the archenemy of the entire beast world. The wind, fire, thunder, electricity, and everything in the world, under the influence of fate, began launching relentless attacks against him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please move further away for now." Fang Zaiji's eyes became serious as he threw out a green bell, which hovered over Li Fan, who had already moved far away.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a flick of his mouth, he spat out thirty-six leaf-like flying blades.</p><p></p><p>The emerald green flying blades were exceptionally agile, as if alive, and in an instant, they surrounded Fang Zaiji protectively.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the rain fell, the wind blew, the fire burned, or the lightning struck, they were easily blocked by the fleeting threads of green light.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's face remained calm as he strode towards the tower top. The golden chains on him tightened instantly, trying to hold him back. But Fang Zaiji's steps were firm. The chains only tensed for a moment before cracks began to appear in the void where they connected.</p><p></p><p>The chains grew longer and longer. Eventually, unable to withstand the extreme pulling force, they shattered inch by inch, and the golden light dispersed in the air.</p><p></p><p>"The enemy of the world, it is the ultimate version of the Indestructible Killing Mechanism. But even so, it cannot harm Fang Zaiji in the slightest. After all, the hierarchy of the world is at a disadvantage, and in the face of a transcendent expert from another realm, no matter how much resistance there is, he is not an opponent." Under the protection of the green bell, Li Fan calmly watched the battle and thought so.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was getting closer and closer to the black three-legged tower. The beasts that had been kneeling and worshiping gradually grew confused.</p><p></p><p>Some became more panicked and devout in their worship. Some desperate to escape were killed on the spot by the leaders among them. Some were reckless, charging at Fang Zaiji without fear of life or death, attempting to sacrifice themselves to kill the terrifying intruder.</p><p></p><p>But their fate was already sealed. The power gap between the two sides was too great that when Fang Zaiji finally stood at the top of the three-legged tower, looking at the trembling beasts kneeling below, he felt a sense of emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"Boring!" he snorted, then picked up Li Fan from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"Main Master, is what you are looking for here?" Fang Zaiji asked.</p><p></p><p>With the support of the ceremony of the many beasts gone, the shadow of the Xuan Bird on the tower top returned to its original form. It turned out to be just a projection of a Xuan Bird image.</p><p></p><p>The vast fate that had gathered at the tower top, now unleashed without constraints, flowed slowly towards other corners of the world like water.</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the small black image, Li Fan looked up and, at the same time, activated the divine ability "Fate Is Mine," madly absorbing the unleashed fate using the Xuan Bird Feather.</p><p></p><p>As if numerous rivers flowing into the sea, the absorption of fate was unusually smooth. There were almost no obstacles. But after half a day, Li Fan had absorbed all the gathered fate in this place.</p><p></p><p>And the effect was immediate.</p><p></p><p>With the three-legged tower as the center, Li Fan could instantly perceive any movement within a radius of thousands of miles. And within this area, Li Fan had almost achieved control over the elements.</p><p></p><p>He searched with his eyes closed for a moment, then frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that the bones of the little black one were not here. The reason why the beasts could manipulate fate through the ceremony was merely because the image had been endowed with a slight self-empowerment by the little black one.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter, it will be found sooner or later in this small world." Li Fan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>In the days that followed, Li Fan, accompanied by Fang Zaiji, traversed the beast world. Wherever they went, the beasts were powerless and surrendered one after another.</p><p></p><p>Their already weak resistance, with the establishment of new passages and the arrival of the majority forces led by Liu San from the Medicine King Sect, was completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you've found a good place this time! I was just worried that the Longsheng Valley was too small and not enough for the disciples to move around!" Liu San scanned the beast world with his divine sense, nodded slightly, showing a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>"Although the strength of these beasts is mostly insignificant, they are enough to help cultivate and manage the spiritual fields. Those slightly stronger ones can also be used to guard the house."</p><p></p><p>"This plan is feasible. When I refine a batch of Beast Control Rings, I won't be afraid of these animals losing control."</p><p></p><p>...</p>

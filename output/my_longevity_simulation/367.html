        <div class="content">
            <p>The soul was constantly growing at a perceivable speed.</p><p></p><p>"It really works!"</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious yellow refining heart curse, combined with the life and death induction chapter, does have an amazing effect!"</p><p></p><p>Lee Fan's speculation turned into reality, making him somewhat pleased.</p><p></p><p>"With this, the strengthening speed of my soul might reach a terrifying level."</p><p></p><p>Just as Lee Fan was about to continue his efforts and retry the life and death induction chapter,</p><p></p><p>the result deviated from his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of the recent shock, causing a psychological adaptation.</p><p></p><p>Even though the face of the Heavenly Doctor was almost touching Lee Fan's face, there was not a hint of fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, thoughts like "Forget it, just do it. Kill me quickly" flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"If the heart is fearless, how can it be feared by death?"</p><p></p><p>Lee Fan seemed to realize something, shook his head, and stopped practicing.</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand why Zhong Shentong chose to end his life. It seems like the influence of this life and death mysterious skill."</p><p></p><p>"However, despite its flaws, giving up the combination of refining heart curse with practice seems quite regrettable."</p><p></p><p>"After all, completing a full reverse cultivation of the Dao heart is quite troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"With the help of the life and death induction chapter, the feedback is almost immediate."</p><p></p><p>"And the combination of both can be used simultaneously."</p><p></p><p>"After this world's adaptation period, I will try practicing again and see the results."</p><p></p><p>"In the next life, perhaps I can supplement 'The Life and Death Mysterious Skill' through Extension Method Jue."</p><p></p><p>For him, the flaws in the technique were not a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were advantages, he could make them his own.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, when he collected enough techniques, he could use Extension Method Jue to deduce a unique and truly his own 'Tian Luo Divine Skill'.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's sudden visit caused Master Li, who was known for his diligence, to take a rare break for a few days.</p><p></p><p>However, the fellow cultivators of the Jiuxu number had no objections.</p><p></p><p>They even hoped that Master Li could rest for a longer period.</p><p></p><p>If Master Li really collapsed due to exhaustion and died on duty, they would probably be blamed for it for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But the hopes of the fellow cultivators were doomed to be in vain.</p><p></p><p>When Master Li came out of seclusion, he immediately resumed the construction of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation without any pause.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once he started this time, there was no moment of rest.</p><p></p><p>When the outer formation structures of the locking formation merged with the other formations led by Xue Mu, Master Li took the lead and started building the inner formation towards the central position.</p><p></p><p>This recklessly diligent behavior made Xue Mu and the others feel ashamed.</p><p></p><p>They had no choice but to follow, working tirelessly.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the time came to the anchoring of the 35th year.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Master Li was working attentively to construct the formation unit when, unexpectedly, he made an extremely rare mistake in setting the formation.</p><p></p><p>The guards beside him all looked surprised.</p><p></p><p>This had never happened since they started following Master Li.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that Master Li was renowned for his efficient and precise formation setting skills.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Comparison Grand Ranking, he was now among the top ten.</p><p></p><p>Many formation masters who came from afar to observe felt self-deprecating after witnessing his skills.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that years of exhaustion had finally taken a toll on his body?</p><p></p><p>The group exchanged worried glances.</p><p></p><p>However, shortly after, the waves of spiritual energy emanating from Master Li gave them a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, has your cultivation progressed to a new level?" He Chen couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Master Li nodded slightly in response to He Chen's question.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Master Li admit it personally, He Chen and the others were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Working so hard in such a harsh environment for years without much time for cultivation and reaching the end of his lifespan had completely overturned their understanding.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this was the fabled case of good deeds eventually having good outcomes?</p><p></p><p>Master Li didn't have time to care about the thoughts of the fellow cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He was trying to view the situation of Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo through the Non-Phase Killing Mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Because the significant increase in his progress through feedback came from the disappearance of the two in the ruins of Chaoyuan Sect nearly ten years ago.</p><p></p><p>"These ten years, they seemed to completely disappear from this world with no feedback at all."</p><p></p><p>"Now, appearing after ten years, they gave me a big surprise."</p><p></p><p>Since practicing the "Zuo Mountain Technique," this was the biggest investment return Master Li had received.</p><p></p><p>Far exceeding the feedback limits that an Aurous Core cultivator could provide.</p><p></p><p>Master Li estimated that Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo had probably both stepped into the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Even with their talents, it's too exaggerated to cultivate from the Foundation Establishment stage to the Nascent Soul realm within ten years."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, where did the techniques and blessed lands come from?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems they gained quite a lot in the ruins of Chaoyuan Sect."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of the distance and the deep white mist, aiding from the Spirit-Shocking Array they left behind, momentarily they couldn't sense the situation over there.</p><p></p><p>However, the long-abandoned White Bone Forward Realm oddly welcomed visitors once again.</p><p></p><p>As the owner of the White Bone Forward Realm, Master Li felt something.</p><p></p><p>He signaled everyone to rest temporarily, returned to the Jiuxu base, entered the secret room, and performed the ritual.</p><p></p><p>When he entered, the visitors had already left the realm.</p><p></p><p>But judging from the residual aura, the visitor was likely to be Su Xiaomei without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Master Li quickly noticed a pile of strange objects in the place where the "skull" predecessor lay dormant, following the previous instructions.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the instructions he once received, Master Li's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Approaching, he picked up one of the peculiar items and carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>With a timely prompt, after selecting, the anchoring charging progress slightly flickered.</p><p></p><p>In the end, there was no change.</p><p></p><p>"A celestial anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>Master Li looked at the shabby "junk" before him in a bizarre manner.</p><p></p><p>"All damaged celestial anomalies that emerged from the body after the death of the cultivator."</p><p></p><p>And the quantity...</p><p></p><p>Master Li counted slightly, causing his heart to skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand seven hundred and sixty-two items.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, these were all obtained by Su Xiaomei from the ruins of Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>After picking up another item, Master Li carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>Rather than appearing as historical relics that had been around for a long time, they seemed more like freshly taken out from the body of a deceased cultivator.</p><p></p><p>They even had a thick aura of blood lingering around them.</p><p></p><p>"Techniques, blessed lands, and so many celestial anomalies..."</p><p></p><p>"Shuofeng, Su Xiaomei, and the others, what have they encountered in the ruins of Chaoyuan Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Despite numerous doubts in his mind, Master Li did not hesitate to absorb the celestial anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Upon absorbing thirteen anomalies in succession, the anchoring charging progress finally experienced a wave of fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>It changed from 2% to 3%.</p>

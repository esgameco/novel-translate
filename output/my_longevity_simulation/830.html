        <h1>Chapter 830</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivators no longer discussed those dark past events that had been exposed. After all, they had heard so much that they had become accustomed to it. Instead, they all began to gather information about the content of the previous Immortal Alliance entrance exams.</p><p></p><p>They were eager to become members of the Immortal Alliance system.</p><p></p><p>A crisis that could have led to internal chaos was quietly quelled in this way.</p><p></p><p>The resolution was so skillful that even after half a month had passed, Li Fan still couldn't help but replay it in his mind and sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"With a wave of the hand, the crisis was eliminated without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"All that was needed was just a single notice."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sincerely praised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't think of a better way to deal with it either.</p><p></p><p>"The entrance exam in six months is so grand. How can I not take a share..."</p><p></p><p>"However, although this world hasn't started for long, the trajectory has already begun to deviate significantly. Those exam questions should have also changed."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, the information about the exam questions from previous entrance exams flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The essence remains the same despite all changes. Although it's impossible to accurately predict the questions, it's not difficult to create a rough scope of question bank."</p><p></p><p>He casually took out a blank jade slip, and a blue light suddenly burst out from the Huadao stone crystal in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Then a huge amount of data madly poured into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>It took a full tea time to completely input it all.</p><p></p><p>"The efficiency of the upgraded middle-grade Huadao stone is indeed much higher. The computing power has directly increased by more than double."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's fingers slid across the lustrous surface of the jade slip, nodding with great satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>The upgrade of the Huadao stone was finally achieved, not only thanks to his unremitting efforts to fuse in Yin Yin's tomb every reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The lower-grade Huadao stone provided by the Five Elders Council in this transaction was also crucial.</p><p></p><p>Although also lower-grade, its quality was far better than the one in Yin Yin's tomb. It was almost infinitely close to a middle-grade existence.</p><p></p><p>After devouring it, the one in Li Fan's spiritual sea immediately jumped to middle-grade.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Five Elders Council only agreed to provide this one piece. They were even willing to give more Celestial Lord artifacts, but refused to give me more Huadao stones."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they also have special uses?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned and pondered. After a moment, he let it go.</p><p></p><p>Although Celestial Lord artifacts are extremely precious, they can be reproduced after all. Compared with Huadao stones that decrease by one with each use, it's hard to say which is more valuable.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the Immortal Alliance entrance exam question bank. This should be able to exchange for more from them."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's to take the opportunity to plant spies or choose to cause destruction, there is great potential."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly made plans in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Ci!"</p><p></p><p>A figure flashed by, and Shang Tianci immediately came to Li Fan's side, wagging his tail.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Ling's existence, the passionate young man, who had already been successfully brainwashed by Li Fan, was now even more obedient to Li Fan's orders. He tried his best to prove himself in every possible way.</p><p></p><p>The previous outdoor shooting was no longer like sightseeing. Instead, he quickly visited all the necessary wondrous scenery, and then hurried back without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he could be transported through the Tianjing gourd, otherwise rushing long distances in such a short time would have exhausted him to death.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had worked so hard, the arrival of Tian Yang still made him feel an unprecedented sense of crisis.</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Compared to the talkative and constantly flattering Shang Tianci, Lin Ling was still more interested in the wooden-headed Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>This made Shang Tianci anxious. He had to resort to roundabout ways, trying to please Li Fan and salvage the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you have any instructions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw the jade slip in his hand over: "First, make a hundred copies of this jade slip."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Shang Tianci, thinking it wasn't a difficult task, immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>However, after taking it and carefully examining the contents of the jade slip, he first let out a cry of pain, covering his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Then he exclaimed: "Senior, this is too much!"</p><p></p><p>"If it's not much, I can carve it myself. What do I need you for?" Li Fan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, it's urgent. Give it to me within seven days."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci's face turned bitter. Looking at Li Fan's serious face, he didn't dare to resist. Gritting his teeth, he went to work.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then looked at the tree people diligently working all over the land of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it seems these tree creations are not within the scope of the Sitting Immortal Technique."</p><p></p><p>Compared to when Li Fan first entered the Spirit Wood, the overall strength of these tree people had made obvious progress.</p><p></p><p>The largest batch had grown from the early stage of Qi Refining to the equivalent of the late stage of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Tree people with Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stage strength also emerged in an explosive manner.</p><p></p><p>The female chief of the tree people benefited the most.</p><p></p><p>She could already fight evenly with ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Such obvious progress was partly due to Shang Tianci constantly transporting the Mysterious Yellow Wonders.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was due to the treasure brought by the Five Elders' transaction this time: [Heavenly Dew].</p><p></p><p>Although there was only one drop, the Spirit Tree surged again by half its size.</p><p></p><p>The tree crown had already reached the sky, looking as if it would pierce through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was also the biggest beneficiary of this transformation.</p><p></p><p>From barely being considered a match for the Harmonious Dao realm when she was first born, to now being firmly in the Harmonious Dao realm, only a month or so had passed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the secret support from the ancient tree elder of the earth veins...</p><p></p><p>"It's really infuriating to compare oneself with others."</p><p></p><p>"I have to go through a lot of trouble just to form my Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan also vaguely felt that when resources reached a certain level, it was also a very simple matter to cultivate cultivators with a certain combat power.</p><p></p><p>"The illustrious families of the Immortal Alliance must not be as simple as they appear on the surface."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then focused his attention on the tree people all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Their tasks were roughly divided into two parts.</p><p></p><p>One part was responsible for constructing the building complex of the [Myriad Realms United Association].</p><p></p><p>The other tree people transported various materials and placed them in designated locations throughout the Spirit Wood Realm to prepare for [Array Refinement].</p><p></p><p>The so-called [Array Refinement] was a way of sacrificing and refining magic treasures.</p><p></p><p>To completely refine a magic treasure, in addition to the conventional fire refinement and heart blood refinement, there was also this special method.</p><p></p><p>It was often used by array masters.</p><p></p><p>Carving complex formations on the treasure.</p><p></p><p>Not only could it thoroughly make the treasure one's own, but it could also use formations to amplify the power of the treasure itself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not very proficient in the Dao of tool refinement, so naturally he couldn't learn tool refinement from scratch just to sacrifice and refine a magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>With the ultimate treasure, the Terminal Dissociation Disc, in his possession, [Array Refinement] was naturally the most suitable.</p><p></p><p>However, after several transformations, the Spirit Wood Realm had become much wider than ordinary small worlds.</p>

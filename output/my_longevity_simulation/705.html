        <h1>Chapter 705</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He quickly realized that the suicide mentioned by Xu Bai was referring to this alternative self.</p><p></p><p>"Why would the young master go to this extent? With me and Old Fang here, along with the Medicine King's True Cauldron, even if we're not a match, it wouldn't be difficult to escape," Liu San looked at Xu Bai, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't explain much, simply saying, "It's just a precaution."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Liu San didn't inquire further and instead advised, "If you want to take your own life for convenience, young master, you can use your spiritual power to encase the Soul-Melting Body Extinguishing Pill, swallow it into your Dantian. At a critical moment, dispersing the pill, the medicinal energy can spread throughout your body in an instant. During this process, you also need to be cautious..."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Liu San's detailed instructions, Xu Bai calmly swallowed the highly toxic pill.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the imminent threat to his life within his Dantian, Xu Bai's heart suddenly felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, with the 'Mystical Transformation of Souls and Spirits,' a method to abandon the alternate self's life at any time, under this double insurance, it shouldn't come to a point where seeking death is the only option," he said.</p><p></p><p>After all, the alternate self needed to head to the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance to confer the Grand Law Jewel, and one couldn't anticipate what level of powerful individuals they would encounter there.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Bai's appearance and aura were unique...</p><p></p><p>It was reasonable to make comprehensive preparations.</p><p></p><p>"Next, it will depend on how Jiao Dao performs," Xu Bai stood in the void of the Beast-Kind Realm, his gaze seeming to penetrate through various time and space obstacles, seeing the scene within Tian Ling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>------</p><p></p><p>"The hell, when was the last time our Tian Ling Prefecture was this lively?" Xu Bai</p><p></p><p>Within the Tian Ling City, the guard cultivators sent by the City Lord to maintain order, seeing the densely packed group of cultivators gathered in the city, cursed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>But as the words reached his lips, he suddenly hesitated.</p><p></p><p>As if forgetting something important, he couldn't snap out of it for a moment. "When was the last time we had this many people in Tian Ling Prefecture?" he asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"It was during the Tian Ling War," a slim and serious cultivator beside him said in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>The vanished memory resurfaced in his mind, reminiscent of an event that seemed to have occurred hundreds of years ago. The guard cultivator appeared disconnected, his expression becoming somewhat dazed. "Yes, there were this many people in the city before the Tian Ling War."</p><p></p><p>"Sun, your memory is quite sharp. I almost forgot about this..." Xu Bai</p><p></p><p>Ignoring his colleague's mutterings, Sun Qi continued to inspect the “Flower Invitation” in his hands, his eyes flashing with a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Flower Invitation was an invitation to the upcoming Flower Appreciation Festival.</p><p></p><p>Due to the overwhelming number of cultivators who had come for this event, even though the City Lord had already prepared a large space, it was starting to feel insufficient.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any mishaps, all cultivators wishing to enter and behold the true appearance of the "Tian Ling Flower" had to enter in sequence according to their arrival. With everyone eager to see the Tian Ling Flower, the entrance fee of a hundred contribution points wasn't a concern; the issue was time.</p><p></p><p>The line of cultivators had filled the entire city, and even the teleportation array leading to the city from the outside world had been temporarily closed for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators wanting to see the Tian Ling Flower didn't know how long they would have to wait.</p><p></p><p>As for the Flower Appreciation Festival itself, there was no specific duration mentioned.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Ling Flower, stored by the Owner at the Qi Li Tang, might be taken away at any time. It was possible that if one missed this opportunity, there might not be another.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the earlier one saw the Tian Ling Flower, the better.</p><p></p><p>The Flower Invitation was a qualification to enter early without queuing.</p><p></p><p>The price of the invitation had reportedly soared to ten thousand contribution points each, and they were limited in quantity, not readily available for purchase.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi possessed one because it was gifted to him by his uncle. Xu Bai</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi's uncle, Sun Liancheng, was the new City Lord of Tian Ling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>A Harmony Dao cultivator, he was responsible for overseeing the realm of Tian Ling</p><p></p><p>"That Tian Ling Flower does seem quite remarkable. It appears to have changed compared to what I've seen before. You can go take a look; perhaps you might be able to break through successfully," Sun Liancheng's tone was somewhat cold, seemingly not holding out much hope.</p><p></p><p>The reason being Sun Qi had been trapped in the Golden Elixir realm due to the "Tian's Calamity" for far too long.</p><p></p><p>Having exhausted all methods, even risking his life by engaging in battles at the Tian Ling War Site, attempting to break through the Xuan Gate of life and death, had all ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Sun Qi himself, everyone in the family had given up.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Ling Flower..." Sun Qi recalled its appearance from memory.</p><p></p><p>As a native cultivator of Tian Ling Prefecture, he was naturally familiar with the flower.</p><p></p><p>Before the great war, he had occasionally purchased a few pots to bring back home for admiration when his interest arose.</p><p></p><p>However, after the war, the Tian Ling Flower had become tainted with the stench of blood.</p><p></p><p>Every time he saw it, it reminded him of the purgatory scenes during the Tian Ling War. Since then, he hadn't bought any more of them.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect there to be an original Tian Ling Flower in this world," Sun Qi couldn't help but feel a bit dreamy.</p><p></p><p>As a colleague approached for task completion and handover, Xu Bai</p><p></p><p>The "Flower Cave" was the location prepared by Tian Ling City for the Flower Appreciation Festival, opened by his uncle Sun Liancheng and a cultivator named Zhao Chong jointly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Chong was known for his love of flowers.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing about the Flower Appreciation Festival being held in Tian Ling Prefecture, he approached Sun Liancheng through an intermediary, expressing his willingness to help for free with setting up the venue. He did so in hopes of getting a chance to see the real demeanor of the Tian Ling Flower.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhao Chong was only a Nascent Divinity cultivator, his network of friends was extensive, and he had connections with several esteemed Harmony Dao cultivators in the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng couldn't refuse and agreed to his proposal.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Flower Cave was located above the City's wide square. Jiao Xiuyuan, with a dark complexion, had set up a table and stood smiling at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>After showing the Flower Invitation, Sun Qi was finally able to enter the Flower Cave.</p><p></p><p>Before he could clearly see anything, the enchanting scent of flowers already wafted towards him.</p><p></p><p>On the open ground laid with various flowers, numerous cultivators had already taken their seats on chairs woven from green vines.</p><p></p><p>The usually reclusive Sun Qi scanned around but didn't recognize anyone. Thus, he directly proceeded to the seat corresponding to his invitation and patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the atmosphere inside the cave suddenly became lively.</p><p></p><p>The first lucky ones had begun to enter gradually.</p><p></p><p>Once all the cultivators were inside, Jiao Xiuyuan suddenly appeared on a high platform constructed with various beautiful flowers. He held a red wooden box in his hand, attracting the gaze of all present.</p><p></p><p>"Friends, the Flower Appreciation Festival has officially begun!"</p><p></p><p>Without many words, Jiao Xiuyuan declared after a brief opening speech.</p>

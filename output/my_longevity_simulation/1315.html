        <h1>Chapter 1315</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The apocalyptic transformation of the Xuanhuang realm occurs when the Xuanhuang realm senses its impending destruction and naturally produces various extreme changes in order to preserve itself. </p><p></p><p>They are all existences that have evolved one aspect to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>For example, the heat death and frozen apocalypse that Li Fan used in his previous life to disguise himself as a Hedao cultivator. Its strength was no weaker than the ice essence of an ordinary Xuanhuang realm, and even stronger than most others.</p><p></p><p>Apocalyptic transformations are often filled with offensive and destructive power. Since they are usually only born when the Xuanhuang realm faces the crisis of destruction, when they appear in the world, they will inevitably trigger the Xuanhuang Heaven's instinctive reaction of vigilance and distrust towards the bearer of the apocalyptic transformation, just like Li Fan's current situation.</p><p></p><p>However, after absorbing its separated evil thoughts, the Xuanhuang Heaven underwent changes similar to being infused with spiritual power and a full revival. Only the changes manifested on the foundational laws of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the transformation of reverse longevity for now, the various restrictions on cultivators in the Xuanhuang realm also became more stringent as the Xuanhuang realm revived internally.</p><p></p><p>The bottlenecks of Heavenly Tribulation, the prohibition on practicing multiple disciplines, and the abnormalities appearing after falling from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>These laws closely related to cultivation were changing rapidly and silently.</p><p></p><p>It would become harder for cultivators to break through realms. More of a cultivator's past information would be recorded in the abnormalities appearing after falling. The evaluation criteria for different disciplines would also become stricter, and the total number of cultivation methods in the world would be mysteriously reduced.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Li Fan vaguely sensed that the efficiency with which the Xuanhuang Heaven absorbed and transformed the foundation of fallen cultivators and world fragments was slowly increasing as its power grew.</p><p></p><p>A faint sound like digestion echoed through the world, imperceptible to ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang realm, cultivators devoured the heavens and earth in their cultivation. With the Xuanhuang Heaven's power suddenly expanding, the strength of cultivators within would also surge rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Establishing foundations, battling Golden Cores, Golden Cores surpassing Nascent Souls - this may become the norm in the near future.</p><p></p><p>Those leading cultivators who wish to escape this predicament would either have to rebuild their foundations from scratch or find a way to quickly break through to higher realms.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, these cultivators who have not "grown" along with the Xuanhuang Heaven would soon become obsolete relics of their time.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing all the earthshaking transformations in the Xuanhuang realm, Li Fan only observed seriously without extracting anything. Although the growth rate of the Xuanhuang realm was still far from Li Fan's requirements, it was enough to provide him with inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"This is the transformation of the Dao. Those who follow it shall live, those who lose it shall perish. It is so in the Xuanhuang realm, so in the Dark Star Sea, and perhaps it was once so in the immortal realm as well," Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He recalled Sun Erlang's experience in the illusion of the True Fruit in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of harvest they will reap in this life's journey to the Carefree Paradise?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Debate of the Dao platform, his silver-white eyes rotated slightly, and the scenes of Sun Erlang and the others appeared within.</p><p></p><p>Although they were only Golden Core cultivators, they were fortunate to receive the teachings of a sage. The array formations of the Myriad Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Assembly were like child's play to them.</p><p></p><p>They charged straight ahead, passing through the Human Realm Heavenly Territory, and finally reached the so-called Carefree Paradise.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it seemed no different from other regions of the Xuanhuang realm.  </p><p></p><p>Yue Zhenwei, the eldest of the three, looked around with a hint of doubt: "Does it seem like there are fewer people here than in other places of the Five Elders' Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang nodded: "Indeed. And they all look listless too. How does this look anything like 'carefree'?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba said indifferently: "Who cares? Our purpose in coming here is to search for the celestial realm needed to break through to the Nascent Soul realm, right? Naturally, the fewer people, the better!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun and Yue also felt it made sense. Do what you are capable of. The secrets of the Carefree Paradise were naturally not something small Golden Core cultivators like them could uncover.</p><p></p><p>So they continued concealing their tracks, practicing the secret arts taught by the sage, searching for traces of a celestial realm within the Carefree Paradise.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Ten days passed, and they found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! We've practically scoured the entire Qiuxi Province, how could we not find a single celestial realm?" Wang Xuanba was full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Either the sage's secret arts had a problem, or..." Yue Zhenwei's expression was also unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang continued: "Perhaps there are simply no celestial realms within this Carefree Paradise. Or rather, what we're seeing now is not the true Carefree Paradise, but merely an empty shell. The legendary dreamscape is where it truly lies."</p><p></p><p>"What should we do next?" Wang Xuanba scratched his head. "We can't just enter the dreamscape and steal things, can we? Why don't we go back to the Human Realm Heavenly Territory and take a look? Although the defenses are tighter there, the domain is also much larger. As long as we're careful, borrowing a few celestial realms shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Sun and Yue both nodded in agreement.  </p><p></p><p>The three quickly reached a consensus and prepared to leave the Carefree Paradise.</p><p></p><p>But what made them inexplicably horrified was that even though they retraced their original path, when they reached the border of the Carefree Paradise, the scenery they saw was different.</p><p></p><p>The white mist barrier that naturally divided the heavens and earth into provinces had disappeared. What appeared before the three was an endless, boundless desert stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The three stood at the edge of the desert, rubbing the yellow sand between their fingers.</p><p></p><p>"It's real," Sun Erlang said in a deep voice, clenching his fist.</p><p></p><p>Still in disbelief, Wang Xuanba stepped into the quicksand: "How is this possible? It was fine when we came, but now we can't go back? We didn't get lost either!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we've unwittingly entered the true dreamscape of the Carefree Paradise," said Yue Zhenwei, the calmest of the three.</p><p></p><p>He gazed into the distance of the desert but found no signs of life.</p><p></p><p>"It's best we don't venture into this desert. Let's try another direction."</p><p></p><p>The three crossed Qiuxi Province again and at another border saw a completely different scene.</p><p></p><p>Thunderous streams of water cascaded down from the ninth heaven. Upon falling into Qiuxi, they instantly turned into shimmering bubbles and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Not far away hung a world of water suspended in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Not only did various creatures swim within, but one could vaguely make out many underwater structures arrayed inside.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we try going there? We can't leave now anyway," suggested Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>"Let's look around some more," said Yue Zhenwei, carefully observing. He found that although there was life in this water world, the civilized entities that built the underwater structures were wriggling fish-like creatures.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Fish. </p><p></p><p>They seemed to have their own language and writing, ruling this underwater world. </p><p></p><p>But to Sun Erlang and the other two, who were merely separated by a thin line and brazenly observing, the fish were completely unaware. As if existing in different worlds.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily leaving the water world, the three followed along the border of Qiuxi State, searching everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Not far away in the state's territory, a huge rock stood by the sea.  </p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same as the giant rock they had previously seen by the sea at the border between the Xuanhuang and Linzhou States.</p><p></p><p>"Great! We've finally found the way out!" Wang Xuanba excitedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to rush over, Sun Erlang stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful! Something doesn't seem right!"</p><p></p><p>Following Sun Erlang's words, two figures appeared one after the other above the giant seaside rock. </p><p></p><p>The first one looked haggard, seemingly severely injured.</p><p></p><p>While the figure chasing behind, though clearly faster than the first, seemed to be savoring the thrill of the hunt, constantly controlling the distance between them. Allowing the fleeing one to have the illusion that with a bit more effort, they could escape. But in reality, there was no way to break free.</p><p></p><p>If it were a normal chase, the three wouldn't have been so shocked. However, the human cultivator fleeing in panic was actually being pursued by a beast with a human body and dog's head!</p><p></p><p>Just as the human cultivator was about to flee out of the Shilin State's range towards the Congcun Sea, the dog-headed beast finally grew impatient and actively ended this game of chase.</p><p></p><p>Its hands turned back into dog paws, firmly pinning down the human cultivator. Watching the human's agonized and desperate expression as they screamed, the dog-headed beast roared with laughter.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied, it opened its mouth, about to swallow the human cultivator whole.</p><p></p><p>"Evil beast! Stop!" In his passionate youthful days, how could Wang Xuanba possibly watch such a man-eating scene unfold before his eyes?</p><p></p><p>Before Sun and Yue could stop him, an ancient gray-white giant axe emanating an air of antiquity burst through the boundary between the two realms, appearing before the dog-headed beast.</p><p></p><p>Yet that dog-headed beast seemed to have been prepared.</p><p></p><p>A savage, excited look flashed in its eyes as it casually tossed aside the human cultivator meal it had acquired.  </p><p></p><p>Not even caring about the gray-white giant axe about to strike its head, it charged straight towards Wang Xuanba's group.</p><p></p><p>And following the dog-headed beast's movements, the Xuanhuang Shilin State it was in also suddenly expanded, instantly swallowing up Qiuxi State's territory and enveloping Sun Erlang's group within!</p><p></p><p>Like a dream descending into reality, the worlds of the dog-headed beast and Sun Erlang's group merged!</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba's gray-white giant axe struck the dog-headed beast's nape, but only produced the sound of metal clashing. His full-force strike capable of splitting mountains merely failed to cut through the beast's skin!</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba snorted coldly, unperturbed: "Did you think my grandfather's axe was just sharp? Relying on your beastly body's toughness to block it? A beast is a beast!"</p><p></p><p>The dog-headed beast seemed to understand Wang Xuanba's words, its expression slightly changing. Only then did it notice an obvious gray scar appearing on its nape. The gray rapidly spread upwards, directly devouring the beast's dog head.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the gray-white head dispersed like dust in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>But just as Wang Xuanba was gloating, the dog-headed beast that had lost its head actually moved again.</p><p></p><p>Its form flickered, already appearing before Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>Its dog paw turned into a black light, instantly piercing through Wang Xuanba's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanba!" Sun Erlang's eyes were bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>A blade reeking of deathly aura belatedly swept up, kicking up an endless black wind that swallowed the dog-headed beast.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the beast's flesh and blood had been completely blown away by the black wind, leaving only white bones behind.</p><p></p><p>However, these white bones emanated an unusual golden glow.</p><p></p><p>"Not good..." Yue Zhenwei's expression changed slightly, but he didn't notice the figure stealthily approaching from behind.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the human cultivator the dog-headed beast had been chasing!</p><p></p><p>A mocking smile on his lips, he looked at Yue Zhenwei with greedy eyes. His aura erupted, showing no signs of previous injury.</p><p></p><p>His neck abruptly extended, his head flying out to swallow Yue Zhenwei's head into his belly.</p><p></p><p>Poor Yue Zhenwei's attention was fully on the dog-headed beast and Sun Erlang, caught completely off guard by the sneak attack, instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh! You'll die for this!" Enraged by the successive deaths of his two companions, Sun Erlang's eyes turned blood-red. </p><p></p><p>Bulging veins, a black aura enveloping his body.</p><p></p><p>His pupils fully consumed by blackness, Sun Erlang recklessly charged towards the long-necked beast.</p><p></p><p>But he was tightly grabbed from behind by the golden white bones.</p><p></p><p>The golden bones locked him in while emitting eerie laughter.</p><p></p><p>"This trick works so well, always hooking a few idiots each time."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's fury only intensified.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>His howl shook heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>A black storm abruptly erupted from his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Far more terrifying than the black blade's black wind before.</p><p></p><p>It instantly devoured the taunting golden bones.</p><p></p><p>Before it could finish speaking, the golden bones vanished along with Sun Erlang into the black storm.</p><p></p><p>Yet the long-necked beast showed no intention of rescuing them.</p><p></p><p>It savored watching while munching on Yue Zhenwei's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the black storm completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>And the corpses of Yue Zhenwei and Wang Xuanba had become the long-necked beast's meal.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang and the others suddenly awoke from the nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat dripping from their foreheads, it took a while before they recovered from that horrific experience.</p><p></p><p>"I died?"  </p><p></p><p>"I'm not dead?!" Wang Xuanba said in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Yue Zhenwei was the first to calm down, observing their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we're still trapped in the Wulao Sect's Qiuxi State."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Yue Zhenwei looked up at the sky: "The entire world seems to have darkened?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not an illusion. The world we're in has indeed darkened, as if night fell," Sun Erlang observed in agreement.  </p><p></p><p>"But our realms haven't changed...wait, what's this?!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's voice suddenly rose sharply.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Erlang, Condensed Golden Dan, Death Count: 1."</p><p></p><p>"Realm Experience Level: 1." </p><p></p><p>"Worry-free Coins: 100."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang read aloud the lines that had appeared before his eyes, his expression utterly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"I have it too," Wang Xuanba exclaimed, also noticing something.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, no! Why are my Worry-free Coins zero?"</p>

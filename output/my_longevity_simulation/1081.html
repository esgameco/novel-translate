            <p>Chapter 1079: The Truth of the Misunderstanding</p><p></p><p>"Is this how the Beast Taming Sect treats its guests?" Mr. White's pleasant voice resounded through the heavens and earth. There was no trace of anger, but it made the sect's guardian, the Azure Dragon, feel greatly threatened as it glared at him.</p><p></p><p>Out of its own defensive instinct, just as the Azure Dragon was about to make a move, at this critical moment, a figure suddenly rose from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!" Accompanied by a miserable cry, it flew straight towards Mr. White.</p><p></p><p>The tense atmosphere was instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes in the world instantly focused on that small figure.</p><p></p><p>"It's Xu Ke..." Mr. White smiled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke rubbed the back of his head, feeling uneasy.</p><p></p><p>But he still opened his mouth shyly as Li Fan had taught him, "Mr. White, why are you here? Did you come to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Before Mr. White could answer, a blue light suddenly arrived from the horizon in an instant, blocking between him and Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Lu Ya!" Seeing old acquaintances one after another, Xu Ke was very excited.</p><p></p><p>And Mr. White, seeing the vigilance on Lu Ya's face, flashed a hint of helplessness in his eyes, "Lu Ya, long time no see."</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya said, "What business do you have?"</p><p></p><p>His tone was icy cold, full of wariness.</p><p></p><p>Mr. White didn't mind, and slowly said, "This trip is not with ill intent. I'm just here to find the Beast Taming Sect, as there is a matter I need their help with."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Ya fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elderly voice rang out, "Guests from afar are still guests, it is our Beast Taming Sect that has been inhospitable."</p><p></p><p>An old man with white hair and eyebrows appeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder?" Lu Ya was startled.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Sanmao nodded in response. Then he looked at Mr. White, "Honored guest, please follow me. If there is anything the Beast Taming Sect can assist with, we will certainly cooperate."</p><p></p><p>This very polite attitude made Lu Ya somewhat puzzled and hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>However, he still respected his teachers after all, and did not openly refute it.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will thank you in advance." As the saying goes, don't hit a smiling person. Mr. White also retracted the aura he was emitting.</p><p></p><p>Following Emperor Sanmao, he disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why did he leave?" Xu Ke, who originally thought Mr. White would take him along, felt a little frustrated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"I told you not to get too close to Mr. White! And you foolishly rushed up to him as soon as you saw him!" Lu Ya lightly patted Xu Ke's head and admonished.</p><p></p><p>"He is not at all like how he appears in front of us usually." Lu Ya looked into the distance of the Beast Taming Sect, his face gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Lu Ya, why do you say that?! Mr. White is really a great person!" Xu Ke was a bit puzzled, but said very seriously.</p><p></p><p>"After Ningyuan City was razed to the ground, we were under Mr. White's..."</p><p></p><p>"Under his command, calling on the people to save themselves. And helping to transfer all the wounded to the small broken temple."</p><p></p><p>"But, that day..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya fell into recollection, his expression a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Among the wounded, someone's condition suddenly worsened, and it looked like he wouldn't last. Mr. White happened to be away, and our skill level simply couldn't save him..."</p><p></p><p>"So we could only split up and search the city for Mr. White."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Ke also suddenly said, "Right, I remember now, there was indeed such an incident at the time. Not long after, Big Brother Lu Ya, your attitude towards Mr. White completely changed. Up to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Why is that?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Ya took a deep breath: "At that time, I searched everywhere for Mr. Bai but couldn't find him. Suddenly, I remembered that when I was seriously ill, Mr. Bai had taken me to his house for treatment. I vaguely remembered that there seemed to be a basement in his house."</p><p></p><p>"I thought, could it be that he was in the basement at this time? After a lot of effort, I finally found the entrance to the basement near Mr. Bai's house. Just as I was about to call out and inquire, I faintly smelled a bloody scent floating out from inside. I thought Mr. Bai was injured, so I rushed in without thinking. But what I saw was..."</p><p></p><p>"What did you see?" Xu Ke was also captivated by Lu Ya's description.</p><p></p><p>"Corpses. The entire basement was filled with dismembered corpses. And he was holding a sharp knife, dismembering the corpses and performing an evil ritual. Do you remember that Gou Zi used to have a few brothers? They were all forcibly sewn with dog bodies." Lu Ya asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke nodded.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, they mysteriously disappeared. I asked Mr. Bai, and he said he hadn't seen any trace of them either. But..." </p><p></p><p>Lu Ya gritted his teeth and said, "I clearly saw them among those few corpses in the basement!"</p><p></p><p>"This..." Xu Ke's eyes widened, not daring to believe any of this.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya continued, "The scene in that basement was simply like hell. Even now when I think back to it, I still feel cold all over. Not only was the smell of blood so strong that it was terrifying, but the ground was already stained dark red with blood. At the very back of the basement, there was an extremely bizarre faceless statue!"</p><p></p><p>"Even though I only saw it for a glance at the time, it often appears repeatedly in my nightmares. If you hadn't seen it with your own eyes, you would never imagine how evil it was!"</p><p></p><p>"He seemed very shocked by my sudden intrusion. But I immediately realized that he might kill me to silence me. Without a second word, I scrambled and crawled out of the secret room. I ran back to the small temple like a madman, wanting to expose Mr. Bai's true face. But he had always disguised himself too well! No one believed me at all!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"If I stayed by his side, I would surely be in danger of being harmed. I could only run away! Unfortunately, no matter what I said, only you were willing to run away with me."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, we met the master on the way, and we finally settled down in this Beast Taming Sect. But I never thought he would linger like a ghost and follow us here."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Ya's furrowed brows, Xu Ke suddenly felt very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe there's some misunderstanding?" Xu Ke still tried to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>"Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding could there be?" Lu Ya snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"You've seen him in person now. Facing the Dao-realm guardian Azure Dragon, he can remain unfazed. You can imagine how terrifyingly powerful he is now! In such a short time, he has cultivated to this extent. I can't think of any other way to achieve this except by exchanging it for the power of that evil ritual!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..." </p><p></p><p>Lu Ya paused for a moment: "I also investigated that bizarre faceless statue."</p><p></p><p>"It is the evil god worshipped by the ancient evil sect, the Xuantian Cult! The remnants of the Xuantian Cult, we cultivators, must eradicate them!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was not clear about what the Xuantian Cult was.</p><p></p><p>However, he did know the reason why Mr. Bai's cultivation was so fast.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to speak, he suddenly remembered Li Fan's warning that "the secrets of heaven must never be revealed", so he had to swallow his words back.</p>

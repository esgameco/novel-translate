        <h1>Chapter 812</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The nine mountains cannot be flown over, the cultivators sigh towards the sky. It is indeed a rare and magnificent sight!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a majestic mountain range, if an ordinary state had even one, it would be enough to be renowned throughout the world. Yet here, there are actually nine of them!"</p><p></p><p>The young man in white slowly walked to the foot of the Tianlao Mountains, exclaiming in admiration.</p><p></p><p>The young man had fair skin and was quite handsome. Only his eyes occasionally revealed a firmness that did not match his age.</p><p></p><p>Around his neck hung a long rope woven from green vines. </p><p></p><p>At the end of the green rope was tied a green gourd.</p><p></p><p>The young man shook the gourd, then pulled out the stopper and pointed the mouth towards the towering Tianlao Mountains in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After slightly adjusting the position, he nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Collect!"</p><p></p><p>With a light shout from his mouth, a virtual image seemed to be sucked from the distant Tianlao Mountains into the green gourd.</p><p></p><p>The young man put his nose to the mouth of the gourd and sniffed carefully.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a stunning view!" </p><p></p><p>His face was full of intoxicated expressions.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, his expression suddenly froze, and his body was also unable to move instantly.</p><p></p><p>A figure slowly appeared behind him, reached out and took the green gourd from his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Scenery Treasure Gourd, this thing is indeed not bad." The man laughed strangely.</p><p></p><p>A hint of horror flashed in the young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ordered Tianyang to lift up the young man, while he himself put away the treasure gourd.</p><p></p><p>"Shang Tianci, a member of the Immortal Alliance's [Shanhe Pavilion]. Condensed his Jindan at the age of eighteen, a truly unparalleled talent."</p><p></p><p>"His innate spiritual treasure, the Heavenly Scenery Treasure Gourd, can capture the scenery of the mortal world within it. It can generate an almost identical copy inside the gourd, only slightly reduced in size."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in an instant, one can shuttle between the locations recorded in the Heavenly Scenery Treasure Gourd. If I didn't have the divine ability to restrain insects, even at the Huashen realm, I might not have been able to capture him so easily."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense looked into the Heavenly Scenery Treasure Gourd, and saw various landscapes with unique features scattered among the misty clouds.</p><p></p><p>Some of them were quite familiar to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Ten Veins of Taihua, the Thousand Waters of Tianling, and so on.</p><p></p><p>And the Tianlao Mountains that Shang Tianci had just captured into the Heavenly Scenery Treasure Gourd were also among them!</p><p></p><p>"Just entered the Jindan stage, and dared to venture alone into the extremely chaotic Jiushan State. Truly a newborn calf that does not fear the tiger."</p><p></p><p>"But if it weren't for me, the things that are about to happen next, he would have indeed taken the protagonist's script."</p><p></p><p>"During his travels, he happened to encounter the surprise attack of the Five Elders Society."</p><p></p><p>"With the inside and outside cooperation of the Lingyuan Sect, the Five Elders Society had long ago dispatched heavy troops to blockade the Jiushan State, allowing entry but not exit. They even blocked communications, so news could not be transmitted out through ordinary means. They just sought to delay as much as possible. In military matters, speed is of the essence. Before the Myriad Immortals Alliance could react, they would seize the Jiushan State in one fell swoop."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that they had bad luck and happened to encounter an anomaly like Shang Tianci. He was actually able to instantly teleport in the Jiushan State where spatial transmission was impossible, relying on his innate spiritual treasure."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts turned, recalling the official statement of the Myriad Immortals Alliance regarding this matter in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"But there is no guarantee that this is the whole truth of the matter."</p><p></p><p>"Further observation is needed."</p><p></p><p>"As for this kid..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his head and glanced at the immobilized Shang Tianci.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang gestured, and with a slap, knocked him unconscious. Then Li Fan flicked his finger, and a red light containing his own essence blood instantly flew into the other party's body.</p><p></p><p>It was the [Blood Relation Crossing] technique that could influence the mind and spirit.</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Realms Alliance can't just have me alone. Such a genius is most suitable to serve as the face."</p><p></p><p>Standing on Tianyang, Li Fan flew to the top of the Heavenly Prison Mountain.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, he set up a formation around himself to conceal his aura, and then gazed into the distance, waiting for the arrival of the Five Elders Council's army.</p><p></p><p>"They should be here soon."</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Li Fan began to study the newly acquired Heavenly Scenery Gourd.</p><p></p><p>Although this was Shang Tianci's companion item, for some reason, he himself did not use it to establish his Dao foundation.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he treated it like an ordinary treasure and simply carried it with him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense drilled into the green gourd, trying to connect with the landscapes inside. He wanted to see if he could freely traverse these scenes like Shang Tianci.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they completely ignored Li Fan and showed no response whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>"Can't be refined with spiritual energy. Even Huan Zhen is unable to sense and absorb it..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be truly exclusive to that fellow."</p><p></p><p>After trying unsuccessfully, Li Fan shook his head slightly and gave up.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't even use such a treasure to establish his foundation. Then what could his foundation-establishing item be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came to the unconscious Shang Tianci and carefully examined him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" After a moment, a hint of surprise flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of Shang Tianci's golden core, a purple-gold gourd pattern was engraved.</p><p></p><p>Its appearance was identical to the Heavenly Scenery Gourd, but its aura was even more profound and magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>However, he had no intention of directly seizing it.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, keeping Shang Tianci alive still had some use.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, this companion item was likely the same as the Heavenly Scenery Gourd. It was probably exclusive to the individual and couldn't be taken by force.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps a Dao incarnation like Mr. Bai could borrow it without any hindrance. As for me, I can't."</p><p></p><p>The treasure was right before his eyes, but he had no fortune to enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>Yet Li Fan didn't feel the slightest urgency.</p><p></p><p>He just narrowed his eyes and silently sensed the progress of the blood bond within Shang Tianci.</p><p></p><p>When Shang Tianci slowly regained consciousness, the fear in his heart towards the mysterious person who had captured him had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was replaced by a sense of closeness and trust.</p><p></p><p>"Young lad, what do you think of the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" Li Fan asked in a strange voice.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Shang Tianci was slightly stunned, not expecting the other party to suddenly ask such an abrupt question out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>He subconsciously replied, "The Myriad Immortals Alliance is great! Everyone has the opportunity to cultivate, and they don't have to worry about their lives..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, interrupting him, "Great? Can't you see how many cultivators have toiled for half their lives just for a single cultivation technique? If it were a genuine technique, it would be fine."</p><p></p><p>"But they even split the techniques and sell them separately. One for foundation establishment, and when you reach the golden core stage, you have to exchange for another. It's the same for nascent soul and divine transformation!"</p><p></p><p>"They treat us cultivators like cattle and horses!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Shang Tianci was about to retort, Li Fan pointed a finger at his forehead.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless scenes of low-level cultivators struggling desperately for a bit of contribution points appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, as a heaven-defying genius, Shang Tianci had no idea how difficult it was for cultivators with average aptitude to progress step by step from mortals to Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core...</p><p></p><p>Many of them were even stuck at realms he could easily break through in their entire lives, unable to advance an inch.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Shang Tianci truly understood these things, and his mind was severely impacted and shaken beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to bewitch him with his words.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, a change began to occur in Shang Tianci's eyes.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 628</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan looked at the hints that emerged from the Tianxuan Mirror with an expressionless face and chose to confirm.</p><p></p><p>The physique of the Ten Thousand Immortal League's inner cultivators would gradually unlock certain privileges with the increase in merit level.</p><p></p><p>This is reflected in various aspects of cultivation life, such as reducing the contribution points consumed when using teleportation arrays, increasing the number of times the Tianxuan Mirror can retrieve items based on market price, and so on.</p><p></p><p>However, some important privileges would only appear once a specific level is reached.</p><p></p><p>For example, the fifth derivative privilege: one free long-distance teleportation application per year.</p><p></p><p>The tenth derivative privilege: when searching for information in the Tianxuan Mirror, one can preview information and item details that would normally require a cultivation level higher by one realm to see.</p><p></p><p>The fifteenth derivative privilege: once every ten years, one can randomly contact a cultivator with a cultivation level one realm higher. But there is no obligation between both parties. Whether they can maintain this relationship depends on their own abilities.</p><p></p><p>And the twentieth derivative privilege allows for deducing divine techniques and combat methods in a seated meditation, by consuming contribution points.</p><p></p><p>However, this deducing process is quite tricky.</p><p></p><p>Not only does it consume a significant amount of contribution points, but success is also not guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>It has been complained by many inner system cultivators as a tool specifically designed to recover contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Upon Li Fan's confirmation, a little figure identical to his current appearance instantly became active. </p><p></p><p>Serious-faced, he gazed into the void ahead. His left palm outstretched, right hand wielding a sword.</p><p></p><p>A faint light burst near the little figure, distorting the space.</p><p></p><p>As expected, a prompt from the Tianxuan Mirror came: "This deducing attempt failed. Would you like to spend fifteen thousand contribution points to continue?"</p><p></p><p>"If you continue, there is a two percent chance of success."</p><p></p><p>"If you give up, the deducing data will reset, and you will have to start over next time."</p><p></p><p>"You can also choose to complete the details of the divine technique data to increase the success rate."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chose to continue directly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the little figure moved again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the scene of the Cloud Sword and Sky Palm technique seemed more lively than before.</p><p></p><p>However, the probability of success was still too small, and shortly after, another failure prompt appeared.</p><p></p><p>For the third deducing attempt, the required contribution points escalated to twenty thousand. Yet, the success rate only increased to three percent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained unchanged and chose to continue deducing.</p><p></p><p>The third attempt also failed.</p><p></p><p>Following it, were the fourth, fifth attempts...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's little figure displayed the Cloud Sword and Sky Palm techniques more masterfully, he slowly understood the process behind deducing divine techniques with the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it was to create a probable divine technique goal for the Tianxuan Mirror, attaching the effects and powers that the divine technique possesses.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, based on the results, the Tianxuan Mirror would deduce the various conditions required to master the divine technique and summarize them into experience, conveying them to the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It can be likened to ancient times in the cultivation world, where powerful beings could observe and learn others' divine techniques during battles, merely with a glance.</p><p></p><p>The more the deducing attempts, the more contribution points were consumed.</p><p></p><p>When the cost for deducing rose to one hundred thousand per attempt, the success rate had only barely increased to eighteen percent.</p><p></p><p>"This deducing of techniques is not something an average person can afford to play with."</p><p></p><p>"The deducing ability of the Tianxuan Mirror itself surely wouldn't be so unbearable, it's just designed to intentionally consume contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"At this point, after investing so much, the cost of giving up would be too high. Those willing to do so are undoubtedly few. It's like being stuck in a quagmire, unable to extricate oneself." Li Fan understood inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he uploaded his insights on the Cloud Sword and Sky Palm divine techniques and supplemented the data.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the success rate surged from 18% to 78%, while the cost of deducing remained the same.</p><p></p><p>"It appears that deducing based on theory is much stronger than fabrication out of thin air."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself and proceeded with the deduction once more.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a colorful divine light descended from the sky onto Li Fan's little figure.</p><p></p><p>As if comprehending something, the figure displayed an expression akin to understanding everything and issued a long whistle. With a single palm strike, the space ahead distorted instantaneously, creating upheaval. Several blue sword lights flashed through the air, tearing through the fabric of space.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a golden light appeared before Li Fan, accompanied by stirring music in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on successfully comprehending the divine technique: [Sky-breaking Heart Sword]."</p><p></p><p>"Divine technique explanation: Unrestricted in form and techniques, whether it's a punch or palm strike, a sword or blade. All move with the heart, possessing the might to shatter the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"Would you like to spend fifty thousand contribution points to infuse the divine technique?"</p><p></p><p>"You can also continue deducing [Sky-breaking Heart Sword] to refine it, aiming for perfection and advancement. Remember, there are no limits to the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"For the first advanced deduction, enjoy a fifty percent discount, requiring only fifty thousand contribution points. The success rate is eight percent."</p><p></p><p>Initially thinking that he had accumulated enough contribution points, it seemed that they might not be enough for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't outplay you after all! Tianxuan Mirror!</p><p></p><p>With a try-it-and-see attitude, Li Fan proceeded with the advanced deduction.</p><p></p><p>The first discounted deduction required fifty thousand contribution points with an eight percent success rate, ending in failure.</p><p></p><p>The second attempt's cost soared to one hundred and fifty thousand contribution points, fortunately with a ten percent success rate. Yet, it still failed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Despite the huge amount of contribution points on Li Fan, they were dissipating rapidly, causing him some discomfort.</p><p></p><p>In these techniques' deductions, contribution points seemed to lose their original value, merely serving as fuel to propel the advancement of the techniques.</p><p></p><p>If the success rate increased steadily every time, Li Fan estimated that he could deduce the advanced divine technique eventually.</p><p></p><p>But the Tianxuan Mirror's behavior surpassed Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching a fifty percent success rate and facing another failure, Li Fan noticed that the rate didn't increase anymore!</p><p></p><p>In its place, another progress bar appeared before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Specialized directional deduction."</p><p></p><p>"When the probability of success in advancing a divine technique increases and then fails, the progress of specialized directional deduction can be increased. When the progress is complete, one can specify the direction in which the deduced divine technique should improve."</p><p></p><p>"Such as killing power, cunning degree, priority level, etc."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The success rate wasn't steadily increasing, but the required contribution points for each deduction were indeed continuously rising.</p><p></p><p>In this manner, to deduce the advanced version of [Sky-breaking Heart Sword], the contribution points consumed in the deducing process would be astronomical.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, from now on, this is our new home," Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"All the facilities on the island remain the same, including the transmission array and the Heavenly Mystery Mirror. Fellow cultivators are welcome to explore on your own; I won't repeat the details," Li Fan said loudly.</p><p></p><p>Just as some cultivators were eager to leave, Li Fan looked at them and suddenly spoke, "The following friends, please follow me to the Political Hall."</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenghao, Gao Yuan, Zhou Qing'ang..."</p><p></p><p>"Fang Weihou..."</p><p></p><p>"Jia Jun..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Like calling a roll call, Li Fan mentioned the names of hundreds of people in one breath.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who were about to leave stopped in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>As they suddenly realized, they listened attentively with nervous expressions.</p><p></p><p>Those called out by name were naturally overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Those who weren't called dare not show any difference, only gazing at the others with envy.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had attached themselves to Li Fan, who was publicly a secret agent but, in fact, the acting island master, their future was indeed promising.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan finished speaking, he led about a hundred people towards the Political Hall in the city's center, leaving the cultivators' consciousness silently interacting.</p><p></p><p>"Some are so confident; fortunes are unpredictable. Don't be so impressed by Li Fan's current power, everything will be in vain when the island master, Hongxi, returns. Join the new 69 book club."</p><p></p><p>"It may not be the case; the secret envoy clearly has a strong background. Otherwise, how could he have the opportunity to be appointed as the ruler of a province so easily?"</p><p></p><p>"That goes without saying; can ordinary cultivators trample on Nascent Soul puppets? Even if Island Masters Hongxi and Ziyun return, they will treat the secret envoy respectfully. Zhu Daoist friend, I advise you to assess the situation and not provoke the secret envoy."</p><p></p><p>"Humph! You all fear him, but I, Zhu Yongshou, do not fear Li Fan!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Conversations like these took place in various parts of the Floating Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>No one can make everyone happy in the world. Li Fan was no exception.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't care about the discussions among the Floating Cloud Sea cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he appointed various vacancies to everyone, then reported the personnel appointments to the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance for approval.</p><p></p><p>After a busy day, Li Fan finally had some leisure time.</p><p></p><p>It was all thanks to the help of capable assistants like He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan; otherwise, dealing with city affairs would not have been so easy.</p><p></p><p>Seated in the Political Hall, in a room specially prepared for him, Li Fan closed his eyes slightly, feeling the various feedback from his dantian with differing strengths.</p><p></p><p>A slightly surprised expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect some of my subordinates to break through so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense; most of them were originally poor cultivators from the Floating Cloud Sea. Now, after following me and working hard for half a year, they have finally achieved their goals and ascended rapidly. They have not only entered the Immortal Alliance system but have also received high positions. Join the new 69 club."</p><p></p><p>"It's normal for their cultivation to break through under such emotional upheaval."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, one man's success is a credit to the whole family. They all rely on my support and benefit from me."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, they naturally receive feedback cultivation like the 'Sitting Mountain Method.'"</p><p></p><p>"And the intensity of this feedback..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully sensed, becoming more and more pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"While it may not compare to the grace of passing down techniques, it is like being recreated."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this path of cultivation is safer, more discreet than passing down techniques, and under the protection of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance system, it's legitimate."</p><p></p><p>"I am just a secret envoy who appeared out of nowhere, without a solid foundation."</p><p></p><p>"If a true ruler of a province had disciples and officials throughout the Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"The benefits are unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes lit up as he seemed to have found a new path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I hold the position of secret envoy firmly, I can rely on these hundreds of trusted followers to rapidly advance in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I can now look forward to forming my Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Grand Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his original goal, Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Tianlingzhou Battle that initially led to the relocation of the Five Elements Grand Dao was likely not going to happen again.</p><p></p><p>But if there was no major conflict between the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Society, during peacetime, it would be too challenging for Li Fan to take advantage.</p><p></p><p>"Train soldiers for a thousand days to use them for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to send you out again, Daoist Zhou Qing'ang."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan smiled, focusing his attention on Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou Qing'ang was surrounded by a crowd of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was apparent to discerning eyes that Zhou Qing'ang, who had a deep bond with He Zhenghao and was highly valued by Li Fan, was destined for great things.</p><p></p><p>["Recommendation, switch sources app is really useful for following books. Download it here and try it out."]</p><p></p><p>If one didn't seize the opportunity to establish good relationships, when would be the right time?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, cultivators came in succession to pay their respects and seek Zhou Qing'ang's attention.</p><p></p><p>After much effort, Zhou Qing'ang finally freed himself from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Late at night, he quietly slipped out of the Floating Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Heading straight to the meeting place.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>"Political Hall, Inspector's Office. Boss, how's this position?"</p><p></p><p>"The authority is quite significant; patrolling all directions within the domain, any illegal activities can be dealt with strictly."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to just guarding a small island, it exudes much more authority!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang said proudly to the stone-faced person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, various confidential information previously inaccessible can now be easily obtained. Truly infiltrating the enemy's camp!"</p><p></p><p>"Boss?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Boss, why aren't you saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang, looking puzzled at the motionless figure in front of him, asked strangely.</p><p></p><p>The silence remained, as dead as ever.</p><p></p><p>A sense of unease suddenly emerged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the stone face finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>The voice was cold, filled with a murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"You are not Zhou Qing'ang. Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>However, he still pretended to be somewhat surprised, "Boss, what are you talking about? Look at my face; this is one hundred percent genuine!"</p><p></p><p>"How could you doubt me? I have made significant contributions to the organization!"</p><p></p><p>"The top-secret information from the Immortal Alliance's entrance exam, the information on uniting the Profound Yellow Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang vented his grievances by detailing his achievements.</p><p></p><p>"So, you've been impersonating Zhou Qing'ang all along..."</p><p></p><p>"Impressive!"</p><p></p><p>The stone face was not deceived by Li Fan's clever words, the voice as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>Previously eager 'Zhou Qing'ang' suddenly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>As if it were another person, he asked calmly, "Oh? Where did I reveal a flaw?"</p><p></p><p>"Humph!"</p><p></p><p>The stone-faced individual sneered, "Your disguise is seamless. However, for all your calculations, you have overlooked something."</p><p></p><p>"When Zhou Qing'ang was initially assigned the mission to infiltrate the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, he had an ultimate mission."</p><p></p><p>"As soon as he actually secured a crucial position within the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, he was to immediately discard his original undercover identity."</p><p></p><p>"To go into complete concealment, not to contact us again, to avoid discovery, lest all efforts go to waste."</p><p></p><p>"Until the organization activates when crucial..."</p><p></p><p>"So, you, who have just been employed, rushed to contact me, it definitely is not the real Zhou Qing'ang."</p>

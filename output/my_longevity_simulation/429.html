            <p>After pondering for a moment, the person spoke cautiously, "This matter still needs to be carefully considered. Let's meet again in seven days."</p><p></p><p>After giving a coordinate location to Li Fan, the person's face disappeared quietly.</p><p></p><p>However, a moment later, he reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Right, no matter what, He Zhenghao, this person, has a high value of attraction."</p><p></p><p>"You must form a good relationship with him. Even if this exam is fake, based on his relationship with the Tianyu State's Heng family alone, it's worth us investing heavily."</p><p></p><p>"I heard from your report before that this person is most fascinated by formations?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can start from this aspect."</p><p></p><p>After giving a few more instructions, the person finally left.</p><p></p><p>After emitting a yellow light, the smooth broken stone began to crack inch by inch and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan went forward to inspect it and found that it had been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Standing still for a moment, Li Fan still sported the appearance of Zhou Qing'ang and quietly flew away.</p><p></p><p>After flying far enough and confirming that no one was following or monitoring him along the way, Li Fan transformed back into the middle-aged man he originally looked like in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"The bait has been set, now it depends on whether the Five Elders will take the hook."</p><p></p><p>As he flew, Li Fan recollected memories related to the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of No Worries..."</p><p></p><p>"I suppose the one controlling this realm is the Longevity Tianzun who can make people forget disasters."</p><p></p><p>"But what is the true country about. The Realm of No Worries Tianzun's rebellion against the principles of heaven and earth should cover almost the entire Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"However, 'Cannot Lie' obviously does not affect other regions, only in specific areas."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Shijie's 'Unity of All' seems to be the same."</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of No Worries and the Transmitter of Laws should be at a higher level than these two..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Five Elders have five Longevity Tianzuns guarding them, and they still fear the Transmitter of Laws."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they make a move to test, they are careful."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>This connection with the Five Elders was not a spur of the moment decision for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Apart from maximizing profits using the entrance exam questions of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the future, to prevent the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation from purifying towards the 'Xuan Network,' balancing with the Five Elders is also crucial.</p><p></p><p>Having a doppelganger acting as a spy for the Five Elders will make things much easier in the future.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan did not return to Wuxian Island but flew towards the southeastern sea area of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The remote small island located in the center of the sea area was Li Fan's destination for this trip.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Li Fan saw from afar the compound courtyard on the island.</p><p></p><p>In the yard, five cultivators were sitting cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>An old man with a red face and white hair, looking very spirited, was pacing around the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He continued to speak some profound and obscure words that were difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator at the late Foundation Building stage was the 'Foundation Building Master' that Li Fan had met years ago.</p><p></p><p>Including Li Chenfeng who stood guard, and the man surnamed Xiao who worked as an actor.</p><p></p><p>In fact, these three people were all lawbreakers who had sneaked into the small world since childhood.</p><p></p><p>Their hometown, a small world called the 'Empire,' was trying to break free from the constraints of the Xuanhuang Realm by using the power of a group of whales composed of ten thousand split boundary whales.</p><p></p><p>And they were tasked with stealing the cultivation texts from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In order to set up a new cultivation tradition once the 'Empire' breaks free from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Using ordinary methods, it was like a foolish dream for a Foundation Building cultivator to accumulate enough contribution points to exchange for joint path techniques.</p><p></p><p>So they took risks, accumulating wealth through these fraudulent methods.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came to find them not because of the minimal contribution points they possessed but to leverage the Foundation Building Master's reputation among the numerous Qi Refining cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly and changed his appearance again to appear as a stranger.</p><p></p><p>Boldly landing in front of the Foundation Building Master.</p><p></p><p>"Calm your mind, focus attentively..." The Foundation Building Master was shaking his head and reciting these words like chanting scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan descending from the sky, his words suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"A Gold Core cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, various thoughts surged in the Foundation Building Master's mind.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan just waved his hand gently, knocking out the other four Qi Refining cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Only the actor surnamed Xiao and the Foundation Building Master remained, and then he said calmly, "It's you, who sneaked into this world from a small world since childhood?"</p><p></p><p>This sentence made the faces of the two men change drastically.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Building Master was about to explain but felt as if he was tightly entangled by a net all of a sudden.</p><p></p><p>At the same time he lost control of his body, he couldn't even speak.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even commit suicide.</p><p></p><p>A hint of despair flashed in the Foundation Building Master's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was about to speak but suddenly felt something rapidly approaching behind him.</p><p></p><p>He teleported his body, dodging in place.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, Li Fan's gaze slightly condensed.</p><p></p><p>He saw a figure about two zhang (around 6 meters) tall, and upon seeing the appearance, it turned out to be the Qi Refining cultivator Li Chenfeng.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he had undergone a huge transformation in his appearance.</p><p></p><p>His body had expanded several times, and horn-like carapaces grew on the surface of his body.</p><p></p><p>Two pairs of transparent wings flapped rapidly behind him, keeping him suspended in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The parts of his hands were replaced by a pair of sharp dark-gold giant claws.</p><p></p><p>His face also seemed to have a mask covered with the appearance of a monstrous beast, with only his eyes exposed.</p><p></p><p>The whole person seemed to be a combination of a human and a beast. Under the sunlight, it exuded a strange beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>The changes in front of him were beyond Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Staring at Li Chenfeng, he found that his transformed body seemed to be capable of shielding to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>The two zhang giant, when sensed with divine sense, appeared to be the size of a fly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, spare us. Pretend you didn't see anything, can you?" Li Chenfeng's mixed voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>However, before Li Fan could respond, his massive body disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>With his giant claws raised high, he was about to tear Li Fan's head apart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that his Insect Sealing technique had lost its effect on Li Chenfeng.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time since he learned it from his Insect Master brother.</p><p></p><p>Although surprised, he quickly set up several formations by his side in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he faced the attack head-on.</p><p></p><p>The cyan giant palm collided with the dark-gold giant claw, erupting with a thunderous noise.</p><p></p><p>Using this opportunity, Li Fan distanced himself while illuminating the world with a blue water sword.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Cluster Sword pierced through Li Chenfeng's body, splitting him in two.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood sprayed, but Li Fan did not relax his vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Because the severed body of Li Chenfeng quickly healed the wound in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, his two halves came at Li Fan from left and right.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the formations set up by Li Fan earlier quietly activated.</p><p></p><p>After flying forward for a while, Li Chenfeng seemed to be frozen in mid-air, unable to move another step forward!</p>

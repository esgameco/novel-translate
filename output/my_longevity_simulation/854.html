        <h1>Chapter 854</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong, with his Seven-Colored Divine Light in one hand, could be considered invincible at the same realm. He could even exhaust Senior Brother Zhang, who was at the same realm, to death.</p><p></p><p>The "Profound Art of Life and Death" he cultivated was also an extremely mysterious and unique technique. It was said that when cultivated to the deepest level, one could reach a wondrous state where life and death coexisted, achieving a different kind of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating this technique could awaken and infinitely amplify a cultivator's instinctive fear of life and death.</p><p></p><p>It could make a cultivator like Zhong Shentong, who was naturally lazy, directly change into a different person in the face of the threat of death, with his motivation maximized.</p><p></p><p>"According to the original historical trajectory, Zhong Shentong would not break through until his end was approaching."</p><p></p><p>"But now he has laid his foundation ahead of time..."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>The most severe period of the anomalous mortal miasma had passed, and it could be determined that Zhong Shentong was not forced to break through because of this reason.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly became interested.</p><p></p><p>However, because his true body was still in the process of devouring the Five Elements Great Hole Heaven, he could not break free.</p><p></p><p>This time, observing Zhong Shentong would require his clone Ji Shaoli to take action.</p><p></p><p>"He has just broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage and hasn't had time to comprehend the Seven-Colored Divine Light. With my Golden Core stage cultivation, dealing with him..."</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be a big problem." Ji Shaoli secretly pondered.</p><p></p><p>However, to be on the safe side, the clone still made adequate preparations.</p><p></p><p>In the stage from Foundation Establishment to Nascent Soul, as long as one had enough contribution points to arm oneself, it was enough to ignore the gap in cultivation and crush the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that his realm was now a layer higher than the opponent's. So Ji Shaoli was not overly worried.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence, Ji Shaoli came to a desolate small mountain in the northwest border of Yongyun Prefecture through the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>There was a slightly dilapidated small temple on the mountain, where Zhong Shentong was living in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, this Zhong Shentong was just an ordinary old man. Although he obtained half a volume of the "Profound Art of Life and Death" by chance, he had been cultivating without success. It was not until his lifespan was about to end that he broke through the shackles under immense pressure and successfully stepped into the Qi Refining stage."</p><p></p><p>"After the Qi Refining stage, he again lacked motivation to cultivate. He only spent the rest of his life in this small temple."</p><p></p><p>"He should have waited until his end was approaching to break through again. But now it's ahead of schedule..."</p><p></p><p>"What is the strange object he used for his foundation establishment?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli did not reveal his own figure, but concealed his aura and spied from afar.</p><p></p><p>In the small temple, besides Zhong Shentong, there was also an eight- or nine-year-old little Taoist disciple.</p><p></p><p>What was excessive was that things like cleaning, making fire, and cooking in the temple could be directly solved with magic techniques.</p><p></p><p>But Zhong Shentong only let the little Taoist disciple do it personally.</p><p></p><p>This little Taoist disciple was very good-looking, with a pair of big eyes that seemed to be able to speak, shining brightly. But he was hardworking and did not complain, and was very efficient at his work. His skilled manner did not seem like a child at all.</p><p></p><p>While the little Taoist disciple handled everything in an orderly manner, Zhong Shentong just sat by a pond in the backyard of the small temple, fishing.</p><p></p><p>The little Taoist disciple called out a few times to no avail, and had to bring the prepared meal to Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's time to eat," the little Taoist disciple said in a childish voice.</p><p></p><p>The little Taoist disciple pouted and started eating by himself.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the little Taoist disciple was almost finished eating that Zhong Shentong's expression moved: "Hooked!"</p><p></p><p>He pulled the fishing rod vigorously, but what he caught was not a fish.</p><p></p><p>It was just a green ball of light.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong looked disappointed, but still reached into the green light ball and fumbled for a while.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he took out a rusty-looking circular plate magic tool from it.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong...</p><p></p><p>(Translation cut off at this point as the excerpt ends here)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After examining it for a while, he shook his head slightly and directly threw it to the young Taoist disciple.</p><p></p><p>The young disciple seemed to be accustomed to this and skillfully caught it: "Master, what is it this time?"</p><p></p><p>"A fire plate that can release bright flames. In the future, there will be no need to use talismans to start a fire," Zhong Shentong said lazily.</p><p></p><p>He put away the fishing rod and began to devour the food ravenously.</p><p></p><p>After establishing his foundation, there was no need to eat like a mortal anymore.</p><p></p><p>But Zhong Shentong seemed to be enjoying himself very much, eating with great gusto.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, he had swept the table clean of all the food and dishes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to sleep for a bit. Don't disturb me unless it's a matter of utmost importance," Zhong Shentong instructed as he got up, humming a little tune.</p><p></p><p>"I know, I know," the young disciple said, somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>After the snoring sounds started in the small temple and the young disciple had finished cleaning up all the kitchen waste, he returned to the front of the pond.</p><p></p><p>From somewhere, he took out a fishing rod and, imitating Zhong Shentong's earlier appearance, began to fish.</p><p></p><p>But after a long time, there was no movement at all.</p><p></p><p>The young disciple couldn't help but feel a little discouraged.</p><p></p><p>"Master said that only those with a sincere heart can fish treasures out of this pond. I've been trying for several years, but I haven't been able to fish anything out."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..." He stubbornly cast another line.</p><p></p><p>The result was the same; the tip of the fishing rod remained empty.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the young disciple resign himself and leave the pond, crestfallen.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." He stared at the pond water not far away, his expression unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>After setting up a layer of illusion around him, he began to carefully examine this small pond.</p><p></p><p>Under the observation of his spiritual sense, this was indeed the most ordinary pond water.</p><p></p><p>It was no more than one zhang deep and no more than three zhang long and wide.</p><p></p><p>The scenery inside the pond was also clear at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Except for some tiny floating objects, there were no fish living in it at all.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't just witnessed with his own eyes Zhong Shentong fishing out a green ball of light from this pond.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli would have almost been deceived.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't see anything mysterious, Ji Shaoli simply flew into the pond himself, trying to find out where the mystery of this pond lay.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>After entering the water, it was still no different from ordinary pond water!</p><p></p><p>After returning to the shore, Ji Shaoli pondered for a moment, took out materials from his storage ring, and made a fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>Imitating the master and disciple's earlier appearance, he began to fish.</p><p></p><p>Sitting by the water, he held his breath and concentrated.</p><p></p><p>He cast a line!</p><p></p><p>But there was still no change.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli sat for a long time and vaguely felt that something was wrong, so he put away his fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>"This pond water clearly has some mystery to it. But it can only be seen and not perceived..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this pond only recognizes Zhong Shentong alone?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Ji Shaoli denied this guess.</p><p></p><p>If that were really the case, the young disciple wouldn't have tried.</p><p></p><p>"Those with a sincere heart..."</p><p></p><p>"How can one be considered to have a sincere heart?"</p><p></p><p>Fishing was not unfamiliar to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was before he crossed over, or during his years as the Grand Preceptor in Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he was troubled, he would go fishing for a while.</p><p></p><p>With the belief that he would never return empty-handed, he would only return happily after the fish had taken the bait.</p><p></p><p>However, since he began cultivating, he had never engaged in this relaxing activity again.</p><p></p><p>"Sincere heart..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli seemed to have realized something.</p><p></p><p>This time, he sat by the pond again.</p><p></p><p>No longer thinking about unraveling the secret of the pond.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to simply catch a fish!</p><p></p><p>"Hoo!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's expression was solemn as he vigorously cast the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the scene before his eyes changed with a bang!</p>

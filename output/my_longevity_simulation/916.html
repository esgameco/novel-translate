        <h1>Chapter 916</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Apart from the insights into the way of the sword, Black Sword almost automatically filtered out everything else that Li Qing transmitted. It did not accept a shred of it.</p><p></p><p>However, this was also within Li Qing's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The Wooden Sword of Heavenly Wonder is a pure creation of the laws of the sword. How could it easily accommodate other laws?</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was not discouraged and tried various methods.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed by.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sword became more and more condensed, and the aura contained within it grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Black Sword, which had always had a strong rejection of foreign objects, suddenly absorbed a bit more of the insights that Li Qing had been feeding it!</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes lit up, and after a quick investigation, he immediately locked onto the existence that seemed to be able to merge with the Black Sword!</p><p></p><p>It was none other than "clumsiness"!</p><p></p><p>"Conceal the sharpness and maintain clumsiness, to restrain the advantages of the sword. By not attacking, one can win all battles..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Qing's mind exploded with an endless stream of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Some scenes seemed familiar, but he did not know where they came from.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing did not care, but used this almost gushing inspiration to continuously infuse the Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>And the Black Sword, which had been very aloof and uninterested in anything other than the way of the sword, was now unusually cooperative.</p><p></p><p>It even seemed to be eager, actively accepting Li Qing's infusion.</p><p></p><p>As the way of clumsiness slowly merged in, the Black Sword, which had become somewhat sharp and exposed as it gradually took its final form, now slowly lost its sharpness again.</p><p></p><p>It once again became dark, inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing knew that this was a symbol of the Black Sword breaking through the shackles of ordinary swordsmanship and taking another step forward.</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Mausoleum, the thousands of legacy swords did not notice anything.</p><p></p><p>Only the Wooden Sword of Heavenly Wonder in the center emitted an imperceptible sword hum.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be expressing its own joy.</p><p></p><p>Because of this sword hum, the myriad swords bowed their heads again. Only the Black Sword beside Li Fan seemed to bend in the same way.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it did not move at all.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing knew that the complete submission of this Black Sword of Heavenly Wonder would not be too far off.</p><p></p><p>With that, he closed his eyes and infused the last essence of his insights on the way of the sword into the Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>After the Wooden Sword of Heavenly Wonder's sword hum, the Sword Mausoleum fell into an even more deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the thousands of legacy swords were each whispering in low voices, enticing Li Qing to give up subduing the Black Sword and take away other legacy swords instead.</p><p></p><p>The scenes of the swords' world-destroying and dazzlingly colorful powers also kept appearing in Li Qing's mind, trying to disrupt his determination.</p><p></p><p>But who was Li Qing? How could he be so easily bewitched?</p><p></p><p>He knew that this might be a small trick used by the Wooden Sword of Heavenly Wonder behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this might be that it was not at ease with him taking away the Black Sword, and thus set up a final test.</p><p></p><p>It was also possible that it was spontaneously obstructing him out of reluctance to lose the Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, these little tricks ultimately could not affect Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the myriad illusions, Li Qing remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>His mind and the Black Sword became one, with nothing else in between.</p><p></p><p>And so, until three months later.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Qing suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he reached out his right hand and naturally grasped the hilt of the Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Then he gently pulled it out.</p><p></p><p>There was no earth-shattering sound of a divine object emerging.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, not a single unusual sound was made.</p><p></p><p>In the light breeze and thin clouds,</p><p></p><p>The black sword fell into Li Qing's hands.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of abandoned swords in the sword tomb seemed to be completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Even the wooden sword Tian Zhi Qi at the center showed no signs of opposition.</p><p></p><p>Silence was consent.</p><p></p><p>The dead silence in the sword tomb was no different from acknowledging Li Qing's success.</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing the wonder of heaven and earth to build the foundation of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing silently recited in his heart, and then the black sword in his hand instantly turned into a wisp of light and merged into his body.</p><p></p><p>It flew into his dantian and settled down.</p><p></p><p>As if ten thousand rivers were rushing towards the black sword.</p><p></p><p>Like a hundred rivers flowing east to the sea, under the surging spiritual power, the black sword gradually became ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Completely dissolving into Li Qing's dantian, it became the foundation of his Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Peering into the laws of heaven and earth to refine the golden core."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing chanted again in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The surging spiritual power in his body still did not stop, turbulently rushing towards the black sword foundation.</p><p></p><p>In the great vortex of spiritual power, the phantom of the black sword became more and more faint.</p><p></p><p>In the end, as it disappeared without a trace, it seemed to form an abyss, completely swallowing all the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A bright light burst out, like the brilliance at the beginning of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It completely illuminated Li Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>The light flashed, lasting for several breaths.</p><p></p><p>When this dazzling light finally faded, a golden core that was completely black and exuded an ancient and simple aura appeared in Li Qing's dantian.</p><p></p><p>If one looked carefully, one could vaguely see the patterns of thousands of sword shadows on the black golden core.</p><p></p><p>But it also seemed to be an illusion produced when facing the darkness. When looking closely again, it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The golden core was formed!</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, it only took a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>The clone Li Qing changed from a cultivator with only the empty shell of the Golden Core Perfection realm to a true golden core cultivator who had built his foundation and formed his golden core with the black sword Tian Zhi Qi.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing was not satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Swallowing the essence of heaven and earth to form the Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing continued to chant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators must rely on a grotto-heaven to form the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>But those who use Tian Zhi Qi to build their foundation do not need to.</p><p></p><p>Because Tian Zhi Qi itself is a part of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>With a thought in Li Qing's heart, the black golden core that had just formed exploded in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The misty spiritual energy inside it instantly spread throughout Li Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>And the countless black golden core fragments also flew to various parts of the body in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Although they seemed to be distributed without any rules, they actually contained profound mysteries!</p><p></p><p>The distribution of the golden core remnants vaguely resembled the original shape of the black sword!</p><p></p><p>Using these remnants as the foundation, Li Qing's spiritual energy, flesh, bones, and tendons...</p><p></p><p>Everything in his body began to be absorbed by these remnant foundations like melting liquid.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, Li Qing instantly became like a torn and twisted rag doll, becoming deformed and distorted.</p><p></p><p>Even as the flesh and bones were forcibly extracted, making horrible creaking sounds,</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the terrifying appearance of the squeezed flesh and blood,</p><p></p><p>All of this seemed sinister and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the surging pain, Li Qing did not care.</p><p></p><p>He only accelerated the process of the golden core remnants devouring his body.</p><p></p><p>After the remnants of Li Qing's flesh and blood in the air were completely devoured,</p><p></p><p>The scattered golden core remnants seemed to form something like human meridians.</p><p></p><p>Strands of dark red tissue connected, eerie and enchanting.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light emerged from the golden core remnants and flowed throughout the body in an instant.</p>

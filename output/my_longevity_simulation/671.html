        <h1>Chapter 671</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The world's destiny stored in the feathers of the mysterious bird flowed out wildly like water rushing out of a gate, causing a slight change in Li Fan's complexion.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying ability of the Han Yi stone statue to absorb destiny was beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary cultivator, they would probably be sucked dry of all their destiny in an instant. With a stroke of bad luck, they would die on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Even someone like Xu Ke, who possessed a great amount of destiny, would probably not be able to hold on for long.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Individual destinies indeed could not last long in this absorption domain. But the destiny of the entire world was a different story.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was a limit to how fast the stone statue could absorb destiny. Even though Li Fan was rapidly fleeing and was close to the side of the statue at that moment, the destiny lost every moment compared to the huge storage in the feathers of the mysterious bird was just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan estimated that even if he stopped here and let the statue absorb to its heart's content, it would probably take at least half a day for it to be completely drained!</p><p></p><p>"This is what they call, divine abilities not being able to match destiny!"</p><p></p><p>Once again invoking the world's destiny stored in the feathers of the mysterious bird, forming a protective field around himself, Li Fan ensured his absolute safety before quietly observing the Han Yi stone statue in front of him.</p><p></p><p>With a horrified expression on its face, eyes full of despair, it looked vividly real.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to freeze on him, stagnant at the moment when he received a fatal blow. 69</p><p></p><p>"Han Yi probably turned into this state after encountering the fisherman. Was it the fisherman's methods, or the effect of destiny?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not act rashly but observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Neither alive nor dead, not quite living nor quite dead..."</p><p></p><p>"Weird!"</p><p></p><p>Having gained some rough understanding of the "Book of Destiny" through the Cloud Water Dream Technique before, Li Fan realized that it did not seem to involve such bizarre changes.</p><p></p><p>If one had to mention something similar, it should be a divine ability called the "End the Cycle of Destiny and Return to the Pivot."</p><p></p><p>When faced with a life-threatening situation, one could sever their own destiny. By cutting off all connections with the world, one would enter a state of emptiness and extinction beyond the worldly realm.</p><p></p><p>In this state, although one's physical body and thoughts were completely stagnant, it was akin to entering a void, detached from the world, undetectable by others.</p><p></p><p>The state of extinction would last for a few months to several years until the external crisis had completely passed, only then slowly returning to normal.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a method with extremely strong side effects but also excellent life-saving capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it was the combination of the fisherman's attack and the 'End the Cycle of Destiny and Return to the Pivot' that led to the birth of this stone statue."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a long time, Li Fan seemed to have some insight.</p><p></p><p>"Although Han Yi used this life-saving divine ability, the gap between him and the fisherman was just too significant. Before he could enter the state of extinction, he was hit by the fisherman's move. Unable to enter the state of extinction, he ended up in the current statue-like appearance."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called end of the cycle is to return one's destiny to the heavens, to abandon it. But now, it has turned into taking destiny from the outside..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this because of the fisherman's attack..."</p><p></p><p>His thoughts spun in his mind, and Li Fan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Li Fan snapped out of his contemplation, looked at Han Yi, and his eyes grew cold.</p><p></p><p>"If it were just the state of extinction, sooner or later he would wake up. But with the fisherman's intervention, in your current state, you will never be able to return to normal again."</p><p></p><p>"Better to die than to live this way. Let me free you."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Li Fan pointed into the air and launched the Purple Firmament Soul-Viewing Technique on Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Han Yi's thoughts were in absolute stillness. Therefore, Li Fan faced no hindrances as he roamed freely within Han Yi's mind. Every secret, even the darkest aspects of Han Yi's heart, were laid bare before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>One could say that at that moment, Li Fan even understood Han Yi better than Han Yi himself.</p><p></p><p>After seizing all of Han Yi's thoughts from his mind, Li Fan flicked his finger, and a black sword light shot out.</p><p></p><p>It pierced through the chest of the statue.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the statue turned into countless tiny particles and dissipated into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, the absorption domain surrounding the statue also vanished instantly.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, instead of the omen of a cultivator falling, an invisible storm emerged in place. The destiny that had been absorbed by Han Yi during that time returned to the heavens and earth following his disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan would not miss this rare opportunity. He used the feathers of the mysterious bird to swallow up all the floating unclaimed destiny before quietly escaping before anyone noticed the abnormalities here.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the Valley of Longevity without disturbing the busy Liu San and others.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan entered the main sect's secluded cultivation chamber and placed the brown jade bottle containing Xu Ke's essence blood along with the materials for creating a clone in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to start, a sense of unease suddenly arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I am currently in the early stage of Nascent Soul Realm, so if I create a clone, its cultivation realm will be limited to the completion of the Golden Elixir Realm. If I want to cultivate Han Yi's 'Book of Destiny' through the clone, perhaps it would be better to first create the clone and let it cultivate and break through on its own..."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe the bottleneck of the adversity of heaven is stronger than the main body, and it might just waste time unnecessarily. It might be best for the main body to first cultivate until the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul Realm. This way, the progress will be twice as effective."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered and temporarily put away the materials, heading to the sky of the Animal Race Sky.</p><p></p><p>"Using the Five Elements Cave Heaven to achieve the Nascent Soul Realm, if I want to break through quickly, it's best to comprehend the principles of the Five Elements deeply."</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Realm, I might need to search diligently. But in the Animal Race Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The operation of heaven and earth, the circulation of the Five Elements, all lie in the sway of my thoughts!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Small World is a level lower and needs to learn from the past mistakes of Xiao Hei, not to get too entangled with the situation. However, to assist my rapid cultivation to the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul Realm, it is enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and in a flash, it seemed like an inverted funnel appeared in the sky. The power of the Five Elements that sustained the Animal Race Realm's operation was slowly absorbed and entered inside it. The collisions of the Five Elements produced loud rumbling noises, causing the sky to become colorful and magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Liu San and Fang Zaiji looked up and discreetly watched Li Fan standing in the clouds. They nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master's cultivation is truly extraordinary. It somewhat resembles the demeanor of our former master!" Liu San expressed relief.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, compared to you, Liu Ruchen, he's still not as good!" Fang Zaiji, on the other hand, did not give Liu San any face and retorted.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's expression stiffened, but contrary to his usual behavior, he did not retort.</p><p></p><p>"New things surpass the old, it's a good thing. Otherwise, wouldn't our Yao Wang Sect be repeating its mistakes?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing!" Liu San repeated.</p><p></p><p>They instructed the disciples not to disturb Li Fan's cultivation, and together they set up protective restrictions around Li Fan before finally relaxing.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Li Fan immersed himself in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two years had passed.</p><p></p>

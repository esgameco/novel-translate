        <h1>Chapter 478</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Indeed, according to the rules, any cultivator belonging to the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance who can kill a member of the Five Elders can apply to the Performance Hall for a certain reward.</p><p></p><p>To exterminate four opposing Nascent Soul cultivators, no matter in which state, can be considered a great achievement.</p><p></p><p>But the gentleman in front of us was too ruthless, not even leaving a trace of the four Five Elders cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the valuable body parts, remnants, and souls.</p><p></p><p>Although the military achievements are dazzling, their actual significance is not that great.</p><p></p><p>Not giving rewards would tarnish their reputation.</p><p></p><p>While giving rewards, the Performance Hall of the Cong Yun Sea is not rich in funds every year.</p><p></p><p>Letting Li Fan take a large sum like this, how would the brothers survive the rest of the year?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Master Li Fan doesn't seem to lack in contribution at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Performance Hall bleeds heavily, it may not satisfy his appetite.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, this person is now famous, and forcing him to give up the rewards "voluntarily" will not work.</p><p></p><p>So how to arrange rewards that satisfy both sides is indeed a debatable issue.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be calm and patient, refusing to leave until he gets a satisfactory result.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Performance Hall furrowed their brows and secretly discussed.</p><p></p><p>After several confrontations and probes, they finally reached a happy ending where both sides were satisfied.</p><p></p><p>With this remarkable achievement, Li Fan was able to obtain the position of "Special Steward of the Performance Hall," officially entering the system of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, all rewards were distributed in the form of merit points.</p><p></p><p>According to the estimation of the people in the Performance Hall, this was enough to raise Li Fan's authority level all in one go to sixteen.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that for an ordinary cultivator within the system to reach this level, they would need at least thirty-four years of hard work.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan managed to achieve it in one step.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan now, the amount of contributions doesn't matter at all. Settling it in terms of merits is the desired result.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Next, he had to cooperate with the Performance Hall to go through the corresponding procedures.</p><p></p><p>The Performance Hall submitted the application, and the Political Hall swiftly approved it.</p><p></p><p>After going through a formality on the Baiyu Wenxin Platform, Li Fan successfully became a member of the Cong Yun Sea Performance Hall.</p><p></p><p>Then came the distribution of merit points.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan left the central core area of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island, besides the aura of an "Ancient cultivator proficient in deduction" from the Tianji Sect, he also gained another layer of identity, "within the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance system, authority level sixteen."</p><p></p><p>"With everyone's attention and an official identity protecting me, even if someone wants to harm me, they can't do it openly."</p><p></p><p>Walking on the road, Li Fan felt much safer.</p><p></p><p>His experiences of reincarnation within the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance made Li Fan deeply understand the importance of order and rules within the sect now.</p><p></p><p>Even the Supreme Dao Ancestor, if they violate the rules or disrupt the order, they would have to face certain consequences.</p><p></p><p>The precedent of the previous life's Guanheng cultivator, who was stripped of their cultivation and exiled to Lanlin State, was a living example.</p><p></p><p>Having an identity within the system undoubtedly meant having an extra layer of protection.</p><p></p><p>However, to temporarily withdraw from the turmoil caused by killing the four Nascent Soul cultivators, Li Fan decided to directly hide and enter closed-door cultivation within the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Killing a Nascent Soul in exchange for a Golden Dan, even under a situation of one against four, was an extraordinary feat.</p><p></p><p>Those who could accomplish such a feat could be considered geniuses regardless of the era, hence the explosive nature of the topic.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to deliberately stir things up; cultivators almost spontaneously discussed and spread the news of this extraordinary event.</p><p></p><p>There were unbelievers, the curious ones, and those eager to challenge Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>When people holding different attitudes towards this matter learned that Li Fan had killed the four Nascent Souls entirely with a "treasure" obtained from the Tianxuan Mirror, their reactions were surprisingly unanimous.</p><p></p><p>"Money is indeed a good thing!"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the truth behind the killing event, which should have had a high level of confidentiality and only known to the members of the Performance Hall, spread almost at the same speed as Li Fan's deeds throughout the various regions of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their personal attitudes towards Li Fan, most cultivators saw his ability to lead everyone to wealth as a remarkable skill.</p><p></p><p>The number of cultivators seeking advice from He Zhenghao increased significantly again.</p><p></p><p>Even He Dao You became somewhat famous among the cultivator community.</p><p></p><p>Despite all the storms outside, Li Fan paid no attention to them.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was the end of the anchor in the ninth year.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time he entered the Meteor Immortal Realm in August, Li Fan had a feeling and woke up from his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai, The Alchemy of Destiny..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed with anticipation. After preparing briefly, he called out, "Heavenly Venerable Fusheng Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the scene before him blurred once again.</p><p></p><p>When he came to his senses, he found himself back in the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he did after entering the Meteor Immortal Realm was not to observe his current situation but to recall the content of the Alchemy of Destiny that Mr. Bai had taught him.</p><p></p><p>The exquisite and unparalleled sentences flashed in his mind, and once again, he reacquainted himself with the "Great Dao Profound Art, Supreme Law."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was once again immersed, unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>"Marvelous!"</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed once again.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei, you finally woke up?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an untimely sentence pulled him out of that wonderful state.</p><p></p><p>It was the somewhat foolish voice of Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Feeling annoyed, Li Fan reached out and gave Xu Ke a claw.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he found that the scenery was somewhat different from when he was in the Imperial Beast Sect before.</p><p></p><p>"What happened while I was asleep?" Li Fan asked Xu Ke through mental communication.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Xiao Hei, you can finally speak?" Xu Ke's face lit up with joy, and he asked with a carefree tone.</p><p></p><p>After scratching a few times, Xu Ke finally recounted the whole story to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that since Li Fan swallowed Song Yang's Ink Immortal Tiger and fell into a deep sleep, Xu Ke had followed the guidance of the jade tablet given by Lu Ya and successfully met Senior Brother Lu Ya and the wise beast Emperor San Wu.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the dormant Heavenly Mandate Xuan Bird, Emperor San Wu spoke some incomprehensible words.</p><p></p><p>Then he inserted a white hair into Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan fell into a deeper slumber on Xu Ke's head.</p><p></p><p>It was only until now that he had awakened.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying I have spent three years in deep sleep?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that you have come to this canyon small world to find a creature called the Rift Realm Whale?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Xiao Hei, you know, these big guys, although they are enormous in size, they usually hide within the clouds and can conceal their figures."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary exploration spells and treasures are ineffective, making it difficult to find them," Xu Ke complained.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

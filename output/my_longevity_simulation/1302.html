        <h1>Chapter 1302</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Heavenly Venerate has returned."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, Lu Xichan and the array masters present were momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then, inevitably, a strong fear surged in their hearts, and they lowered their heads.</p><p></p><p>Even their bodies couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was the overwhelming oppressive power of the Longevity Heavenly Venerate who had dominated the Xuanhuang realm for thousands of years and single-handedly created the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>With Dharma Transmitter Ren's words, in each state of the Wanxian Alliance, the Sacred Emperor Talismans attached to the giant Dharma Transmission Stone Statues suddenly moved on their own without wind.</p><p></p><p>They fluttered incessantly, as if they could be blown open at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The stone statues suppressed by the talismans also seemed to come alive, emitting subtle shaking.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor Talismans emitted a purple-golden starlight, while the Dharma Transmission Stone Statues emitted a white glow.</p><p></p><p>The two forces constantly opposed each other.</p><p></p><p>The sky and earth of the Xuanhuang realm changed colors.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor also seemed to sense something, raising his head to look at the sky while lecturing, but without stopping the principles of the Great Dao he was expounding.</p><p></p><p>It's just that his speaking speed had unintentionally quickened a little.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the anomalies in the Xuanhuang realm, some Alliance cultivators had already guessed what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Their faces turned pale, cold sweat pouring down their foreheads. They no longer had the heart to listen to what the Sacred Emperor was saying, their whole bodies shivering from fear.</p><p></p><p>While some cultivators had flickering eyes, gathering to listen to the Sacred Emperor's teachings. At the same time, they prayed in their hearts for the Dharma Transmitter to return a little later.</p><p></p><p>"The changes of ancient and modern times, the principles of the Great Dao."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmission Method cannot be contained by Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"I have now attained the Dao, and will try to change it..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Sacred Emperor's Dharma lecture came to an end.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor's gaze also completely shifted from the masses below to the figure in the starry sky outside the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Nodding slightly, he suddenly disappeared into the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Without the Sacred Emperor's protection, all kinds of anomalies suddenly descended between the heaven and earth of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Rolling dark clouds emerged out of nowhere. Continuous and unbroken, they slowly obscured the bright moon transformed by the Great Enlightenment of the Sacred Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>On the earth, the birds and beasts that had originally gone out to listen to the Sacred Emperor's Dharma lecture were startled, fleeing in panic and rushing back to their nests to take shelter.</p><p></p><p>Even the flowers, plants and trees were broken and scattered in the increasingly violent winds.</p><p></p><p>Thunderbolts exploded from the dark clouds one after another.</p><p></p><p>Then heavy rain pounded the ground.</p><p></p><p>With the wind, rain, and thunder combined, the entire Xuanhuang realm instantly became like a doomsday.</p><p></p><p>Those Alliance cultivators whose hearts were shaken by listening to the Sacred Emperor's Dharma lecture instantly felt like a basin of cold water had been poured over their heads, going from feverish to sober.</p><p></p><p>"What was I thinking! That's the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate! The Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate who single-handedly suppressed the Xuanhuang realm for thousands of years! I actually fantasized that the Sacred... no, this group of bandits would win?"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Sacred Emperor is strong, he definitely won't be a match for the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. Damn, I need to hurry and forget this new Dharma too."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerate above, please forgive this humble one's momentary delusion..."</p><p></p><p>"With the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate taking action, everything will get better!"</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance cultivators were awed by the Dharma Transmitter's might, their hearts and galls trembling.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Dynasty soldiers, due to the innate huge gap in realms, were also momentarily terrified.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, their eyes became firm again.</p><p></p><p>Some of them recalled the words the Sacred Emperor had said to them before this expedition.</p><p></p><p>So someone shouted to the sky: "The Sacred Dynasty will surely win, the Sacred Emperor will surely win!"</p><p></p><p>At first it was just sporadic shouts.</p><p></p><p>But it quickly formed a wildfire momentum. Without anyone deliberately directing, all the Sacred Dynasty soldiers shouted in unison, as if their hearts were connected.</p><p></p><p>The voices also grew louder and louder, from shouting to roaring, from roaring to howling.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the Enlightened soldiers, like rolling waves, spread throughout the entire Xuanhuang realm with the momentum of collapsing mountains and overturning seas.</p><p></p><p>As if responding to their call, the bright moon in the sky burst out with purple-golden light.</p><p></p><p>It drilled out from the boundless dark clouds again.</p><p></p><p>The swaying wind and rain of Xuanhuang actually showed a trend of gradually subsiding amidst this earth-shattering roar.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound coming from afar, Dharma Transmitter Ren sneered: "Just a dying struggle."</p><p></p><p>As if echoing his words, transmission gates appeared one after another in the four central states of the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Huge flying ship arrays constantly flew out from them, instantly filling the sky of the four states.</p><p></p><p>A Dharma Transmitter stood at the bow of each of these flying ships.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitters looked up at the sky and bowed slightly towards the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate in outer space.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan secretly peeked at this scene, inwardly surprised: "These should be the cultivator forces from the small worlds of the various Dharma Transmitters. Since Lord Heavenly Venerate has already appeared, naturally they will no longer hide behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the aura emanating from those flying ships, there are quite a few Harmonized Dao cultivators among them."</p><p></p><p>As Lu Xichan was pondering, a voice full of mockery suddenly came from the sky: "You've deployed the Detached Discs and nineteen Tianxuan Secondary Lifeforms, yet after so long, you still haven't broken a mere entrapment array."</p><p></p><p>"Your Strategy Array Hall is really getting worse with each generation. If Lu Xia knew, he would probably be so angry that he'd come back to life."</p><p></p><p>Hearing her master's name and the ridicule directed at her, Lu Xichan couldn't help but feel a surge of anger in her heart. However, she also recognized that the speaker was one of the Dharma Transmitters, Dou. So even though she was angry, she didn't dare show a hint of it. She just lowered her head and said, "This subordinate is incompetent."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, tell your people to step aside." With a lazy sentence from Dharma Transmitter Dou, a team of lads floated down from the flying ship in the sky.</p><p></p><p>They first bowed slightly to the Mirror Holders guarding the Detached Discs. After receiving the array data analyzed by the Detached Discs so far, they began to break the array.</p><p></p><p>These lads numbered thirty-six in total.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were all devoid of any expression. Even their eyes had no emotional fluctuations at all.</p><p></p><p>One of them stretched his hand into the light beam of the Bright Moon Starlight Grand Array.</p><p></p><p>Then his body also instantly became ethereal.</p><p></p><p>From his hand to his body, he gradually became the same as the starlight of the array.</p><p></p><p>The lad testing the array with his body was about to be completely devoured by the starlight of the array when his figure suddenly disappeared, turning into a stream of light and flying to another lad.</p><p></p><p>This second lad also touched with his hand and then tested the array with his body.</p><p></p><p>This repeated back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Until the last thirty-sixth lad, just before his body turned into starlight.</p><p></p><p>His body shook, shaking out the original thirty companions. He himself also returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-six lads whispered to each other.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if reaching a consensus, they all nodded in unison.</p><p></p><p>They split into two groups, one starting to break the array, the other repeating the process of testing the array with their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance array masters observing on the side almost immediately felt the extraordinary nature of this group of lads.</p><p></p><p>According to their speed of deciphering, this Bright Moon Starlight Grand Array would definitely have a hole torn open in less than half a day at most.</p><p></p><p>As the chief of the Strategy Array Hall, Lu Xichan's shock was far beyond ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these thirty-six array-breaking lads, the four words "Array Spirit Sacred Body" came to her mind.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely special physique, as if the body was composed of natural arrays. Not only did they have a natural affinity and resonance with various arrays, they could also merge their body with the array, greatly increasing the strength of the array.</p><p></p><p>Just like spirit tools to magic treasures, they could transform into array spirits, causing the array to sublimate and evolve.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan's master Lu Xia had wanted to find cultivators with this physique to inherit his mantle when he was alive. Unfortunately, he never got his wish until his death, and had no choice but to pass on all his lifelong learnings to Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>But she never expected that today, more than thirty of them appeared at once!</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan looked up at the sky again, at the figures standing on the densely packed floating ships.</p><p></p><p>Her heart turned slightly cold: "Just how many things are these Dharma Transmitters hiding?"</p><p></p><p>After Dharma Transmitter Ren learned about the progress of breaking the array, a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This time the Wanxian Alliance had been made to look so miserable, Lord Heavenly Venerate's punishment was definitely unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, before receiving the punishment, he would vent his anger on these troublemakers.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the group of black-robed cultivators who had been gathering their moves and were forced to stop because of the Sacred Emperor's Dharma lecture began their actions again.</p><p></p><p>Several more cultivators in blue Daoist robes, holding whisks and talismans, quietly descended from the flying ships in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The whisks and talismans waved, shaping the power in the accumulated light orbs into one hideous-looking, killing intent-filled, god-like figure after another.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these energy gods descended, the might emanating from them made even Lu Xichan, a Harmonized Dao realm cultivator, feel genuine fear.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance's counterattack was about to be unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Bright Moon Starlight Grand Array, the Sacred Dynasty soldiers had also prepared for close combat with the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield commander-in-chief, Sun Erlang, was methodically issuing one order after another through the Sacred Emperor's Star Network.</p><p></p><p>"Those below the Nascent Soul stage, guard your positions and do not act recklessly. Continue to supervise the construction progress of the suppression grand array. Remember, being able to complete the grand array on time is a great merit!"</p><p></p><p>"For cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage and above, I'm making the following deployment adjustments."</p><p></p><p>The brighter stars in the sea of stars dispersed and regrouped under Sun Erlang's mental manipulation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't clash head-on with the Wanxian Alliance, extend the battle lines to every part of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"We don't need to attack the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, what we need is to wait for the Sacred Emperor to return victorious from the sea of stars!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang said with great determination.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightened soldiers responded with a thunderous cry.</p><p></p><p>After everyone's emotions were stirred up, Sun Erlang observed the scene inside the Bright Moon Starlight Grand Array and made final adjustments to the soldiers' assignments.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the remaining mental power had already connected to the silently standing dark golden Sacred Punishment Puppet.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I can stretch my muscles and bones a bit."</p><p></p><p>Three hours later.</p><p></p><p>The Bright Moon Starlight Grand Array that had tightly sealed the four states of the Alliance for a full seven days was finally torn open with a small hole.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the powerful attacks filled with the anger of the Alliance cultivators poured out from this gap.</p><p></p><p>Solidified spell techniques, furious-eyed manifested deities, and countless magic treasure lights...</p><p></p><p>Shining upon each other, gushing out.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying energy sufficient to completely flatten several states of the Alliance was impatiently seeking targets to strike.</p><p></p><p>However, what awaited this long-accumulated counterattack from the Wanxian Alliance was just an ordinary black door.</p><p></p><p>As the black door opened, all the frenzied attacks were devoured by it.</p><p></p><p>Like a deep abyss monster opening its bloody huge mouth.</p><p></p><p>Not a bit of energy ripple was left for the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After devouring all the accumulated explosive energy, the black door disappeared again as silently as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the somewhat stunned Wanxian Alliance crowd.</p><p></p><p>"The Dark Sea?" Dharma Transmitter Ren's face changed slightly, as he sensed a hint of familiarity from this door.</p><p></p><p>And just as he expected, this "vast" energy devoured into the Dark Sea only formed another accumulating cloud deep in the Dark Sea. Other than that, it didn't stir up any other ripples.</p><p></p><p>"So the recent disturbance in the Dark Sea was also related to this group of bandits."</p><p></p><p>With new and old grudges combined, Dharma Transmitter Ren's heart had already reached the peak of anger.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-six lads continued to break the array, intending to completely shatter the Bright Moon Starlight Grand Array.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators under the other Dharma Transmitters also poured out from the gap in the grand array, intending to sweep and slaughter the bandits in each state.</p><p></p><p>However, Dharma Transmitter Ren's plan encountered a setback in the very first state.</p><p></p><p>The entire...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The state was completely empty and desolate.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the bandits had completely withdrawn, and even the interior of the Heavenly City had been swept clean.</p><p></p><p>No one was left behind.</p><p></p><p>"They ran away?" Chuan Fa Zhe Ren was somewhat surprised and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a silver light shot towards them at a rapid speed.</p><p></p><p>The silver light seemed to have received a special blessing, moving several times faster than when it was flying before.</p><p></p><p>It arrived in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Patrolling Heaven Arrow?!"</p><p></p><p>Some of the Chuan Fa Zhe recognized the object that was right before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Their faces changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Continuous and violent explosion sounds reverberated through the sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the Xuanhuang Realm, in the darkest starry sea.</p><p></p><p>The figure that was rushing back to the Xuanhuang Realm at high speed also suffered a nearly identical fate.</p><p></p><p>However, what detonated in the starry sea was not just the Patrolling Heaven Arrow.</p><p></p><p>It was the remnant power of true immortals scattered throughout the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Holy Emperor Li Ping was not a pedantic person who had to have a fair and square confrontation with Chuan Fa.</p><p></p><p>All he wanted was victory.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the "strong wind" blowing in the starry sea, Li Ping used the reviving power of the starry sea to change the original positions of the remnant true immortal powers.</p><p></p><p>He then used formations to conceal them, forming a trap in a certain sense.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa had walked this road back home countless times.</p><p></p><p>He was more familiar with it than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>However, he never thought that this time, he would encounter an attack.</p><p></p><p>Like the rising of wind and surging of waves, that figure became flickering, illusory and distorted under the influence of different remnant true immortal powers.</p><p></p><p>He looked a bit disheveled.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor gazed at his opponent from afar, whose appearance was identical to the tall stone statues erected all over Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Tall crown and long beard.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa Tian Zun.</p><p></p><p>However, even though this figure was under attack, the expression on his face remained the same as the stone statues on the ground, without any change.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor did not wait for his opponent to recover from the sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>The phantom of the Holy Dynasty appeared behind him, accompanied by swirling starlight.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mandate is with me..."</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Dao is with me..."</p><p></p><p>"The future is with me!"</p><p></p><p>The fortune that the Holy Dynasty had gathered and accumulated for a long time was instantly bestowed upon him.</p><p></p><p>The devout prayers from countless Daqi people, soldiers, and the remnants of the Youzu race broke through time and space, resounding in unison beside the Holy Emperor like the mysterious sound of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the darkest starry sea, a gale blew around the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The darkness receded and the starlight gradually brightened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Holy Emperor seemed to have become the center of the entire dark starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Endless star domains, boundless void, and countless stars.</p><p></p><p>They were all revolving around the Holy Emperor at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, all living beings felt something in their hearts at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They involuntarily looked up at the sky one after another. Outside the gloomy sky.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling silver vortex of starlight illuminated the world that was like night.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of the layers of revolving stars, one could clearly see the majestic and solemn figure of the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>His starlight holy robe danced with the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Glowing and shining endlessly!</p><p></p><p>"Dao extinguishes..."</p><p></p><p>"Dao is born!"</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Holy Emperor, accompanied by a calm and vast Dao sound, disappeared into the vortex of starlight.</p><p></p><p>Like the Milky Way, descending from the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>Charging down towards the old man with the tall crown who had not yet stabilized his form!</p><p></p><p>On Chuan Fa's eternally unchanging face, a hint of fluctuation finally appeared.</p><p></p><p>In this endless starlight, he seemed to see the ancient immortal cultivation world, the prosperous immortal cultivation era of this starry sea.</p><p></p><p>He also saw that as the prosperity reached its peak and began to decline, some disharmonious anomalies began to appear in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he also saw that with the collapse of the immortal dao, all kinds of terrifying calamities silently descended upon the starry sea. One after another flourishing immortal cultivation realms were annihilated in the catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa's eyes fluctuated. In front of his eyes, the dazzling starry sea was becoming dim.</p><p></p><p>The starlight entered his eyes, his body, and his soul.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa's tall crown and attire began to decay.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa's beard and hair began to fall out.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa's figure changed from tall and majestic to stooped.</p><p></p><p>Those remnant true immortal powers that had not been completely shaken off were still entangling him.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa Tian Zun appeared to be in a precarious state.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>"What a move, Dao extinguishes and Dao is born."</p><p></p><p>In the howling wind of the starry sea, Chuan Fa Tian Zun finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>His voice was different from the kind preaching tone in the memories of the Xuanhuang living beings.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to being heavily injured, it sounded weak and feeble, like a dying mortal.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor did not respond.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even show his figure.</p><p></p><p>The impact of the starlight river was about to end.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Emperor's attack had not ended yet.</p><p></p><p>What had just happened to Chuan Fa was only the Dao extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>And next...</p><p></p><p>Black hair drilled out from the top of Chuan Fa's head and grew long in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Muffled explosive sounds came from various parts of Chuan Fa's body. From time to time, one could see traces of tumors and protruding bones.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The strong heartbeat accompanied the reviving wind of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>With each beat, a piece of flesh and blood exploded from Chuan Fa's body.</p><p></p><p>As the new Dao is born, the old laws shall be executed.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa, this ancient existence incompatible with the revival of the starry sea, was undergoing an intense Dao devouring.</p><p></p><p>The heartbeat was getting faster and faster, and Chuan Fa's bent body was already incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Even the bones under the flesh and blood no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>Like an incomplete puzzle piece, swaying violently in the explosions.</p><p></p><p>His newly grown long hair circled around the starry sea and returned to its original place.</p><p></p><p>It tightly strangled his neck.</p><p></p><p>Tightening more and more, like a sharp sword, determined to cut off his head.</p><p></p><p>The heartbeat had reached its limit, and Chuan Fa's chest exploded.</p><p></p><p>No blood mist, just pure, absolute nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Not even energy existed, a complete state of Dao annihilation!</p><p></p><p>The Dao annihilation began to spread from the void in his chest to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The already badly damaged body seemed to be completely devoured by nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The wind of the starry sea became more and more violent.</p><p></p><p>As if celebrating this victory.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Just as the void of Dao annihilation was about to devour Chuan Fa's head.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa Tian Zun, this mysterious and supremely powerful person who had oppressed the Xuanhuang Realm for several eras.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, starlight appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same words that the Holy Emperor had shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Dao extinguishes..."</p><p></p><p>With Chuan Fa's words, the starry sea seemed to fall into silence and darkness again.</p><p></p><p>The blowing wind slowly subsided.</p><p></p><p>The wildly growing hair slowly fell off.</p><p></p><p>The nothingness that was devouring Chuan Fa was also stopped by some force and ceased to spread.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, all the destructive phenomena on Chuan Fa's body had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was an invisible barrier around him, blocking all forces trying to approach.</p><p></p><p>The wind was still blowing, and the starlight was dazzling.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Even though he only had half a head left.</p><p></p><p>"Dao is born."</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa said again very calmly.</p><p></p><p>Black hair grew out again, and flesh was born and evolved from nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The tall crown and attire were restored to their original state in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment, Chuan Fa Tian Zun, who was originally heavily injured and on the verge of perishing, actually recovered to his original state!</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying sight!</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, just a little bit short." The Holy Emperor's sighing voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>A streak of starlight rolled by, and Li Ping's figure appeared again.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Chuan Fa Tian Zun, the regret in his eyes had long disappeared, leaving only endless fighting spirit and firm belief.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa also did not directly counterattack, but looked at this attacker who wanted to put him to death without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>As if seeing something extremely interesting, Chuan Fa was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "When did another Ping Taishang realm appear in this starry space?"</p><p></p><p>There was some emotion and some sigh.</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head slightly, "But it's the limit of the current starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"It's not the limit of this starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"How can we talk about Taishang."</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa Tian Zun did not refute.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he looked back at the distant center of the starry sea, "Does fellow Daoist know that as the water rises, the boat rises with it?"</p><p></p><p>"My Taishang and your Taishang..."</p><p></p><p>"Are still different."</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>There was no boasting, just a matter-of-fact calmness.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor listened to Chuan Fa's words, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>He naturally understood what Chuan Fa meant.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Chuan Fa Tian Zun was currently displaying his current combat power was because the limit that the starry sea could accommodate was only up to this point. But the power that Chuan Fa Tian Zun could control was still above this limit.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the existence of the upper limit, it could not be fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>As the limit of the starry sea was opened up, his strength would also become stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>As for the Holy Emperor, although he had also reached the limit of the starry sea now.</p><p></p><p>It was through the blessing of the Holy Dynasty's fortune, the favor of the starry sea, and many other factors.</p><p></p><p>Once the limit of the starry sea was opened up, he would also need to continue cultivating for a period of time to catch up.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap between Chuan Fa and him.</p><p></p><p>"After all, it's Chuan Fa Tian Zun who has survived for who knows how long." The Holy Emperor was not very surprised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Nor was there any fear.</p><p></p><p>Even though his killing move was blocked, even though there was a gap in their strength.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's attack had just begun.</p><p></p><p>Holy Emperor Li Ping stretched out his hand towards the front, feeling the rising wind of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was not the reviving wind of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa Tian Zun also noticed Li Ping's movement.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist's previous move of Dao extinguishing and Dao being born was indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"It evoked my feelings and benefited me greatly."</p><p></p><p>"I also have a move, please appreciate it, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Chuan Fa Tian Zun took the initiative to attack this time.</p><p></p><p>"This technique is called..."</p><p></p><p>"Object in Palm."</p><p></p><p>The moment the three words "Object in Palm" rang in the Holy Emperor's ears, a sense of unease surged in Li Ping's heart.</p><p></p><p>Then the scene before his eyes began to change rapidly.</p><p></p><p>His body shrank infinitely in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery expanded rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The old man with the tall crown, who was originally several times smaller than his thirty-three-foot-tall body, swelled rapidly.</p><p></p><p>By the time the Holy Emperor realized the change had occurred, Chuan Fa Tian Zun had already become as huge as the towering stone statues erected on the Xuanhuang land.</p><p></p><p>It was not just a change in size.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor even felt that his connection with the Holy Emperor, with the Xuanhuang Realm, and even the entire starry sea, was being continuously reduced as he shrank.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor had a vague premonition in his heart that if this continued, the connection might be completely severed.</p><p></p><p>And he would be forever lost in this miniaturized scene.</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts turned rapidly, Chuan Fa Tian Zun's attack had already followed.</p><p></p><p>In just the time it took to think, Chuan Fa's full appearance could no longer be seen.</p><p></p><p>Only Chuan Fa's palm, as tall as mountains and as vast as the earth and sky, pressed down from above.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space was locked, and the Holy Emperor had nowhere to escape.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, even the palm lines of Chuan Fa had become like towering continuous mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>Facing Chuan Fa's giant palm that was about to crush down, there was not the slightest fear in the Holy Emperor's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"How can it be an object in your palm?"</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in the Holy Emperor's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Let me show you the true power of Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"Body transforms into..."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>His body was completely covered under Chuan Fa's giant palm.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Endless Xuanhuang light shone from under the giant palm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the living beings of the Xuanhuang Realm suddenly felt the earth beneath their feet shaking wildly.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy clouds in the sky were all shaken away by this tremor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, quite a few keen-eyed cultivators saw that between heaven and earth, it seemed as if some lines were missing.</p><p></p><p>With a creaking roar, it was as if the pillars of heaven had broken.</p>

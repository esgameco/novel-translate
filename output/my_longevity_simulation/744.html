        <h1>Chapter 744</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The announcement brought a shock no less than the Xuanxuan Treasure Manual. </p><p></p><p>The announcement was titled 'Letter to Cultivators of the Xianmeng'. The main points were:</p><p></p><p>"Through the unremitting efforts of Xianmeng cultivators, the complete exploration of the White Mist Barrier in the Xuanhuang Realm has been accomplished. This is a great milestone worthy of being remembered forever."</p><p></p><p>"But the path of cultivation is difficult, and the journey ahead is not over. Next, an even more arduous and great task awaits everyone."</p><p></p><p>"As is well known, in addition to the divided states and the towering White Mist Barrier, there are also innumerable small pocket worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm."  </p><p></p><p>"Now that the White Mist Barrier has been fully explored, it is time to advance into these small worlds!"</p><p></p><p>"Bring them all under the rule of the Xianmeng Alliance and achieve the unification of the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Any cultivator who contributes to this effort will gain immense merit and contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"When cultivators carrying the Xuantian Treasure Manual encounter portals leading to pocket worlds, the manual will send out a reminder."</p><p></p><p>"It is important to note that exploring pocket worlds is different from the White Mist Barrier, with dangers far exceeding it. In the White Mist, at most there were strange, deceased existences. But in the small worlds, there may be cultivators and species with different supernatural powers who will fight to the death in resistance."</p><p></p><p>"But do not be afraid!"  </p><p></p><p>"Even if you unfortunately die during exploration, the merit and contribution points gained will not disappear, but will be inherited into your next reincarnation along with your true spirit."</p><p></p><p>"The unification of the Xuanhuang Realm is destined to be an extremely long process. But I believe that with the fearless spirit of our Xianmeng cultivators, this goal will eventually be achieved!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators reacted with surging hearts or doubts upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Bai, he inwardly cursed, immediately realizing the source of his Lord's unease.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Zaiji, is the Terminal Disk Formation ready?" Li Fan flew to the entrance of Changsheng Valley and asked solemnly. </p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Fan addressed Fang Zaiji by his full name, immediately realizing the severity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be careless, Fang Zaiji replied: "I have tried my best. But the power within the Terminal Disk is something we have never encountered before. Creating the formation based on it will require some more time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "There is no time left. Tell me the current progress of the formation."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was a bit surprised but still promptly followed orders.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan listened, he took out the Separation Disk and input the rudimentary formation into it.</p><p></p><p>A faint glow emanated from the Separation Disk as countless scenes flashed rapidly before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, the scenes suddenly froze, and a complete formation appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>As the glow faded, Li Fan pointed into the air, transmitting the formation to Fang Zaiji, Liu San and others as they jointly set up the formation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they were lucky that the entrance to Changsheng Valley was quite hidden within the mist.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, when the formation was completed, the entrance had not been discovered by other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuantian Treasure Manual sounds like a good thing," said Fang Zaiji, who had grasped the situation, his eyes flashing with a hint of greed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji said indifferently: "To use such a divine object, one must naturally pay a price. I don't..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big deal, after all, I don't have anything to hide." </p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, Li Fan and Jiang Yushan's gazes suddenly fell upon him, a faint murderous aura emanating from them.</p><p>Fang Ranjie chuckled and quickly changed the subject: "The Myriad Immortal Alliance's latest move is no small matter. As far as I know, the small worlds contained within the Xuanhuang Realm are likely not less than tens of thousands. Not to mention the secret realms and cave paradises."</p><p>"After the great calamity back then, many cultivators from various sects fled and took refuge within them. The Myriad Immortal Alliance's current mobilization of cultivators to thoroughly explore these places..."</p><p>He sighed with emotion: "One can almost imagine the bloody scenes that will unfold soon."</p><p>Liu San frowned and said, "Although the small worlds and cave paradises may not be weak in power, the Xuanhuang Realm now has the Reincarnation Pavilion, where cultivators can be revived. How can they fight against this? It can be almost certain that, although the process may be difficult, the small worlds will ultimately be the ones to lose in the end."</p><p>"Perhaps the Immortal Alliance had already planned the war against the small worlds when they established the Reincarnation Pavilion," Fang Ranjie nodded in agreement.</p><p>Listening to their conversation, Li Fan remained silent.</p><p>In this world, the Myriad Immortal Alliance's plans were intricately connected. Every step they took had a deeper meaning.</p><p>So the question arises, why did the Immortal Alliance go to such great lengths, not hesitating to open the Heavenly Mirror to the public, to launch a war against the small worlds?</p><p>What special significance does the unification of the Xuanhuang Realm hold for the Myriad Immortal Alliance?</p><p>Almost instantly, Li Fan thought of the towering obelisks that stood in various places throughout the Xuanhuang Realm in the previous world.</p><p>After the unification of the Xuanhuang Realm in the previous world, the Immortal Alliance seemed to want to use the thousands of obelisks to push the Xuanhuang Realm away from the pull of the Immortal Realm.</p><p>But in this world, there were no signs of them doing so.</p><p>It was not due to a lack of ability, but perhaps...</p><p>"The Heavenly Mirror can see all things in the world. It has already completed the initial upgrade by penetrating the white mist barrier. If it can further encompass the countless small worlds within its reflection..."</p><p>"It may not be impossible to go even further!"</p><p>"At that time, perhaps we won't even need external forces. Relying solely on the power of the Heavenly Mirror, we can lead the Xuanhuang Realm to break free from the constraints of the Immortal Realm."</p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered as he considered this possibility.</p><p>"Regardless of how, the tide is difficult to turn. I must ponder how to maximize my own benefits from this."</p><p>...</p><p>In the following days, Meng Wushi from the Pharmacist King Sect began his experiments.</p><p>First, he actively separated himself from the connection of the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation, ensuring that even if his internal situation was completely exposed, it would not implicate the Pharmacist King Sect.</p><p>Then, he generated his own Heavenly Mirror and, while activating its detection function, constantly lingered at the entrance of the Longevity Valley.</p><p>After maintaining this for a period of time, he then flew away on his own.</p><p>"Fortunately, it worked. Otherwise, we might have been embroiled in a bitter battle," Fang Ranjie let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>"It was also a stroke of luck that I obtained that Terminus Stone Tablet that can shield the Heavenly Mirror's perception," Li Fan also feigned a sigh.</p><p>Liu San was very relieved: "In the upcoming momentous battle, our Pharmacist King Sect can remain outside of it. This is truly a great fortune. Perhaps it is an opportunity for us to rise again."</p><p>Jiang Yushan also pondered and said, "Perhaps we can take this opportunity to openly join the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p>"After all, the Myriad Immortal Alliance cannot possibly annihilate all the people from other small worlds. There will surely be worlds that willingly submit to them."</p><p>"We may not be unable to infiltrate their ranks and whitewash our identities."</p>

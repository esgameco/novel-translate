            <p>Zhang Haobo smiled and said, "Little sister is not at all foolish, on the contrary, Senior Shuo in the past..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo paused, then changed his words, "Actually, she is very intelligent. Sometimes she appears to act impulsively, but she has actually weighed the pros and cons in her heart."</p><p></p><p>"Even you have been deceived by her, doesn't that prove how formidable little sister is?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei snorted, raising her head proudly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like our little sister is even smarter than me!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng quickly chimed in.</p><p></p><p>After some sweet talk, they finally obtained Su Xiaomei's forgiveness.</p><p></p><p>"I forgive you!"</p><p></p><p>"Now quickly take out the small cauldron and try it!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng relaxed and took out the last remaining Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>He then infused it with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The cauldron was stimulated, emitting a faint green light.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng brought the cauldron close to the bronze door.</p><p></p><p>The light shone on the door, which was originally extremely hard and could not be shaken no matter how it was attacked.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seemed to melt, forming a door within the shining light.</p><p></p><p>"How is it! My guess was correct, right?" Su Xiaomei said triumphantly.</p><p></p><p>She was the first to enter.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng entered after them.</p><p></p><p>As they passed through the bronze door, they didn't forget to put away the small Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>With the disappearance of the green light, the entrance disappeared, and the bronze door gradually returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Xiaomei was the first to enter, she didn't act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>After the three met up, they observed the space behind the door together.</p><p></p><p>A long and deep passage stretched before them, seemingly endless.</p><p></p><p>Their divine sense was also suppressed, unable to explore.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be danger?" Xiao Heng asked.</p><p></p><p>"Formations, mechanisms, restrictions, all possibilities," Zhang Haobo said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Caution is paramount."</p><p></p><p>The three exchanged glances and had Su Xiaomei take the lead, while Zhang Haobo guarded from behind.</p><p></p><p>Protecting Xiao Heng in the middle, they carefully advanced along the passage.</p><p></p><p>Their minds were tense, not daring to be careless.</p><p></p><p>However, to their surprise, this long and narrow passage went smoothly without any twists or turns.</p><p></p><p>"It feels too smooth, which doesn't seem like a good sign," Su Xiaomei mused, examining her surroundings before continuing forward.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the passage, it suddenly opened up into a bright and spacious hall.</p><p></p><p>It was divided into three levels.</p><p></p><p>In the central empty area, there were many rooms surrounding each level.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the corridor leading deeper inside.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like this is a gathering place, but it appears that something has happened."</p><p></p><p>"The tables and chairs are scattered haphazardly, and the flowers, decorations, are all over the floor."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng observed the surroundings, calmly analyzing.</p><p></p><p>"The Medicine King Cauldron is truly miraculous. After so many years, the things inside can still be kept so fresh."</p><p></p><p>"You see, this plant doesn't look like it has been alive for thousands of years." Su Xiaomei then picked up a pot of flowers from the ground, showing some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xiao and Zhang both had a slight change in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>"If even ordinary spiritual items can be preserved so well, what about the cultivators inside the Medicine King Cauldron?" Xiao Heng squinted his eyes and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was Su Xiaomei who answered him.</p><p></p><p>"It has been over twenty years since the Medicine King Cauldron returned. If there were cultivators from the Medicine King Sect inside who could still move, they should have put away the Medicine King Cauldron long ago."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo nodded in agreement, "Either they all died, or they all disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng added, "I'm afraid of the eerie existence that is neither alive nor dead."</p><p></p><p>There wasn't anything of value in this hall.</p><p></p><p>And all the rooms on the three levels of the hall were sealed shut and couldn't be opened.</p><p></p><p>The three had to continue exploring deeper inside.</p><p></p><p>Although the Medicine King Cauldron was silent, the hearts of the three became increasingly uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The corridor behind the hall extended in different directions.</p><p></p><p>The trio explored each one systematically.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the corridors were different areas.</p><p></p><p>There were alchemy rooms, transmission halls, martial arts arenas, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But just like before, no one was in sight.</p><p></p><p>The doors were tightly closed.</p><p></p><p>Despite knowing that there might be many ancient treasures inside, the three didn't know how to access them.</p><p></p><p>They could only stare blankly.</p><p></p><p>The only silver lining was that unlike other ancient sect ruins, which were full of crises, there were no formations or restrictions triggered from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>There was just a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>Continuing forward, they encountered a grey-white stone door blocking their path.</p><p></p><p>This time, the method of camouflaging with the small Medicine King Cauldron didn't work.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this stone door was several times more sturdy than the previous bronze door.</p><p></p><p>Even with Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo's combined attacks, they couldn't even make the stone gate budge.</p><p></p><p>Feeling futile, Su Xiaomei was a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that we will return empty-handed from the treasure mountain?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, such thoughts arose in the hearts of the three.</p><p></p><p>No cultivator would easily give up upon seeing such treasures before them.</p><p></p><p>They turned back and conducted a thorough search again.</p><p></p><p>This time, they were lucky to make a discovery.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, this room's door doesn't seem to be sealed."</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei called out to the two.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and Zhang Haobo hurried over.</p><p></p><p>Touching the slight gap on the door, Zhang Haobo nodded, "Right, it's indeed different from the other rooms."</p><p></p><p>Seeing a potential breakthrough, Xiao Heng became a bit excited, "Does this mean we can open it?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhang Haobo and Su Xiaomei joined hands once again.</p><p></p><p>Under the blazing sun and bloody sea.</p><p></p><p>The bronze door emitted creaking sounds.</p><p></p><p>It was slowly pried open inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, with the concerted effort of the two, they finally managed to create a gap in the door.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>The three passed on messages to each other, then walked in.</p><p></p><p>There was no imminent danger as they had expected.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the scene in the room caught them off guard.</p><p></p><p>It was a solitary dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Although not large, it was fully furnished with a bed, table, chairs, and cabinets.</p><p></p><p>And on the floor, there was a cultivator lying prone.</p><p></p><p>His head facing the door, his movements suggested he was about to close it.</p><p></p><p>To the astonishment of Xiao Heng and the others, this person still had a trace of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Breathing steadily, as if only asleep.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Do we take action?"</p><p></p><p>"After thousands of years, he's still alive. His strength is unfathomable. If we act recklessly..."</p><p></p><p>As they communicated through divine sense, the person lying on the floor groaned, slowly waking up.</p><p></p><p>The situation was unclear, and the three huddled together, quickly retreating.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect cultivator got up from the ground, first looking around somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if recalling something, his expression gradually returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Counting with his fingers, he was shocked, "It has been twenty-four years already?"</p><p></p><p>Finally noticing Xiao Heng and the others in the room, he showed a trace of surprise on his face, but quickly regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!" Xiao Heng and the others greeted in unison.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 528</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just as Sister Zhao created a lifelike illusion similar to a "love simulation" during the induction process.</p><p></p><p>To her, what is the significance?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believes that with her strength, even without the temptation of illusions, she could easily swallow and assimilate other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But she just didn't do it.</p><p></p><p>She insisted on playing this time-crossing game with Li Fan for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she is really extremely bored?</p><p></p><p>Although this possibility cannot be ruled out, Li Fan would rather believe that there is still some hidden secret behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Ants" spying on Changsheng Tianzun, thinking they are hidden well enough to not be discovered.</p><p></p><p>In reality, perhaps nothing can escape their eyes. Since their gaze fell on them, they became aware.</p><p></p><p>Just like the reminder Sister Zhao gave at the end, or perhaps it was a warning.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, trying to unearth the secret of Xian Fan Shang, must be the same.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan activated the killer intent without form, and his gaze fell on Yinyin Island in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Yinyin Islander was still conducting experiments with mortal beings as usual.</p><p></p><p>"So many years have passed, and the lethality of the Xian Fan Infestation seems to have not weakened at all. The new Chapter 69 redirects to Chapter 69 dot com, it is just the infectious ability, which has weakened a lot compared to the original version..." Watching the mortals constantly wailing in agony, Li Fan recalled the scenes he saw in Sister Zhao's illusion, comparing the two in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Yinyin Islander was deeply engrossed, his expression focused. The tragic cries of the mortals did not affect him in the slightest. It was as if what was disappearing in front of him was not life, but just mere consumables.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched for a while and felt bored as well.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it will take some time for him to research something." With that in mind, he withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts returned to the construction work in the Cloud Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Half a year had passed by, with most of the time already gone.</p><p></p><p>The overall basic structure of the Immortal City has been mostly completed, and the next step is the construction of many key facilities, such as the "Transmission Law Deity Statue" and the "Long-Distance Transmission Array."</p><p></p><p>In this regard, with the help of the monks sent by the Wuxian Alliance Headquarters, there was no need to worry too much.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the extended construction period, shortages of supplies began to occur inevitably.</p><p></p><p>After all, the materials Li Fan received at that time were barely enough to build a floating city without any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>It was only through the coordination of He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan that the situation did not come to light on the spot.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou Kebao, who was secretly hindering them, surprisingly had good patience.</p><p></p><p>For so long, he had never actively contacted them or hinted at anything.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we can't rely entirely on him to solve this problem. I have to think of a way myself. The new Chapter 69 redirects to Chapter 69 dot com."</p><p></p><p>"There is Jiao Xiuyuan's channel for ordinary supplies that can be purchased with contributions."</p><p></p><p>"But those strategic materials are not something that ordinary means can acquire. However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, manipulating the current "Cloud Immortal City Reconstruction Commander," Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>In the reconstruction work, each cultivator had their own responsibilities. Although it was called commander, he was not that busy.</p><p></p><p>When no one was around, "Zhou Qing'ang" quietly left the Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>To prevent anyone from tracking him, he lurked in the deep sea for three days and nights.</p><p></p><p>Only after ensuring complete safety did he establish contact with the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>The light and shadow flickered, and after a moment, a blurry figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Why did you suddenly contact us? Is something wrong?" Due to his repeated outstanding achievements, the attitude of the person's face had improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>Even though "Zhou Qing'ang" broke the rule and contacted them again, there was no anger, but genuine concern.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, don't worry, Head. It's not a trouble; it's a huge opportunity!" Zhou Qing'ang was very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The person's face became much calmer.</p><p></p><p>"Head, as you should know, I have the honor of being appointed as the overall commander for the reconstruction of the Cloud Immortal City under the influence of leaders He Zhenghao and He Daoyou." Zhou Qing'ang lowered his voice.</p><p></p><p>"And recently, we have encountered some troubles..."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Zhou Qing'ang briefly described the situation where someone in the Wuxian Alliance wanted to scheme against Li Fan, withhold supplies, and coerce them.</p><p></p><p>The person's face listened and furrowed their brows.</p><p></p><p>"This is intolerable. How could Master Li and the others withstand this pressure?"</p><p></p><p>"He personally told us before that he would rather defect to the Five Elders Association than submit to those people."</p><p></p><p>Before Zhou Qing'ang finished speaking, the person's face suddenly and inexplicably said with joy, "Oh? Does this mean that Master Li Fan is planning to surrender?"</p><p></p><p>However, soon he became a bit doubtful, "Could it be that he is cooperating with the Wuxian Alliance's plan to trap us?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang suddenly felt embarrassed, "Uh, Head, obviously, that was just hot air..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang hurriedly explained, "Although the chance of defection is slim, we must seize the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"He once issued a military order in front of the leaders. If he fails to complete the construction on time, he might lose his head. Due to the lack of those materials, Master Li Fan has been almost going crazy recently."</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying...?" The person's face suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"Trade?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang nodded repeatedly, and then transmitted a series of material lists to the person's face, pressing them onto the stone.</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Head, take a look at these. Can we get our hands on them?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the person's face spoke slowly, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>"That's easy! Hasn't our superiors always asked us to investigate the confidential information about the Immortal City's defense array? With these materials as bargaining chips, let alone the defense array, we can get the entire blueprint for the construction of the entire Immortal City!" Zhou Qing'ang confidently stated.</p><p></p><p>The stone-faced person remained silent but seemed to be intrigued as well.</p><p></p><p>"The importance of the array has been downgraded by two levels now. It's not very cost-effective to trade it this time..." after a while, the person's face ordered.</p><p></p><p>"If possible, it would be best to get information from Master Li Fan about the events that occurred on the day of the 'Wanchun Island Incident.'"</p><p></p><p>"If he could record the situation at that time using a Recording Stone, that would be even better."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang, curious, inquired, "Head, digging up the entire Wanchun Island was our handiwork, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It's really terrifying! I regret not being on the island at that time, otherwise, I could have just gone home directly with this opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what exactly were we looking for with such a grand gesture?"</p><p></p><p>The person's face snorted, "Don't ask what you shouldn't ask. Just do your job within your boundaries."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"It's the character 'Hunger'..."</p><p></p><p>From the subtle fluctuations emanating from the Immortal Boat Sect cultivators not far away, Li Fan's divine sense quickly made a judgment. </p><p></p><p>He didn't approach at close range, but stayed inside the wooden house to observe.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yan..." Elder Gou, who usually had a stern face, was now bowing and scraping, extremely obsequious.  </p><p></p><p>The people in the valley inwardly complained, but didn't dare show it. They even lowered their heads, not daring to look directly at the Immortal Boat Sect cultivator in front of them.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the eyes of mortals, an Immortal Boat Sect cultivator was almost no different from the legendary immortals.</p><p></p><p>"Gou Lang, I heard that in the Punishment Valley, five people died in succession recently?" Elder Yan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Gou Lang's body trembled as he repeatedly responded, "Indeed, that happened. It's just that those few sinners had bad luck. They only went out on missions two or three times before their conditions worsened and they died. The Punishment Valley itself didn't have any major issues..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! What luck..." A cold light flashed in Elder Yan's eyes. He didn't explain further. </p><p></p><p>His vast divine sense instantly enveloped the entire Punishment Valley. </p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, this place has been contaminated."</p><p></p><p>Elder Yan's face instantly turned gloomy. A point of starlight appeared on his fingertip, and he pointed from afar at the residential area of the Punishment Valley where Li Fan's divine sense was.</p><p></p><p>Endless light and heat destroyed everything within range.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>The hidden Li Fan, who was secluded in cultivation to comprehend the Saint Fetus, slightly raised his head.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a civilization that can survive in the Darkest Starry Sea for so long, they are indeed very cautious."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in order to infiltrate, I need to solve the problem of myself being a major source of infection. Otherwise, even if I hide well, causing a large number of surrounding people to die will also expose me."</p><p></p><p>"My divine soul has stayed in the Darkest Starry Sea for too long. It's hard to change after accumulating for so long. I still need to split off a wisp of divine sense to lurk. With previous experience, it can be done like this..."</p><p></p><p>For the next two full months, no one from the Immortal Boat went out to collect relics of destroyed realms.</p><p></p><p>But for the almost endless relics in the outside world, they obviously couldn't give up.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan finally waited again for a new collection team.</p><p></p><p>According to previous experience, Li Fan's divine sense mixed in with the relics and entered the Immortal Boat with them. </p><p></p><p>It's just that this time, the Immortal Boat was obviously much more cautious in handling the relics. When staying with the relics, the Immortal Boat cultivators always maintained wearing armor. They transported the relics to a sealed space. After they left, a blurry talisman phantom appeared above the space.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>The talisman emitted a faint glow, shining on the more than a dozen relics below.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan's divine sense was also bathed in the light, it was not affected in any way.</p><p></p><p>It's just that looking at the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters on the surrounding relics that were about to dissipate, it was absorbed into the talisman phantom above through this dreamlike light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense even felt that the various mysterious powers lingering around him were all absorbed by the talisman.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the power attached to the more than a dozen relics here completely disappeared. They really turned into worthless garbage in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters, the Immortal Boat's degree of utilization is a bit higher than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>This space was completely sealed, and Li Fan's divine sense couldn't escape either. But he was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>For the remaining "garbage", there must be</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan had expected, two days later, two Qi Refining stage cultivators, led by a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator, walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Move all these things onto the ship."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful with all of them. Although the power of world destruction within these items is gone, they are still genuine antiques. The fact that they could survive in the Starry Sea for so long indicates that their material composition is quite extraordinary. Send them all to the [Forging Star Workshop], maybe they can be put to good use." The Foundation Establishment stage cultivator instructed.</p><p></p><p>The two Qi Refining cultivators looked only fifteen or sixteen years old. They seemed to be quite inexperienced.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and attached himself to one of them.</p><p></p><p>Following the three people, he left the sealed space and boarded a small flying boat, arriving at the so-called [Forging Star Workshop].</p><p></p><p>It was an enclosed ring-shaped building made of an unknown white metal.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the circular ring was a scorching fireball.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying heat waves surging on the surface of the fireball were telling of the enormous energy contained within.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, one could see wisps of flame being sucked into a small hole in the circular building from time to time.</p><p></p><p>The receptionist at the Forging Star Workshop was not an ordinary human.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was a strange half-human, half-beast existence with a completely red body, two horns on its head, and a long tail trailing behind.</p><p></p><p>The three people seemed to be very afraid of it. After putting down the items, they couldn't wait to drive the flying boat away.</p><p></p><p>After a lot of tossing and turning, they finally returned to their residence.</p><p></p><p>It was located at the [Hall of Proving the Dao], a separate continent floating in the void.</p><p></p><p>The Hall towered into the sky, piercing the clouds.</p><p></p><p>They came to the lower level of the Hall to report back to their master.</p><p></p><p>The master of the three was a Nascent Soul stage cultivator named Zhao Wuji, who was already white-haired.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three return, he put away the book-type magic tool he was reading and asked with a kind expression, "Is everything taken care of?"</p><p></p><p>The three lowered their heads and replied, "Reporting back to Master, everything has been properly handled."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why I had you specifically make this trip?" Zhao Wuji asked again.</p><p></p><p>The three were all stunned, not knowing how to answer.</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, the Valley of Suppressing Sins was razed to the ground. The survivors in the valley were also all taken away and isolated for observation. It's said that the cause of the incident was that the valley's operations for collecting relics outside were not standardized, triggering the spread of the [Power of World Destruction]."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>"This procedure was set by the Immortal Pivot Court and has been followed for the past thousand years. Even if there were occasional lapses, it never caused much trouble. But this time, it has caused such a big commotion." Zhao Wuji's words suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Foundation Establishment disciple among the three suddenly realized, "Master, are you saying that the Tower of Severing Immortals is taking advantage of this opportunity to make things difficult?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Zhao Wuji showed an expression of being pleased with his disciple's understanding. "It's not just the Valley of Suppressing Sins. Next, all the areas of influence of the Immortal Pivot Court within the Immortal Ark will face the impact of the Tower of Severing Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Pivot Court has been in power for too long, and those who covet the leadership of the Immortal Ark have also waited for too long."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji let out a small sigh.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhao Wuji's three disciples each had different expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment disciple's eyes were shifting, as if he was calculating something.</p><p></p><p>Among the two Qi Refining disciples, one lowered his head, carefully pondering his master's words.</p><p></p><p>As for the other one, the one Li Fan's divine sense had attached to, he seemed completely unconcerned.</p>

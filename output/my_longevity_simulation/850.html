His voice had</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Xie trembled slightly and asked again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Weiqi Zheng's face change several times in a short period, he immediately guessed what the other party was thinking.</p><p></p><p>He immediately reassured, "You don't need to worry, our mutual aid society's secret technique is foolproof."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"If you really don't feel at ease, I can help you again!

Empty your mind and eliminate all distracting thoughts." Ji Shaoli instructed.</p><p></p><p>Weiqi Zheng nodded and did as he was told.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his uneasy heart became calm.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded secretly.</p><p></p><p>Then he waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>As for what he was waiting for...</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was the storage ring that Lin Ling had urgently sent from 800 miles away.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the surging power of the earth's veins, in just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Lin Ling personally arrived at Haixuan Island with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Without being noticed by other cultivators on the island.</p><p></p><p>The moment he arrived at the secret room, Lin Ling knocked Weiqi Zheng unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's avatar and clone carefully examined Weiqi Zheng's body at the same time.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shook his head slightly, "Strange. It's not some special physique either."</p><p></p><p>"Although his cultivation talent is outstanding, it's still limited to the scope of one state. Compared to the true geniuses of the Xuanhuang Realm, there is still a considerable gap."</p><p></p><p>"Why was he chosen by the Wanxian League?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a little puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, despite his confusion, it didn't affect his movements at all.</p><p></p><p>He placed the green True Temptation Fruit, which was constantly changing between the real and the illusory, against Weiqi Zheng's forehead.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, as the fruit completely dematerialized, this fruit that could control a Hedao cultivator was wasted on Weiqi Zheng, who only had the cultivation level of Zhuji!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't feel the slightest heartache.</p><p></p><p>If Weiqi Zheng could really pass the selection, then knowing the truth of the Thirty-Three Immortals Selection Plan through this would definitely be worth it!</p><p></p><p>If he unfortunately failed...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression became a little dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Then he could only let him work for a lifetime to pay it back.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on this True Temptation Fruit alone is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the End Separation Disc emitted a lustrous white light.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it appeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath and instantly set up a circle of formations around it.</p><p></p><p>Using his finger as a sword, he forcefully sliced down.</p><p></p><p>The End Separation Disc was cut into a thin layer while slightly vibrating.</p><p></p><p>As if it had suffered great damage, the End Separation Disc instantly became dull.</p><p></p><p>It looked a bit listless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan felt a little distressed.</p><p></p><p>He quickly retrieved it into his mind to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>"After all, it's not the End Stone Plate, but a disc that was cut out and fused with the Separation Disc."</p><p></p><p>"Although it inherited part of the characteristic of being able to be cut and separated, cutting just one piece is still damaging."</p><p></p><p>"You little guy, you better not disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully implanted the thin cicada wing-like End Separation Disc into Weiqi Zheng's mind.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, under Lin Ling's lead, he quietly left this secret room.</p><p></p><p>Only the clone Ji Shaoli was left standing still and waiting.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Weiqi Zheng slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>Then, seeing Ji Shaoli standing beside him with a slightly pale face, many scenes suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your hard work, Brother Ji."</p><p></p><p>"I, Wei, will never dare to forget this great kindness!"</p><p></p><p>Weiqi Zheng said very gratefully.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli waved his hand, "We are all one family in the mutual aid society, so naturally we should help each other."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since the city lord summoned you. You should go."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with the secret technique of our mutual aid society, even if the Changsheng Heavenly Venerate takes action, he won't be able to discover the secrets in your mind!"</p><p></p><p>His tone was extremely confident, and Weiqi Zheng deeply believed it.</p><p></p><p>He nodded heavily.</p>

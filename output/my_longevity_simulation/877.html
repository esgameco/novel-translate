        <h1>Chapter 877</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This stone was quite similar to the tool Zhou Qingyang had used before to contact his superiors.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then placed both hands on it.</p><p></p><p>He activated it using the secret method of the Five Elders Association from his memory.</p><p></p><p>As expected, it was effective. As ripples spread across the surface of the stone, a blurry human face appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>After clearly seeing the situation on this side, the person on the other side was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then the image turned, seemingly switching to a different contact person.</p><p></p><p>The other party glanced at Li Fan, and after a while, snorted coldly: "You even know the secret method of guidance that was just changed not long ago..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems your Universal Alliance has also planted moles among us."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said, "No such thing. I just tried it casually, it was a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>A loud bang came from the other side, clearly very dissatisfied with Li Fan's attitude.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not end the communication, but asked: "What do you want from us this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Last time, you really tricked us badly. You talked about some world-suppressing ultimate weapon, the Sky-Splitting Cannon."</p><p></p><p>"We prepared a whole set of countermeasures, originally thinking of winning with the element of surprise. But unexpectedly..."</p><p></p><p>"Humph, due to misinformation, our strategic direction misjudged. We suffered heavy losses."</p><p></p><p>The face on the stone mirror suddenly expanded, matching his tone and appearing a bit gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and did not answer immediately.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he sighed and said, "It's not that I intentionally provided false information. It's just that the Myriad Immortals Alliance put on too convincing an act this time, even we were deceived."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that such a powerful world-suppressing ultimate weapon was just a distraction?"</p><p></p><p>"However, you guys aren't much better off either, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly changed the topic: "How could the mighty Five Elders Association determine a major strategic direction just based on a few words from us?"</p><p></p><p>"You must have also discovered something that ultimately allowed you to decide."</p><p></p><p>"If even you were like this, how could we have avoided it? We can only say the Myriad Immortals Alliance played this hand beautifully."</p><p></p><p>The face of the Five Elders Association member looked displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, we thought that the high-profile selection of the Thirty-Three Immortals was just a front. The real killer move must be hidden elsewhere. Who would have thought the Myriad Immortals Alliance was so arrogant, with no concealment at all."</p><p></p><p>"Putting their trump card directly out in the open..."</p><p></p><p>The tone of the face was full of the frustration of putting in great effort only to hit air.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the opportunity to ask: "What exactly happened on the battlefield of the Nine Mountains Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>"You were defeated too quickly. By the time we received the news and personally came to the scene to confirm it, we could hardly believe it was real."</p><p></p><p>The face of the Five Elders Association member turned gloomy and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan directly brought out his trump card.</p><p></p><p>The face was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, his level was not enough to know about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Go confirm with the higher-ups. This person..."</p><p></p><p>"Is problematic. Cannot be fully trusted." Li Fan said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The face, no longer as calm as before, hurriedly retreated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waited calmly.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Lin Ling secretly observed Li Fan, unable to contain the curiosity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Association reacted very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a figure appeared again on the smooth stone surface.</p><p></p><p>"This friend, what you said before..."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Ziqiong cannot be fully trusted,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" </p><p></p><p>The speaker was no longer the person from before, but an older man with a strong voice.</p><p></p><p>"If our intelligence is correct, the Purple Vault Immortal is a 'Deranged Cultivator'. His true loyalty lies not with your Five Elders Council or the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"But only with the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate," Li Fan whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes, his information is accurate. But in certain situations..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it's a mix of truth and falsehood, making it difficult to discern," Li Fan said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Although his words were vague, the Five Elders Council fell into a long silence.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is..." From the low murmur of the Five Elders Council man, it wasn't hard to hear the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Purple Vault Immortal was the Five Elders Council's deepest hidden and most important spy.</p><p></p><p>Much of their critical intelligence came from him.</p><p></p><p>This matter was an absolute secret. Originally, only a handful of people within the Five Elders Council knew about it.</p><p></p><p>However, this cultivator from the Multiverse Alliance in front of them already knew the Purple Vault's true identity.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the previous major defeat due to erroneous intelligence...</p><p></p><p>The implications were enough to make the middle-aged man feel like he had fallen into a deep, cold abyss.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he thanked Li Fan, "We will thoroughly investigate this matter. Thank you, friend, for the warning."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan got straight to the point, "We need to know what exactly happened in Jiushan Province back then. Similarly, due to misjudgment, our attention was not on the Jiushan Province battlefield at the time."</p><p></p><p>"Although we've gathered some information from within the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, it's too shocking and needs to be confirmed with you."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, she should be able to appear normally again after some time... I'll transmit the scene from that time to you, see for yourself." The middle-aged man seemed eager to verify the truth of Li Fan's information. After transmitting a message, he took his leave.</p><p></p><p>The smooth, broken stone crumbled on its own, no longer usable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, was watching the scene unfolding in his mind, his spirit trembling.</p><p></p><p>In the clear sky of Jiushan Province, a face suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a tall crown, with a long beard.</p><p></p><p>Solemn expression, eyes lowered.</p><p></p><p>As if having compassion for all living beings, yet concealing boundless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>No cultivator of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals would be unfamiliar with this face.</p><p></p><p>Because in every heavenly city of each province, and in every territory of the Alliance, one could see statues of this figure from time to time.</p><p></p><p>He was the founder of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, the creator of the new methods that defied the laws of heaven and earth, the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate who had dominated the world for thousands of years!</p><p></p><p>As the Dharma Transmission's face appeared, a faint silhouette also quickly emerged in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Five Elders Council cultivators in Jiushan Province also sensed the anomaly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>They quickly gathered, ready for battle.</p><p></p><p>But the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate did not give them much time to prepare before making his move.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission, who had been lowering his eyes, suddenly opened them.</p><p></p><p>With that, an unimaginably terrifying force descended upon Jiushan Province.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were crushed into pulp, their blood flowing everywhere, before they could even cry out.</p><p></p><p>Under this immense pressure, the nine mountain ranges emitted continuous rumbling sounds.</p><p></p><p>The mountains collapsed and fractured, layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>Crumbling from top to bottom, unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission did not avert his gaze, and the terrifying pressure that had descended on Jiushan Province did not relent.</p>

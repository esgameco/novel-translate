        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Why is this happening? Didn't Cold Yingyi just bring back a batch of supplies?!"</p><p></p><p>"To actually let you, a mere mage, take such risks, they are truly a bunch of b*stards!"</p><p></p><p>"To encounter a new life maze on the way? No wonder..."</p><p></p><p>"You were actually able to escape from such a maze, you're lucky. New Chapter 69 Book at ?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's a pity. Moving slower, and there's not much life left."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amid the constant exclamations of amazement from the green-robed cultivator named Hao Hui, Li Fan roughly recounted his experiences along the way.</p><p></p><p>Besides concealing some possible details related to Tianyi in the chaotic stone maze, everything else was narrated truthfully without any embellishment.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning of Li Fan's actions, observing the white-haired and withered but incredibly calm cultivator before him, Hao Hui's eyes flashed with a hint of respect.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator of such high virtue was extremely rare, even within the entire Wanxian League.</p><p></p><p>Hao Hui's expression became solemn, and he softly said, "Friend, rest assured and relax. I will immediately send someone to the Jiaxu No. base to fulfill your desperate plea for help."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cleared his throat and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Everything that needed to be done had been done, and it was evident that this body could not withstand any more turmoil.</p><p></p><p>In order to function normally again, it needed proper recuperation.</p><p></p><p>Hao Hui retreated and closed the door behind him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan felt the shadow in the corner of the room disappear.</p><p></p><p>"There are 57 years of remaining time in this world. Although I can take some longevity treasures, my current condition is similar to that of an almost ascended immortal, nearing the end of life. The effects of prolonging life may not be as good as imagined."</p><p></p><p>"Even though I may not have long to live, it doesn't necessarily mean I can't achieve my goals."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was deep in thought with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>At the forefront of the Broken Palm Immortal City, in a hidden place directly facing the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Countless demonic sounds gushed forth from a nearby void abyss, passing through a gap without any hindrance, continuously pouring into this space.</p><p></p><p>The indescribable voices of the deepest layer of purgatory resonated and raged here incessantly.</p><p></p><p>The powerful and pure demonic sounds seemed to even affect the spatial structure.</p><p></p><p>One twisted and terrifying visage after another kept forming here.</p><p></p><p>And before these inexplicable faces, a figure sat calmly.</p><p></p><p>His features were unclear, but his body shape was bizarre, resembling undulating waves of a river, constantly flickering.</p><p></p><p>The demonic sounds that would make ordinary cultivators change color seemed to have no effect on him at all.</p><p></p><p>As the twisted faces formed by the resonating demonic sounds approached him, they were directly captured and merged into his body.</p><p></p><p>His body fluctuated, the faces disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Yet he remained remarkably calm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>A green stone door rose, blocking the gap in this space.</p><p></p><p>The demonic sounds abruptly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Light darkened, and all the remaining demonic faces instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>His body swayed even more violently.</p><p></p><p>"Shaojun."</p><p></p><p>A black shadow appeared by his side, transforming into a black-robed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He reported to him the scene he had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>Some time later.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?" Shaojun's tone carried a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>"According to my observation, Li Fan did not lie. His remaining lifespan has indeed been nearly consumed by the devouring white mist of Yuan. If he had been slightly slower that day, the situation might have been uncertain."</p><p></p><p>"I have also confirmed his identity with Jihong Dao before coming here. The path to the Jiaxu No. base does show traces of the appearance of the New Life Maze."</p><p></p><p>"However, it has now retreated back into the white mist, so it should be just an isolated incident."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator replied.</p><p></p><p>Shaojun fell silent for a moment upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Especially now that people's hearts are restless, there needs to be a clear contrast to make them feel ashamed of themselves."</p><p></p><p>“You go handle this matter.”</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Shaojun spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator nodded.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to leave, he glanced at Shaojun and hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator paused and asked, "Yan Huan has been hung in the middle of the Xianlou, repeatedly whipped for eleven days now."</p><p></p><p>"When will he be released?"</p><p></p><p>"If this continues, that youngster won't be able to hold on."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a show, the [Demonic Sound Whip] is absolutely real."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator spoke cautiously, fearing to provoke the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Shaojun, however, did not blame him.</p><p></p><p>"I originally let him release the rumors deliberately to correct the atmosphere in Xianlou."</p><p></p><p>"Now that we have such a good publicity subject, his role is more or less dispensable."</p><p></p><p>"Release him tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Send a Soul Replenishing Pill over and let him rest well."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator showed a pleased expression and said, "Thank you, Shaojun."</p><p></p><p>He then quietly disappeared within the secret room.</p><p></p><p>The recent conversation seemed like a trivial episode to Shaojun.</p><p></p><p>As the green stone door descended again, the raging demonic sounds reappeared.</p><p></p><p>His body began to sway and flicker once again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of Shaojun, within half a day, Li Fan's desperate plea for help had spread throughout the entire Eternal Immortal Fortress.</p><p></p><p>There were skeptics, but there were also deeply moved individuals.</p><p></p><p>And as disciples like He Chen, who were trapped at the Jiaxu No. base, were rescued and investigated.</p><p></p><p>Though some cultivators stubbornly believed it was all a staged act, the vast majority chose to believe.</p><p></p><p>As people marveled and admired Li Fan's high character, they couldn't help but feel regret for his remaining decades of life.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan himself, after greeting wave after wave of visitors, he finally welcomed a rare moment of tranquility.</p><p></p><p>"After some recuperation, I have barely managed to adapt to this aging body now."</p><p></p><p>"Although I can change into a younger appearance, it's clear that this current form attracts less attention."</p><p></p><p>The perfect conclusion of his first reverse cultivation of the Dao and the growth of his soul made Li Fan relish the taste of improvement.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan prepared to begin his second reverse cultivation plan.</p><p></p><p>"My original intention for the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Grand Competition was to pass it off casually and go through the motions."</p><p></p><p>"But now, I plan to go against the flow."</p><p></p><p>"I will invest all of my limited remaining life into the construction of formations."</p><p></p><p>"To popularize the Tianxuan Locking Spirit and burn all my strength for it."</p><p></p><p>"I will not stop until I die."</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made Li Fan feel goosebumps all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his discomfort, Li Fan put on a determined look.</p><p></p><p>With slow but resolute steps, he walked out of the room.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 893</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Wood Sword Tian Zhi Qi was able to specially allocate fixed time to provide one-on-one instruction. </p><p></p><p>This unimpressive-looking black sword must have something extraordinary about it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spiritual consciousness slowly swept over its body. No matter how he looked at it, it was just an ordinary mortal iron sword.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if he could easily break it with his bare hands.</p><p></p><p>But just as Wood Sword lost its spiritual nature and the remaining legacy swords were looking around in a daze,</p><p></p><p>The black sword itself was undergoing subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>"It's like slowly tempering with fire, eliminating the dross and keeping the essence. It looks plain and simple, but in fact, it's the same as Wood Sword, returning all methods to one, the great Dao is the simplest." Slowly, Li Fan saw the mystery in it.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Wood Sword Tian Zhi Qi's plan to create another body for himself?" This thought suddenly arose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The other legacy swords may still need a long time to transform into complete conceptual existences. But this black sword, due to Wood Sword Tian Zhi Qi's special attention, is not far from completing the transformation."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, this may be one of the reasons why Wood Sword was willing to leave with Shuo Feng." Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this yet-to-be-formed black sword, Li Fan temporarily dismissed the idea of taking it away.</p><p></p><p>"There should still be more than ten years..."</p><p></p><p>"This can also be considered the fruit of Wood Sword Tian Zhi Qi's efforts. If it can be taken away, Tian Jian Sect in the Spirit Wood Realm will be established."</p><p></p><p>Although it is not clear at present why Wood Sword Tian Zhi Qi would do this,</p><p></p><p>It does not hinder Li Fan from making full use of it.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the original place, he stayed in this sword tomb for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>After being unable to gain new insights from Wood Sword, Li Fan reluctantly left.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Fan did not forget to use secret techniques to hide the sword tomb here.</p><p></p><p>At the same time leaving a mark.</p><p></p><p>As long as any other person breaks in, he will immediately sense it.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jian Sect matter is done, next is Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>The location of the Medicine King Sect ruins is not a secret.</p><p></p><p>Located in the deep mountains of Liuxian State, where few people set foot.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the interior has long been ransacked by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Only some unwanted scrap metal and iron are scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan arrived here, he couldn't find any other living person within a hundred-mile radius.</p><p></p><p>The air was filled with a faint foul smell, making people feel disgusted.</p><p></p><p>"The Medicine King Sect's actions are indeed to my liking. Even when the entire sect was preparing to escape, they still left such a disgusting miasma to prevent their old sect grounds from being occupied by others." Li Fan secretly said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This special stench was left by the Medicine King Sect back then.</p><p></p><p>It has almost fused with the earth here, lingering for thousands of years without dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Although this move by the Medicine King Sect was a bit disgusting, it was indeed effective.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the relatively well-preserved ruins and came to the abandoned workshop according to the location Jiao Xiuyuan mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the stench, he exerted his spiritual power and dug out several small Medicine King Cauldrons buried deep underground.</p><p></p><p>"There are actually thirty-six cauldrons?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>Although he had previously entrusted Jiao Xiuyuan to help dig for small Medicine King Cauldrons,</p><p></p><p>The other party firmly stated there were only twenty-some.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiao, oh Brother Jiao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and made a note of this debt.</p><p></p><p>As usual, he carefully searched again.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these old cauldrons, the Medicine King Sect indeed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was nothing else of value.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan went straight to the Zixiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>On Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli suddenly felt a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, I have clearly made adequate preparations. In theory, even if a Hedao cultivator came in person, I should be able to retreat at ease."</p><p></p><p>"Where does this sense of crisis come from?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, who had always trusted his own premonitions, stood up abruptly, his expression extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>Pacing back and forth, the sense of crisis did not subside.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it intensified.</p><p></p><p>His heart pounded, as if a great calamity was imminent!</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli knew something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Checking the teleportation array on the island, he found that it had indeed been blocked and could not be activated!</p><p></p><p>A cold gleam flashed in Ji Shaoli's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Trying to activate the instant teleportation array also lost its effect.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if something had sealed off the entire space around Haixuan Island!</p><p></p><p>Although alarmed, Ji Shaoli remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Holding a withered branch, he felt the power of the earth veins flowing beneath his feet, which was not restricted.</p><p></p><p>He breathed a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>After a period of growth, Lin Ling spent all day with the Daoist child Liuli, and her strength had also improved sufficiently.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, as her spiritual nature increased day by day, her relationship with the ancient trees of the earth veins also became better.</p><p></p><p>She got this withered branch of the earth veins from them, allowing any holder to travel through the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>With a means of escape, Ji Shaoli did not leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see who was trying to harm him.</p><p></p><p>Being able to shut down the two-way teleportation array of Wanxian Island, and all the connections he had spent a lot of contribution points to maintain were of no use at all...</p><p></p><p>Everything indicated the strength of the enemy.</p><p></p><p>It was definitely not something the Xiang family, a mere local snake, could do.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was not afraid of being exposed, as long as he could figure out the reason for the failure.</p><p></p><p>Humming a tune, he brewed two cups of spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli waited patiently for his guest to arrive.</p><p></p><p>The members of the mutual aid society on Haixuan Island had long been sent away by him under some pretext.</p><p></p><p>He had also told Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi the specific information about the two earthly wonders he had promised them.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they could find them alive...</p><p></p><p>That would depend on their own luck.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli did not have to wait long.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the figure of a young man appeared beside Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>What made Ji Shaoli's pupils contract violently was that this young man appeared without any fluctuations in his aura.</p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was...</p><p></p><p>He had seen this young man before!</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter?!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli blurted out.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Li Fan himself, one of the cultivators who had spread the new method in the scene where Ning Yuan took the Longevity Fruit in the Fallen Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The young man was also a little surprised that Ji Shaoli called out his identity as soon as he opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>The young man stared at Ji Shaoli with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the clone only felt his thoughts and body completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>The means of escape he had prepared in advance also lost their effect!</p><p></p><p>As if his soul was being pulled out, a blurry figure was appearing on Ji Shaoli's body.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Two seven-colored divine lights suddenly surged and attacked the young man.</p><p></p><p>But as they approached the young man, they were pinched by his two fingers.</p><p></p><p>Unable to advance an inch.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." The young man looked at the seven-colored divine light in his hand, a trace of oddity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After suppressing and putting it away with a flip of his hand.</p>

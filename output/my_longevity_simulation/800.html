            <p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment the gaze locked onto the Holy Fetus Li Fan. New 69 Book Bar 87shux.com</p><p>The desire of "hunger" in the mind of the Holy Fetus Li Fan reached its peak.</p><p>Since he was "hungry", he had to eat!</p><p>Every part of the flesh and blood of the body seemed to have given birth to its own consciousness.</p><p>Wanting to endlessly devour everything around to alleviate the self-generated feeling of "hunger".</p><p>And the Holy Fetus Li Fan himself was completely occupied by his thoughts.</p><p>So it led to...</p><p>In an instant, the Holy Fetus Li Bai was like a punctured ball.</p><p>With a bang, he quickly shrank to a tiny particle in the mutual devouring.</p><p>And then completely disappeared from the world.</p><p>And his thoughts in his mind still lingered at the moment when he saw the remains of the Immortal Ruins open their eyes.</p><p>This process, if explained in plain and easy-to-understand words.</p><p>That is, the mortal body of the Holy Fetus Li Fan could not withstand the pressure of a glance from the remains of the Immortal Ruins, and vanished in an instant.</p><p>Of course, perhaps the limitation of "mortal body" can be removed.</p><p>Even if the true body at the Nascent Soul stage was here, the result would not be much better.</p><p>Cultivators, cultivators below the Longevity Realm.</p><p>The gap between them and the Immortals can be said to be as vast as the sky and the abyss. The difference is so great that it cannot be described in words.</p><p>And with the demise of the Holy Fetus Li Fan, according to reason, what will happen next in this life is to wait for the remaining time to be exhausted.</p><p>The incarnation of Li Fan, trapped in the coffin of Gu Xinghan, automatically returns to reality.</p><p>However, everything in the Immortal Ruins.</p><p>Whether it is the humanoid remains bound by dark red chains, or the [Hunger] engraved on the wilderness.New 69 Book Bar 87shux.com</p><p>They are all existences that cannot be speculated by "common sense".</p><p>The Holy Fetus created by the Sacred Blood Fetus Method improved by the Empire is a completely independent individual relative to the true body.</p><p>But it is also a clone with a [sense of the same body].</p><p>Even if the true body has fallen, this sense of the same body still spans time and space, and is maintained on the incarnation of the true body.</p><p>This connection cannot be detected by ordinary cultivators.</p><p>Even the strongest ones in the Xuanhuang Realm, the Celestial Venerables at the Longevity Realm, may not be able to discover it.</p><p>But...</p><p>In the Immortal Ruins, there is an existence called "Immortal".</p><p>Therefore, the gaze of that figure in the Immortal Ruins, with the help of this connection.</p><p>A terrifyingly powerful suction force descended.</p><p>The entire Beast Realm instantly collapsed into a black singularity.</p><p>Everything in it fell and disappeared into it.</p><p>The next moment, the scope of influence of the suction force spread to the Longevity Valley.</p><p>After more than two hundred years of development, the Medicine King Sect can now be said to be extremely prosperous.</p><p>Ten people have attained the Harmony Dao, seventy-six people have attained the Nascent Soul.</p><p>The number of those at the Nascent Soul and Golden Core stages is countless.</p><p>It is even a few points stronger than the most prosperous times in ancient times.</p><p>But at this moment, all these "great cultivators".</p><p>Liu San, Fang Zaiji, Jiang Yushan...</p><p>And so on. They all had no power to resist, and didn't even have time to react. New 69 Book Bar 87shnx.com</p><p>They all disappeared into the black singularity.</p><p>After devouring two small worlds, the black singularity was not only unsatisfied.</p><p>Instead, it expanded even more rapidly.</p><p>A black ball capable of devouring everything appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>The true world-ending catastrophe has descended.</p><p>The moment the black singularity was born, the protective energy charging progress of Li Fan's incarnation instantly plummeted, almost returning to zero in an instant.</p><p>If it were Li Fan's true body here, he would probably be the same as the other buried cultivators.</p><p>He might not have enough reaction speed to activate [Return to Reality] in time.</p><p>Fortunately,</p><p>Yes, at this time it was Huan Zhen who took the initiative.</p><p>But unlike before, after Huan Zhen was activated, the surrounding scene did not immediately become blurred.</p><p>Instead, it entered an extremely peculiar state.</p><p>Outside of Huan Zhen, it was pitch black, forming a circular domain.</p><p>It seemed as if someone let out an earth-shattering roar of anger, trying to stop the black sphere from devouring everything at will.</p><p>It seemed as if there was a sky-supporting rotten tree, appearing in the sky, accompanied by mad laughter: "Everyone must die! That's right, everyone must die!"</p><p>It seemed as if two crisscrossing rays of light instantly swept across the Xuanhuang Realm that was about to disappear, then broke through the void and shot towards the endless emptiness outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>It seemed as if countless cultivators looked at the black sun rising in the sky with shock and despair, waiting for death.</p><p>...</p><p>The scenes changed faster and faster.</p><p>In the end, it completely sank into darkness.</p><p>And then...</p><p>A dazzling silver light suddenly burst out from the black domain of Huan Zhen.</p><p>Anchored for 1 year.</p><p>Jielishan Peak!</p><p>Li Fan, who was at the middle stage of Golden Core, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>His eyes were scarlet red, like a beast!</p><p>Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!</p><p>An endless sense of hunger filled his mind, making him almost instantly lose his sanity.</p><p>He was so hungry.</p><p>He desperately wanted to stuff everything in his sight into his stomach.</p><p>He roughly smashed the wooden bed under him and then swallowed it into his stomach like a whale sucking in water.</p><p>But the hunger did not ease in the slightest.</p><p>Instead, it became even more intense!</p><p>A strong sense of crisis suddenly surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p>If this continued, dominated by the sense of hunger, then what might await him was the fate of complete destruction.</p><p>You should know that now Huan Zhen has not yet been fully charged, and he no longer has the chance to start over!</p><p>Seizing this moment when reason prevailed, Li Fan glanced at the Huan Zhen panel.</p><p>So he silently operated it.</p><p>After going through thousands of catastrophes, the immortal heart remains unchanged!</p><p>The Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Chant, although it would not weaken the effect of "Hunger".</p><p>But it could make Li Fan maintain the clarity of his mind.</p><p>Not to the point of becoming a monster that only knew to devour everything.</p><p>With the Immortal Heart Chant operating to the extreme, resisting the endless hunger.</p><p>Although he could keep his life, the price was torture as if in the Avici Hell.</p><p>For a full eight years, Li Fan was forced to stay at Jielishan Peak, struggling hard against the sense of hunger.</p><p>He didn't even notice when Huan Zhen had already finished charging in the 6th anchored year.</p><p>"Eight years have passed. This hunger shows no signs of weakening at all."</p><p>A trace of determination flashed in Li Fan's eyes, which now looked like a crazy beast.</p><p>He first looked at the prompt that had existed in Huan Zhen for a long time.</p><p>[This simulation has ended]</p><p>[You can choose one of the following options to retain:</p><p>An item you possessed in this simulation.</p><p>Your cultivation realm in this simulation. </p><p>The simulated memory of a person closely related to you in this simulation. This memory can be inherited by that person.</p><p>Give up the above choices to speed up the charging progress.]</p><p>Without hesitation, he chose the first option.</p><p>Then, an item called "Final Separation Disc" appeared in Huan Zhen's storage space.</p><p>"Huan Zhen!" Li Fan called out again.</p><p>"Do you want to virtualize the current scene and return to the set anchor point." Huan Zhen's prompt sounded in a timely manner.</p><p>Li Fan decisively chose yes.</p><p>The next moment, the scene of Jielishan Peak became illusory again.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>There will be another chapter later, just two chapters for today.</p>

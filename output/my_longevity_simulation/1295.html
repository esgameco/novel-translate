        <div class="content">
            <p>Sun Tian Ci's eyes flashed with a hint of reluctance. </p><p></p><p>"But isn't this harming others to benefit oneself? If I cultivate slowly, I should be able to achieve the same effect, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mock Sun Tian Ci's inflexibility, but slowly explained: "The way of heaven is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient. The cultivation method I'm teaching you is in harmony with the Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, how could it have such miraculous effects?"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators borrow the spirit of heaven and earth to achieve Dao convergence. They are truly thieves of heaven. Returning the treasure to its owner, is this good or evil?"</p><p></p><p>"From the perspective of cultivators, your actions are unforgivable evil; but from the perspective of the Profound Yellow heaven and earth, you are undoubtedly a person of great merit to heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Each word seemed to contain some ultimate principle of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As Sun Tian Ci listened to Li Fan's words, the hesitation in his eyes gradually turned into determination.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, what Li Fan showed Wu Ning Lu contained both truth and falsehood.</p><p></p><p>Although Sun Tian Ci had extraordinary talent, how could he so easily convert the cultivation of other Dao-converged cultivators without the guidance of a famous teacher?</p><p></p><p>"Born with Dao convergence, the starting point is already higher than the vast majority of cultivators in the world. And with my help..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at Sun Tian Ci, looking at the subtle aura gathering on his body, and thought to himself: "Soon. When his strength grows a bit more and his connection with the Profound Yellow Realm deepens a bit more, he can go to the Fallen Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>In addition to seeing him as a chess piece to regulate the war between the Immortal Alliance and the Holy Dynasty in the future, more importantly, Li Fan spared no effort in cultivating Sun Tian Ci to let him inherit the position of [Profound Yellow Great Celestial Venerate].</p><p></p><p>When creating the Holy Emperor's avatar, Li Fan severed all memories related to the Fallen Immortal Realm and the Profound Yellow Great Celestial Venerate's trial.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Holy Emperor never had any intention of going to the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>He slowly gained the recognition of the Profound Yellow Realm entirely through his own practical actions that were beneficial to the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the position of [Profound Yellow Great Celestial Venerate], in addition to the recognition of Profound Yellow, more importantly, had to go through the inheritance ceremony.</p><p></p><p>This was a means of control that had been vaguely passed down since the opening of Profound Yellow, and did not change with the will of the Profound Yellow Realm's Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even if the inheritance was temporarily cut off now, it was still deeply hidden in the depths of the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a true Profound Yellow Great Celestial Venerate, in addition to being able to mobilize the power of the Profound Yellow Realm to the greatest extent, it was also possible to inherit the memories and legacy of the previous generations of Great Celestial Venerates.</p><p></p><p>The so-called throwing a stone to test the way.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not interested in becoming the Profound Yellow Great Celestial Venerate, but he valued the secrets of the Profound Yellow Realm and the immortal artifacts that might have survived.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the scene of the final trial he experienced in the Fallen Immortal Realm appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"The vast immortal spirit power extracted by detonating nine immortal artifacts. The power to destroy heaven and earth is enough to cross the high walls."</p><p></p><p>"There are still four immortal artifacts remaining, including the [Great Sun Golden Bell]. Those are genuine [immortal artifacts] that have been passed down from ancient times."</p><p></p><p>Having glimpsed three parts of the [Profound Primordial Spirit Grand Formation] and successfully reproducing part of its might, Li Fan was very clear about how powerful the strength of the true immortal realm was. The same was true for immortal formations and immortal artifacts.</p><p></p><p>These were great weapons that could completely turn the tide of the war, and even the capital for him to explore outside the high walls in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. White may have been concerned about the safety of the Profound Yellow Realm and never used the power of these immortal artifacts to fight against the Dharma Fire. But I don't care..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the premise is to gain the recognition of the immortal artifacts."</p><p></p><p>"The immortal artifacts left by the Great Celestial Venerate should have many restrictions."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci's cultivation did not last long before it was interrupted by a sudden change.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a servant of the Sun family came to report in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"The exit of the Sun family is blocked by someone? They are calling me out by name to challenge me?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci, who was awakened, looked a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>The Sun family servant answered with a mournful face: "Yes, young master. Those who tried to force their way out were all beaten up by the other party and thrown back."</p><p></p><p>"It has been going on for more than ten days. The family head is busy with urgent matters and can't spare time. We really have no choice, so we had to disturb your seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party's extremely frightened appearance, Sun Tian Ci couldn't help but comfort him: "It's alright, take me to have a look."</p><p></p><p>For Sun Tian Ci, comprehending the Dao and cultivating was as simple as eating and drinking. Occasionally being interrupted once in a while was fine, he could just continue next time. Naturally, there was nothing worth getting angry about.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived outside the Sun family's cave abode, Sun Tian Ci saw the person blocking the door.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a child about the same size as him, also five or six years old in appearance.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in purple clothes, with pure eyes...</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps a little dull and foolish.</p><p></p><p>"You... fight." The child pointed at Sun Tian Ci and said concisely.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci immediately shook his head: "No."</p><p></p><p>Hearing his request being rejected, the child's eyes narrowed instantly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci kindly reminded: "You are only at the Nascent Soul realm, you definitely won't be a match for me. I don't bully the weak."</p><p></p><p>These words were said very sincerely, and the murderous aura surging from the child slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci heard the whispers of the Sun family members beside him: "Tian Ci, don't be careless. We have investigated, this little kid is not simple. He is obsessed with martial arts and has terrifying strength. Although he is only at the Nascent Soul realm, he can defeat Primordial Spirit cultivators with a wave of his hand..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this person's background is mysterious, and the Immortal Alliance officials seem to ignore him. People call him [Martial Idiot Child]."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci nodded to the people in the family, indicating that he already knew.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he looked at the Martial Idiot Child and said seriously: "Although the Nascent Soul realm can defeat Primordial Spirit, the difference between Primordial Spirit and Dao Convergence is like the difference between heaven and earth. You have no chance of winning."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I'll hurt you if I make a heavy move."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Idiot Child shook his head, disagreeing with Sun Tian Ci's view: "The outcome of a battle has nothing to do with the realm."</p><p></p><p>"Fight!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the burning fighting intent in the other party's eyes, Sun Tian Ci couldn't help but feel a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he knew that this battle was unavoidable, so he could only take him to the Sun family's martial arts arena.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sun family was a newly rising aristocratic family, and the appearance of their cave abode looked ordinary, it actually had its own world inside. The various functional buildings of the cave abode were built no less inferior to those of the aristocratic families that had inherited for thousands of years in the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>For example, this martial arts arena was built on a piece of ancient fallen immortal's bones that was collected at a high price. It could easily withstand the attacks of Dao Convergence cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Inside the martial arts arena, the two children, Sun Tian Ci and the Martial Idiot Child, stood opposite each other with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were even more nervous to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci was now the most precious existence of the Sun family. Although his realm was overwhelming, if he was injured a little, all the Sun family members present who did not stop the competition today would be severely punished.</p><p></p><p>"Please!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Idiot Child shouted, and in the next moment, a silver spear tore through the air and stopped stabbing at Sun Tian Ci's face.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!" Sun Tian Ci was a little surprised, but that was all.</p><p></p><p>The attack of a Nascent Soul couldn't even shake his defense.</p><p></p><p>The spear melted like ice in water and automatically disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" However, after resolving the other party's attack, Sun Tian Ci was surprised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>While he was stunned, the space in front of him rippled like water. Then, the silver spear appeared again like a flying fish jumping out of the sea, and stabbed straight at Sun Tian Ci's body.</p><p></p><p>"Martial!" The Martial Idiot Child shouted at the same time.</p><p></p><p>On the body of the spear, silver light flowed. In an instant, it split into seventeen other weapons, surrounding Sun Tian Ci in the center.</p><p></p><p>Swords, spears, sabers, halberds, axes, hooks...</p><p></p><p>It was as if there were eighteen different cultivators wielding them, performing different moves at the same time.</p><p></p><p>They all chopped down.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci's body was completely enveloped by a violent silver light explosion.</p><p></p><p>"Young master!"</p><p></p><p>"Tian Ci!"</p><p></p><p>The Sun family members present exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>"No need to panic, this level of momentum can't hurt Ci'er." Sun Lu Yuan's voice rang out, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the Sun family's prodigy was competing with someone, Sun Lu Yuan, who arrived late, stared at the battle in the martial arts arena.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Idiot Child naturally understood that his attack would not work in one move.</p><p></p><p>The moment the silver light enveloped Sun Tian Ci, he had already flashed up and launched continuous attacks.</p><p></p><p>There were weapons of warriors hurting people, magic treasures of cultivators taking shape, unexpected fists and feet, and even the power of heaven and earth anomalies representing Dao Convergence cultivators...</p><p></p><p>The martial arts arena kept rumbling and shaking. It looked precarious, and the protection seemed like it could shatter at any time.</p><p></p><p>Sun Lu Yuan's face was solemn as he cast spells to reinforce it.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Tian Ci, who was praised as the most talented person in the Myriad Immortal Alliance in a hundred years, could only be forced to defend and looked miserable.</p><p></p><p>In fact, none of the people present could understand the shock in Sun Tian Ci's heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that the profound method given to him by his master, which could dissolve the attacks of cultivators and return them to heaven and earth, lost its effect when facing this Martial Idiot Child in front of him!</p><p></p><p>"How could this be? Could it be because his realm is too low? The techniques used against Dao Convergence have little effect on him instead?"</p><p></p><p>Since birth, he had been cultivating. Although he had a lot of battle experience in his master's illusions and against Dao Convergence cultivators of the Immortal Alliance, this was the first time he encountered a situation where his killer move was completely ineffective.</p><p></p><p>The young Sun Tian Ci couldn't help but feel a little flustered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But he was extraordinary after all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although the Martial Idiot Child's attacks were fierce, he was ultimately two major realms lower than Sun Tian Ci.</p><p></p><p>In the process of being crazily beaten, Sun Tian Ci gradually adapted to the other party's attacks and slowly saw some clues.</p><p></p><p>"No! It's not that the method has lost its effect! Just like the previous Dao Convergence cultivators, after the Martial Idiot Child's moves are performed and resolved by me, his own aura still decreases for a short time. But..."</p><p></p><p>"What he lost was quickly replenished from heaven and earth?!"</p><p></p><p>Understanding this point, Sun Tian Ci was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that his method was not as simple as the consumption of spiritual energy. It was to strip the cultivator's origin and foundation and scatter it back to the Profound Yellow heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, the performance of this Martial Idiot Child in the martial arts arena at this moment was to compete with him while continuously absorbing the power of origin from the Profound Yellow heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"It completely violates the new method created by the Celestial Venerate?!"</p><p></p><p>No wonder Sun Tian Ci was so shocked. The behavior of this Martial Idiot Child was equivalent to him devouring the Profound Yellow cave heaven, the change of birth, and the spirit of heaven and earth at all times...</p><p></p><p>In Sun Tian Ci's perception, this was something that was completely impossible to happen.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci, who was momentarily distracted due to comprehending the mystery, was caught by the Martial Idiot Child. His technique broke through the defense and directly bombarded Sun Tian Ci's body.</p><p></p><p>Spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, Sun Tian Ci's eyes flashed with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>A flowing white light aura appeared on his body, instantly forcing back the Martial Idiot Child's technique.</p><p></p><p>It was Sun Tian Ci's spirit of heaven and earth, the White Silk.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the White Silk, after Li Fan's training and Sun Tian Ci's years of cultivation, had a qualitative difference from when it first descended.</p><p></p><p>"To force me to this point..."</p><p></p><p>"Master was right, there are so many geniuses in the world, I'm nothing special."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tian Ci's mood gradually calmed down, and the white light surrounded him, resolving the Martial Idiot Child's attacks one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Don't investigate the cause, follow the method to attack!"</p><p></p><p>His master's teachings flashed through Sun Tian Ci's mind.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't figure out the reason why this Martial Idiot Child can absorb the Profound Yellow origin at all times, then I won't bother with it!"</p><p></p><p>"Strike at his foundation and directly sever his connection with the Profound Yellow Realm!"</p><p></p><p>A bright light flashed in Sun Tian Ci's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The illusory White Silk, like a tornado, whizzed rapidly, wrapping around Sun Tian Ci's body.</p><p></p><p>In the vortex of white light, he floated up into the air.</p><p></p><p>One hand pointed to the sky, the other pointed at Wu Chi'er.</p><p></p><p>He let out a low shout.</p><p></p><p>Wu Chi'er's smooth attacks were forced to pause slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he simply stopped his offensive altogether, looking at Sun Tianci in the air with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>The two fingers were like a pair of scissors.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily severing his connection with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented feeling of weakness welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The soul of heaven and earth, born as a human?"</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of realization flashed in Sun Tianci's mind.</p><p></p><p>But the movement of his fingers did not stop.</p><p></p><p>He completely occupied the perception of the Dao in this space through his own method of communicating with the Xuanhuang Dao.</p><p></p><p>Briefly excluding Wu Chi'er.</p><p></p><p>It was destined not to last long.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress!" Sun Tianci, suspended high in the air, pressed down hard with the finger pointing at Wu Chi'er.</p><p></p><p>Endless white silk light, like surging rivers, gathered within.</p><p></p><p>A huge phantom finger formed a solid body, like a towering mountain, pressing down from above.</p><p></p><p>The space around Wu Chi'er was sealed by this great power, and his body could not move.</p><p></p><p>As the suppressing finger fell, the violent rumbling sound accompanied by the howling sound of space being ground into cracks resounded throughout the entire martial arts field.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci's expression was neither sad nor happy.</p><p></p><p>And under the suppressing finger, Wu Chi'er also had an expressionless face.</p><p></p><p>There was not a hint of fear in his eyes, but rather a pensive look.</p><p></p><p>Just as the suppressing finger was about to hit, he actually imitated Sun Tianci's style and pointed a finger towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The purple clothes on his body turned into vast purple Qi and surged into it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the suppressing finger performed by Sun Tianci, the momentum seemed much smaller. But it seemed more condensed and sacred.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Wu Chi'er's face had the joy of enlightenment and the solemnity of performing the ultimate technique.</p><p></p><p>One purple and one white, one rising from the earth and one falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>They collided fiercely near the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The dazzling light instantly engulfed everything.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" Sun Luyuan's expression changed slightly, and he waved his sleeve very decisively, wrapping up the Sun family members who were watching the battle, and flashed away.</p><p></p><p>Facts proved that Sun Luyuan's choice was very wise. The impact caused by the collision of the suppressing fingers completely engulfed the entire martial arts field.</p><p></p><p>And then it continued to spread to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The protective formation carefully arranged by the Sun family was like paper in the face of this terrifying might, and it shattered one after another.</p><p></p><p>The vast power swept through until more than half of the Sun family's cave was engulfed by it.</p><p></p><p>The two Dao-merging members of the Sun family cast spells together to contain it.</p><p></p><p>The aftermath of the explosion finally slowly came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the devastated Sun family's cave, Sun Luyuan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Sun Tianci's still strong aura made him feel slightly at ease.</p><p></p><p>After the turmoil dissipated, he came to the original martial arts field, which was now only an empty space.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that Wu Chi'er had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Sun family's Qilin child stood motionless, as if comprehending something with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Strictly ordering others not to disturb him, Sun Luyuan personally guarded him.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the ruins after the great battle around him, a feeling of powerlessness suddenly arose in Sun Luyuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Even though they are both at the Dao-merging stage, the gap is actually so big."</p><p></p><p>"What's more terrifying is that Tian'er is only five years old. In the future..."</p><p></p><p>A word that he had never thought of before suddenly appeared in Sun Luyuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"How many years has it been since Xuanhuang Realm last produced a Trueborn Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"With Tian'er's talent, it's possible, it's possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Especially in the upcoming great change. When heroes gather in troubled times..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan, who had been a Dao-merging cultivator for more than 500 years, couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>He could only tightly close his eyes, for fear that his thoughts would be seen through by others.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Sun Tianci's consciousness, this Dao-merging child was in constant self-blame.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't mean to kill him."</p><p></p><p>"But the technique was already formed, and he also counterattacked with the Suppressing Finger Technique..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci was extremely remorseful.</p><p></p><p>But he was interrupted by Li Fan's cold rebuke: "Fool! How could such an existence be easily killed by you?"</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured. Even if your entire Sun family is wiped out, he will not disappear."</p><p></p><p>Not caring about his master's vicious words, after hearing that Wu Chi'er had not actually perished, Sun Tianci was somewhat pleasantly surprised and broke free from his remorse.</p><p></p><p>"Master, who exactly is that Wu Chi'er?"</p><p></p><p>"Is he the soul of heaven and earth, born as a human?" Sun Tianci couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted lightly: "You still have some discerning eyes."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan actually had more to say.</p><p></p><p>"This reincarnation method of Zhang Qianmo does have some tricks."</p><p></p><p>"The body of the Great Vow to Eliminate Demons, merged into the basic laws of Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"And this body of Wu Chi'er..."</p><p></p><p>In the previous few reincarnations, although Li Fan had seen Wu Chi'er, he did not have enough insight to explore the mysteries behind it.</p><p></p><p>But the many major gains in this life, the increasingly close connection with the Xuanhuang Dao, and even several rounds of comprehension in the Starry Sea, gave him enough ability to see through the essence of Zhang Qianmo's reincarnated body.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Qianmo once made three great vows. One was to eliminate all demons in the world, one was to replace the Ten Immortal Sects, and one was to collect all the cultivation techniques and share them with cultivators all over the world."</p><p></p><p>"Eliminating demons can be called 'Execution'."</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivation world, the strong are respected. Replacing the Ten Immortal Sects can be called 'Martial'."</p><p></p><p>"Sharing cultivation techniques so that people all over the world can cultivate can be called 'Literary'."</p><p></p><p>"The sages of ancient times attained the Dao and the world changed. They ascended in broad daylight and benefited later generations. This is an ancient and supreme method that can prove the true immortal way..."</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the hope of fulfilling each vow is extremely slim, the reincarnated body is like my simulation, able to infinitely amplify the probability of success."</p><p></p><p>"If the immortal way still existed, Zhang Qianmo might be able to truly achieve the three great vows and attain the realm of true immortality through this method."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "As time passed, the immortal path was severed and the world is in imminent danger. This method..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not the fault of the techniques. It's the change of the Great Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"But compared to those cultivators from the same era who have long been reduced to ashes, Senior Brother Zhang's method is still much stronger. Even if Xuanhuang Realm can really survive the disaster in the future and the immortal way reopens..."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Qianmo might really be able to reach the realm of true immortality."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but imagine the future: "Although this process is a bit long, if one can prove the true immortal way, then nothing else matters."</p><p></p><p>Thinking for a moment, Li Fan's thoughts returned to the present: "It's not easy for Xuanhuang Realm to become the last surviving place in the entire Starry Sea, and for Zhang Qianmo's great vow ascension method to proceed to the second step. If Diyi hadn't taken the initiative to lead the chiefs away, I'm afraid this step would have taken him thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"And now, this second step..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched the battle between Zhang Qianmo's reincarnated body and Sun Tianci from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he also saw how that Wu Chi'er appeared as if the soul of heaven and earth was born.</p><p></p><p>"This great vow ascension method really relies on the feedback power after the world's sublimation..."</p><p></p><p>"Attaching to the world is completely opposite to the current Celestial Venerable's new method."</p><p></p><p>"It can also be regarded as a parasite, but the new method only knows how to devour and seize. This great vow ascension method, however, is beneficial to the world."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Xuanhuang Dao is almost willing to support it unconditionally. After all, in this world, those willing to stand on the side of the Xuanhuang Dao are few and far between."</p><p></p><p>"The method is wonderful. But without the prospect of ascension, it's ultimately not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, it's far inferior to directly becoming the 'Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable'."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's thoughts surged, Sun Tianci, who had learned that Wu Chi'er was not dead and had become relieved, began to sort out the gains from this battle.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he encountered an existence of similar age and evenly matched in actual combat, and he couldn't help but feel a little excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Suppressing Finger Technique taught by Master to have such great power."</p><p></p><p>"I have comprehended less than a third of it. If I fully release it..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci's fingers drew in the void, immersed in the extremely profound shape of the talisman.</p><p></p><p>This Suppressing Finger Technique was naturally not a real "True Immortal Seal Character".</p><p></p><p>It was just the remnant characters that Li Fan comprehended through the research of the Profound Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>However, even such an imperfect existence was still an unimaginably terrifying divine ability for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "stones from other hills may serve to polish the jade", Li Fan taught the half-comprehended "Suppressing Finger Technique" to Sun Tianci to see what this Xuanhuang prodigy could comprehend from it.</p><p></p><p>He could also use it as a reference.</p><p></p><p>Although the details of the battle between Wu Chi'er and Sun Tianci were ordered to be kept secret by Sun Luyuan,</p><p></p><p>The miserable state of the Sun family's cave after the battle could not be hidden from the world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the reputation of the Sun family's Qilin child became more and more resounding.</p><p></p><p>Even many warlike Dao-merging cultivators began to take the initiative to seek him out and request to spar.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci, however, was more than happy to oblige and refused no one.</p><p></p><p>After constant battles, his combat ability rapidly improved.</p><p></p><p>And after accumulating a total of converting a portion of the soul of heaven and earth from thirty Dao-merging cultivators back to the Xuanhuang Dao,</p><p></p><p>The accumulated power exceeded that of a complete Dao-merging cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Quantitative change finally accumulated into qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Sun Tianci stood in a daze, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Standing motionless, tears actually flowed from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang..."</p><p></p><p>He murmured in a low voice, his expression full of grief.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a gust of clear wind blew over his body, constantly swirling.</p><p></p><p>An aura that Li Fan was very familiar with quietly descended upon Sun Tianci.</p><p></p><p>"Has the condition finally been met?"</p><p></p><p>"After gaining the support of the Sage Emperor, the requirements of the Xuanhuang Dao have become much higher."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, simply slaughtering a few cultivators of the new method could achieve a similar effect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly said in his heart while observing from the side.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's not yet time for him to accept the Great Celestial Venerable's trial."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly noticed that the attention of the Xuanhuang Dao on Sun Tianci's body was different from that on the Sage Emperor's body.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because Li Fan was hidden in Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, the Xuanhuang Dao showed a little vigilance and suspicion while being close.</p><p></p><p>This emotion was so subtle that even Sun Tianci himself did not notice it, still immersed in the supreme joy of contacting the Xuanhuang Dao.</p><p></p><p>Only Li Fan, who had personally experienced the true closeness of the Dao with the Sage Emperor's body, could perceive the difference.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking carefully, perhaps only that matter has the highest efficiency."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not feel angry at the reaction of the Xuanhuang Dao.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he had already begun to think about countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to take it, you must first give it."</p><p></p><p>"Let you taste a little sweetness first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly in his heart and waited for Sun Tianci to wake up from his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after three days, Sun Tianci reported the good news to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's words made him a little surprised: "Master, aren't we going to find Dao-merging cultivators to spar anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"I feel it's very effective."</p><p></p><p>"Too slow! Too slow! I could lose my soul at any time, I can't wait that long."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly and directly injected the information into Sun Tianci's mind.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci couldn't help but widen his eyes: "Master, this is a felony of the Immortal Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a problem myself, but if it implicates the family..."</p><p></p><p>After understanding his master's plan, Sun Tianci couldn't help but hesitate.</p>

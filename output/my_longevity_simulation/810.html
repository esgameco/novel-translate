            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lingmu Realm. New 69 Bookstore 85shux.com"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tian Yang stood in the sky, their divine consciousness slowly sweeping over this small world.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but sigh at the wonders of creation.</p><p></p><p>This was a small world without cultivators or humans.</p><p></p><p>Only a kind of tree people born from spirit wood existed here.</p><p></p><p>In fact, according to the information released by the Wanxian Alliance 115 generations later.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, this Lingmu Realm was still a desolate small world without any living creatures.</p><p></p><p>However, as a spirit tree took root and sprouted here.</p><p></p><p>The small world also slowly became vibrant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the towering giant tree not far away, as well as the tree people living and settling on it, and a trace of regret flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that this tree is already bound to this small world and cannot be transplanted. Otherwise, just by cutting down its branches and planting them in other small worlds. The problem of lack of spiritual energy could be solved once and for all."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Fan's naked and undisguised malice attracted the attention of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>The thousand-zhang giant tree suddenly moved without wind.</p><p></p><p>As the branches swayed, thousands of tree people flew towards Li Fan like locusts, darkening the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly: "You're really seeking your own death!"</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing his senior brother's summons, the listless Tian Yang didn't understand his meaning and looked at him with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>Then, seeing Tian Yang's innocent look, he had no choice but to point to the attacking army of tree people. New 69 Bookstore 85shux.com</p><p></p><p>Only then did Tian Yang react.</p><p></p><p>Letting out an angry roar, Tian Yang's body instantly expanded to the same size as the spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>His whole body emitted black flames, instantly burning any tree people who dared to approach to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Take it easy, don't hurt our little saplings!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan hurriedly transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>This battle could almost be said to have no suspense at all.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Lingmu Realm tree people only had cultivation equivalent to Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment tree people were one in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Golden Core tree people were already considered elder-level existences among the tree people race.</p><p></p><p>The strongest among the tree people, the Tree People Patriarch, could communicate with the spirit tree itself and was almost invincible in this realm.</p><p></p><p>But even he was only at the Nascent Soul stage in battle power.</p><p></p><p>After nearly half of the tree people were injured, they had no choice but to surrender.</p><p></p><p>The Tree People Patriarch looked quite delicate and was obviously different from the rough appearance of other tree people.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal, please be merciful!"</p><p></p><p>It sounded rather miserable, and surprisingly, it was a female voice.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not moved at all: "Submit! Or die!"</p><p></p><p>The Tree People Patriarch bowed: "We are willing to surrender."</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the Spirit Wood Heart, and your race will be spared. Don't make me do it myself, or this realm will once again turn into a scorched earth." Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Tree People Patriarch's body trembled slightly. New 69 Bookstore â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand why this cultivator, who was clearly visiting for the first time, already knew about the existence of the [Spirit Wood Heart].</p><p></p><p>But things had come to this point, and she no longer had any room for choice.</p><p></p><p>She spat out a ball of green light from her mouth, which slowly flew into Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly refining it, Li Fan vaguely felt that the spirit tree in this world had already become a part of his body.</p><p></p><p>And the life and death of these tree people born from the spirit tree were also at his whim.</p><p></p><p>The Lingmu Realm thus belonged to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Cross-level combat power, mere trees were no match at all.</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan had already arrived at the center of the Spirit Tree.</p><p></p><p>There existed a huge cavity here.</p><p></p><p>Countless roots, from various parts of the Spirit Wood Realm, converged here.</p><p></p><p>And the innumerable branches of the Spirit Wood also all originated from this place.</p><p></p><p>Branches and roots were like the tentacles and eyes of the Spirit Wood.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the Spirit Wood to sense anything that happened in this small world.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the change of ownership of the Spirit Wood's heart,</p><p></p><p>These effects had all been transferred to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Spirit Tree, he sensed every detail of the small world.</p><p></p><p>"It's the same trick as Little Black occupying the Heavenly Dao of the Beast Realm."</p><p></p><p>"But this world can recover its vitality, and this Spirit Tree also has some credit. So comparatively, it will be a bit simpler."</p><p></p><p>"Just the right time to try out the [Heavenly Transformation] divine ability."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>As his mind willed, mountains and rivers suddenly appeared on the land of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan freely reshaped this world, just as Mr. White had done before in his own cave heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, after only half a day, Li Fan's world-transforming actions were forcibly halted.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the power of the Spirit Tree itself could not withstand Li Fan's such squandering. It needed to rest and adjust for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Boring."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, his figure flashed, and he came to the top of the Spirit Tree.</p><p></p><p>Overlooking the land of the Spirit Wood Realm, a magnificent and vast formation appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Perfectly integrated with the world itself, without the slightest flaw.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this formation was changing and progressing every moment.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Law."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the instant just now, relying on the vast computing power of the [Final Separation Disc], he instantly designed in his mind a grand formation tailored for the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The core idea, however, came from the Infinite Law of Zhang Zhiliang, the first formation master of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of the [Final Separation Disc], the last piece of the puzzle for his envisioned Infinite Law was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>A formation that would always evolve and have no limit.</p><p></p><p>It would be the nightmare of all formation masters.</p><p></p><p>"If the grand formation is completed, all ordinary methods of breaking formations will be useless."</p><p></p><p>"It can only be forcibly solved by brute force."</p><p></p><p>"With the scale of the Infinite Law Formation covering the Spirit Wood Realm, it's impossible to do without five or six Harmonious Dao realm experts."</p><p></p><p>"If some rare materials are used to further strengthen the formation, and Harmonious Dao realm combat power is deployed at key formation nodes..."</p><p></p><p>The virtual formation diagram in Li Fan's eyes slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"As a protective grand formation for the headquarters of the Myriad Realms United Association, it's impressive enough."</p><p></p><p>"What's lacking now are the resources needed to build the formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately thought of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>At this point in time, the Five Elders Council still had various ideas about the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Restless and eager to act.</p><p></p><p>And in Li Fan's hands, there was too much information that they were interested in and could be used for mutual exchange.</p><p></p><p>The only thing to consider was, in this life, who to contact.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang's superior, or Tianliang Wangpo.</p><p></p><p>Or...</p><p></p><p>Figures flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>These originally absolute secrets all turned into bargaining chips in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, Li Fan had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>Although the many previous cycles were said to be evenly matched, the performance of the Five Elders Council was really a bit sloppy.</p><p></p><p>"Let me help you with all my strength."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how deep the foundation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance really is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were deep.</p>

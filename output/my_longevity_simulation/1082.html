        <h1>Chapter 1082</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Seeing Lu Ya's deep conviction in his own conclusion, Xu Ke hesitated for a moment before slowly saying, "I once heard someone say that sometimes, even if you see something with your own eyes, it may not necessarily be the truth."</p><p></p><p>"Also, when judging a person's character, don't look at what they say, but look at what they do."</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know what the situation is with that basement, Mr. Bai has always been especially kind to us. Without his help, we might have starved to death long ago. So, I'm always willing to believe that Mr. Bai is truly a great person."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke organized his language as he spoke slowly. This long-winded speech took quite a while to finish.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya smiled sarcastically and patted Xu Ke's head, "You little kid, you read a few books and start lecturing me? And in such a pompous manner."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not an unreasonable person. I know what I'm doing. It's just..." Lu Ya seemed to see that eerie and strange faceless statue again, and his heart couldn't help but feel a few more pounds heavier.</p><p></p><p>After that, Lu Ya chatted with Xu Ke for a while longer. After seemingly receiving a message from someone, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xuanniao, how did I do?" At this time, Xu Ke finally asked Li Fan for credit in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Just average. You still need to work harder in the future." Li Fan responded very flatly, and Xu Ke instantly felt a bit discouraged.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in this era, the remnants of the Faceless Immortal's power are much stronger than thousands of years later. That Lu Ya, just from seeing it once, has already been tainted by its aura and fallen into the Immortal's web, unable to escape."</p><p></p><p>As the current world's agent of the Faceless Immortal Xuanhuang, there is probably no one who understands the nature of His power better than Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In the previous illusion he experienced, Li Fan was not qualified to perceive it. But now, he could see at a glance the most fundamental reason why Lu Ya's attitude towards Mr. Bai had changed greatly, which was still due to the influence of the Faceless Immortal's stone statue.</p><p></p><p>All living beings have an instinctive fear of unknown powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Just like a butterfly caught in a spider's web, unable to break free, although it has not yet seen the arrival of the predator, it has already sensed its future fate and become fearful.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya is in this state now.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he subconsciously tied and associated the Faceless Immortal's stone statue with Mr. Bai. Rather than running away and distancing himself from Mr. Bai, it's better to say he's trying to avoid the Faceless Immortal's control.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, just like the real Li Fan, ordinary methods simply cannot break free.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Mr. Bai really has anything to do with the Faceless Immortal...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not see any aura of the Faceless Immortal on Mr. Bai from that brief encounter just now. Of course, it could also be because his strength is too great and he's better at concealing it.</p><p></p><p>While pondering, Li Fan saw the still dejected Xu Ke and scratched his hair, "Your mentality still needs strengthening. If you can't even handle this little setback, how will you follow me to save the world in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xuanniao, I'm not even ten years old. Do I have to be the one to save the world?" Xu Ke said with a bitter face.</p><p></p><p>"Who told you to have a fateful connection with me." Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, get ready. Next, the Beast Taming Sect should have a mission to give</p><p></p><p>"Here you go." Li Fan prophesied again.</p><p></p><p>Having demonstrated his ability to predict the future multiple times, Xu Ke had already developed a strong faith in Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Li Fan's prediction was once again accurate.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Lu Ya brought Xu Ke to a small wooden hut outside the Demon Suppression Tower of the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>On the table inside the wooden hut, there was a wooden carving and a wooden box.</p><p></p><p>"This wooden carving is a gift left for you by Mr. Bai," Lu Ya said with a somewhat complex expression.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that something had happened to him during these three days. He spoke of Mr. Bai with much more courtesy, but Li Fan keenly sensed that the influence of the Faceless Immortal seemed to have deepened on him instead.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!" Xu Ke, who had not yet developed the ability to perceive this, excitedly ran to the table and grabbed the wooden carving.</p><p></p><p>Without caring about what the wooden carving was actually for, Xu Ke was very satisfied as long as it was a gift from Mr. Bai. Originally, he wanted to carefully put it away, but after hearing Li Fan's telepathic message, he hid it in his chest first.</p><p></p><p>"This wooden carving is indeed a good item." Li Fan stared at it intently, sensing the power of the laws condensed within it.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, anything given by Mr. Bai could not be ordinary.</p><p></p><p>This small wooden carving of Xu Ke represented counterattack.</p><p></p><p>As long as the attack did not exceed the upper limit that the wooden carving could withstand, it would be absorbed and then reflected back.</p><p></p><p>It was quite similar to the divine ability demonstrated by Shuo Feng after comprehending the Heavenly Wonder of the Wooden Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's a full-powered attack from a Harmonious Dao realm cultivator, this wooden carving can perfectly reflect it. Although the number of times is limited, it is definitely a life-saving treasure," Li Fan marveled at Mr. Bai's generosity while studying the principles of heaven and earth within the wooden carving.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Xu Ke received the task of going to the Nether Sacred Beast Mountain to deliver the red wooden box to the First Beast Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Inside this wooden box is the head of [Second Emperor Lie]. If I'm not mistaken, it should have been personally beheaded by Mr. Bai. Second Emperor Lie wandered outside, causing trouble and not returning to the demon race. Although it seems that Mr. Bai killed him, he actually handed him over to the First Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"Using this favor to exchange for the method of demon beasts devouring the void to reproduce, in order to cultivate the Void-Splitting Whales."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan went over the cause of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai is the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, yet he still cannot grasp the specific evolutionary direction of the demon beasts and has to seek out the First Beast Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the demon beasts of the Xuanhuang Realm may not be native creatures, but outsiders."</p><p></p><p>"The First Emperor realized that the great calamity of the Xuanhuang Realm was imminent and there seemed to be no possibility of escaping unscathed. So he wanted to split the realm and leave..."</p><p></p><p>The towering white mountain that seemed to be the end of the world appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"According to the First Emperor, Nether Mountain is the edge of the sky and the corner of the sea, the end of the world."</p><p></p><p>"The countless wandering energies of the Xuanhuang Realm gather here. If they are detonated using a certain special method, it may instantly unleash an extremely terrifying power approaching that of a True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Thus crossing the high walls and leaving the Abyssal Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>A thousand years later in the present world, Nether Mountain had become a huge realm-splitting whirlpool. The world's wound had not healed for thousands of years, which showed how terrifying the energy fluctuations were when Nether Mountain split the realm.</p><p></p><p>"The principle is the same as the realm-splitting divine weapons of the Heavenly Sword Sect. However, they are all just simple theories. Whether they succeeded or failed, whether they successfully escaped the Abyssal Starry Sea or have already turned into nothingness..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 906</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Ji Yuzhen say this, Xuanyuan Hong's face darkened. "Nonsense!" he said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'm not clear about the cultivation technique you practice? Although you can split your soul into myriad parts, the one that can heal my injuries must be the most essential, original soul. If you lose that, your cultivation will be greatly diminished!"</p><p></p><p>"How could I do such a thing!" </p><p></p><p>However, seeing Ji Yuzhen's face still bearing a faint smile, Xuanyuan Hong couldn't help but scold him further.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he consoled, "Zhen'er, don't worry. It's just a minor injury. I will go into seclusion to cultivate for a period of time and will naturally recover."</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen silently nodded, his gaze falling upon Xuanyuan Hong and not shifting away for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside a grand hall.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong, the Dark Heavenly King, sat at the head position while twelve Dharma Kings stood within the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Although I suffered a minor injury in the last battle against the Great Master of the Heavenly Capital, I also gained much from my opponent," Xuanyuan Hong said solemnly. </p><p></p><p>"I will be going into seclusion for a period of time. During this time, I will have to trouble all of you with matters big and small in our sect!" </p><p></p><p>"Dark Heavenly King, rest assured, there will definitely not be any mishaps!" The Dharma King named Elder Cui stroked his beard and responded.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong nodded. "If I succeed this time, I may be able to re-forge a True Immortal body in the lower realm. At that time, the plan to break free from the Darkest Star Sea will be greatly advanced!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the other twelve cultivators varied. </p><p></p><p>Some were joyous and congratulatory, some were calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>There were also those with solemn expressions, their inner thoughts inscrutable. </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a dark secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Zhen'er, I've sensed that recently there seems to be someone getting restless. That person who secretly contacted you before..." </p><p></p><p>"Go find him," Xuanyuan Hong said calmly, his tone concealing a hint of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen was slightly startled, then reacted. "Big Brother Xuanyuan, you mean to lure the snake out of its hole?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong's face was grim. "That's right! This time we'll take care of the Great Master of the Heavenly Capital together!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen's eyes lit up, somewhat excited. "Big Brother Xuanyuan, you've already made a breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen took a deep breath, suppressing the excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Good. I've been playing along with that person. I'll contact him as soon as I return."</p><p></p><p>"Mm. Be careful in all matters."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Blood filled the sky. </p><p></p><p>The death cries of countless cultivators rang out.</p><p></p><p>After receiving a message, Xuanyuan Hong's aura completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen sped towards the last place he sensed Xuanyuan Hong's aura.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed something abnormal there had drawn the attention of many other cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Not just him, but the other Dharma Kings and the many cultivators bewitched by the Great Master of the Heavenly Capital all rushed there as if by prior agreement.</p><p></p><p>Fighting while speeding along.</p><p></p><p>"Little sister, the enemy numbers are too great! Let's find Big Brother Xuanyuan first, then plan for the long term!" The young cultivator named Zhou Yangli among the twelve Dharma Kings sent a solemn mental message.</p><p></p><p>The unease in Ji Yuzhen's heart grew thicker and thicker. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, the number of cultivators harboring ill intent somewhat exceeded her expectations. But if Xuanyuan Hong was present, none of this would be an issue.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the soul light sweeping away the densely packed enemies ahead, Ji Yuzhen sped up once again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly ends here.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully reorganized it again, making sure no parts were left out.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that back then..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The surprise attack by the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao was actually intentionally orchestrated by the Mysterious Heavenly King. He wanted to lure out the unstable elements within the Mysterious Yellow Realm and eliminate them in one fell swoop."</p><p></p><p>"But for some unknown reason, at this critical moment, the Mysterious Heavenly King himself encountered a mishap."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, "If the information obtained from Ji Yuzhen's memories is true, then at that time, the Mysterious Heavenly King had already progressed further on the basis of the Half-Immortal Body. He was already invincible in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, and after his breakthrough, who could possibly be his opponent?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao? The Great Master of Tiandu? Or could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the image of that faceless stone statue flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a faint sense of horror surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This faceless divine statue was created by Xuanyuan Hong to express his gratitude for the life-saving grace of the Faceless True Immortal in the ascension passage back then."</p><p></p><p>"From the current perspective, the Mysterious Heavenly King Xuanyuan Hong is indeed a person of noble character, without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>"But as for this Faceless True Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the eyes of a True Immortal, Xuanyuan Hong with his Half-Immortal Body is no different from an ordinary mortal. He has no value to be exploited."</p><p></p><p>"But when Xuanyuan Hong condensed his True Immortal Body, everything changed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated darkly about what might have happened back then.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt it made sense.</p><p></p><p>Just like when he was in Daxuan, facing ordinary people, he was also amiable and approachable.</p><p></p><p>But when dealing with the officials of the court, he was like a tiger eyeing its prey, a completely different person.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his own experience, perhaps that Faceless True Immortal would also display different faces when facing different groups of people.</p><p></p><p>This theory also well explained why the power behind the faceless divine statue didn't seem to care much about the prayers coming from the Mysterious Yellow Realm. It just transferred them to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that even if I use the function of the faceless divine statue, it should be safe for the time being. As long as I don't display the power of an [Immortal]..."</p><p></p><p>Although he had deduced this guess, Li Fan did not lower his guard against the faceless divine statue.</p><p></p><p>After all, even that Mysterious Heavenly King might have fallen victim to this stone statue.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Fan not be wary of it?</p><p></p><p>"Ji Yuzhen's memories are incomplete. The most crucial memories, including those of when she was cultivating her techniques, are not here."</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, they are hidden away."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan surveyed the flowers floating all over this place.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heavenly King once said that after cultivating the 'Infinite Heavenly Pivot Detached Spirit Art', there is a difference between the myriad split souls and the original soul."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that what is wandering in this ring-shaped mountain are Ji Yuzhen's split souls. What I have obtained are also the memories emanating from the split souls."</p><p></p><p>"As for the original soul that holds the truly important information..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan searched this ring-shaped mountain once again, and then frowned slightly, "It's actually not here?"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, it's hidden too deeply. It's not something I can discover at my current level."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the unwilling Li Fan finally gave up helplessly.</p><p></p><p>However, this also gave Li Fan some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"With the information obtained from here, coupled with the various things I glimpsed from Mo Rubin's mind, it's enough to impersonate a member of the ancient Mysterious Heaven Sect."</p><p></p><p>"If a confrontation arises, if I'm not clear about the subtle details, I can explain it with damaged divine soul and missing memories."</p><p></p><p>"The only flaw is the inability to reproduce the techniques of the Mysterious Heaven Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the few techniques of the Mysterious Heaven Sect that Zhao Shijie had obtained in her illusion.</p>

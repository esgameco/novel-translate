        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1037: Mustard Seed Conceals Crossing Calamity</p><p></p><p>After spending nearly half a month ensuring there were no major issues with the plan to break the restrictions on the Separation Disc, Li Fan wasted no time in contacting Mo Rubin and the Avatar of Tian Xuanjing to inform them of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin studied the extremely complex formation recorded on the jade slip for a long time. After finishing, he pinched the bridge of his nose, frowning, "I can't make out anything significant. You'd better go ask the Avatar of Tian Xuanjing again."</p><p></p><p>"After all, once it's determined, it will be difficult to change again."</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading the contents of the jade slip, the human avatar of Tian Xuanjing's eyes gradually lit up. </p><p></p><p>"Marvelous, truly marvelous."</p><p></p><p>"The greatest skill appears clumsy, the simple is actually complex, directly pointing to the Great Dao..."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuanjing avatar was immersed in it for a long time, then suddenly raised his head to look at Li Fan, "Such a formation, how did you derive it?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes still revealed deep suspicion. </p><p></p><p>Obviously, the Tian Xuanjing avatar did not believe Li Fan had this ability.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, his eyes moving. Recalling his previous speculation about the incarnation of immortal weapons, he opened his mouth and said, "Me? Such a complex formation, I can't derive it."</p><p></p><p>"But each has their own expertise. Just because you and I can't do something doesn't mean others can't."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you think you, Tian Xuanjing, are the strongest in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Our Xuantian Sect used to have immortal treasures..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, his words abruptly stopping.</p><p></p><p>Tian Xuanjing stared straight at Li Fan, as if trying to see through him. </p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, he couldn't see anything from his face.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the Tian Xuanjing avatar took the initiative to speak, "Alright. No matter how you obtained this method to break the restriction, in any case, according to my judgment, it should be able to remove the prohibition on the Dharma transmission."</p><p></p><p>"However..." The Tian Xuanjing avatar suddenly changed the topic, "To ensure foolproof, we still need to verify it first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, "Verify? How to verify?"</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuanjing avatar said leisurely, "The restrictions left by the Dharma Transmission Deity Sovereign are not all used on me..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuanjing avatar paced back and forth, seeming to be thinking about something. </p><p></p><p>After a long time, he slowly said, "In order to maintain the stability of the Xuanhuang Realm, the Dharma Transmitter once cleaned up almost all the unstable factors in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I call it cleansing the Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"Those that could be eliminated were completely eliminated. Those that couldn't be eliminated..."</p><p></p><p>"Were forever sealed with restrictions."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also showed an interested expression on his face, "There was actually such a thing..."</p><p></p><p>"This was an incredible thing in itself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly nodded, recognizing the other party's statement.</p><p></p><p>You should know that even in the mortal realm, there are scenes of long-term division inevitably leading to unity, and long-term unity inevitably leading to division.</p><p></p><p>And since the Xuanhuang Realm was reborn after the great calamity, it has always been the confrontation between the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Although there were occasional frictions and wars, it was more of a means to regulate the overall number of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Behind this, there must be factors of the Dharma Transmitter secretly controlling it.</p><p></p><p>"So, where do we test the restrictions? Won't it alert the Dharma Transmitter?" As for what Tian Xuan said, these unstable factors sealed by the Dharma Transmitter, Li Fan was really</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He was so interested that he immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also considering it." The avatar of Tian Xuanjing frowned, seemingly also caught in a difficult decision.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he gave his answer.</p><p></p><p>"The sealed object cannot have too much harm. When such a transmission method was sealed back then, there was often a trace of attention left behind. Although thousands of years have passed, there's no guarantee that the attention has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"It's best if the transmission method was sealed in a fit of anger back then. It poses no actual threat to the Xuanhuang Realm and was only sealed because it angered the transmission method. To the transmission method, it's like a rat that was casually killed. After so many years, the transmission method may have long forgotten about it."</p><p></p><p>The more the avatar of Tian Xuanjing spoke, the brighter his eyes became.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he looked at Li Fan: "I wonder, have you heard of the [Du'e Sect]?"</p><p></p><p>"Du'e Sect?" Li Fan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed dramatically, revealing a hint of anger: "Isn't this one of the ten apostate sects back then? You can't be asking me to break their seal, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan directly refused with a wave of his hand: "Impossible! These traitors, I'll let them off if I don't kill them all, but you want me to go save them?"</p><p></p><p>"Humph, it seems the transmission method still has some merit. Sealing these pieces of trash for so long..."</p><p></p><p>"Transmission method, you did well!"</p><p></p><p>As if the three words "Du'e Sect" had touched Li Fan's reverse scale, his entire state suddenly became a bit unstable.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes coldly laughing, sometimes excited.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Tian Xuanjing observed Li Fan for a moment before explaining: "Hehe, you don't need to worry about this. The people of the Du'e Sect should have long been killed by the transmission method. What the transmission method sealed was just some of the arrangements left by the Du'e Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Those things have already penetrated deep into Xuanhuang and are difficult to remove. Even the transmission method cannot completely destroy them, so it could only seal them."</p><p></p><p>"They are just dead objects. If you go test the seal-breaking and succeed, as long as you don't touch the things inside, there will be no abnormalities. This is already the place I screened and felt was most suitable for early testing."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of Tian Xuanjing's avatar, the densely packed paper people that existed in the Xuanhuang Realm to monitor everything suddenly flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Du'e Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant, and finally his expression gradually stabilized: "Since that's the case, where is the Du'e Sect's seal located?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll listen to you and go try it out."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"This trip is quite dangerous, do you have any compensation?" Li Fan's eyes were burning.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Tian Xuanjing suddenly felt a bit helpless: "I haven't recovered yet for the time being. Let's talk about it after you successfully return."</p><p></p><p>"As for the location of the Du'e Sect's seal..."</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Tian Xuanjing's expression turned a bit solemn.</p><p></p><p>He broke off another finger and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a set of coordinates, why go through so much trouble? Just say it directly..." Li Fan was a bit puzzled, until he checked the contents of the finger and his words suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Hiding a mustard seed between Mount Sumeru... The transmission method actually has such means?" Li Fan's expression was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Tian Xuanjing warned: "You must strictly follow the size and position, otherwise not only will you not find the Du'e Sect's location, you may even get lost in the void."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan firmly memorized the contents recorded in the finger, then crushed it with one hand.</p><p></p><p>According to the record, the Du'e Sect was shrunk by 100,000 times by the transmission method and constantly hidden in the void of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>

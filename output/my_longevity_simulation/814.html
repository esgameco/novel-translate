            <p>Shang Tianci paused for a moment and then spoke with an air of mystery, "This purple gourd has the ability to manifest the scenes recorded in the green gourd into reality!"</p><p></p><p>"That is, if there is enough energy. New 69 Book Bar 89 shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"With my current abilities, I can at most recreate a lake with a diameter of a hundred miles."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to ascend to the Harmonious Dao, creating nine mountains with a single thought would not be a difficult task!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci's tone was filled with pride.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was indeed intrigued, "Oh? Are there any limitations to the landscapes you can manifest? How long can they exist? Can they be manifested in the Xuanhuang Small World?"</p><p></p><p>"There are no constraints whatsoever," Shang Tianci said with his head held high. "Once manifested, they can exist permanently. They are no different from real landscapes. They can be created in the main Xuanhuang realm, as well as in cave heavens and small worlds!"</p><p></p><p>"One of my companions from the [Shanhe Pavilion] had a sudden whimsical idea. He said that if I were to use the manifestation technique inside the cave heaven of a Yuan Ying stage cultivator, and the manifested landscape was larger than the cultivator's cave heaven, it would instantly cause that Yuan Ying cultivator to explode!" Shang Tianci said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>[Shanhe Pavilion] was an unofficial organization within the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Its members were all outstanding talents from various states. There was a minimum entry requirement - anyone who reached the Foundation Establishment stage after the age of twenty could no longer join.</p><p></p><p>The Shanhe Pavilion did not have many members, only around fifty.</p><p></p><p>However, they helped and benefited each other, and were exceptionally united. Regardless of family background, all those who passed the assessment to join were treated equally.</p><p></p><p>"Your companion's idea is not bad. He is a talent worth nurturing! If there's a chance, we can try to win him over to our side!" Li Fan let out a low chuckle. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"I think so too. Yan Fangzhou is already at the Hua Shen stage at such a young age. If he can join us, he will definitely be a great help!" Shang Tianci nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Hua Shen..." Li Fan's breath hitched for a moment, but he quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>He cackled strangely, "You should try to interact with him more and sound him out first. In the end, I will personally make a move."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was about to respond.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an urgent alarm sounded from the distant Taihua Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it spread throughout the entire Taihua Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>The moment the cultivators heard the alarm, the information naturally appeared in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"From this moment on, the Wanxian Alliance is entering a Class A state of war readiness."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators from the Martial Arts Halls, Garrison Academies, and Formation Strategy Halls of each state, quickly return to the Heavenly City. Await orders."</p><p></p><p>"Set up checkpoints and patrols at the borders of each state to strictly guard against villains."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, "The Wanxian Alliance has finally reacted."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci, on the other hand, had some hidden worries, "I don't know how far the situation will develop."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry. The Five Elders Council will need some time to digest after swallowing the Nine Mountains State. And the Wanxian Alliance definitely won't be able to swallow this insult and will vow to take back the Nine Mountains State."</p><p></p><p>"So for a long time to come, both sides will be wrestling in the Nine Mountains State. The possibility of war breaking out in other states is low."</p><p></p><p>"That is, if there are no other special factors. New 69 Book Bar 89 shux.com," Li Fan said, suddenly adding a sentence.</p><p></p><p>Although Shang Tianci was momentarily bewitched by Li Fan, he was still kind-hearted at a young age.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not try to comfort him, but let him ponder on his own.</p><p></p><p>"If things go as expected, the Five Elders Council should soon try to contact me according to the method I left on the jade slip."</p><p></p><p>"Let's not rush</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Let's keep them in suspense for now," Li Fan thought, pondering how to make a killing in the upcoming transaction.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>His mind became alert.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, this feeling is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, sensing his own body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he found the source of the abnormality in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The secret technique, "Zhu Xuan"!</p><p></p><p>This was a secret technique taught by Jiang Yushan of the Medicine King Sect in the 115th world, used to identify the remnants of the Xuan Tian Sect in ancient times!</p><p></p><p>In order to collect as much secret information about the Xuan Tian Sect as possible, Li Fan had been maintaining the activation state of the Zhu Xuan secret technique ever since he left the Xuan Huang Realm in this life.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he didn't have much expectation for his own luck.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, after randomly transferring with Shang Tianci, he actually encountered it by chance!</p><p></p><p>"Mount Tai Xu."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze swept around.</p><p></p><p>"One of the Ten Veins of Tai Hua, it will mysteriously collapse in the near future. From then on, it will be forgotten by the world and become the Nine Veins of Tai Hua."</p><p></p><p>"There are actually remnants of the Xuan Tian Sect here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested.</p><p></p><p>Although he already knew clearly that a Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect was sleeping at the bottom of the Purple Xiao Sect ruins.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention of capturing him for the time being.</p><p></p><p>At least not now.</p><p></p><p>As one of the most powerful forces in the ancient Xuan Tian Sect, the Dharma King's strength would definitely not be weaker than an ordinary Unified Dao realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had been sleeping for thousands of years, Li Fan probably wouldn't be able to handle him at present.</p><p></p><p>If the capture was unsuccessful and he was forced to return...</p><p></p><p>It's better to do things steadily.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, that person is there and won't run away.</p><p></p><p>After the Medicine King Cauldron returns and Li Fan subdues Liu San and other Unified Dao realm forces.</p><p></p><p>Maybe then he will go and give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Bringing his thoughts back to the present, Li Fan wandered around Mount Tai Xu with the Zhu Xuan secret technique.</p><p></p><p>The sensing range of this secret technique was not very precise.</p><p></p><p>After a full half day, he still couldn't find the source of the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what are you looking for?" Shang Tianci asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm. There seems to be some secret hidden in this Mount Tai Xu. You help me look for it too." Li Fan sized up Shang Tianci and suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He then passed on the Zhu Xuan secret technique to him, but didn't tell him the specific use of the technique.</p><p></p><p>After Shang Tianci learned it, he also wandered around the mountain with Li Fan to search.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after the battle alert, people were in a panic.</p><p></p><p>Most cultivators had returned to Tai Hua Heavenly City for safety.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if these two acted so sneakily, they would definitely arouse suspicion from others.</p><p></p><p>After searching for most of the day, Shang Tianci's luck was still much better than Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have discovered something and quickly transmitted a message: "Senior, over here!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed and he quickly brought Tian Yang to Shang Tianci's side.</p><p></p><p>"How many sounds?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Two sounds."</p><p></p><p>In the Xuan Tian Sect, the higher the rank, the more warning sounds the Zhu Xuan secret technique would produce.</p><p></p><p>When he sensed the Tian Xuan Mirror before, there were three dings.</p><p></p><p>Although these two sounds were not as good as the Tian Xuan Mirror, it was not a small figure either.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan indeed felt the constant reminders from the Zhu Xuan secret technique.</p><p></p><p>He looked around.</p><p></p><p>This was a secluded valley in the mountains, extremely quiet.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that for a thousand years, no one had disturbed it.</p>

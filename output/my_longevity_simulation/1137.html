            <p>Chapter 1135: The Power to Drive Away Immortals in the Sixth World</p><p></p><p>The boundless sea of the water attribute cave heaven began to freeze over for thousands of miles. ●𝑮𝒐𝒐𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒔𝒕𝒐𝒄𝒐𝒎 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒈●</p><p></p><p>In the scorching hot fire attribute cave heaven, the flames became dim.</p><p></p><p>But they did not extinguish.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they continuously shrank and condensed.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into strange free-floating flames.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of unimaginable changes happened to Li Fan one after another.</p><p></p><p>And his realm also broke through the Nascent Soul stage, and he madly advanced in the Spirit Transformation stage.</p><p></p><p>Early Spirit Transformation, Middle Spirit Transformation, Late Spirit Transformation...</p><p></p><p>Until reaching Spirit Transformation Perfection before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Powerful.</p><p></p><p>Vitality.</p><p></p><p>Full of aggression.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's current feeling about himself.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had no time at all to savor all of this.</p><p></p><p>As he expected, his rapid transformation while in the True Immortal Net had already attracted the attention of that faceless True Immortal outside the high walls.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings seemed to no longer be so dark, and specks of light appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there were waves constantly surging, and uninvited guests had arrived in the silent and dark sea.</p><p></p><p>"Return to reality." Li Fan decisively said.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene froze.</p><p></p><p>And then quickly dissipated into mist.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the faceless True Immortal did not fully investigate the anomaly in the net, or perhaps the dark sea shielded most of the faceless True Immortal's power.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the process of returning to reality this time was very smooth.</p><p></p><p>The void white mist did not last long before thunderously dispersing.</p><p></p><p>Light reappeared once again.</p><p></p><p>Anchored for 1 year, detached from the mountain peak!</p><p></p><p>"Safely returned."</p><p></p><p>"Proving my method is feasible."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan breathed a sigh of relief, ignoring the prompt about returning to reality for now.</p><p></p><p>The influence of the faceless True Immortal's power had indeed declined to a certain extent after returning to reality once again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face was no longer a smooth blank slate.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the contours of some facial features slightly protruded.</p><p></p><p>However, this appearance looked even more eerie compared to being purely faceless.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I just need to follow the same method."</p><p></p><p>He flew towards Daxuan Capital with practiced ease.</p><p></p><p>Next, the events that occurred in Daxuan and the other few small worlds were almost exactly the same as in the previous life, that is, the 120th world.</p><p></p><p>The only possible difference was that Li Fan was more skilled and omitted many probing steps.</p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side, Li Fan did not go off track, and even stopped researching the use of the Youzu people's power of faith.</p><p></p><p>Minimizing all variables.</p><p></p><p>In the 121st world, the progress of charging for returning to reality was a bit faster.</p><p></p><p>Completing the charge three months in advance.</p><p></p><p>Hiding in the dark sea, inheriting cultivation, returning to reality.</p><p></p><p>All in one go.</p><p></p><p>Next, the 122nd world, 123rd world...</p><p></p><p>All the way to the 125th world.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the 8th year, Li Fan once again came to the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that after returning to reality again this time, he would completely escape the influence of the faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Now his face was no different from a normal person's.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he still sensed some defects that the naked eye and divine sense could not discern.</p><p></p><p>The influence of the True Immortal Net still existed.</p><p></p><p>But it would shatter with a single touch.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suppressed the urge to court death in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Return to reality!"</p><p></p><p>The scene instantly changed between illusion and reality.</p><p></p><p>The mist gathered and dispersed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>126th world, anchored for 1 year, detached from the mountain!</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>A feeling completely different from the previous few worlds arose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was the true freedom of being unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>"Long trapped in a cage, I am once again returned to nature."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Humming softly, he slowly walked to the edge of the cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Realm, I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the boundless sea of clouds, Li Fan chose to inherit the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sky above the Great Xuan changed colors.</p><p></p><p>The entire world seemed to be unable to bear the pressure, emitting creaking sounds of being overburdened.</p><p></p><p>However, this change only lasted for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The vast aura surrounding Li Fan quickly subsided and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The sky returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"At the perfection of the Hua Shen stage, even the Great Xuan world is already struggling to bear it."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to reach the perfection of the Dao Merging stage, I'm afraid that the moment I inherit the cultivation, the world would be torn apart."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter. When the time comes, I can go to the Xuanhuang Realm to inherit the cultivation. Or I can first perform a world upgrade on the Great Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, then turned his thoughts to his plans for this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"In this life, I will remain behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>"Unless absolutely necessary, I will never take action myself."</p><p></p><p>"Everything else is just incidental, only to verify my previous guess."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his gaze looking far away, as if he could see the sky of the vast Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the argument that the Dharma Transmitter and the Heavenly Doctor have never appeared at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Li Fan had doubts about their relationship was because of the scroll of "Patching the Heavens Record" passed down by the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the "Patching the Heavens Record", a method of healing the heavens, which only exists in theory, is described.</p><p></p><p>That is "borrowing a shell to return the soul, breaking and then being reborn".</p><p></p><p>The world, no matter how powerful the cultivation realm is, just like living beings, has its own end of life.</p><p></p><p>When a world inevitably moves towards decay and decline, no matter how brilliant the medical skills are, it is powerless to turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>One can only watch helplessly as it perishes.</p><p></p><p>This is the normal, theoretical situation.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Doctor proposed a possibility of saving the world.</p><p></p><p>That is to find another cultivation realm that is still in its prime and perform the act of possession.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Heaven changes hands, and the world is transformed."</p><p></p><p>"Although it seems so absurd and unbelievable, it may not be impossible for the Heavenly Doctor to achieve."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Since entering the Xuanhuang Realm, all the scenes he had seen flashed rapidly before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The various phenomena speculated in the Patching the Heavens Record, which would occur during the world's shell reincarnation period, are really too similar to the current situation of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Strange occurrences arise, and the Dao of Heaven suddenly changes."</p><p></p><p>"More importantly..."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Doctor is from the Heavenly Dharma Realm, yet he attaches such importance to the Xuanhuang Realm. He desperately wanders in the darkest starry sea, collecting remnants of other worlds."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Heavenly Doctor's previous words and actions..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"The accuracy of the Heavenly Doctor's plan to patch the heavens can almost be confirmed."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing that is worrying is the Dharma Transmitter's attitude."</p><p></p><p>"If he clearly knows that the Heavenly Doctor is from another world and wants to borrow the Xuanhuang Realm to return from the dead, yet the Dharma Transmitter never obstructed him from beginning to end."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, like the Heavenly Doctor, he also went out to collect world remnants in the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>"Either, apart from this, the Dharma Transmitter also has no better way to save the Xuanhuang Realm and has no choice but to be forced to do so."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter and the Heavenly Doctor are actually the same person!"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, the Dharma Transmitter is the Heavenly Doctor's avatar!"</p><p></p><p>A glint of brilliance flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, countless cultivators have a question in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Why doesn't the Dharma Transmitter leave an avatar while his primordial spirit roams beyond the heavens?</p><p></p><p>As long as there is one avatar, it would be enough to suppress all the villains in Xuanhuang.</p>

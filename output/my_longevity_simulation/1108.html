        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1106: Madness for Becoming a True Immortal</p><p></p><p>Collecting the information about these children was naturally for the purpose of finding a candidate to succeed the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Now that Li Fan already knew all the answers to the test, as long as he could find someone with a generally matching temperament and character, the possibility of successfully inheriting the position was still quite high.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to be too demanding to complete it in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>First, he would identify a few suitable candidates, and in the next life, he would select them and start special training.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was conducting various tests on these children through the Dreamland Technique,</p><p></p><p>The grand play he had arranged to stir up the Xuanhuang Realm slowly began to unfold.</p><p></p><p>First, a rumor spread like wildfire.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian, who had once caused a sensation and led almost all the cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance to hunt him down, possessed two heaven-defying abilities called the "Qian-Kun Bone Hand" and the "Book of Ten Thousand Deaths" because he had come into contact with the remnant shell of a True Immortal when he was young.</p><p></p><p>The Qian-Kun Bone Hand could reverse the Qian and Kun, allowing an item to revert back to its state from a period of time.</p><p></p><p>The "Book of Ten Thousand Deaths" could predict one's countless ways of dying. When used properly, it could turn misfortune into fortune and ward off evil and calamity.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance had almost forgotten the name Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as these two terrifying abilities were mentioned, it instantly triggered the memories of the Immortal Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Ou Shangtian, with a cultivation below the Nascent Soul stage, was able to persist for nearly half a year under the pursuit of countless cultivators. He proved the power of the "Qian-Kun Bone Hand" and the "Book of Ten Thousand Deaths" through his actions.</p><p></p><p>And these two powerful exotic abilities were actually just byproducts of the so-called True Immortal's remnant shell?</p><p></p><p>Then, if one could obtain this True Immortal's remnant shell in its entirety, what kind of fortune would it bring?</p><p></p><p>The moment they heard this rumor, almost every cultivator had this thought in their minds.</p><p></p><p>But the mention of a True Immortal was illusory and intangible.</p><p></p><p>People just treated it as a lost legend and didn't take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>However, strangely, as time passed, the rumor did not die down. Instead, it showed a tendency to become more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>Discerning individuals could see that there was someone behind the scenes pushing the waves and assisting the tide.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to investigate the mastermind behind the scenes, something unexpected happened that no one had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>That evening, a graceful white figure suddenly appeared in the sky above the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by his appearance, the entire Xuanhuang Realm instantly began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>And all the cultivators who looked up and saw this figure had an indescribable feeling welling up in their hearts simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The figure only lasted for a few breaths before abruptly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>But combined with the previous rumor that had been spreading like wildfire, the cultivators' minds almost subconsciously blurted out four words: "True Immortal's Remnant Shell!"</p><p></p><p>The phenomenon that enveloped the entire sky, along with the slight tremor that occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm as the white figure appeared, these two things could not be faked!</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not a True Immortal, it must be an extraordinary figure!"</p><p></p><p>Just as people were discussing and speculating about the true identity of the white figure,</p><p></p><p>The moment the cultivators saw these black, viscous substances, they knew that they were creations of the Earth's Spirit - the "Black Swamp".</p><p></p><p>Faced with this crisis of extinction, the cultivators were not frightened but delighted, not fleeing but charging forward.</p><p></p><p>Many of them launched a desperate charge towards the Black Swamp.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, under the protection of the Celestial Venerable's mighty power, everyone could be resurrected after death, so there was nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if they could happen to slay this Earth's Spirit, that would truly be a single step to ascension!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although the power of the Earth and Heaven's Soul that merged with the Dao was strong, ants could still kill an elephant with their numbers!</p><p></p><p>There were indeed many cultivators who held this belief.</p><p></p><p>Under their fierce struggle, the trend of the black swamp's expansion was actually contained.</p><p></p><p>Just as the cultivators were pleasantly surprised, thinking that the black swamp had become weak, a dazzling golden figure suddenly flew out from the black swamp.</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could react, it had already torn through the sky and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After that golden figure left, for some unknown reason, all the raging black swamps receded back into the depths of the earth.</p><p></p><p>"That was..."</p><p></p><p>"The remnant shell of a True Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>In the dazed crowd, someone suddenly shouted in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the crowd instantly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Because from the fleeting glimpse just now, that figure indeed looked extremely similar to the one that had appeared in the sky not long ago!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was able to suppress the Dao-merging black swamp with just its aura...</p><p></p><p>After being stunned for a moment, the cultivators present all reacted and chased after the direction where the golden light had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only a small number of cultivators hesitated for a moment, then continued to launch attacks on the black swamp that had retreated back into the depths of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, it was a bit unfortunate that the black swamp that had returned to its lair became even more ferocious and violent compared to before.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that its strength had also greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators, without exception, all perished here.</p><p></p><p>But even if they were wiped out, it still could not stop the greed of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>So the cultivators who heard the news and came to die continued endlessly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the black swamp and the True Immortal's remnant shell quickly spread throughout the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The golden figure that could cause the Earth and Heaven's Souls to go berserk gradually attracted the attention of more and more cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And then, wherever the True Immortal's remnant shell went, without exception, Earth and Heaven's Souls would mysteriously appear, as if wanting to suppress this remnant shell.</p><p></p><p>Never did they know that the Xuan Huang Realm actually hid so many Earth and Heaven's Souls.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the cultivators were stunned by this grand occasion.</p><p></p><p>Almost every few days, one could hear news of new Earth and Heaven's Souls appearing.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance who had been stuck at the Primordial Spirit stage for a long time all went a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>They could no longer sit still and went to hunt the Earth and Heaven's Souls they fancied.</p><p></p><p>And even more cultivators still focused their attention on that True Immortal's remnant shell.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' desire for the True Immortal's remnant shell reached its peak after a certain event occurred.</p><p></p><p>A mortal named Zhang Haobo, after having the fortune to touch the True Immortal's remnant shell that suddenly descended in front of him, actually instantly leaped from being an ordinary mortal to the peak of Golden Core stage!</p><p></p><p>And the strange object that allowed him to lay his foundation turned out to be a rib-shaped wonder!</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that the True Immortal's remnant shell only stayed by his side for a moment before suddenly disappearing and fleeing again.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it might not have been impossible for this Zhang Haobo to be promoted to the Primordial Spirit stage in an instant!</p><p></p><p>After the cultivators investigated Zhang Haobo's identity and background, they also ruled out the possibility that he was faking it and putting on an act.</p><p></p><p>After all, the memories of the nearly hundred mortals who were by his side and personally witnessed the miracle were all intact!</p><p></p><p>"The True Immortal's remnant shell should be looking for a fated person."</p><p></p><p>"That Ou Shangtian was like this, and this Zhang Haobo was also like this! But their luck was not enough, so they were not chosen by the True Immortal's remnant shell in the end."</p><p></p><p>"However, if one could finally obtain it..."</p>

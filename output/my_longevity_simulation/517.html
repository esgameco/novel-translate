            <p>However, there was no further probing into it.</p><p></p><p>Although they were fellow Daoists, she, as a Daoist disciple of the Great Dao Sect, was destined to come into contact with highly secretive matters.</p><p></p><p>It was normal not to speak openly about it.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, by spreading the law and snatching and publicizing the 'Primordial True Scripture,' it can be considered as indirectly saving countless cultivators, which can be seen as a great merit," Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if thinking of something, Li Fan was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Zhao Senior Sister noticed Li Fan's anomaly and asked with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The unreasonable laws..." Li Fan turned around and stared straight at Zhao Senior Sister.</p><p></p><p>"Law cannot be cultivated together. Isn't this also the law of nature? If a cultivator reverses this law, achieves immortality, then wouldn't the Xuanhuang Realm be saved?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Senior Sister fell silent for a moment and shook her head slightly, "You are right in your thinking, indeed, there were a few predecessors who wanted to do this."</p><p></p><p>"But without exception, they all failed."</p><p></p><p>"The stronger the law of nature, the more difficult it is to reverse it. The law that cannot be cultivated together is a natural change that the heavens and earth have produced to counteract us cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Investigating further, this law has already been reversed once. Trying to reverse it again will only increase the difficulty."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, with numerous talents within the Immortal Dao Ten Sects, why hasn't anyone gone against the 'Law of the Transmitted Way Celestial Lord' and completely destroyed the foundation of the new law?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Senior Sister explained to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully pondered the meaning in Senior Sister's words, falling into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After three years of chaos, the cultivators seemed to have gradually become accustomed to the days of being unable to cultivate together.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation realms could not be improved, which saved them the effort of daily cultivation, allowing them to laze around and play within the sect every day.</p><p></p><p>Life was not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>As for those with exceptional talents, they were arranged by the elder generation in the sect to cultivate a law individually.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Senior Sister was also one of them.</p><p></p><p>She was now cultivating the "Impermanent Spiritual Profound True Scripture," which, although weaker than the "Heavenly Execution Great Dao Scripture" by more than a bit, was sufficient for her to cultivate to the realm of immortality.</p><p></p><p>However, with Zhao Senior Sister's lofty ambitions, she was naturally not willing to settle for mediocrity.</p><p></p><p>They say it is difficult for water from the vast sea to be used, once personally practicing the most exquisite techniques in the world, then practicing a lower-level technique again felt like chewing wax.</p><p></p><p>So, she turned her gaze to the remaining two techniques of the Xuantian Daoist Sect.</p><p></p><p>After some consideration, she chose the "Heaven's Grief, Earth's Desolation Scripture."</p><p></p><p>"Heaven's Grief, Earth's Desolation, sadness permeates the world. This technique is only slightly inferior to the 'Heavenly Execution Great Dao Scripture'!" Zhao Senior Sister evaluated.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Daoist Sect is truly worthy of having once been the ruler of the entire Xuanhuang Realm. A Law King can possess so many exquisite and unparalleled techniques. I really don't know how many treasures that fleeing Saint Messenger still has on him. Shi*.‚Äù</p><p></p><p>"Saint Messenger? The Saint Messenger of the Xuantian Daoist Sect?" Li Fan asked curiously, "This person was actually able to escape under the pursuit of the top ten sects of the Immortal Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, not only did he escape but he also took the Xuantian Daoist Sect's treasure, the Xuantian Treasure Mirror, with him. There has been no news of him since then. Even after the top ten sects searched the entire Xuanhuang Realm, they never found his trace."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Senior Sister shook her head, glossing over this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, we haven't double-cultivated for so long..." Her cheeks flushed slightly as she whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Li Fan understood her intentions and pulled Zhao Senior Sister into a secluded room, then isolated the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>The calm days did not last long.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not know the situation outside. However, within the Great Dao Sect, when the first disciple passed away due to being unable to break through the realm for a long time, a sense of anxiety and unease began to spread among the people.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan attended the funeral of this cultivator named Zhu Jun.</p><p></p><p>It was very simple, just hastily cremating the body and burying it on a mountain, as per Zhu Jun's wishes.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere of the funeral was not particularly mournful, but Li Fan clearly saw that all the cultivators present had a sense of sorrow in their eyes, like losing a companion.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a prophecy spread within the Great Dao Sect saying, "Yesterday Zhu Jun, today you all, tomorrow be judged!"</p><p></p><p>Within the Great Dao Sect, there were cultivators at the realm of immortality overseeing things.</p><p></p><p>Even if they wanted to revolt, they couldn't.</p><p></p><p>Rather than die pathetically on the mountain, it was better to go down the mountain and seek a glimmer of hope!</p><p></p><p>Influenced by the news of Zhu Jun's death, many disciples had such thoughts and chose to voluntarily abolish the sect's techniques and apply to go down the mountain to seek a way out.</p><p></p><p>The sect leader, Ji Changxi, was not heartless; he agreed to the disciples' requests.</p><p></p><p>He also promised that if they truly found themselves at a dead end and regretted their decision, they could come back anytime.</p><p></p><p>Several disciples were moved to tears on the spot and changed their minds, deciding to stay in the sect and live and die with it.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still a few cultivators who insisted on going down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi did not stop them.</p><p></p><p>But those with keen eyes could see that beneath the apparent calm, there was an accumulating terror that could erupt at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Just half a year later, some of the disciples who had gone down the mountain were seen crying and begging to return to the sect outside the sect gate.</p><p></p><p>Crying and pleading beside the protective array of the sect, requesting the sect leader to let them return.</p><p></p><p>Once they returned to the sect and recounted the situation outside, the surviving cultivators of the Great Dao Sect realized how lucky they were.</p><p></p><p>Because of the law that cannot be cultivated together, the outside world had already turned into a horrifying slaughterhouse.</p><p></p><p>The past peace was completely gone.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the road, one might suddenly be attacked by a cultivator who would stop at nothing for the techniques one might possess.</p><p></p><p>How could the Great Dao Sect disciples who had given up their techniques survive in such a situation with only a few defensive tools? </p><p></p><p>Being heavily injured and able to return alive to the sect was already a stroke of luck.</p><p></p><p>These people had lost their courage, not to mention continue cultivating, just living in the sect and waiting for death.</p><p></p><p>The other Great Dao Sect disciples were also filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>They no longer mentioned going down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, have you noticed anything wrong?" Li Fan found Zhao Senior Sister with a solemn expression and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Is there a problem with the cultivation?" Zhao Senior Sister, who was rarely daydreaming, asked with a frown after a long time.</p><p></p><p>She then scanned the outside world with her spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Upon taking a look, her expression changed dramatically.</p>

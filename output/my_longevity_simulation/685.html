        <h1>Chapter 685</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ximen Yu stared at him intently, listening intently.</p><p></p><p>"I can't remember." After a while, Li Fan shrugged, saying helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Ximen Yu's face stiffened. "For such a strange thing, how can you easily forget it?"</p><p></p><p>He looked incredulous, sizing up Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Ximen, why don't you tell me, what exactly is this dead branch. Maybe as you talk about it, I might remember." Li Fan suggested with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ximen Yu squinted his eyes, scanning Li Fan back and forth.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, unafraid, met his gaze calmly.</p><p></p><p>Unable to discern Li Fan's true strength, Ximen Yu ultimately chose not to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>With a turn of his body, he once again presented the dead branch that he had been guarding behind him to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he said, "Actually, I am not too clear about the origin of this item. During that time, my progress in studying the veins was at a bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>"Under the governance of the Ten Thousand Immortals League, the power of the veins is firmly locked by protective formations covering the entire territory. Without authorized permission, it is truly difficult to access and research. I tried many methods but still could not find a breakthrough. Just as I was about to switch to another research direction..."</p><p></p><p>"About two years ago, the power of the veins here suddenly erupted for some reason. It seemed like a disaster that could wipe out a whole state happening miles away. It triggered a chain reaction. When I saw this, I was greatly happy and, of course, seized this rare opportunity to draw in the overflowing power of the veins."</p><p></p><p>"And this dead branch is what I discovered from the power of the veins."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu explained slowly, and Li Fan seemed pensive after hearing it.</p><p></p><p>"Two years ago, it seems to be the time point of the Crimson Flame Sea Burning. Did Hongxi forcibly draw out the influence brought by the veins in order to force out the hidden Crimson Flame in the veins?" </p><p></p><p>The veins of Xuanyellow connected everything. Although separated by thousands of miles, they could still affect each other. Prior to this, in the Cloud Sea, there was an island that sank and resurfaced from the seabed due to the influence of "a hundred mountains turning into flat plains" from a distant place.</p><p></p><p>The tremor of the veins observed by Ximen Yu might have been caused by the aftermath of the battle with the Crimson Flame.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the dead branch, which was still continuously emitting the yellowish vein power, Li Fan asked in confusion, "The power of the veins is pure and incomparable. How could a dead branch be trapped inside? Ordinary trees would be crushed into powder by the powerful pressure in the depths of the veins within moments. What is the origin of this dead branch that not only can survive in the veins but also can trigger and absorb the imprisoned vein power?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then looked at Ximen Yu again and said, "It seems that the Ten Thousand Immortals League has not noticed the anomaly in the veins here. Otherwise, given the safety concern of the protective formation, they would definitely send someone to deal with this hidden danger."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu's face changed slightly, but he did not refute it.</p><p></p><p>"This dead branch indeed possesses some kind of mystical power. It seems to have the same origin as the veins, so my small-scale extraction and research of it here would only be regarded as a normal fluctuation of the veins themselves."</p><p></p><p>The dead branch would intermittently emit the power of the veins, containing some kind of pattern. At this moment, it gradually weakened, and finally, there was no more vein energy flowing out.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu carefully put away the jade bottle containing the dead branch.</p><p></p><p>"Originating from the same source as the veins?" Li Fan pondered over this sentence carefully.</p><p></p><p>Then Ximen Yu took out a stone tablet from his storage ring. It seemed to have been peeled off from a certain rocky wall, and the traces were very ancient.</p><p></p><p>The lines were quite abstract, but the content they depicted could generally be understood.</p><p></p><p>Numerous small dots represented humans, in rites and life on the earth's surface.</p><p></p><p>Underground, a giant tree was growing upside down.</p><p></p><p>The roots were densely packed, rooted in every corner of the earth.</p><p></p><p>The canopy, however, delved deep into the ground, reaching the core of the earth.</p><p></p><p>"I discovered this while researching the changes of ancient and modern geography in a geological fault somewhere. It should have been left behind by an ancient mortal group."</p><p></p><p>"Not only this mural. I have also found similar ancient records in various places in the realm of Xuanyellow."</p><p></p><p>"I suspect that the so-called veins originated from the roots of this ancient tree. This dead branch of mine belongs to that ancient tree."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu explained.</p><p></p><p>"Although these pieces of information left by mortals are very rudimentary and are seen from the perspective of mortals, they may not depict the whole picture. But precisely because they are mortal things, we cultivators tend to ignore them. Therefore, what should have been erased as records can survive and remain." Ximen Yu said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Tree of the Veins..." Li Fan rubbed his chin.</p><p></p><p>"No, not right." Suddenly, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It is somewhat similar to what I saw in the illusion back then, although there were some differences." Li Fan affirmed.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu was not surprised. After thinking for a while, he said, "It is possible that the ancient tree you saw is even older."</p><p></p><p>"It might be the source of the Tree of the Veins."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was astonished, "The Tree of the Veins also has a source?"</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu took out black stones from somewhere, crushed them, and sprinkled them onto the dead branch that was stuck in the ground. The black powder was soon absorbed by the dead branch, making it seem even more vibrant.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that there was originally only one mother tree between heaven and earth that controlled the lives of all beings in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Later, a great change occurred, and the mother tree was severely damaged. Moreover, some branches fell from it onto the world."</p><p></p><p>"One of them turned into the ancient Tree of the Veins."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu looked at the carefully cared for dead branch with affection and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes, "How did Ximen, my friend, come to know about this? It is truly unheard of."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu kept his gaze on the dead branch without replying.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was stunned for a moment, then nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, thanks to your words, I seem to remember now. I did encounter that dead branch here before."</p><p></p><p>Drawing out a map of Tianlingzhou, Li Fan marked a location.</p><p></p><p>Only after Li Fan disappeared did the gate of the cave close again.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu frowned deeply, muttering to himself, "Between heaven and earth, as wood grows old, it brings forth life and longevity day and night..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 993</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very certain that before Mo Rubin left, this hidden cave did not have this spider web.</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly appearing, giving me a hint..."</p><p></p><p>There was no spider weaving the web, as if it appeared out of thin air. </p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's gaze, a butterfly flapped its wings and landed on the spider web.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly did not sense any danger at all, and even felt very comfortable, crawling back and forth on the web with its feelers.</p><p></p><p>This spider web was also different from ordinary ones. It did not stick to the butterfly. And it was very sturdy, without even the slightest sway.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly played on the web very happily. </p><p></p><p>But after all, it could not live on the web for its entire life. It still needed to go find food to sustain its survival.</p><p></p><p>So the butterfly flapped its wings again, wanting to fly away.</p><p></p><p>But just at the instant it was about to break free from the web...</p><p></p><p>Something that made Li Fan's pupils contract happened.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing the butterfly's departure, that originally harmless spider web suddenly tightened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>An attractive force was generated out of nowhere, immediately pulling the butterfly back.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly was caught off guard. Its fragile body simply could not withstand the pulling of this immense force. In an instant, it was torn into countless powder-like fragments. Adhered and evenly scattered on the pure white spider web.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was absorbed by the web. The remains of its body fused with the web, becoming indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>And the spider web still quietly existed in the corner, as if the previous anomaly had not happened at all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had witnessed the entire process, took a deep breath. </p><p></p><p>With such a direct hint, how could he not see where he had been neglecting all along, and the source of the uneasiness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His previous inference was actually not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Just like a butterfly that mistakenly entered a spider web, the Faceless Immortal should not be interested in the weak Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was relying on the power of the stone statue to bully others, or wandering around under the eyelids of the statue.</p><p></p><p>It would not draw the attention of the true immortal.</p><p></p><p>If this state was maintained from beginning to end, there indeed would not be any problems.</p><p></p><p>But if one wanted to break free from the control of the true immortal's power, or suddenly displayed a strength that even interested the true immortal...</p><p></p><p>The ending would likely be like that butterfly, instantly devoured and torn into countless fragments!</p><p></p><p>To draw an analogy to Li Fan's situation, with the Yuanying realm cultivation and Hedao battle power in this world, continuing to bounce around with the help of the Faceless Immortal's stone statue was not a big problem. </p><p></p><p>But if he chose to ascend, just like the butterfly on the web instantly flapping its wings, it could immediately alert that Faceless Immortal.</p><p></p><p>How fast the true immortal's reaction would be, and whether it could influence or even hinder the process of ascension, Li Fan had no way to speculate.</p><p></p><p>And afterwards, a black domain appeared, with time still flowing outside the black domain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this could explain to a certain extent that when one's strength reached or approached the level of the Nameless Immortal, one could have a certain impact on the operation of ascension.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was that Li Fan had already been chosen by the faceless stone statue to play a "proxy" type of role. </p><p></p><p>Even golden willpower would appear within his own body...</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he was deeply entangled in the web!</p><p></p><p>There was almost no difference from being in front of the true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the true immortal would not pay attention to the ants under his feet, but when the ants burst with a flash of light, it would inevitably attract the gaze of the true immortal!</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Li Fan couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, my subconscious spiritual sense prevented me from immediately returning to reality."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, facing a True Immortal without any mental preparation..."</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current level of enlightenment, he had to admit that the odds were against him.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of terror, Li Fan calmed his mind.</p><p></p><p>The uneasiness that had been lingering in his heart gradually dissipated, and there was no longer much fear left.</p><p></p><p>Because of the unknown, there is fear.</p><p></p><p>After learning the source of the threat, Li Fan actually became calm.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, it's not as desperate as imagined. After all, it's not about directly confronting a True Immortal, but finding a way to successfully return to reality in front of a True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"This world has just begun, and there is still a very long time, enough for me to ponder."</p><p></p><p>"When I was at the Foundation Establishment stage, I was able to calmly return to reality in front of the Heavenly Doctor; now that my strength rivals the Harmonious Dao, how can I not return to reality in the presence of a True Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts gradually settled, and the look of panic in his eyes disappeared, becoming unfathomable like a deep pool.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the hidden spider web of this secluded heaven, subtle changes occurred again.</p><p></p><p>Another butterfly, fluttering gracefully, landed on the spider web.</p><p></p><p>Just like what happened before, it was unaware of the perilous situation it was in, trapped in the giant web.</p><p></p><p>But this time, when the butterfly was about to flap its wings and leave, something different happened!</p><p></p><p>As a result, that inexplicable suction force did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the butterfly quickly flapped its wings and departed.</p><p></p><p>Vanishing into the air.</p><p></p><p>As if it were a play, after performing these two scenes, the spider web, butterfly, and wind all disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, Li Fan couldn't find any traces of their existence in this hidden heaven.</p><p></p><p>"This illusion technique does indeed have some tricks."</p><p></p><p>However, what Li Fan was concerned about was not how Mo Rubin displayed this scene, but the profound meaning behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the stone statue or the Wanling Qiong Essence, Mo Rubin is avoiding them like the plague."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to his suggestive performance, it's clear that he already knows the consequences of being trapped in the True Immortal's web."</p><p></p><p>"But from the current situation, it seems he has already escaped from the True Immortal's web."</p><p></p><p>The scene of a strong wind blowing and the butterfly flapping its wings to leave reappeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And he also vaguely realized the part he had overlooked before.</p><p></p><p>The faceless stone statue, as the totem of the Xuantian Sect, should have been a common sight within the sect in the past.</p><p></p><p>However, in the memories of Ji Yujing, the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect, Li Fan didn't see any trace of the faceless True Immortal stone statue at all.</p><p></p><p>"Either the stone statue didn't exist within the Xuantian Sect at that time."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Some power directly severed the existence and influence of the stone statue."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Happening to two Dharma Kings at the same time, this kind of severance is definitely not a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that there are still more secrets buried in the destruction of the Xuantian Sect back then. And Mo Rubin, who deeply realized the terror of a True Immortal's power, doesn't even dare to speak directly about it."</p><p></p><p>"He can only use this abstract method to hint at it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart became even heavier.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that to break through in this world, I still need to obtain help from Mo Rubin."</p><p></p><p>"Let's cooperate with him to complete the coercion of the Tianxuan Mirror first."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan left gracefully.</p>

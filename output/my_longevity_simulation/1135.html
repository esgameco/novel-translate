        <h1>Chapter 1135</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>To achieve the highest realm of the "Heavenly Emperor Qi Canon" and become an unparalleled emperor comparable to an immortal, Li Fan estimated that he would need to establish a vast dynasty with an influence spanning the entire Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, with such power, why would I even bother practicing the Heavenly Emperor Qi Canon?"</p><p></p><p>However, as it was just an expedient measure to anchor himself, Li Fan didn't hold much illusion about it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his goal had already been achieved.</p><p></p><p>With the growing prosperity of the Daxuan Dynasty, he had almost no more occurrences of the bizarre phenomenon where his body would intermittently disappear.</p><p></p><p>Even his originally lost face seemed to be resurfacing.</p><p></p><p>"The Faceless Immortal, His power seems to sever all connections with the world."</p><p></p><p>"And as the Daxuan Heavenly Destined Holy Emperor, the lives of hundreds of millions of beings are tied to me. To a certain extent, it has influenced the power of the Immortal's Web."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully sensed the entanglement of these two forces within himself and suddenly had a realization.</p><p></p><p>"The correct way to use the Myriad Spirits Grand Formation may not be simply to block. Instead, it's..."</p><p></p><p>"To splash the resentment of those hundreds of millions of beings like a pot of dog blood."</p><p></p><p>"To put it in layman's terms, it's to forcibly associate those hundreds of millions of resentful spirits with the Faceless Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"For example, making those wrongfully killed beings believe that the Faceless Immortal is the culprit."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced, and after some deduction with the Terminal Separation Disc, he quickly made subtle adjustments to the Myriad Spirits Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>Then he summoned Lin Ling here.</p><p></p><p>"Master." </p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Ling, clad in battle armor and looking heroic, appeared before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Unlike her experiences in the previous life, since awakening her consciousness in this life, Lin Ling had always shouldered the responsibility of leading the Daxuan Imperial Army to conquer myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Constantly on the move, especially under Li Fan's instructions, she had never made contact with the Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>Her temperament had also become bold and unrestrained, like someone in the military.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan told her the subtle modifications to the Myriad Spirits Grand Formation, Lin Ling was about to leave to carry out the task when she suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan looked at Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>"Master, while flying through the Xuanhuang realm, a consciousness discovered me and kept trying to communicate with me."</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Earth Vein Ancient Tree?" Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No. But it's very similar..." Lin Ling answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's expression, she quickly added, "But I always followed your teachings and ignored it."</p><p></p><p>"That consciousness was crazy and deranged, not even saying who it was. It just wanted me to go see it..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know why Ruomu would discover Lin Ling's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring about the details of the encounter location, Li Fan designed a formation for Lin Ling to conceal her from external perception.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, the main task in this life was still to break free from the Faceless Immortal's influence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only recorded the time and location of Ruomu's appearance this time, without any intention of further contact.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, I can give the Earth Vein Ancient Tree a surprise."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered as he arrived in the secret chamber below the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>It was pitch black here, with more than a dozen Youzu people imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>Once Daxuan had gained some combat power, Li Fan had ordered Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba to launch an attack on the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Patrolling Heaven Arrow's...</p><p></p><p>(Translation truncated due to reaching the maximum response length. Please let me know if you would like me to continue translating the remaining part.)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>With assistance, the outcome was also a mix of victory and defeat.</p><p></p><p>The Great Xuan Forbidden Army suffered hundreds of casualties, but they also captured some Youzu people alive.</p><p></p><p>After some persuasion, they also recognized the reality and agreed to open the passage to the Youjie for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the energy recharge was not yet complete, so Li Fan was not in a hurry to enter.</p><p></p><p>These Youzu people, upon seeing Li Fan's arrival, hurriedly knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan stood motionless, sensing his own statue in the darkness not far away.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the destined holy emperor of the Great Xuan, Li Fan had also thought of recreating a power similar to the essence of the Source Force.</p><p></p><p>Since it was somewhat similar to the power of faith, Li Fan ordered the construction and erection of his own statues in various places, hoping to achieve the condensation of the Source Force essence with the vast number of people.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, he was a bit naive.</p><p></p><p>Although the Source Force essence was an existence abandoned by the True Immortals, it was vaguely one level higher than ordinary spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Without special means, it was obviously impossible to gather and refine it purely through the collective prayers of mortals.</p><p></p><p>But things changed after these Youzu people were captured and brought back.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because these Youzu people had an extremely strong innate faith in the Youjie. Almost at the moment of their submission, Li Fan vaguely sensed a strange aura appearing within his body.</p><p></p><p>It was as scarlet as the national fortune of the Great Xuan Dynasty, and the feeling it gave Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>It was extremely similar to the golden Source Force essence of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal in his previous life!</p><p></p><p>Later, Li Fan simply moved one of his own statues into this dungeon and ordered these dozen or so Youzu people to pray day and night.</p><p></p><p>The effect was also very significant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan studied their prayer methods and had the Great Xuan Forbidden Army learn and imitate them.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, they all failed.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Li Fan could only attribute it to the special physique of the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it is still related to the dark power of the Youjie. Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>The Youjie, which could interfere with the True Immortal Web to a certain extent, obviously still hid many secrets.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not something that could be explored in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that the reproductive ability of the Youzu people is not very strong either."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, without relying on the faceless True Immortal stone statue, I could also form a network of faith."</p><p></p><p>The ability to freely bestow, deprive, and even transmit over a distance was too powerful and convenient.</p><p></p><p>Having tasted its benefits, Li Fan naturally found it difficult to leave it.</p><p></p><p>So even though he was not far from Huan Zhen at this time, Li Fan still did not give up on researching this kind of power.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Li Fan did not possess the talent in this aspect.</p><p></p><p>"I can only wait until it's completely safe and let those guys study it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Great Holy Emperor..." At this moment, one of the Youzu people who was kowtowing and praying suddenly trembled and made a sound, seeming to have something to say.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan immediately became interested.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they actively tried to communicate with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Li Fan's permission, that Youzu person then continued tremblingly: "During my prayer, I discovered that my previous master..."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Li Fan cautiously: "That is, the Youjie, doesn't seem to be very angry about our betrayal."</p><p></p><p>He swallowed his saliva: "The ancestral teachings passed down through generations in the tribe all said that one must not betray the darkness. Otherwise, divine punishment will surely be incurred."</p>

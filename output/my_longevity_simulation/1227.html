        <div class="content">
            <p>Sun Luyuan took the list and was shocked upon reading it. 💘😂➅❾𝓼𝐇ย𝕏.ℂㄖ𝕄🌷💲</p><p></p><p>In addition to the talented disciples from the major families of the Wanxian Alliance, there were also many cultivators holding key positions within the alliance.</p><p></p><p>Some of them were not unfamiliar to Sun Luyuan, but others held hidden positions that even he was not very clear about.</p><p></p><p>"Try your best to win over all the people on this list."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to go to great lengths. Just find an excuse to trick them..."</p><p></p><p>"Bring them over. Once they witness the majestic aura of our Holy Dynasty, they will surely have an epiphany just like you did!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be in a hurry. Take it slow to avoid exposing any flaws," Ou Shangtian said.</p><p></p><p>"Each successful case will count as a merit for you. There are plenty of treasures in our Holy Dynasty's vault. That Ice Seal Sword of yours is not even considered top-notch."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian's words made Sun Luyuan's heart race with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Although it was said that everything could be exchanged in the Tianxuan Mirror,</p><p></p><p>perceptive people knew that the truly precious treasures could not be obtained merely with contribution points.</p><p></p><p>They either required an extremely high level of merits or had various stringent exchange conditions.</p><p></p><p>A divine sword like the one in his hand, capable of easily endangering the safety of an entire state, would definitely only be available to the core members of institutions like the Martial Arts Hall or the Defense Institute in the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Do a good job." Ou Shangtian patted Sun Luyuan's shoulder with an air of seniority.</p><p></p><p>"Don't embarrass me in front of my master," he said with a hint of profoundness. 69丂卄ㄩ乂.匚ㄖ爪</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Unable to stay in the Holy Dynasty for long, Sun Luyuan was soon sent away.</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, it felt like he had just woken up from a bizarre dream.</p><p></p><p>Only the extremely cold sword in his dantian reminded him that everything was real.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you're back so soon? How did it go?"</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber of the Sun family, his younger brother Sun Luyao asked impatiently.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan did not mention the humiliation he had experienced and simply took out the Ice Seal Sword.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the Holy Dynasty is even stronger than we imagined. They actually have an immortal cultivator stationed there. As for that Holy Emperor's cultivation level, it's unfathomable and impossible to discern."</p><p></p><p>"A treasure like this was given away just like that."</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, the Wanxian Alliance is really nothing."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Sun Luyao listened to his brother's words, he heard the voice of Senior Phantom in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"What did I tell you? Hehe."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, no matter what decision you make, I will always support you." Sun Luyao expressed his stance with a somewhat complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan, thinking that his brother was worried about the uncertain future, comforted him again.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious phantom had accurately predicted Sun Luyuan's trip to the Holy Dynasty, clearly indicating that he definitely understood the true situation of the Holy Dynasty. ☠👺６９𝕤Ĥ𝕌𝔁.Ⓒ𝓞Ⓜ🎈🍮</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to ponder for a moment, putting on an act.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a solemn tone, he said, "The choice made by your Sun family is a wise move. That Holy Emperor of the Great Enlightenment has a cultivation level not inferior to mine."</p><p></p><p>"Within the Xuanhuang Realm where the Dao cannot be transmitted out, he is an invincible existence."</p><p></p><p>The implication behind these words made Sun Luyao's heart race.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had already guessed the mysterious phantom's strength, hearing it confirmed directly from him was still extremely shocking.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that the Xuanhuang Dao, just like cultivators, has its own desires?"</p><p></p><p>"This Holy Emperor might very well be the Xuanhuang Realm's..."</p><p></p><p>"The incarnation of good intentions. It's to set right the world that has been tampered with by the transmission of the Dharma."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sun Luyao's heart trembled violently once again.</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of the Dao of Heaven in the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>This origin was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts fell into brief confusion. Shortly after, as if remembering something, Sun Luyao asked, "Incarnation of good intentions? Could it be that, Senior, you mean there is also an incarnation of evil intentions in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was lost in thought, remaining silent without responding.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the distant reaches of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the continuous sea of relics, in the Xuanshang Boat.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Lingsheng Yuanrong technique, Zhao Xian's cultivation speed soared at an astonishing rate, breaking through the shackles of the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Successfully condensing the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>The tremors caused by the breakthrough to the Golden Core realm finally disturbed Zhao Xian's master, Zhao Wuji.</p><p></p><p>After discovering Zhao Xian's terrifyingly rapid progress, Zhao Wuji was not pleased but instead alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why?" Zhao Xian asked, full of discontent.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji did not report the news of Zhao Xian's successful breakthrough to the academy, and even actively suppressed and concealed it.</p><p></p><p>This naturally made Zhao Xian very dissatisfied, and in a moment of impulse, he even wanted to fully disclose everything he had seen in his dreams.</p><p></p><p>However, after experiencing many things in his dreams, he knew that his master was trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>"Too fast, Xian'er, your cultivation is simply too fast. If it were only the late Foundation Establishment stage, it would be fine, but directly jumping to the Golden Core realm..." Zhao Wuji's face was full of worry.</p><p></p><p>Only after Zhao Xian's repeated questioning did Zhao Wuji finally explain the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Those like you, true geniuses, although extremely rare in our academy in the past, have existed before. When your master was young, I had a senior sister."</p><p></p><p>"She was also truly exceptional in talent. Even faster than your cultivation, without the process of accumulating over time, in just three years, she went from Qi Refinement directly to the perfected Golden Core realm."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, it caused a sensation in the academy, and then..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhao Xian's expression also became somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because he had never heard of such a person existing within the academy.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister was then conscripted. From then on, there was no news, not knowing if she was alive or dead," Zhao Wuji sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Conscripted? Conscripted to where?" Zhao Xian was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>The immortal boat had not experienced real warfare for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>He could not understand the term 'conscription' mentioned by his master.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>Finally, under Zhao Xian's burning gaze, he first set up a prohibition, sealing off this place.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he transmit his voice, saying, "Xian'er, do you know why our Proving Dao Academy has such an outstanding status? Even the Immortal Pivot Court does not dare to offend us too much?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian answered according to what he had learned before, "Naturally, it is because our Proving Dao Academy is the source of the Dao methods of the immortal boat."</p><p></p><p>"Then, why exactly is the academy called the source of Dao methods?"</p><p></p><p>This question from Zhao Wuji stumped Zhao Xian.</p><p></p><p>"Because our academy provided the most important theoretical support for the survival of the immortal boat after the great tribulation descended," Zhao Wuji said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The power of true immortals that caused the boundless catastrophe back then, without absolute talent, ordinary cultivators simply cannot comprehend it. Our academy..."</p><p></p><p>"Has the most outstanding scholars in the entire immortal boat."</p><p></p><p>"Talent is also an extremely important resource on the immortal boat. Regardless of whether these geniuses are willing or not, as long as they show it, they will be firmly controlled."</p><p></p><p>"Even to the point of being deprived of it, no longer belonging to themselves."</p>

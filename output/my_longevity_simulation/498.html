        <h1>Chapter 498</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The tone was warm and friendly, without any airs of being the island's master.</p><p></p><p>This made Gao Yuan somewhat surprised and flattered.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan, who had spent half of his life striving on Wanxian Island, knew that these so-called "proxies" and "vice" were often more difficult to deal with than those officially appointed.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know how this somewhat famous Tianji Sect cultivator had chosen him.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment, he was his top immediate superior, and he couldn't afford to be negligent.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan quickly tidied up and hurried towards the agreed meeting place.</p><p></p><p>As for desertionâ€¦</p><p></p><p>That was just venting frustrations.</p><p></p><p>Desertion was impossible. Apart from the high level of danger, Gao Yuan was at least a member within the Wanxian Alliance's system.</p><p></p><p>If he really defected to the Wulao Club, where he had no skills, would his life be better than it is now?</p><p></p><p>It was likely that after all valuable information in his mind was extracted, he would be set aside and ignored by everyone.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't that foolish.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the chaotic thoughts in his mind, on his way to hurriedly rush, Gao Yuan pondered on the reasons why this newly appointed acting island master wanted to see him.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally arrived at the meeting point agreed by both sides.</p><p></p><p>Taian Island.</p><p></p><p>The defense formation opened, revealing a passage, and Gao Yuan flew into the formation. </p><p></p><p>In his sight, the acting island master Li Fan was seated in front.</p><p></p><p>While the guardian of Taian Island, Zhou Qingang, stood restrained on the side, sweating profusely and looking extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the two of them were discussing some sensitive topics. When they saw Gao Yuan's arrival, they suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Gao Yuan couldn't help but feel a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>The guardian of Taian Island, in terms of duty level, was even higher than his own.</p><p></p><p>He actually behaved so indiscreetly in front of Li Fan. It seemed that this ancient Tianji cultivator was not so easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Being knowledgeable about people, Gao Yuan immediately straightened up, walked forward, and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Island Master!"</p><p></p><p>"You've arrived," Li Fan looked at Gao Yuan, showing a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why I asked you here?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Although Gao Yuan was muttering in his mind, he replied promptly, "I do not know."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that you were stationed at the gate of the Political Affairs Hall before?", after a moment of silence, when Gao Yuan began to feel uneasy, Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master," although he knew it was a deliberate question, Gao Yuan still answered respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been in office?"</p><p></p><p>"For over ninety-eight years."</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years pass swiftly. You've worked hard..."</p><p></p><p>"After a hundred years in office, without any job changes, did you ever have any grievances in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>"I dare not," Gao Yuan tightened in his heart, shaking his head quickly to express his loyalty.</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan praised and then moved to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"Every time a cultivator enters office within the system, they need to go through an examination at the White Jade Questioning Platform in the Political Affairs Hall. In daily affairs, you also need to go to the Political Affairs Hall from time to time. I suppose you have some understanding of the cultivators within the Congyun Sea system, don't you?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I dare not make grand statements. But in terms of basic information, I am clear." Gao Yuan raised his head slightly, glancing at Li Fan before adding, "At the very least, one cannot mistake people. Furthermore, I need to understand the nuances, such as who has a good temper, who has a powerful background and cannot be offended."</p><p></p><p>"In our line of work, our status is lowly. If we offend the wrong people due to lack of foresight, there won't be a good outcome."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then help me identify which of these cultivators are worth utilizing," without paying attention to Gao Yuan's dissatisfaction, Li Fan waved his hand, and a myriad of cultivators appeared like stars densely packed in front of Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Worth utilizing?" Gao Yuan was initially stunned.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about the great task of rebuilding the Immortal City that the Island Master had mentioned earlier, his heart suddenly raced.</p><p></p><p>"You also know that I just woke up not long ago. I am not very familiar with the personnel within the Congyun Sea.," Li Fan whispered in front.</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly taking on this great task, I am also quite nervous, fearing that I might mess it up."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, a workman must first sharpen his tools. To smoothly complete this mission, I need to assemble a capable team."</p><p></p><p>"Since you have some understanding of them, why not assist me as a consultant."</p><p></p><p>"When laying the foundation of the Immortal City in the future, I will not forget your contributions!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gao Yuan suddenly felt his throat dry.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the cultivators who he once needed to be careful around, now standing in front of him, ready to be chosen by him, made him understand.</p><p></p><p>With just a word from him, they would join as a team to help this new Island Master establish his career.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So, this is what power feels like?"</p><p></p><p>His heart couldn't help but pound violently.</p><p></p><p>His face turned red, and the exhilarated Gao Yuan couldn't help but feel a bit heady.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not clouded by the momentary false glory.</p><p></p><p>He knew very well that the "power" he currently held was granted to him by the Island Master in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Until the construction of the Immortal City in the Congyun Sea was completed, all of this was just illusions, appearing beautiful but vulnerable to collapse and non-existence with just a slight flaw.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal City was successfully built, the chance for power to become real would present itself.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of being able to manipulate destiny at will was indeed too tempting, making Gao Yuan unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>So he secretly vowed to do his best, seize this rare opportunity, and complete the transformation of his professional career.</p><p></p><p>According to the list of cultivators, one after another, Gao Yuan detailedly introduced them to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened attentively to Gao Yuan's explanations, feeling delighted.</p><p></p><p>The abilities of the gatekeeper cultivator, whom he had occasionally seen in his previous life entering the Wanxian Alliance, far exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with the basic information of each cultivator to the point of knowing their temperaments, possible complex relationships behind them, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"I have struck gold."</p><p></p><p>As Gao Yuan's detailed introductions continued, Li Fan became more and more satisfied with him.</p><p></p><p>"Even small figures have their uses."</p><p></p><p>"This is where I can break through."</p><p></p><p>One suitable cultivator after another was selected by Li Fan and noted down in his mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>All surviving system cultivators in the Congyun Sea received a message from the acting island master.</p><p></p><p>In seven days, the ceremony for the reconstruction of the Immortal City in the original Wanxian Island location would be held.</p><p></p><p>All personnel must attend punctually.</p>

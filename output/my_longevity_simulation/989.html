        <h1>Chapter 989</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist seemed to be still immersed in the sensation of absorbing the golden power of desire for a while. Her expression was dazed, and her golden figure swayed rhythmically.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the rhythm gradually passed that her mind slowly regained clarity.</p><p></p><p>"The [Myriad Spirits Nectar], true immortals may not care about it. But for me now, it is indeed an extremely rare and nourishing substance." The Hundred Flowers Daoist sighed slightly and answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Spirits Nectar..." Li Fan deliberately pretended to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Emissary does not know much about this substance?" The Hundred Flowers Daoist, who had lived for countless years, immediately took the initiative to ask after observing Li Fan's expression.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan nod slightly: "I merely received the grace of true immortals occasionally. True immortals do not give much guidance, and everything is based on my own enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I did not intentionally deceive you before. I only know that there are immortals in the world, but I indeed do not know much about the specifics of immortals."</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan said this, he sensed a trace of jealousy from the Hundred Flowers Daoist.</p><p></p><p>However, the Hundred Flowers Daoist quickly restrained herself and said softly: "Since that's the case, I will clarify it for the Emissary. The so-called Myriad Spirits Nectar is the desire for the [Dao] from all things with spiritual intelligence in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Dao, not the Dao of cultivation. But refers to everything in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Born with desires, pursuing the Dao until death..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the destiny of us mortal beings."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully comprehended the words spoken by the Hundred Flowers Daoist, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Pursuing the Dao gives rise to the Nectar. This is the instinct of living beings and also a major law of the natural operation of the world. For true immortals, what may be valuable is the purest trace of the [Dao] within the desires of living beings pursuing the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"But for us mortal cultivators, this [Myriad Spirits Nectar] has the power to transform the decayed into the miraculous."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Listening to the Hundred Flowers Daoist's explanation, Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>The masses pursuing their own desires is the great Dao that drives the operation of the world, unchanging since ancient times. </p><p></p><p>If all living beings in the world had no desires, then the world would lose order, unable to function normally, and fall into a state of complete stillness.</p><p></p><p>What true immortals pursue is the trace of the great Dao that is born from driving the power of mortal desires.</p><p></p><p>The golden power of desire, which Li Fan named the [Myriad Spirits Nectar], is in fact the raw material for extracting the traces of the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>After the traces of the great Dao are absorbed, the golden power of desire is useless to that faceless true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is discarded.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was thinking this, he heard the Hundred Flowers Daoist say slowly: "The Glazed Body I cultivate borrows the visions of the flowers in the world from the people under heaven. It can be said to have the same origin as the Myriad Spirits Nectar. Moreover, it is much purer..."</p><p></p><p>"Not only for me, as long as it involves the desires of the masses, the Myriad Spirits Nectar has endless wonderful uses. Alchemy, crafting magical tools, making talismans - add some and the success rate will skyrocket."</p><p></p><p>"Consuming it during a breakthrough greatly reduces the possibility of failure."</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing a small amount during cultivation can also make cultivation several times more effective."</p><p></p><p>"It is even said to be able to create things out of thin air, directly transforming into the objects needed."</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Spirits Nectar has a promoting effect on anything driven by [desire]." The Hundred Flowers Daoist's tone was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest hesitated slightly, and then said with some uncertainty, "I have heard that the Wanling Qiong Jiang involves the desires of all living beings. The more it is used, the deeper the entanglement."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it will be more difficult to ascend to immortality in the future."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Baihua Taoist priest paused for a moment: "However, now that the path to immortality has long been severed, this side effect is equivalent to non-existent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>This is the right way. If the Wanling Qiong Jiang is really that wonderful, even if he can't use it himself, it doesn't matter if he keeps it. How could it be given to Li Fan for free? Only substances that are harmful to true immortals and deliberately abandoned by them make sense.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his head to look at the Baihua Taoist priest: "The Wanling Qiong Jiang is useless to true immortals. The right to use it is entirely mine. Baihua Taoist, rest assured, if you work steadfastly for the Compassionate Immortal, you will surely not lack it in the future."</p><p></p><p>A trace of joy appeared on the face of the Baihua Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you have already joined the Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal Sect, from today onwards, you are also a member of our Wanjie Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Let me first take you on a tour."</p><p></p><p>Next, the Baihua Taoist priest followed behind Li Fan and toured the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were not discovered by other people in the realm.</p><p></p><p>The Baihua Taoist priest sighed with emotion: "Although it is a small world, it is not much inferior to my hometown Wansheng."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was fixed on the furnaces of heaven and earth in various parts of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled: "To be honest, more than ten years ago, this place was just a tiny realm."</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because of the blessings bestowed by the true immortal that the Lingmu Realm is renewed day by day."</p><p></p><p>The Baihua Taoist priest nodded.</p><p></p><p>With her insight, she could naturally see that Li Fan's words were not false.</p><p></p><p>This realm is full of vitality and vigor. It is a sign of new life.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the secret room, Li Fan became serious again: "Ten thousand years ago, the Compassionate True Immortal's Tao was destroyed by the ruler of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I was fortunate to discover the stone statue of the true immortal and received the true immortal's grace. I vowed to restore the true immortal's Tao."</p><p></p><p>"Because the other party is powerful, I want to accumulate strength first and then unite the myriad realms to set things right!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan briefly introduced the ins and outs of the matter to the Baihua Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>The Baihua Taoist priest nodded: "I also have some understanding of the current situation in the Xuanhuang Realm. That Dharma Heavenly Venerable is indeed terrifying and fearsome, but..."</p><p></p><p>"If the envoy can obtain the help of the true immortal, then he is not worthy of fear at all."</p><p></p><p>After personally experiencing the Wanling Qiong Jiang, the Baihua Taoist priest had great confidence in the "Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "The true immortal's bestowment is unpredictable. Sometimes it descends continuously for no reason, and sometimes it is not seen for years. It is a long and arduous task to restore the true immortal's Tao! However, Baihua Taoist, I have a doubt that I have never understood."</p><p></p><p>"You said that the true immortal has already transcended and should be indifferent to these mundane matters. Why would there be rewards descending then?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the Baihua Taoist priest, trying to get an answer from her mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Baihua Taoist priest was slightly nervous. After thinking for a while, she gave her guess: "Perhaps it is not a blessing, but the remnant power after the true immortal absorbed the traces of the Tao?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, too much time has passed. I don't know what kind of state the immortals that still exist in the world have become."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a blessing, just a remnant of power. It's really depressing..." Li Fan muttered in his mouth, but there was not a trace of disappointment in his heart.</p>

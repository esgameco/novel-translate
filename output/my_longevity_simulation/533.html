        <h1>Chapter 533</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The wind ignored the barbarian bird beside it and asked kindly, "What Great Demon Gathering? I have no idea."</p><p></p><p>"I was entrusted by Senior Brother Lu Ya to bring a wooden box to you." Xu Ke's big eyes turned around, staring at the wind bird for a while, pretending to be innocent and said.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Ya?" The wind bird tilted its head, pondered for a moment, unable to recall the name. "Sounds familiar..."</p><p></p><p>"What wooden box? Let me see..." It casually said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Xu Ke seemed unguarded and took out a crimson wooden box.</p><p></p><p>An ancient and desolate aura suddenly emanated from it.</p><p></p><p>"This is!" The wind bird shuddered for a moment, almost losing balance and falling into the sea.</p><p></p><p>The white barbarian bird, on the other hand, didn't recognize it at first and carefully inspected the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>After a while, it let out a sharp cry.</p><p></p><p>Feathers stood on end, seemingly greatly stimulated.</p><p></p><p>About to say something, it was quickly stopped by the wind bird, who fanned a gust of wind to halt it.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it turns out to be sent by that one..."</p><p></p><p>"Kid, put it away quickly, if it attracts other guys, it won't be good." The wind bird awkwardly coughed, cautioning Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Without asking about the contents of the box, the wind bird awkwardly cleared its throat and repeatedly urged, "Kid, put it away quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Xu Ke obediently put away the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we are heading to the Southern Demon Mountain but can't find the way. Could you possibly take us there?" He widened his eyes, scratched his head, and hesitantly said.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, kid, did your elders at home not instruct you before you left? What Southern Demon Mountain, it should be called the Holy Beast Mountain!" The wind solemnly lectured.</p><p></p><p>"Disrespecting the Holy Beast Mountain like this, it's fortunate you met someone like me. If you encounter those cruel guys, you might be caught on the spot, your guts ripped out, and your heart eaten!" The wind threatened.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke tilted his head, thought for a moment, and with some confusion said, "But Grandpa San said when you arrive, don't be nervous, it's just like being back home. That's what my family members always say!"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa San..." The wind suddenly choked, hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly unruly barbarian bird also lowered its head, pretending not to have heard anything.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, as long as you are happy, kid." In the end, the wind bird chuckled, saying no more.</p><p></p><p>The group continued to head towards the extreme south.</p><p></p><p>During the journey, Xu Ke kept questioning the wind bird about various matters related to the demon beast tribe.</p><p></p><p>Including where they usually reside, how they interact with humans, their future plans, and how they view the Beast Control Sect.</p><p></p><p>After the slip of the tongue earlier, the wind bird became cautious. It only shared irrelevant topics with Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>And so, more than ten days passed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the legendary Southern Holy Beast Mountain loomed in the distance.</p><p></p><p>From afar, one could see a towering conical mountain standing at the junction of the blue sea and sky, seemingly appearing out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the mountain, like wearing a crown, there was a thick layer of pristine white snow.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the snow-covered peak, one could faintly see the outline of a majestic city.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had sharp eyes and even noticed that the location where the Southern Holy Beast Mountain was situated had become the boundary line of the entire Southern Sea.</p><p></p><p>The boundless sea seemed to abruptly stop at that point.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that lay a dark abyss-like scenery.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Holy Beast Mountain stood as the boundary between light and darkness, reality and illusion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Ke stunned and astonished by the magnificent sight before him, the wind couldn't help but feel a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Have you ever seen such a marvel."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called edge of heaven, the corner of the sea, the edge of the world, the origin of life, that's our Southern Holy Beast Mountain."</p><p></p><p>The wind also sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the earliest demon beasts in the world appeared here and then spread across the entire world."</p><p></p><p>"This is the sacred place in the hearts of all demon beasts. Although you were sent by that person, your human identity may prevent you from entering. So, it's not certain if you can go in."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what the Senior Wind said is correct. Even you, little black bird, although you have the identity of a demon beast, have been tamed by humans and acted as human companions, so you are not qualified to enter the Mountain." The barbarian bird, who had been silent, suddenly perked up.</p><p></p><p>It made a strange cry and without waiting for Xu Ke's response, fluttered its wings and turned into a white stream of light, heading straight for the distant mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke remained unconcerned, swinging the jade pendant hanging from his chest.</p><p></p><p>"No worries, before leaving, Senior Lu Ya told me that if I encounter trouble, showing this pendant will suffice."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu Ya wouldn't harm me."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qing, hurry up and follow!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the wind bird was about to advise further, it suddenly remembered something, its eyes showing more astonishment than when it sensed the aura of Di Mo before.</p><p></p><p>Because it clearly saw, on that jade pendant that flashed before its eyes, a single character that only demon beasts could read.</p><p></p><p>The wind bird finally recalled where it had heard the name Lu Ya before.</p><p></p><p>It was that person who single-handedly entered the Holy Beast Mountain with the body of a human, then withdrew unscathed.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

            <p>Surrounded and outnumbered, Li Ping showed no signs of panic. üéàüê†‚ùªÔºôùî∞ÔΩà·µò–ñ.·∂úùëúÔΩç‚òØüç´</p><p></p><p>These puppets were all driven by the source power refined and extracted through the Cangsheng Lingyuan technique. </p><p></p><p>And now, the Qizhi Lingyuan technique, which the Holy Dynasty had initiated for the people to cultivate, was an upgraded version of the Cangsheng Lingyuan technique.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, Li Ping could see how the source power influenced the puppets. The golden source power network within his body emitted bursts of invisible fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>The purity of the energy had already infinitely approached the essence of the source power, forming a natural suppression against the puppets manipulated by Qiao Gong.</p><p></p><p>In the span of a breath, dozens of puppets that had been staring fiercely in the secret room had already become unsteady and unable to stand.</p><p></p><p>Including that female puppet of the Shangguan clan.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong's face instantly turned extremely ugly. Having dealt with source power for most of his life, how could he not see the means by which this mysterious figure in front of him influenced the puppets?</p><p></p><p>He had already given up the idea of fighting the other party to the death and began to plan how to escape and simply abandon this body to be reborn from a memory backup.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the ever-changing expressions on Qiao Gong's face, Li Ping naturally saw through his little thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Unhurriedly, he revealed the locations where Qiao Gong had hidden his memory backups, one by one.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong was shocked to the core, unable to hide his astonishment any longer.</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth are you!" His voice was even slightly cracked due to fear.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't win in a fight and couldn't escape either.</p><p></p><p>Since fleeing to this Xuanhuang Realm, Qiao Gong had never felt so desperate. 6Õé9ÕésÕéhÕéuÕéxÕé.ÕécÕéoÕémÕé</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qiao Gong, don't misunderstand. I came here to offer you an opportunity," Li Ping said slowly.</p><p></p><p>However, his slightly gloomy tone, coupled with his obscured facial features, had no persuasive power at all.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong naturally didn't believe him and even felt more terrified in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because he had never mentioned the name Qiao Gong to anyone else in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The world only knew him as the mysterious Lingyuan Sect Leader.</p><p></p><p>Now, a faceless mysterious man had appeared who could reveal his background with a single sentence and seemed to know everything about him like the back of his hand!</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong even began to suspect if there were other survivors from the Tianji Realm besides him back then.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Qiao Gong's mind was in a mess. However, his chaotic thoughts all disappeared as Li Ping raised a dazzling golden orb of light in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Source power... essence?!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong exclaimed again, his face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take a closer look, Li Ping had already put away the golden orb.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, haven't you been seeking the source power essence in vain? I can teach you," Li Ping said, directly stunning Qiao Gong with this one sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, don't you want to recreate the immortal-level puppet [Zu]? I can also help you with that," Li Ping continued to say in a leisurely manner.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qiao Gong was already so shocked that he felt a bit numb. He wasn't even surprised that Li Ping knew about the existence of Zu. üíô‚ôûÔºñ‚ûàùî∞ùê°ùïå‰πÇ.cÔºØÁà™üêô‚òü</p><p></p><p>What if what the other party said was true?</p><p></p><p>"What are your conditions?" Qiao Gong asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping chuckled, "Seeing is believing. Please follow me first, Fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong followed behind Li Ping, traveling from Jiushan Prefecture all the way east, arriving at the depths of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Near an undersea volcano.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Gazing at this terrain, Qiao Gong vaguely sensed that a creature seemed to be slumbering in the earth fire veins below.</p><p></p><p>And Li...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Ping's next words confirmed his guess.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, a puppet with complete self-awareness?" Qiao Gong was somewhat skeptical.</p><p></p><p>"Not a direct puppet creation, but transforming one's body into a puppet through mysterious methods. Absorbing the power of the earth veins for thousands of years, yet still not completing the thorough metamorphosis. If it is awakened prematurely, I'm afraid it will lead to the puppet body being congenitally deficient. I brought you here, fellow Daoist, to see if you have any solutions." Li Ping said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Transforming one's body into an object?" Qiao Gong kept mulling over the meaning of these four words.</p><p></p><p>Then, a golden light shot out from his eyes, sweeping over the continuous earth veins below.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the golden light faded, and Qiao Gong nodded: "The puppet below, with the help of the uninterrupted tempering of the earth fire for a thousand years, its strength has indeed swelled to a level that was previously unattainable. But the intensity of the earth fire is limited in the first place. Even if it absorbs it for another thousand years, its strength is destined to stop at the perfection of Hua Shen. It is impossible to go further."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this earth fire array was laid down by him before he fell into slumber. After such a long time, the two have already shown signs of merging into one. If it is easily transformed, I'm afraid it will also awaken him."</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qiao Gong said thoughtfully: "Unless the earth fire itself that tempers this puppet undergoes a change."</p><p></p><p>"You know, the Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao is extremely mysterious, with many drastic changes in heaven and earth. And the earth fire is the manifestation of the power of the Heavenly Dao's laws..."</p><p></p><p>"However, this opportunity can be encountered but not sought." Qiao Gong said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping slowly spoke: "I understand."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a disciple of the Heavenly Mechanism Realm. My original plan was to use heavenly materials and earthly treasures to transform and sublimate the Earth Fire Returning to Origin Array. But now that I think about it, your suggestion is still better. Borrowing the power of heaven and earth to recreate the universe..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong was slightly startled, and then repeatedly emphasized: "I said, this opportunity can be encountered but not sought."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Li Ping smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, watch my methods."</p><p></p><p>After boasting, Li Ping closed his eyes and stood still.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after waiting for more than half a day, there was no movement at all.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the faint aura of refined source power still locking onto him, Qiao Gong would have thought of taking this opportunity to slip away.</p><p></p><p>But the situation was stronger than the person. If the other party didn't speak, he could only continue waiting.</p><p></p><p>This wait lasted for half a month.</p><p></p><p>It was only because Qiao Gong, as a grandmaster of artifact refinement, had an extraordinary state of mind that he could barely persist.</p><p></p><p>And in a place that Qiao Gong couldn't see, within the Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment Small World.</p><p></p><p>Those captured and mass-produced Youzu people from the flesh and blood factory began to pray to the Dark Sea again.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because they were born to be created to provide power for the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Almost without much teaching, the efficiency of prayer was several times higher than praying to the Faceless Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The subtle influence began to occur in the Profound Yellow World.</p><p></p><p>And the towering Great Enlightenment Faceless Holy Emperor at the bottom of the Congyun Sea also silently sensed this change in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The occurrence of certain things is not achieved overnight, but slowly accumulates.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, when Li Ping felt that this accumulation finally exceeded a certain threshold...</p><p></p><p>"Warping the principles of heaven and earth!" </p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor chanted lightly, his figure majestic, and lightly pointed towards the continuous earth vein fire below.</p><p></p><p>The action seemed like a joke, but a moment later, Qiao Gong, who had been watching from the side, was shocked!</p>

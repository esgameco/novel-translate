        <div class="content">
            <p>"In terms of safety, there is no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>"Just as the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance has always promoted, the Daoist cultivators have already exceeded the capabilities of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation."</p><p></p><p>"With your strength, Shaojun, you shouldn't be afraid of a mere formation, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If a little bit of freedom could be traded for enough benefits, I believe you, Shaojun, would be very willing."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly exists under the abyss and beyond the mist, could it be that Shaojun truly doesn't feel curious at all?"</p><p></p><p>After Jihongdao finished speaking, Shaojun's distorted figure reappeared on the Dust Ferry.</p><p></p><p>Without saying a word, he just looked coldly at Jihongdao, waiting for his next words.</p><p></p><p>Jihongdao was not surprised by his coming and going, "Once the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation is completely built, the Tianxuan Mirror will undergo a complete sublimation."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, there may be a great opportunity to settle unresolved matters from two hundred years ago."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, if the elevated Tianxuan Mirror wants to advance further, aside from encroaching on the territory of the Five Elders' Association, it can only explore towards the boundaries."</p><p></p><p>"As a breakthrough point, the Devouring Elemental White Mist will naturally not give up easily."</p><p></p><p>"As long as it frees up its energy, the Devouring Elemental White Mist will surely be unable to stop. It's just a matter of how much time it will take."</p><p></p><p>"All Shaojun has to do is be patient."</p><p></p><p>"So many years have passed, does it really matter at this moment?"</p><p></p><p>Shaojun didn't seem to be swayed by Jihongdao, his voice slightly mocking, "Jihongdao, you really haven't changed at all."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for a response, his figure disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Jihongdao slowly turned his head, looking back at the busy cultivators in the distant Immortal Stronghold, a faint smile appearing on his lips.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Li Fan's hard work in the bellowing abyss officially began.</p><p></p><p>In charge of assisting in building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation were the formation masters, in addition to Xue Mu, there were also five cultivators under the Tian Yu Prefecture's Array Hall.</p><p></p><p>Unlike in the usual domain where they only needed to consider constructing a formation and not worry about safety.</p><p></p><p>Building the Locking Spirit Formation outside the bellowing abyss was extremely difficult and required the joint effort of many departments.</p><p></p><p>First, the garrison stationed at the Eternal Immortal Stronghold, called the Quing Xuan, under layered protections, painstakingly cleared a blank passage in the white mist where formations could be arranged.</p><p></p><p>Following that, the cultivators from the Tianji Hall selected suitable locations within the passage.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Yanwu Hall collaborated with the Quing Xuan garrison to quickly create dozens of footholds before the white mist reclaimed the territory.</p><p></p><p>These footholds were where Li Fan and the others rested after each formation was set up.</p><p></p><p>To improve construction efficiency, at the suggestion of the experienced formation master Dou Xingsi, they employed the method of multi-point blooming and simultaneous construction for the Locking Spirit Formation enveloping the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Seven formation masters each began expanding outward from a different direction and eventually merged the outer formations before constructing the central core formation.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, after everything was ready, they placed the core formation pivot and did the final adjustments.</p><p></p><p>The plan had no major issues, but during the actual construction, it was extremely arduous.</p><p></p><p>Even someone as tenacious as Li Fan was almost exhausted by the process of constructing formations.</p><p></p><p>For example, to set up formation nodes in the white mist, they had to first expel the Devouring Elemental White Mist.</p><p></p><p>The vacuum zones opened by the Quing Xuan army were not sustainable.</p><p></p><p>Before the white mist returned, Li Fan had to race against time to complete the manufacturing of a small formation node to connect it to other formation structures later.</p><p></p><p>If a mistake or accident led to completing only half of the work within the specified time, facing the resurgence of the Devouring Elemental White Mist, Li Fan had no choice but to retreat temporarily.</p><p></p><p>It was as good as starting from scratch next time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the previously constructed formation nodes were already submerged in thick white mist.</p><p></p><p>If any issues arose requiring maintenance, Li Fan had to risk his life, accompanied by several cultivators, to venture into the mist for investigation.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, throughout the whole process, they had to be constantly vigilant against the invasion of the Abyssal Magic Sound.</p><p></p><p>The eruption of the magic sound mostly followed a pattern, like the tides.</p><p></p><p>The Quing Xuan army would provide the time of each sound tide's arrival for Li Fan and others to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also sudden situations where a surge of magic sound would attack.</p><p></p><p>Although the location where Li Fan was constructing the formations was outside the abyss, the magic sound had passed through the Eternal Immortal Stronghold, and most of its power had already been absorbed.</p><p></p><p>But facing the true onslaught of the magic sound, Li Fan truly felt like a flame extinguishing in a storm.</p><p></p><p>The resentful, sharp, and terrifying sounds surrounded him, causing his senses to almost go astray.</p><p></p><p>Once the danger even caused a sharp decrease in the protective energy shield of the 'Zhen Zhen'.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, the Quing Xuan army was professional in handling the Abyssal Magic Sound.</p><p></p><p>They protected Li Fan in the center while each took out unique treasures that could absorb sound.</p><p></p><p>There were peculiar dark stones full of cavities, faceless human faces with only two ears, green grass that danced with sound, and many other varieties.</p><p></p><p>Even the exotic beasts with red fur from Wanlai Island Li Fan had seen several times.</p><p></p><p>The effects were exceptionally significant.</p><p></p><p>Once used, the terrifying magic sounds that had been raging a moment ago vanished instantly.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan keenly noticed that after absorbing a certain amount of magic sound, these exotic beasts and treasures seemed to undergo some changes.</p><p></p><p>The beasts became more frenzied and uncontrollable, while the treasures would occasionally emit strange sounds on their own.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Quing Xuan army usually replaced these treasures periodically.</p><p></p><p>Once their reserves were almost depleted, they had to replenish supplies at the Eternal Immortal Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the sound-absorbing treasures, the maintenance of the base and the 'Black Death Symbols' that allowed the cultivators to survive in the Devouring Elemental White Mist were also consumables.</p><p></p><p>If, for some reason, the deployment was delayed, the construction would be forced to halt.</p><p></p><p>Overall, building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation in the vast white mist was definitely several times more difficult than in an ordinary domain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of this, despite the slow progress, Li Fan's ranking in the Great Comparison Golden List was not far behind.</p><p></p><p>What was even more eye-catching than the top-ranked individuals was the one at the 783rd position.</p><p></p><p>Golden Core cultivator Guo Yezhong.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a year had passed since the beginning of the formal Great Comparison, but his points remained at zero, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>He was the only one on the entire list in this situation, making him more conspicuous than even the first-ranked individual.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 432</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Unlike you, in Dalí, there stands a towering volcano at the center."</p><p></p><p>"Every once in a while, the volcano erupts, taking away countless lives."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in recent years, its activities have become increasingly frequent."</p><p></p><p>"It is clear that the ultimate fate of Dalí is to be completely engulfed by the lava of the volcano."</p><p></p><p>"Centuries ago, I came to the Xuánhuáng Realm alone, trying to find a way to save my homeland."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked back with nostalgia as he spoke to Li Chenfeng and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, although I found a way to temporarily suppress the volcano, with my current cultivation level, I am unable to completely eradicate the hidden dangers."</p><p></p><p>"However, that is not the main point."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly changing the topic, Li Fan continued, "During my time in the Xuánhuáng Realm, I encountered many ordinary people who, like me, crossed over from small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"They often lead extremely difficult lives. Touched by their plight, I often try my best to lend a helping hand."</p><p></p><p>"It is because of this that I was able to join the organization I am with today. This is also the reason why I have come to find you all today."</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng and the others were stunned, "What organization?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said extremely seriously, "An organization that aims to unite all the lands outside the realms and launch a counterattack against the immortal cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>"A counterattack against the immortal cultivation world?" The three of them present were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood with his hands behind his back, nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years ago, we were exiled from our homeland with pain and resentment. Over the long years, the memories of most people about their homeland have faded."</p><p></p><p>"But there is still a group of people who always keep these memories in their hearts."</p><p></p><p>"They vowed that one day, they will return here. They will reclaim everything that originally belonged to them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked into the distance with determination and said in a voice filled with seduction, "Compared to the small worlds we are in, the Xuánhuáng Realm is vast."</p><p></p><p>"It is teeming with life and abundance."</p><p></p><p>"Yet it is occupied by those cursed immortal cultivators. And we can only live in barren, cramped territories, struggling for survival."</p><p></p><p>"How unfair!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng and the others compared the world of the empire with the Xuánhuáng Realm, nodding in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"We understand very well that our own strength is too weak compared to the vast alliance of immortal cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Only by uniting all our strengths, do we stand a chance of competing with them."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, five hundred years ago, we made an attempt."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, at that time, we did not have enough unity and ultimately failed."</p><p></p><p>"However, we did not give up."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were piercing as he looked at Li Chenfeng and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Over these years, we have been searching for new allies, rebuilding our strength."</p><p></p><p>"There are countless small worlds outside the realms, and no one knows exactly how many are yet to be united."</p><p></p><p>"But just like you, those who have crossed over are always cautious in their actions, hence the progress is slow."</p><p></p><p>"It was only recently that I noticed you, and after some probing, indeed..."</p><p></p><p>Zhù Shǎo Táng seemed to have remembered something and said, "The battle against the immortal cultivation world five hundred years ago?"</p><p></p><p>"In the history of the Xuánhuáng Realm that the empire has collected, indeed, there is such an event."</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng’s eyes flickered with some regret, but he quickly concealed it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he carefully asked, "So, Senior, are you here this time to invite our empire to join the organization?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>When Zhù Shǎo Táng was about to speak, he was stopped by Li Chenfeng.</p><p></p><p>This young man seemed to be in a leading position among the three.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan and answered somewhat implicitly, "The grand goal of the organization, this junior admires greatly."</p><p></p><p>"But our empire is too weak. Even if we join the organization, we may not be of much help. It might even become a burden..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted Li Chenfeng's words with a raised hand.</p><p></p><p>"Though not very strong, among the numerous worlds that have joined the organization, you are already ranked slightly above average."</p><p></p><p>"You don't have to belittle yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Li Chenfeng with a half-smile, saying, "Moreover, even those small worlds that entirely lack extraordinary powers, the organization has not rejected their applications to join."</p><p></p><p>"After all, every bit of strength is beneficial. Even without power, you can still contribute."</p><p></p><p>"The organization will train qualified fighters free of charge."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone left no room for refusal, and Li Chenfeng's smile gradually became forced.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to resist, but seeing Li Fan's expression turning cold, Li Chenfeng's heart sank gradually.</p><p></p><p>Tension began to spread in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>However, inexplicably, after a while, Li Fan seemed to relax again.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, he said, "I didn't want to tell you this originally, but it seems like you still cling to that ridiculous escape plan."</p><p></p><p>"You are just a bunch of weak fleeing cowards..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said coldly, "To tell you the truth, your plan to use one hundred thousand Split-Realm Whales to escape from Xuánhuáng Realm is simply impossible."</p><p></p><p>"The moment you leave Xuánhuáng Realm will be the day of your empire's destruction!"</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng and his companions were completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by this, Senior?" </p><p></p><p>"See for yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed towards the foreheads of the three.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Chenfeng felt the surrounding scenery disappear.</p><p></p><p>As if placed in an endless void.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a huge sphere of light shimmered.</p><p></p><p>A stream of light flew out from the sphere of light, trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, when it had moved a certain distance away from the sphere of light.</p><p></p><p>Its flight trajectory changed, irreversible and rose upwards.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng and his companions broke out in cold sweats, falling to the ground in confusion and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?"</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at Li Fan, his eyes full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you think we are fighting desperately to counterattack the immortal cultivation world?"</p><p></p><p>"Because we have nowhere else to go."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>"That is the 'Immortal Ruins,' a terrifying unknown entity that casts greedy eyes on the entire Xuánhuáng Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuánhuáng Realm is vast and huge, perhaps it could endure for a while against the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"But for the small worlds we are in, it's uncertain."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention, the ridiculous and laughable plan your empire came up with."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to hit Li Chenfeng with his words.</p><p></p><p>The three from the empire also realized the kind of fate awaiting them if they escaped from Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>Their faces turned extremely pale.</p><p></p><p>"So, joining us is the only way out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said calmly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 876</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Golden Chain Breaks the Void?" Tian Yang was slightly stunned, but he reacted after a moment. </p><p></p><p>"It seems like there was such a scene. But I don't quite understand what it means, so I didn't pay too much attention to it."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang was more focused on the application of the spatial power contained within the Huangquan spirit body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who didn't know much about spatial abilities in the first place, concentrated all his attention on those ancient secrets.</p><p></p><p>Like the blind men touching an elephant, each had a different perspective.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the Huangquan water here again.</p><p></p><p>"This great river can be called the creation river of the Hunyin Realm. But the cycle of life and death has been destroyed. Even if more power is added to it, its behavior of constantly evolving spirit bodies is destined to lead to a day when it will dry up."</p><p></p><p>"When the Huangquan dries up, billions of spirit bodies will drift out..."</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, this process may take thousands or even tens of thousands of years. It happened prematurely in the 115th world, most likely because that three-eyed skull was brought into the Huangquan for some reason."</p><p></p><p>"In order to be reborn, that skull absorbed all the power of the Huangquan water."</p><p></p><p>The insights from his previous life and the on-site investigation in this life allowed Li Fan to deduce the possible truth of what happened in this most remote subsidiary small world of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan did not touch this still endlessly living Huangquan water.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving with Tian Yang, Li Fan silently thought, "If there is an attempt to escape the Xuanhuang Realm in this world, perhaps this Hunyin Realm is an excellent testing ground."</p><p></p><p>After passing through the long spatial passage and taking nearly a month, Li Fan and Tian Yang finally returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Half a year passed, and the flames of war between the Five Elders Council and the Wanxian Alliance had also been fully ignited.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Li Fan didn't expect that this time, the one who took the initiative to provoke the dispute turned out to be the Wanxian Alliance, which had always been at a disadvantage before.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they made a move, they caught the Five Elders Council off guard and even captured the lost territory of Jiushan Prefecture in one fell swoop!</p><p></p><p>Those fortresses that the Five Elders Council had built on the nine mountain ranges with great effort seemed completely like a joke!</p><p></p><p>Having achieved such war results, the Wanxian Alliance, contrary to the norm, did not widely publicize it.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance members only knew that there was continuous good news coming from the front, but as to how the Wanxian Alliance achieved such incredible war results, there were various opinions and no reliable conclusion.</p><p></p><p>It's just that everyone speculated that it might have something to do with the previous "Thirty-Three Immortal Candidates" plan.</p><p></p><p>During this half year, Ji Shaoli's avatar stationed on Haixuan Island also went to the fishing pond by the small temple, trying to learn the truth of that battle from the stone tablet senior.</p><p></p><p>But the other party seemed to be immersed in the comprehension of the Dao of "Fishing" and completely ignored him.</p><p></p><p>And due to the defeat on the front line, the Five Elders Council seemed to have become somewhat distrustful of the "Wanjie Alliance".</p><p></p><p>Several attempts to actively contact and try to figure out the inside story of the war were met with no response.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli could only put it aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Ling had gradually become familiar with Liuli during this period.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Ling had the cultivation of Hedao, she was born not long ago and had a childlike nature, not putting on the airs of a senior at all.</p><p></p><p>Every time, she would take the initiative to find Liuli to play.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, this little Daotong, who looked silly and cute on the outside but was actually a bit alert, let down his guard.</p><p></p><p>This originally somewhat dazed innate spirit seemed to have some...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He had "opened his mind".</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he had become more "human".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the little Taoist disciple hiding behind Lin Ling, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't bother with her for the time being, and only instructed Lin Ling: "Come with me to the border of Jiushan State."</p><p></p><p>In the past, Lin Ling would have simply nodded in agreement without asking anything.</p><p></p><p>But this time, a hint of doubt flashed in Lin Ling's eyes, as if she wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, but he still explained simply: "During my six-month trip this time, I made some new discoveries. They might be of some help to the current situation of the Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Lin Ling bid farewell to Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she led Li Fan, traveling through the surging earth veins.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the two arrived at a remote place in Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>After scouting around and confirming there were no cultivators lying in ambush, they quietly emerged from underground.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping their divine sense, looking at this familiar yet very strange "Jiushan State", both Li Fan and Lin Ling were momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid Jiushan State will have to change its name in the future," Li Fan sighed slightly after coming back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>On the land of Jiushan State, the nine majestic mountain ranges that originally traversed the area had been completely leveled by some unknown power.</p><p></p><p>The originally strategically important state had suddenly turned into a flat plain.</p><p></p><p>However, the space formed by the corpse of the exotic beast [Tian] was inherently unstable.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing a world-shocking great war, this instability became even more prominent.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, black spatial cracks could be seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>They kept appearing and disappearing like lightning.</p><p></p><p>"When Tianyang finishes his closed-door cultivation and comprehension, perhaps I can bring him here for a visit," this thought flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there seems to be a remnant of an extremely terrifying aura here," Lin Ling's focus was different from Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and then said with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Dharma Transmission made a move?"</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan quickly denied this speculation.</p><p></p><p>"If it doesn't involve the safety of the Xuanhuang Realm itself, the Dharma Transmission should remain indifferent to disputes at this level."</p><p></p><p>"But apart from the Dharma Transmission, which Longevity Realm powerhouse does the Myriad Immortals Alliance have?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Dongj√≠, who only exists in classical records, or the curator of the Museum of Wonders, Emperor Sanmo?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also thought of the rumors among the people of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Could it really be the Thirty-Three Immortal Chosen One plan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had once gifted a piece of the Final Dissociation Disk he had cut off to Wei Qizheng, one of the Immortal Chosen Ones.</p><p></p><p>Although it didn't have the real-time transmission communication function, it could record most of what Wei Qizheng experienced in detail.</p><p></p><p>As long as he met Wei Qizheng again, or at the moment of Wei Qizheng's death and the disk's destruction, the stored information could be synchronized to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although he was somewhat curious about the methods of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, Li Fan also knew that now was not the time to reap the fruits.</p><p></p><p>The longer this nail was hidden, the more secret information he could know.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a little longer."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing this thought, Li Fan first triggered the special fluctuations to contact the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time, still no one responded.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't give up.</p><p></p><p>He triggered it again and again.</p><p></p><p>In this way, after repeating it seven times, a faint response came from somewhere in Jiushan State.</p>

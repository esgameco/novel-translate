            <p>Chapter 1116: Strategic Relocation</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bitter victory, in these three confrontations, the Lingmu Realm didn't actually suffer much loss. It was merely a bit of energy accumulation.</p><p></p><p>If the Wanxian Alliance were to retreat now, or be deterred by the strength currently displayed by the Lingmu Realm and temporarily suspend their attack, the Lingmu Realm would quickly be able to replenish this energy loss.</p><p></p><p>However, it was very obvious that the Wanxian Alliance wouldn't be scared off so easily.</p><p></p><p>The Annihilation Beast, having lost its attack target, wandered aimlessly for a while. Then, as if it caught a whiff of the delicious aura from the Xuanhuang Realm on the other side of the spatial passage, it actually changed its target.</p><p></p><p>The spatial rift was torn open again, and that aura that made Li Fan's heart palpitate also vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Before the people of the Lingmu Realm had time to celebrate, the entire Lingmu Realm began to shake violently without any warning.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>As the master of the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan in the Underworld Prison was the first to sense the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"The anchored position of the Lingmu Realm in the Xuanhuang Great World is changing!"</p><p></p><p>"Are they trying to cut off the source instead of confronting head-on, and directly annihilate the small world?"</p><p></p><p>Once, the Wanxian Alliance had forcibly relocated the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven located in the Tianling Prefecture to the central hinterland prefectures. Now, the actual scale of the Lingmu Realm was still not as large as the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven. Even though it had been reinforced by Li Fan's array refining, it seemed unable to prevent the Wanxian Alliance from relocating it by brute force.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even though his true body was far from the battlefield, through the sensing of the Holy Infant and his avatar, Li Fan had already seen what method the Wanxian Alliance was using to relocate the world from the tremors of the world.</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Starry Sky Grand Array!" A glint flashed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long coveted this magnificent grand array created by the Mysterious Heavenly King and used by the Xuanhuang Realm to capture other immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>However, even though his Ultimate Decomposition Disk had almost evolved to the level of an immortal artifact, it was still powerless against this starry sky grand array and unable to forcibly deduce it.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that besides the array, there were some other unknown factors within it.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan previously inquired about the ins and outs of this array from the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror, it repeatedly beat around the bush and fobbed him off with other grand arrays.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan had never seen the true face of this array.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, today, he encountered it while the Lingmu Realm was being besieged.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of consciousness of his true body, the Decomposition Disk emitted an excited faint white light, flashing and changing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"Glimpsing a leopard through a tube, one can see a spot. But the Decomposition Disk can infer the overall picture of the grand array from this partial view."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, as an opponent of the Wanxian Alliance, one can instead witness more of their hidden cards."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very satisfied with the results of this probe.</p><p></p><p>Just as the anchored position of the Lingmu Realm was gradually shifting, the initial deduction of the Decomposition Disk on Li Fan's side had already yielded results.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror didn't lie, the grand array is indeed severely damaged."</p><p></p><p>"What the Wanxian Alliance is currently employing is precisely the ability of the Floating Starry Sky Grand Array that spans the starry sea to lock onto and pull in worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the speed at which the Lingmu Realm is now being forced to move, the might of the grand array is less than one ten-thousandth of when it was intact. But absorbing the entire Lingmu Realm is still a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>"No, no..."</p><p></p><p>"Something is still missing."</p><p></p><p>No matter how the Decomposition Disk calculated, with its understanding of arrays, it was unable to construct an array that had the same function as the ancient Floating Starry Sky Grand Array.</p><p></p><p>This once again confirmed Li Fan's previous speculation.</p><p></p><p>This [Floating Starry Sky Grand Array] was indeed not only</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>It was just a simple formation.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder with the resources to pass on the method, they haven't been able to successfully restore this formation for so many years. They still have to painstakingly go to the void to scavenge for world remnants," Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Although the full picture of the grand formation couldn't be seen, the power that the Myriad Immortals Alliance mobilized was also a defective one.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's instructions, the confused people of the Spirit Wood Realm quickly took action.</p><p></p><p>As a formation took shape on the land of the Spirit Wood Realm, an invisible fluctuation enveloped the entire small world. And the Spirit Wood Realm, which was being dragged and moving rapidly, instantly seemed to break off contact.</p><p></p><p>The shaking gradually lessened and finally stopped at an unknown location.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately checked the current position of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, it had already shifted from the eastern part of the Myriad Immortals Alliance to the south.</p><p></p><p>It was now not far from the Great Vortex of the Shattered Realm.</p><p></p><p>"They plan to use the natural power of the shattered realm to directly shatter the world? The Myriad Immortals Alliance really played a good hand."</p><p></p><p>Being able to dispel the power of the Floating Star Void, the performance of the Spirit Wood Realm this time truly far exceeded the expectations of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a divergence within, and they did not continue the attack.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could vaguely sense that in the surrounding void, immortal alliance cultivators were constantly emerging, surrounding the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren, Yaowang Sect and others also sensed the current situation, and their faces turned a bit unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the so-called desperate fight of a trapped beast."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I still didn't consider thoroughly enough in this life. Perhaps when building the Spirit Wood Realm base again next time, the ability to instantly teleport the entire small world can be added."</p><p></p><p>"Before today, it was still a bit difficult to achieve this. But with the demonstration of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, hehe..." Li Fan sneered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>All the blades imposed on Li Fan will inevitably be returned a thousand times over.</p><p></p><p>"Emissary, I think we can't sit and wait for death anymore," Liu Ruchen proposed in a deep voice at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Although the various defensive measures of the Spirit Wood Realm are perfect, they definitely can't withstand the endless consumption of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Perhaps breaking out and fighting to the death might give us a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>"The capacity of the Yaowang True Cauldron has been expanded several times after these years of modification, it should be able to take most people together," Fang Zaiji also added.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen's opinion was recognized by the vast majority of people.</p><p></p><p>They all looked at the Holy Fetus Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Saving people but losing land, both people and land can be preserved; saving land but losing people, both people and land will be lost."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, everyone should prepare for the transfer," Li Fan nodded and agreed with everyone's plan.</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately dispersed with a roar.</p><p></p><p>Some were responsible for monitoring the entrance of the spatial passage to deal with possible sneak attacks from the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The others quickly transferred the resources and population of the Myriad Worlds United Association.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the anchored position of the Spirit Wood Realm itself had not shifted, Li Fan had previously prepared a plan to cut off the tail to survive.</p><p></p><p>That was to transfer to the small worlds connected to the Empire, other realms, etc.</p><p></p><p>Then destroy the spatial passages.</p><p></p><p>Although it couldn't completely stop the pursuit of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, it could delay them for a few days.</p><p></p><p>However, unfortunately, during the recent transfer of the Spirit Wood Realm, its own position shifted. This caused the passages to all the affiliated small worlds to be severed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, if they wanted to withdraw, the only possible direction was to forcibly kill a bloody path out of the encirclement of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>

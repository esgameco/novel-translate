            <p>Chapter 1190: The Sage Imparts the Dao</p><p></p><p>While Li Ping and Yin Shangren were conversing, the black-haired youth who had enlightened himself to a path of the "Primordial Golden Core" experienced a rapid decline in his vital signs. Eventually, he completely lost the aura that a living being should possess.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not die.</p><p></p><p>The black-haired youth still sat there quietly, his physical and spiritual powers circulating spontaneously.</p><p></p><p>Vast and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, he couldn't hold on. He completely assimilated with the consciousness of the cave heaven and lost himself." Yin Shangren sighed deeply, his face full of regret.</p><p></p><p>"His original strength was too weak, and the target he chose was not quite appropriate. If he had chosen the slightly smaller cave heaven next to it, he might have had a chance to survive."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's gaze also lingered on the black-haired youth for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"What was his name?"</p><p></p><p>"Qu Wentian."</p><p></p><p>"A good name. But there's still one thing I don't understand." Li Ping's voice echoed in the spacious secret chamber, "With the Foundation Establishment realm, is it really possible to seize the fortune of a cave heaven? The cave heaven that disappeared was called 'Abyssal Wilderness'. Although it looked small from the outside, its scale was almost equivalent to half of the small world of the Great Inception..."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe this kid had extraordinary talent." After a long silence, Yin Shangren couldn't come up with a reason either and could only answer like this.</p><p></p><p>"You should know that people are different. Some things that seem impossible for us to accomplish are just a casual act in the eyes of others. Although the 'Primordial Golden Core' path opened up by Qu Wentian is destined to be walked by only a very small number of people, it has also inspired me."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren looked at Li Ping, his expression turning solemn: "You're right. If we want to completely shatter the dominant position of the new Dharma Transmission method, our new new method must not be a path for the minority and full of hardships."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the reason why the cultivation way of Dharma Transmission could spread like wildfire throughout the entire Xuanhuang world in an instant, and continue unabated despite the suppression of the Ten Sects, eventually replacing them, was because it had almost no threshold, right? The attribute that the new new method should have is that everyone can cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"I thought about it. The reason why Qu Wentian was able to break through the realm based on 'Foundation Establishment with Myself' was that he seized the fortune of the cave heaven world. Conversely, the fortune of the world should be the most crucial factor for the 'Primordial Golden Core'."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren spoke faster and faster, and his expression became somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"No external objects, everyone can cultivate, the fortune of the world..."</p><p></p><p>"By combining these three necessary conditions, we can glimpse the true ideal of the Primordial Golden Core!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren waved his hand, and one after another childlike face illusions appeared in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>"Seizing the fortune of the world is not for the sake of the fortune itself, but for the transformation of the fortune. The fortune of the world is an existence that is extremely mysterious and difficult to understand for ordinary people. Only by forcibly possessing it through 'devouring' and making it a part of oneself can one slowly comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"But if there is a supremely wise teacher who instructs in detail his understanding of the fortune of the world..."</p><p></p><p>"I believe that even immature children can comprehend its Dao!" Yin Shangren said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Ping's somewhat disbelieving eyes, he said, "How complex and inconceivable does the method of 'Foundation Establishment with Myself' seem to outsiders? But for those I have taught since childhood, and in their cognition, in this world..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of children who only have this one method of cultivation, it is not so difficult to learn. Especially after the first "Building Foundation with Self" is successful, it's as if a bottleneck is broken through, and successful individuals emerge one after another.</p><p></p><p>"As it is with 'Building Foundation with Self', so it is with 'Primordial Golden Elixir'."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the new method should vary from person to person. Imitating the world's changes within one's own body to form the primordial may not necessarily require the pursuit of the ultimate. After all, the world varies in size, and the aptitude and potential of cultivators also differ. Fully unleashing one's own potential is already enough..."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing needed is to find such a 'Supremely Sagely Master' somewhere. Not only does he have the ultimate understanding of the world's Dao, but he can also share his insights with others patiently and without reservation..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Yin Shangren looked at the Destined Holy Emperor before him. </p><p></p><p>"Although I am willing to be the teacher of the world, I'm afraid..." Li Ping's tone paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>"My own understanding of the world's Dao is insufficient, so how can I teach others?"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you need to carefully consider your path of 'Primordial Golden Elixir'."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was also powerless to refute, and a hint of unwillingness and confusion flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping came with high spirits but left in disappointment. </p><p></p><p>Leaving Yin Shangren on the spot, he returned alone.</p><p></p><p>He properly reassured Baihua Daoren, who had hurried over thinking that the Xuanhuang Realm was under attack by the Wanxian Alliance and was searching for enemies.</p><p></p><p>He also rewarded her with some "Golden Source Power" as a commendation.</p><p></p><p>As a pure crystallization of cultivation, Golden Source Power is a great nourishment for Baihua, a pure energy body.</p><p></p><p>Baihua first expressed her gratitude, and then solemnly absorbed it.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Fellow Daoist, what you gave this time..."</p><p></p><p>Before Baihua Daoren could finish a complete sentence after swallowing the Golden Source Power, it turned into an unbelievable exclamation.</p><p></p><p>"How is it so dense?"</p><p></p><p>"It's even like..."</p><p></p><p>"Source Power Essence?!"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren looked at Li Fan in utter shock.</p><p></p><p>Her crystal body became more brilliant and solid at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>Years of hidden injuries were slowly healed, and even the subtle connection with the Fishing Pond that had always persisted after her escape seemed to become negligible under the washing of the Golden Source Power.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, as Baihua Daoren looked at the faceless Holy Emperor before her, his unfathomably deep figure slowly imprinted in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not explain anything, only leaving Baihua with an extremely mysterious back view.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he has already come so close to the realm of True Immortals?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua was extremely shocked in her heart, but the Golden Source Power surging in her body that far surpassed the mortal realm seemed to be the best evidence for her speculation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As an avatar, Li Ping's realm naturally had not surpassed his true body.</p><p></p><p>He still remained at the Nascent Soul stage, and even the vast majority of his combat power came from the great fortune of the Holy Dynasty, while his own strength was pitifully weak.</p><p></p><p>The reason he was able to produce golden energy essence infinitely close to Source Power Essence was precisely because of a group of special people.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the Holy Emperor's seat, deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Perpetually dark, without a trace of sunlight.</p><p></p><p>However, a group of people lived here, completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Every day, apart from normal daily life, their most important task was to pray to the stone statue of the Holy Emperor.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 461</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Passing by the Formation Hall and continuing towards the inner city, Li Fan stopped in front of a building with a stone tablet engraved with the character "武" at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw this character, Li Fan felt a sense of solemnity and oppression enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>Several illusions seemed to appear before his eyes, as if he was about to be attacked by swords and knives in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good character, but compared to the '乱' character stone I saw before, it lacks a bit of flavor," Li Fan thought to himself, suppressing the instinctive urge to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, he walked into the Martial Hall without changing his face.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Formation Hall that Li Fan was more familiar with, there were many overlapping spaces for teleportation. The main view of this Martial Hall was composed of many huge stones floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>Strange and rugged stones, scattered in space like a sky full of stars.</p><p></p><p>At a sudden glance, each stone had a unique shape.</p><p></p><p>Some resembled human figures or beasts, while others resembled mountains or water.</p><p></p><p>On the huge stones, one could vaguely see pavilions, grass, trees, and occasional passing figures.</p><p></p><p>The floating stone Li Fan was standing on at the moment was extremely special.</p><p></p><p>It was bare and smooth, as if polished like a mirror.</p><p></p><p>There were faint rays of light flowing beneath the surface of the stone. When Li Fan stepped onto the huge stone, a formation was activated, and he felt himself uncontrollably transported to the center of the flying stone. A mysterious energy surged from underneath his feet, like invisible shackles binding him firmly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, as Li Fan looked up, the countless floating stones around him also underwent inexplicable changes.</p><p></p><p>The position where Li Fan was originally located was a humble corner in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>But after being imprisoned, the scene in the air changed rapidly, as if the stars were revolving.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan seemed to be in the center of the starry sky, becoming the absolute focus of this space.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan felt the countless gazes hidden behind the various huge stones all falling on him.</p><p></p><p>Truly the center of attention!</p><p></p><p>Each gaze felt as heavy as a mountain, and for ordinary cultivators who had not seen much of the world or had poor mental endurance, they might have kneeled and collapsed on the ground instantly.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan remained calm and composed, showing no sign of unease.</p><p></p><p>After a brief confrontation, a solemn voice resonated from the stone sea, continuously echoing.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator Li Fan, due to the abnormality in the '普閒真葉價格', you are summoned to appear and undergo an investigation."</p><p></p><p>"This investigation will be conducted by the Martial Hall of the Cong Yunhai, with the cooperation of the Cong Yunhai Tianji Hall and the Political Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Due to the wide-ranging impact and extremely malicious nature of this incident, the Immortal Alliance Headquarters will send a special envoy to oversee the entire process."</p><p></p><p>"In adherence to the principles of fairness, justice, and transparency, this investigation process will not be kept confidential and will be supervised by all members of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a lengthy introduction by the grand voice, the investigation finally reached the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator Li Fan, during the investigation, you may defend yourself."</p><p></p><p>"However, you will be held accountable for the truthfulness of every word you speak. If any concealment or deception is discovered, you will be punished according to the laws of the Immortal Alliance, depending on the severity of the situation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan nodded, indicating his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I declare that the investigation officially begins."</p><p></p><p>"Please Martial Hall, Jin Chongcheng, summarize the events of this incident."</p><p></p><p>A beam of light flashed, and a cultivator wearing the standard uniform of the Wanxian Alliance Martial Hall appeared out of thin air above the flying stone where Li Fan was standing.</p><p></p><p>Although he was positioned higher than Li Fan, he looked up at the sky filled with floating stones and began to speak.</p><p></p><p>"The abnormal fluctuation in the price of '普閒真葉' was caused by a sentence spoken by Cultivator Li Fan sixteen days ago."</p><p></p><p>"He conveyed the message 'the price of 普賢真葉 will soar' through Jiao Xiuyuan to the outside world, and then..."</p><p></p><p>Jin Chongcheng briefly summarized the cause and effect of the matter, and with his words, images appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Charts showing the price fluctuation curve of 普閒真葉, scenes of cultivators frantically buying, and the appearance of countless loss-stricken cultivators after the incident with the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, we have noted that Cultivator Li Fan had already purchased a large amount of stock before the increase in the price of 普閒真葉. He then sold at a high point, making a significant profit."</p><p></p><p>"In conclusion, we believe that Cultivator Li Fan is suspected of disseminating false information, exploiting the herd mentality of the public to seek excessive profits, and maliciously disrupting the stability of the Immortal Alliance." Jin Chongcheng added.</p><p></p><p>With his statement, a silence fell over the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>The weight of the gazes upon Li Fan seemed to intensify.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary cultivator, their complexion would have paled, and they might have confessed without being asked.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan spoke up confidently, interrupting Jin Chongcheng's words, "I have an objection!"</p><p></p><p>"Accusing me of disseminating false information? Where does this even begin? It's true, I made a little profit in this incident..."</p><p></p><p>"And the subsequent price trend of 普賢真葉 was consistent with my prediction. Doesn't that precisely prove the accuracy of my deduction?" Li Fan argued firmly.</p><p></p><p>Whispers filled the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Quiet!"</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the legitimacy of profiting from deduction techniques, I would like Elder Sun Qixuan of the Tianji Hall to speak."</p><p></p><p>A shimmering light flashed, and Jin Chongcheng vanished from everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>In his place, a young scholar who looked to be in his twenties appeared.</p><p></p><p>Although he was handsome, his face looked sallow.</p><p></p><p>"It's him..." Li Fan squinted his eyes, looking at the man and nodding in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>This Sun Qixuan was the cultivator he had encountered during the investigation by the Tianji Hall. The mysterious aura unintentionally emanating from this person had left a deep impression on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging pleasantries with Li Fan, Sun Qixuan cleared his throat and slowly said, "The perspective of our Tianji Hall has always been the same."</p><p></p><p>"The results obtained from deduction can be completely used as a reference for future actions. Otherwise, why would our Tianji Hall be established?"</p><p></p><p>"We can all do this naturally, and there is no reason for the Alliance to prohibit such actions among its members."</p><p></p><p>Sun Qixuan's words were very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Sun Qixuan's tone changed, and his sharp gaze fixed on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"However, I doubt whether this Daoist Li Fan truly has the ability to deduce the future!"</p><p></p><p>"If the incident of 'the price of 普賢真葉 will soar' was truly deduced by him, our Tianji Hall advocates his innocence."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Sun Qixuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If this matter was fabricated by him..."</p><p></p><p>"We recommend that he be punished severely."</p>

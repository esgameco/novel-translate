        <h1>Chapter 921</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The process of Li Qing forming her golden core was exceptionally smooth. There was no sense of the dangers described in other cultivation texts, it was just a natural progression.</p><p></p><p>In just over half a day, she successfully stepped into the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>"A pure Yin body..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing took a deep breath, comprehending the earth-shattering changes happening inside her body.</p><p></p><p>The Yang energy was completely transformed, and with the final obstacle removed, Li Qing felt her brand new body subtly reaching a state of perfect harmony.</p><p></p><p>The circulation speed of her spiritual power nearly doubled, and even her comprehension of techniques and divine abilities was a level higher than before. </p><p></p><p>A complete metamorphosis!</p><p></p><p>And her golden core was also different from the common forms described in the texts.</p><p></p><p>Like the moon in mid-sky, it emitted a cold white light. The core's surface was covered with mysterious Dao patterns, highlighting the extraordinary nature of this golden core.</p><p></p><p>These changes filled Li Qing with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Just in terms of cultivation talent, even Zhao Ruoxi is now far inferior to me."</p><p></p><p>"And the quality of my golden core is top-notch."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that all this cannot be revealed to others yet. It must not be exposed."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was well aware that once the changes in her were noticed, the true divine effects of the "Inverted Ethics Scripture" would be leaked. It would definitely cause an unimaginable frenzy!</p><p></p><p>At that time, even the Nascent Soul and Harmonized Dao patriarchs of the inner sect would come to fight for it!</p><p></p><p>Compared to attaining the Great Dao, the trivial matter of gender reversal was not worth mentioning at all!</p><p></p><p>"Before I have sufficient power to protect myself, I still need to lay low."</p><p></p><p>Taking out her clothes and putting them back on, the aura of a Golden Core powerhouse gradually dissipated from Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>No one would have imagined that this outer sect disciple, who only a year ago was still in the Qi Refining stage and had suffered severe physical and mental trauma, had now entered the door and embarked on the Great Dao of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>After returning to hide in the outer sect, Li Qing soon encountered an unexpected predicament.</p><p></p><p>It had become very difficult for her to absorb Yin energy from those outer sect female cultivators to aid her own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Li Qing decided to reveal some of her cultivation and enter the inner sect of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>And after a careful decision, she also selected her target to become her master.</p><p></p><p>From the same Moon Flower lineage as Senior Sister Zhao, it was Nascent Soul Immortal Huo Jingtong!</p><p></p><p>In fact, under normal circumstances, with the talent Li Qing was currently displaying, Huo Jingtong would not have taken a fancy to her.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing had long found out that Huo Jingtong was a serious face-con.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing believed that with her increasingly beautiful appearance, as well as the strong charm that naturally emanated from her every move, even unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>Becoming Huo Jingtong's disciple would not be difficult!</p><p></p><p>And the most important reason for choosing Huo Jingtong as the target was that this woman had exceptional talent. Cultivating for just over a hundred years, she had already stepped into the Nascent Soul realm early on.</p><p></p><p>The disciples under her were also all young female cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As a place for Li Qing to secretly develop, it was simply too perfect!</p><p></p><p>A hint of dangerous light flashed in Li Qing's eyes as she secretly began her plot.</p><p></p><p>For an outer sect disciple to become a disciple of an inner sect Nascent Soul Immortal, naturally required some maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>Like a patient hunter, Li Qing waited for the right opportunity for a full three months.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Huo Jingtong's youngest disciple Sima Jing had accepted a sect trial mission and was to go to the Yin Wind Valley thousands of miles away to pick Soul Yin Pearls.</p><p></p><p>Before Sima Jing set off, Li Qing found her through a close friend who was an outer sect female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>She pitifully recounted her experiences and begged Sima Jing to take her along.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Wind Valley is a place of extreme Yin. Perhaps I can absorb enough Yin Qi there to completely shed my male appearance."</p><p></p><p>Initially, Sima Jing was a bit hesitant, but seeing Li Qing's tearful appearance, she eventually softened her heart and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Sima Jing, only in her twenties, had already reached the late stage of Foundation Establishment. </p><p></p><p>However, her experience was too shallow. On the way to the Yin Wind Valley, she was quickly bewitched by Li Qing's sweet words.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship rapidly heated up, and Sima Jing treated Li Qing as a confidant, often lamenting the unfortunate experiences that had befallen Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Qing Qing. When we reach the Yin Wind Valley, I will find more Soul Yin Pearls for you," Sima Jing promised, patting her chest.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing gratefully clasped Sima Jing's tender hands, unwilling to let go.</p><p></p><p>Sima Jing's cheeks flushed slightly, but she did not pull away.</p><p></p><p>However, this naive little girl did not know that her whereabouts on this trip to the Yin Wind Valley had already been leaked by Li Qing to a male cultivator from another lineage of the Great Dao Sect, Wei Lu, who had long coveted Sima Jing.</p><p></p><p>Wei Lu, like Qin Shou, was a lustful person. He had repeatedly pursued Sima Jing but was rejected, so he harbored resentment.</p><p></p><p>This time, upon receiving the news that Sima Jing was going out alone, he was already itching to act. Instigated by those around him, he finally made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to stage a play of heroic rescue. He sent out a group of people to pretend to kill, rob, and rape. At the critical moment, he would step forward, defeat the bandits, and win the beauty's heart.</p><p></p><p>When Wei Lu was secretly plotting, he never thought that he was also part of Li Qing's scheme.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Qing had planned, at the most critical moment of picking Soul Pearls in the Yin Wind Valley, a group of uninvited guests suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Although Sima Jing's strength was not weak and she had many magic treasures to protect herself, she was outnumbered. Moreover, she had to take care of the weak Li Qing. Gradually, she became exhausted and fell into a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to be completely defeated, Li Qing suddenly said with determination, "Jing'er, don't worry about me! You run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Then, in order not to become a burden to the other party, Li Qing actually attracted the attention of the attackers by taunting them, like an egg striking a stone.</p><p></p><p>She kept provoking them, drawing their attacks to herself.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on Sima Jing's side lessened, but the difference in strength between Li Qing and this group of bandits was too great. In just a moment, she was already seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>This was still under the circumstance that these people had listened to Wei Lu's orders and did not use lethal force.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing on the verge of death, Sima Jing was so anxious that she was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>Before Wei Lu could even make his appearance, Sima Jing used a secret technique of mutual destruction to temporarily burst out with the strength of the Golden Core realm, forcing the crowd to retreat, and then took Li Qing and fled into the depths of the Yin Wind Valley.</p><p></p><p>Wei Lu's face darkened as he ordered the crowd to pursue immediately.</p><p></p><p>The dying Li Qing, seeing Sima Jing hugging her and crying, said that she had a secret technique. After using it, not only could she recover from her injuries, but she might even be able to advance further.</p><p></p><p>However, this secret technique was a bit special and required Sima Jing's cooperation.</p><p></p><p>If Sima Jing was unwilling, she would not force it.</p><p></p><p>Sima Jing, whose mind was clouded by love and who was extremely simple, how could she watch someone die without saving them? She immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>After a round of secret techniques that were unfit to be described to outsiders and were invigorating...</p>

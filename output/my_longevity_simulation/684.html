        <div class="content">
            <p>However, after all, it has been passed down by several people, so there may inevitably be some distortion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing is believing.</p><p></p><p>If under the leadership of Emperor Yi, the demon clan can truly pass through the Southern Abyssal Beast Mountain and break through the barrier.</p><p></p><p>Then it means that the Tianjian Sect, in the past, also achieved this.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the following meteor immortal realm, we can focus on researching how to obtain the method of forging the barrier-breaking divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Not only to leave oneself a way out.</p><p></p><p>Such secret techniques, whether it is the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance or the Five Elders Association, are surely very interested.</p><p></p><p>Leyang Prefecture is located southwest of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, not too far from the central four prefectures.</p><p></p><p>There is a large lake within the territory called Yueyang Lake.</p><p></p><p>The prefecture got its name from the lake.</p><p></p><p>It is said that at sunrise every day, you can see a magnificent scene of a red sun leaping out from the bottom of the lake. At that moment, the concentration of the sun's energy far exceeds that of other regions. By absorbing and comprehending momentarily, it can be equivalent to several days of normal rigorous training.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many cultivators gather by the side of Yueyang Lake. Moreover, the lake is very abundant in resources, and the fish in the lake, influenced by the rich energy of the sun, become different from usual species. Their flesh is delicious, as if swallowing a fire attribute spiritual stone, warming the whole body.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this large lake, many cultivators with average aptitude can also advance rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, such good fortune naturally attracts jealousy from all over. To prevent outsiders from coming to plunder resources, the cultivators of Yueyang Prefecture voluntarily formed an alliance. They claimed a vast area surrounding Yueyang Lake as their own.</p><p></p><p>For the cultivators who come from afar attracted by the reputation, if they want to obtain resources from the lake, they can only fight over the areas that are divided and of inferior quality.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten days of effort, Li Fan entered Leyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he felt several gazes falling on him.</p><p></p><p>But seeing that Li Fan did not fly towards Yueyang Lake, those tracking gazes slowly retracted.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring these people, Li Fan flew in the direction of Qihong Island.</p><p></p><p>Qihong Island is located by a tributary that flows into Yueyang Lake, beside the Jinsha River.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the sun rises above Yueyang Lake, and the energy of the sun bursts forth, the Jinsha River also shimmers with golden light.</p><p></p><p>It is considered residual sunlight of pure essence, but for some reason, it is tainted with a hint of ominous aura, making it impossible for cultivators to absorb.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, few cultivators come here, making it one of the quieter areas of Yueyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The name of Ximen Yu is quite well-known here. Without much effort, Li Fan found his cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>From afar outside, he could already hear Ximen Yu yelling, "How many times have I told you, if you want a complete study of ancient and modern geography, come to Qihong Island to find me. Transferring through the Tianxuan Mirror will be blocked."</p><p></p><p>"What? You don't believe that such a thing would happen in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance? I am deceiving you? And now you want to expose me as a fraud to others?"</p><p></p><p>"You...!"</p><p></p><p>After Ximen Yu's furious scolding ended, Li Fan spoke out loudly, "But Ximen Yu fellow cultivator is here?"</p><p></p><p>"I am Han Wuyou, specifically coming to visit the esteemed fellow cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Come in." Ximen Yu's lazy voice came out.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and Li Fan entered the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>It was not spacious, nor was there much decoration.</p><p></p><p>The ground was littered with scattered jade slips, and there were also many paper books and wooden slips.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned them briefly and found that they were all written in unfamiliar characters.</p><p></p><p>"Are you here for the study of ancient and modern landforms?" Ximen Yu did not lift his head, carefully staring at the branch that had extended on the ground of the cave dwelling, and asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Li Fan replied straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu casually pointed, and a paper book flew out from the cluttered ground.</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand contribution points. Confidentiality required; it cannot be resold."</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, a golden light flew out with the book, landing in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, signed the contract, and tossed ten pieces of high-grade spiritual stones over.</p><p></p><p>He temporarily put away the "Study of Ancient and Modern Landforms" without carefully reading it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not in a hurry to leave but instead asked with interest, "Why doesn't Ximen Fellow Cultivator use jade slips for recordings? Instead, you use paper books for transcription?"</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu paused in his observation of the withered branch, scoffed at Li Fan, and said indifferently, "The content engraved in jade slips can usually only be preserved for ten thousand years. If the spiritual energy is lost, this time will be even shorter."</p><p></p><p>"But by writing with ink of death on paper made from long-lasting trees, it can last three to five thousand years without fading."</p><p></p><p>"If directly engraved on a perennial wood, even after a hundred thousand years, it will still be clearly visible."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan smiled and said, "Fellow cultivator's considerations are truly different from the usual. Always calculating in terms of thousands of years..."</p><p></p><p>"After ten thousand years, whether the Xuanhuang Realm will be there or not, is still unknown," Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly turning around, Ximen Yu's eyes were solemn.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that, fellow cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph. Well then, you may leave." Taking a glance at Li Fan, Ximen Yu turned his head away, no longer speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Looking forward to the next meeting!" Li Fan arched his hand and was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Just as he walked to the entrance of the cave dwelling, he suddenly felt the earth tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>A familiar yet unfamiliar energy appeared in Li Fan's senses.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but turn around, only to see a yellow energy erupting from the withered branches observed by Ximen Yu.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to have been waiting for this, Ximen Yu took out a small white jade bottle and sucked in all the yellow burst of energy.</p><p></p><p>The eruption lasted for about half a stick of incense before slowly subsiding.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the harvest this time, Ximen Yu showed a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the earth's veins?" Li Fan approached, somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu's expression changed, put away the jade bottle, and blocked Li Fan's gaze fixated on the withered branches.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivator is quite insightful. Yes, I have already completed the study of ancient and modern geography. Now, I am researching the earth's veins."</p><p></p><p>"This is related to personal privacy; it is better not to inquire randomly, fellow cultivator." Ximen said in a displeased tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed a hint of apology on his face, "It was not my intention. I just felt that fellow cultivator's withered branch seemed somewhat familiar, that's all."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Ximen Yu was slightly stunned, then his expression changed slightly. "Fellow cultivator, don't make fun of me!"</p><p></p><p>"I never tell lies." Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Once, in Tianling Prefecture, I also encountered a withered branch in the wilderness. Upon touching it, I suddenly arrived in an unknown space."</p><p></p><p>"A dilapidated tree towering into the sky, making people feel desolate. I didn't stay long; I woke up from the scene soon after."</p><p></p><p>"The withered branch in my hand had disappeared, just like a dream."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed slightly, "Fellow cultivator's withered branch seems somewhat similar to what I saw back then. However, there seems to be some slight differences..."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu's complexion became more surprised as he listened.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1270: Shaking Uniqueness</p><p></p><p>In the rather dull-colored mural, the nine-star red pearls were quite eye-catching. Like countless eyes, they stared at Li Fan in a very strange way.</p><p></p><p>At the same time this thought emerged in Li Fan's mind, he truly felt as if the myriad red pearls in the mural had come alive, and an odd aura suddenly surged forth from them. </p><p></p><p>Neither righteous nor evil. Both ancient and weathered, yet as if newly born. What shocked Li Fan the most was that merely through the virtual image left by the mural, it caused a phenomenon where part of his divine soul avatar was absorbed and assimilated.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan tried many methods but was unable to stop it. Only by utilizing the essence of Source Power was he able to isolate the influence brought by the nine-star red pearls.</p><p></p><p>"Just what are these nine-star red pearls?"</p><p></p><p>"If the image alone is like this, if the real red pearls were here, I'm afraid even the protection of Source Power essence would be useless."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan made some calculations about what might happen after being absorbed by the red pearls.</p><p></p><p>"It's not enough to cause any substantial harm to living beings, but it will leave special marks in the souls and even the life essence of every absorbed creature. And this is just the effect of those nine-star red pearls."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze focused once again on the empty area where the nine-star red pearls should have been originally located. </p><p></p><p>After all, this device was part of the Profound Yellow World Boundary Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, existences created through this method would only be like replicated clones. And a person's ultimate achievement is still closely related to his own experiences."</p><p></p><p>"Uncertain variables, infinite possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"The same original individual, the same life experiences..."</p><p></p><p>After discovering that lives like his were just existences that True Immortals could casually create, modify, and replicate at will, even possessing the supreme treasure [Return to Truth], he couldn't help but feel a strange inexplicable feeling at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's realized through the uncertain number rings and the nine-star red pearls. It's already impressive enough."</p><p></p><p>"Looking at it from another angle, perhaps the original version of this formation in the Immortal Realm is even more powerful. It's just that without the support of immortal spiritual energy, some key formation nodes lost their efficacy and had to be replaced by these strange objects."</p><p></p><p>"Imprinting the nine-star red pearls."</p><p></p><p>"This is the true means of immortals, unfathomable, and can be said to be the authority that only creation gods can possess."</p><p></p><p>"With the information of special creatures all recorded, this also means that as long as the energy and technical conditions are met, it wouldn't be a problem to recreate any historical figure that has appeared in the history of the Profound Yellow World."</p><p></p><p>The Return to Truth Spell was different from the True Immortal Seal Characters like Chaos and Famine. Not only were their specific manifestations of power vastly different, it also couldn't be cast in an inferior version through clumsy imitation.</p><p></p><p>"According to my previous findings, the red pearls were most likely recalled by the [Return] character spell. But if this event occurred after the great calamity in the Immortal Realm, with nowhere to return to, the red pearls should have returned to the Profound Yellow World again. It was in this process that they were forcibly taken away by someone."</p><p></p><p>"Creating myriad appearances of living beings..." A strange glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, examining the extremely bizarre device.</p><p></p><p>"In the Profound Yellow World, there exists a Creation Stone Tablet that records everything in the world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled in self-mockery.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>After understanding the principles within, Li Fan became even more curious about the current whereabouts of the red pearls.</p><p></p><p>"What a profound and subtle formation?!"</p><p></p><p>"But now..."</p><p></p><p>Based on his deductions, the function of this Profound Yellow Primordial World Boundary Grand Formation's core was to imprint a special mark on all newly born creatures in the Profound Yellow World through the nine-star round pearls. Then, through the uncertain number rings, it would make certain adjustments to the imprints in the life essence of these creatures.</p><p></p><p>"The nine-star red pearls, barring any accidents, probably existed since the birth of the Profound Yellow World. All native creatures of the Profound Yellow World were forcibly imprinted by it. In other words, it's very likely that the unique life characteristic data of all Profound Yellow World creatures are stored and recorded in the nine-star red pearls..."</p><p></p><p>"The immortal rules are strict, as can be seen. Even though the Immortal Realm has been destroyed for so many years, the rules still remain."</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the first time he truly saw a powerful formation capable of manipulating the form of [Life].</p><p></p><p>Even though he had already witnessed the Profound Primordial Spirit Grand Formation, an immortal-level formation that could be said to re-establish the elements of earth, fire, water, and wind, and recreate the world, Li Fan still sincerely exclaimed in admiration after figuring out the principles of the formation before him.</p><p></p><p>"Going to such great lengths indicates that the mastermind behind this matter cannot directly use the Return to Truth Spell, but is borrowing external forces like me..."</p><p></p><p>"The nine-star red pearls are the key."</p><p></p><p>Its profound meaning certainly wouldn't deviate too much from the main purpose of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan simply directly simplified this circular device, treating it as part of an unknown formation unit. Then he incorporated it into the world boundary grand formation model of the Final Separation Disk Scripture after actual formation data calibration.</p><p></p><p>As if there was some invisible existence hindering him, with Li Fan's current cultivation, he didn't have the qualifications to write it at all. Not even to copy it.</p><p></p><p>Thereby producing differences in temperament, talent, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mood suddenly became heavy.</p><p></p><p>"After creating completely identical individuals, based on the records of the stone tablet, one could completely recreate everything the individuals had experienced before."</p><p></p><p>"I treat the living beings of the Profound Yellow World as playthings. The True Immortals probably treat me the same way~"</p><p></p><p>"The rings are present, but the red pearls are nowhere to be seen..."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just a sigh that Li Fan let out when his mind was greatly shocked. It wasn't his true inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After more than 10,000 iterations of data extrapolation, Li Fan deduced the most likely use of the nine-star ring device here.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts calmed down and returned to before.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"The ultimately created [Life] would also be exactly the same."</p><p></p><p>The final answer of the deduction made Li Fan fall into silence.</p><p></p><p>The discovery of the Crossing Calamity Sect undoubtedly indicated that since the moment of creation in ancient times, the Profound Yellow World had always been under strict surveillance.</p><p></p><p>And now, it wasn't just surveillance.</p><p></p><p>The content of the experiment was truly bone-chilling.</p><p></p><p>"If the guess is true, then the Immortal Realm doing this is to cultivate a unique cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"And after achieving the goal, based on this data under strict monitoring and recording, countless target existences can be mass-produced."</p><p></p><p>The faces of those cultivators who left their names in the history of the Profound Yellow World flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong, Su Bai, Xu Ke...</p><p></p><p>As well as He Zhenghao, Xiao Fan, Zhang Haobo.</p><p></p><p>All these [people] could be recreated.</p><p></p><p>Without the uniqueness, could [people] still be called [people]?</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Fan had Return to Truth and could constantly return to a predetermined anchor point</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's heart, the people he had come into contact with all had their own unique symbols.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Xuantian Wang was Xuantian Wang, and Mr. Bai was Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were NPCs, they were NPCs with names and distinct identities.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The world Li Fan knew had suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Behind every NPC, there could be countless replicas.</p><p></p><p>Even without him pressing the "Restart" button, these existences could complete the swap themselves. Even if destroyed ten thousand times, as long as the original data was not lost, they would be recreated.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought it was a single-player world with only him as the player.</p><p></p><p>But now it had become an online game played by countless players.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan feel a little uncontrollably nauseous.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt the world was spinning.</p><p></p><p>All things in the world were twisted and distorted lines, in all colors. Mixed with the whispers of unknown evil gods, gradually eroding Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Despite being blessed by the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, he could not maintain a stable Dao heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense shook violently, slowly disintegrating like roots dispersing in water.</p><p></p><p>His figure became illusory, and Li Fan just bent over and vomited like a helpless mortal.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change directly stunned Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>He had no idea why this mysterious and powerful senior would suddenly become like this just by thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vomited more and more violently.</p><p></p><p>What he vomited was not a physical filth, but his own essence, energy and spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>This scene made Sun Luyao feel a deep fear from the bottom of his heart.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that something terrible was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice gradually became smaller.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>It turned into a light cough.</p><p></p><p>And then it turned into a low, slightly crazy laughter.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the hideous laughter, there was also Li Fan's muttering.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... what are you saying?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao felt uneasy and couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehehe..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehehehe..."</p><p></p><p>"So I said, you guys died well!"</p><p></p><p>"All dead, only I'm not dead, that's the most perfect situation."</p><p></p><p>Like a demon whispering from the depths of the Nine Hells, Li Fan locked onto Sun Luyao with his divine sense in the murmuring sound.</p><p></p><p>But it still made him feel a deep, bone-chilling cold.</p><p></p><p>Just when he wanted to say something more.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao was horrified to find that the core source of the formation in his body suddenly went out of control.</p><p></p><p>As if in the next moment, he would be destroyed in the self-destructive riot.</p><p></p><p>After the initial panic and confusion, Sun Luyao finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan in disbelief: "Senior, why?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze was completely different from what he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>It was true indifference.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, he himself simply did not exist at all.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Infinite Mirror, the body that had just completed the shattered reorganization was collapsing inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>And as the spirit of the Infinite Mirror, Sun Luyao was helpless against it.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that he was about to perish, Sun Luyao, who once again tasted the taste of death after many years, couldn't help but completely lose his composure.</p><p></p><p>He tried everything to save his life.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, spare me! I am your most loyal slave, whatever you want me to do, I will do it!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I was wrong! I shouldn't have had other intentions, I deserve to die ten thousand deaths!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, spare me! I still have use! The ruins of the Primordial Xuanhuang Barrier Great Formation have not been fully explored, I still have value!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao conveyed his dying thoughts faster and faster, finally crying and wailing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, let me live a little longer! Let me..."</p><p></p><p>Poof.</p><p></p><p>Like a cockroach easily crushed to death, Sun Luyao's life came to an abrupt end.</p><p></p><p>The ancient mirror surface, which originally had a spiritual luster, suddenly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Falling powerlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Still so noisy when dying, then it's better to never appear again in the future..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were all black, and after turning slightly, he muttered a little crazily.</p><p></p><p>It's not just this life.</p><p></p><p>But from now on, life after life.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was there, Sun Luyao would never appear in the main storyline again.</p><p></p><p>Without Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>There were still Sun Lufei and Sun Luchang.</p><p></p><p>Just changing the code, for Li Fan, there was no difference at all.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao, who died with remaining grievances and appeared for the last time, probably never thought that originally everything was fine before. He was helping his senior to complete the exploration and analysis of the ancient primordial Xuanhuang Barrier Great Formation.</p><p></p><p>And the next moment, his existence was to be erased forever.</p><p></p><p>And the root cause of all this was simply because he saw Li Fan's ugly state due to a momentary mental breakdown.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, it is not appropriate to describe it as a mental breakdown.</p><p></p><p>Since obtaining Restart and personally tasting the supreme power brought by restarting everything.</p><p></p><p>There was almost nothing that could truly cause damage to Li Fan's psyche.</p><p></p><p>Even the so-called True Immortals and even Nameless True Immortals were no exception.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the power of True Immortals could indeed pose a threat to his life.</p><p></p><p>But that was only by influencing his methods to prevent Restart from happening.</p><p></p><p>Not by influencing Restart itself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought that as long as the supreme authority of the Restart one-click restart was not shaken, his mental defense line would always be as solid as a rock and would not be truly affected.</p><p></p><p>Everything was no match for a single sentence "It's just a Restart."</p><p></p><p>But today, Li Fan encountered something that could truly hurt him.</p><p></p><p>Because his uniqueness was challenged.</p><p></p><p>Although this uniqueness did not actually exist for him originally. It was bestowed by Restart.</p><p></p><p>But it was still something he simply could not tolerate.</p><p></p><p>After a brief struggle and persistence for a while, he finally broke down.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was worthy of being Li Taishi who had gone through countless reincarnations and hundreds of thousands of tribulations.</p><p></p><p>He didn't break down for long and quickly completed his self-adjustment.</p><p></p><p>That's right, those True Immortals could indeed do the same to mortals as Li Fan did to mortals.</p><p></p><p>But they were all dead!</p><p></p><p>Dead!</p><p></p><p>In the end, there was still only one player left in this world.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this point, Li Fan slowly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>As for the unlucky Sun Luyao...</p><p></p><p>And the Primordial Xuanhuang Barrier Great Formation that was only partially explored...</p><p></p><p>Come again in the next life.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, it was a matter of no consequence.</p>

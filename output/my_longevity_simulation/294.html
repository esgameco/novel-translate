        <h1>Chapter 294</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As time passed, the soul body slowly dissipated, and the size of this blank space kept shrinking.</p><p></p><p>But even at the end, when the space became extremely small and everything inside was close at hand to Li Fan, he still couldn't detect the existence of the soul contract mark.</p><p></p><p>"This is what they call 'look but cannot see, listen but cannot hear!'" </p><p></p><p>Amidst the sigh, this soul completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not discouraged. He immediately took out another soul and tried again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Days went by, and in the blink of an eye, more than half of the 26 years of anchoring had passed.</p><p></p><p>After going through five assessments, Li Fan's theoretical test results for the Tianxuan Soul Locking Formation were always top-notch.</p><p></p><p>But oddly, in the test of discerning soul contracts, the results were always at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>This made Ji Hongdao look at Li Fan with a hint of pity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan remained as always, unhurried.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan examined the Soul Gathering Bead in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Only about one-third of the gold color remained.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred and twelve..."</p><p></p><p>"Not as many as I imagined before. The seemingly substantial golden light on the surface should be a false impression caused by the clustering effect."</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and twelve was the number of souls Li Fan had consumed.</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't particularly many, it definitely wasn't few either. </p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Fan's progress was still slow.</p><p></p><p>In the tests, the accuracy rate of identification was only around five in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Basically no different from blind guessing.</p><p></p><p>And it was said that some cultivators could already achieve an astonishing accuracy rate of 99%.</p><p></p><p>"The gap between people is really too big."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head in secret, Li Fan skillfully extracted a soul and plunged into it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Having observed more than 300 souls of the Five Elders Society cultivators, as soon as Li Fan entered the interior of this soul, he noticed something different.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the blank and empty scenes inside other souls, remnants of the cultivator's memories from when they were alive still existed here.</p><p></p><p>Stubbornly resisting the cleansing, they formed a piece of red reef, standing in the soul.</p><p></p><p>Slowly approaching, Li Fan observed the red light in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Inside the red light cluster, the scenes kept changing, and the specific content was unclear.</p><p></p><p>However, it could be vaguely discerned that it was only a small segment of memory, looping over and over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled Ji Hongdao's previous instructions.</p><p></p><p>"The emotional memory cleansing of the cultivators' souls in this batch of Soul Gathering Beads was carried out simultaneously."</p><p></p><p>"Some cultivators' souls are innately tenacious. If there is also something unforgettable until death, it's normal for it to not be completely cleansed."</p><p></p><p>"Occasionally encountering some that slip through the cracks, don't panic."</p><p></p><p>"Although memories still remain, after going through cleansing, the aggressiveness has approached zero. You can boldly explore the memories with peace of mind."</p><p></p><p>"So for you, it's a rare opportunity instead."</p><p></p><p>"Obtaining some techniques, secret arts, or even confidential information of the Five Elders Society from these remnant memories is possible."</p><p></p><p>"The memory information obtained from the souls is also not required to be submitted. Just treat it as your own fortune, so don't have any mental pressure."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The risk shouldn't be big, but we can't be unprepared to prevent accidents."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan severed the connection between this thread of divine sense and his main body.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if some unexpected change occurred, at most he would only lose this thread of divine sense.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if there really was no danger, then after obtaining the contents of the memory, he could also bring the gains back to his main body.</p><p></p><p>With preparations made, this thread of Li Fan's divine sense began attempting to make contact with the red cocoon of light in front.</p><p></p><p>It was like entering someone else's body, unable to move or speak.</p><p></p><p>He could only experience observing the surroundings from the other party's perspective.</p><p></p><p>A few fragmented scenes flashed quickly before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>That was the incompleteness caused by the memory cleansing.</p><p></p><p>"This fellow Daoist... are there forbidden books to destroy here?"</p><p></p><p>A sneaky cultivator took out an oddly shaped jade slip and handed it forward in front of his eyes.</p>

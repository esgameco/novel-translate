            <p>Chapter 1138: The Transformation of Hot Silence and Ice Seal</p><p></p><p>Transforming into Sun Ang and infiltrating the headquarters of the Dharma Protector Hall, the main target was actually not Yan Faju. ▲Google search stocom reading▲</p><p></p><p>It was indeed for the purpose of hiding.</p><p></p><p>From the information gathered so far, it seems that the Myriad Immortal Alliance has very strict management over the cultivators guarding Yan Faju.</p><p></p><p>Not only do their backgrounds need to be spotless, they are basically selected from the hereditary families of the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they have to go through a rigorous review before joining.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the key point is that once one chooses to guard Yan Faju, it means they are not allowed to step out of the Dharma Protector Hall headquarters for three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>While guarding, they themselves also become prisoners.</p><p></p><p>So among the major hereditary families of the Dharma Protector Hall, basically no one is willing to take on this bitter task.</p><p></p><p>This is the case no matter how generous the reward for the task is.</p><p></p><p>After all, once reaching the Harmonious Dao stage, there is no hope for immortality.</p><p></p><p>What they pursue is nothing more than power and enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in prison for three hundred years is not something everyone can endure.</p><p></p><p>But this special condition happens to form the best hiding place for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The headquarters of the Dharma Protector Hall is located in the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance to begin with.</p><p></p><p>The space where Yan Faju is located has even more formations and restrictions arranged.</p><p></p><p>There may even be the legacy of the Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>Even for the current Li Fan, he is not 100% confident that he can forcibly enter and exit.</p><p></p><p>Changing identities and hiding inside.</p><p></p><p>When the outside world is in chaos, no one would have thought that the real culprit behind all this had already hidden in such an important place of the Myriad Immortal Alliance hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, Yan Faju is not of much use to me anymore."</p><p></p><p>"If I want to make further progress now, unless it is a very compatible immortal technique. Otherwise, I still need my own understanding of the Dao and the principles of the world."</p><p></p><p>"These ordinary techniques derived by Yan Faju..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is only a wonder of the Xuanhuang world. From the height Li Fan is at now, the help Yan Faju can provide is extremely limited if he wants to contend with Heavenly Doctor, Dharma Transmitter, and even True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan has gone through many lifetimes and has an overview of ancient and modern secrets.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the essence of the Heavenly Profound Mirror, the many secrets of the Myriad Immortal Alliance are even more readily apparent.</p><p></p><p>He also received guidance from the Heavenly Doctor's legacy...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's vision and standards are actually among the top in the entire Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>For example, for the "Marvelous True Spirit Transformation", the version derived by Yan Faju was only applicable to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, in terms of deriving the most suitable technique for oneself, Li Fan is even slightly better than Yan Faju.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Fan possesses [Huan Zhen], which is something that Yan Faju must never know.</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"Like the Final Separation Disk, I help it complete its sublimation and transformation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>While pondering, he flew out of the underground cave of Luojia Mountain.</p><p></p><p>As for the world soul Zilong, an existence even weaker than the first generation Chi Yan, Li Fan had no interest in devouring it.</p><p></p><p>As for how to pretend to be in the Harmonious Dao stage without devouring it...</p><p></p><p>Among the [Xuanhuang World-Ending Transformation] absorbed by Li Fan, there are several that are not inferior to the power of the world souls.</p><p></p><p>And their external manifestations of power are also extremely similar and difficult to distinguish from the world souls.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the world souls are the manifestation of the laws of the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of impending destruction, naturally there is no time to</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The corresponding spirit of heaven and earth did not manifest, but instead directly manifested with the power of the world.</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the Sun family by flight, Li Fan's clothes and appearance also changed quietly.</p><p></p><p>His eyebrows and hair turned snow-white, and his clothes seemed to be stained with frost.</p><p></p><p>The space that Li Fan passed through during his flight seemed to have many small ice crystals due to the low temperature.</p><p></p><p>"[The heat and silence of heaven and earth, all things frozen], this is one of the evolutions born out of the Xuanhuang realm in response to the life and death crisis."</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically, it is indeed feasible to plunge all things in heaven and earth into a state of absolute darkness and silence in order to escape the catastrophe."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the external force is too powerful and directly destroys the entire system in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"This change of heat, silence and freezing is almost no different from the spirit of heaven and earth with ice power. I deliberately fabricated the appearance of occasional overflowing energy fluctuations to simulate the appearance of my recent promotion and unstable realm."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was pondering, Tianyu Empty City was already in sight.</p><p></p><p>Without any pause, he flew straight into the Sun family in the city.</p><p></p><p>Although there have been family members serving in important positions in the Hufa Hall for generations, and now there are three Hedao cultivators in the family, the Sun family has been very low-key.</p><p></p><p>In Tianyu Empty City, they only purchased two adjacent and inconspicuous cave dwellings.</p><p></p><p>Only by entering it can one discover that these two connected cave dwellings have their own space inside.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Fan flew in, a somewhat angry voice followed.</p><p></p><p>It was Wu Ninglu, the Taoist partner of Sun Ang, the body he occupied.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu's cultivation was similar to Sun Ang's before, both in the late stage of Huashen.</p><p></p><p>It's just that their relationship was not very good. They became Taoist partners under the pressure of their families.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, no children have been born.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? You are..." Wu Ninglu was in a raging momentum, looking like she was going to interrogate.</p><p></p><p>However, when she saw Li Fan's appearance at this time, she couldn't help being shocked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only glanced at Wu Ninglu and did not answer her.</p><p></p><p>"I'm tired."</p><p></p><p>He said very coldly, and then flew towards Sun Ang's residence.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sun family's cave dwelling was a ring-shaped valley.</p><p></p><p>Important buildings such as the family council hall and treasury were located in the center of the valley.</p><p></p><p>The residences of each family member were distributed in the ring-shaped mountains.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu had long been angry about Sun Ang's previous departure without saying goodbye and then mysteriously losing contact.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, seeing that the other party still had that indifferent and cold attitude after returning home, Wu Ninglu was even more furious in her heart.</p><p></p><p>But somehow, when she was about to get angry and saw the other party's cold eyes, her anger was instantly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>She opened her mouth, but didn't even have the courage to call out to the other party.</p><p></p><p>This inexplicable emotion did not dissipate until Sun Ang's figure completely disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>"I was actually scared by him?!" Wu Ninglu was both surprised and angry, finding it hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking back to Sun Ang's performance just now, a bold guess couldn't help but appear in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Did Sun Ang break through?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, when facing Sun Ang, Wu Ninglu did indeed have the feeling of trepidation that only appeared when facing the elders of the family.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the anger and dissatisfaction in Wu Ninglu's heart dissipated completely.</p><p></p><p>With unbelievable joy, she hurriedly followed and flew back to her home.</p><p></p><p>"Mister Sun?"</p><p></p><p>As if returning to when they first met, Wu Ninglu asked cautiously.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 907</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From the current intelligence, it seems that besides the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect, Senior Sister Zhao may be the only person in the Xuanhuang Realm who knows about those immortal realm inherited techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Zhao's foundational technique is the 'Eternal Only Me Secret'. As for the others..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps certain things can be exchanged with her."</p><p></p><p>"One Heart Immortal Sect, the Great Dao is mine alone."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about it after the avatar retrieves the black sword from the sword tomb. The avatar's soul has been modified by me, and there are no memories of Huan Zhen in its mind. Even if it indulges and gets lost in her illusions, there's not much to lose."</p><p></p><p>"It's only a year's time, no need to be impatient."</p><p></p><p>For now, he left this ring-shaped mountain first. When he was about to reach the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards a certain direction at the center of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Ultimate Separation Disk in his sea of consciousness actually had a faint response.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere, the nine Separation Disks of this world were born.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was originally the ultimate creation formed by the fusion of nine Separation Disks. At this moment, even across a vast distance, the Ultimate Separation Disk could clearly sense the existence of the newly born Separation Disk offshoots in the world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even felt a sense of hunger and greed from the Ultimate Separation Disk.</p><p></p><p>"Nine disks converging into one has already created a flawless true Separation Disk. If it could devour another self again..."</p><p></p><p>"To what extent would the Separation Disk evolve?"</p><p></p><p>Even having seen many treasures, Li Fan couldn't help but feel excited at this moment.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice. The Separation Disk had helped him too much.</p><p></p><p>In this Xuanhuang Realm where old monsters were hidden everywhere, compared to them, in terms of foundation, cultivation, and divine powers, Li Fan still didn't have much advantage despite having reincarnated for many lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>Only in formations...</p><p></p><p>Relying on the accumulation from one lifetime to another, plus the existence of the heaven-defying Separation Disk, Li Fan's attainment in formations was enough to crush others.</p><p></p><p>It could almost be said to be ahead of the times, leading by far!</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, when he laid down the recording formation in front of the Transmitter and the Dharma King of Xuantian Sect, Mo Rubin, neither side noticed it at all. This also proved this point.</p><p></p><p>"Overtaking on the path of formations is perhaps the only possibility to break the situation early."</p><p></p><p>"When ordinary formations are pushed to the extreme, the next step is..."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal-level formations!"</p><p></p><p>"Between immortal-level formations and ordinary formations, there exists a chasm of qualitative change. For the Separation Disk to complete this metamorphosis, it needs the data of at least one immortal-level formation..."</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the [Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation] flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Back then, it was personally designed by the Xuantian King Xuanyuan Hong, bearing the hope of bringing the Xuanhuang Realm across the high wall together. This Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation should be the existence in Xuanhuang Realm that was most likely to approach an immortal-level formation.</p><p></p><p>"Although the formation was already damaged during the era of the Ten Immortal Dao Sects, there must still be some remnants left."</p><p></p><p>"Separation Disk, Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation..."</p><p></p><p>"Each one is a top-level secret that only the high-level members of the Immortal Alliance can access."</p><p></p><p>So the future path in this world was already very clear.</p><p></p><p>That is to find a way to contact Mo Rubin and gain his trust.</p><p></p><p>Then, with the help of his identity as a Transmitter, obtain the various secrets that Li Fan needed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Compared to these, the improvement of cultivation was not so important.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current combat power, as long as the Immortal realm was not reached, he could basically come and go freely, without worrying about his life.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the Immortal realm and the Ascension realm was too huge. Even if Li Fan broke through one or two more realms, he might still not be a match for an Immortal realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was better to take a different path and find an alternative solution.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it succeeds or not depends on Senior Sister Zhao's side."</p><p></p><p>"However, we can't put all our eggs in one basket."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan returned to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Shang Tianci came to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." He stammered, looking hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Yan Fangzhou's situation seems to be a bit troublesome. Can we let him out now?" Shang Tianci asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained unchanged, showing no signs of joy or anger: "I will arrange this matter myself. You may go down now."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci dared not refute and could only bow and retreat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense instantly focused on Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, this "genius" had been imprisoned by Li Fan for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in the enhanced Two Extremes Microcosm Formation, no matter how much he struggled, he only faced endless repetition and dull scenery. There was no escape.</p><p></p><p>The formation isolated spiritual energy inside and out, making it impossible for him to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Even when he wanted to calm his mind and concentrate, he couldn't do it. At critical moments, the formation would accurately send out interference, making him irritable and tormented to the point of madness.</p><p></p><p>Under such torture, Yan Fangzhou was almost driven insane.</p><p></p><p>But it was just impotent rage.</p><p></p><p>Not only was he unable to change any of the current situation, it made his own condition even worse.</p><p></p><p>When Yan Fangzhou came to his senses, his strength had been completely exhausted by himself.</p><p></p><p>Like a mortal, he was dejectedly sealed in the formation.</p><p></p><p>Helplessly waiting for death.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing stages of roaring at the sky, crying bitterly, and having a face like dead ashes, Yan Fangzhou, this "genius", now seemed to have completely lost his spirit.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the ground, his eyes were dull. Like a withered statue, he remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not appear to mock him, but carefully observed Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Then, the corners of his mouth revealed a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Although Yan Fangzhou acted well, it was still a bit insufficient to deceive the cunning and treacherous Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Yan Fangzhou had never seen what a truly completely collapsed person looked like.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his hollow eyes, there was still a trace of spirit.</p><p></p><p>"This is pretending to be crazy, trying to deceive me and wait for me to let my guard down before launching a counterattack."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, while it can fool that silly boy Shang Tianci, it can't fool me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "Still being able to play these little tricks means he's far from truly collapsing."</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about it when he really goes insane."</p><p></p><p>Lightly tapping Yan Fangzhou's body standing motionless in front of the black gate tower, Li Fan once again strengthened the formation.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he leave with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou, who had no idea that his cleverness had backfired, was still pretending to be a fool in the formation. Trying to wait for someone to come.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After resolving this small interlude, Li Fan came to the front of that faceless divine statue.</p><p></p><p>Since he planned to win the trust of that Mysterious Heaven Sect's Dharma King Mo Rubin, Li Fan naturally had to play his role well.</p><p></p><p>The action of recruiting soldiers and horses could not stop.</p><p></p><p>The closer he got to the divine statue, the more inexplicable scenes appeared in his mind.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 761</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After carefully understanding the cause of the matter, Xu Baizi did not first think about how to suppress the fervent public opinion. Instead, his true self, thousands of miles away, directly looked at his own "Reincarnation" panel.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of his physiological age had not decreased. However, Xu Baizi did not think that Peng Qing's words were mere nonsense. </p><p></p><p>The Venerable of Rebirth originally attained the Dao in the white mist. As is well known, the "Element-Devouring White Mist" could devour the life essence of cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Peng Qing's sudden demise, his miserable state before death, was almost identical to cultivators who died in the white mist. Such circumstances could not be explained as mere coincidence.</p><p></p><p>However, to prevent the situation from escalating, Xu Baizi first used threats and enticements to silence all the witnesses from that day. Afterwards, he sent cultivators to spread various even more bizarre and horrifying rumors, such as:</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator in a certain place died as miserably as Peng Qing, shouting: 'The one who will destroy the Myriad Immortal Alliance is the Dharma Transmitting Venerable.'"</p><p></p><p>Or, "The deceased was not the real Peng Qing. The real Peng Qing died many years ago. The one who died before everyone's eyes that day was the avatar of a cultivator named 'Thousand-Faced Demon Venerable' from the Five Elders Council, with inscrutable intentions to create chaos in the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For a time, rumors flew in all directions, making it impossible to discern truth from falsehood. Gradually, although the heat of the incident did not subside, fewer and fewer people paid attention to Peng Qing's actual raving words before his death. </p><p></p><p>Thus, more than ten days passed. The Peng Qing incident was slowly forgotten by everyone. Fewer and fewer people discussed it, and public opinion eventually completely subsided, as if this incident had never occurred in the world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Baizi accomplished his mission successfully, greatly satisfying Nan Gongshi. Generously, Nan Gongshi rewarded him with much merit and contribution.</p><p></p><p>He also gave Xu Baizi a reincarnation talisman. "This is..." Xu Baizi held the talisman in his palm, feeling an profound sensation, as if grasping another body of his own.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Reincarnation Decree,'" Nan Gongshi introduced with a pleased expression. "Recently, I received three of these as rewards from above. I kept one for my own use, and the extras are of no benefit carrying around, so I might as well reward you this time for your great merit."</p><p></p><p>"With this thing, even if you unfortunately perish, you can immediately reincarnate and revive."</p><p></p><p>Xu Baizi showed a delighted expression: "Thank you for your generous kindness, great sir!"</p><p></p><p>Since the Reincarnation Ministry was established, Xu Baizi, as a provincial messenger, had not inquired about methods to obtain the many treasures of the Reincarnation Ministry.</p><p></p><p>Although it was announced to all at the beginning that as long as one had sufficient contribution, anyone could obtain them, the gates of the provincial Reincarnation Ministries remained tightly shut.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention redeeming resources from the Reincarnation Ministry. Although cultivators across the realm were greatly dissatisfied, the Reincarnation Ministry was not subject to the control of the provinces, citing the excuse that preparations were not ready to deflect all inquiries.</p><p></p><p>Xu Baizi solemnly put away the "Reincarnation Decree." Before leaving, he suddenly asked in a lowered voice: "Great Sir Nan Gong, about what Peng Qing said before dying, that someone stole his life span..."</p><p></p><p>"Is there truth to this? If it's true, then it can only be suppressed temporarily, not permanently."</p><p></p><p>Nan Gongshi was silent for a moment, then shook his head slightly: "Since everyone can be reborn, what importance does lifespan hold?"</p><p></p><p>"For us, attaining the Dao and eternal life is an unattainable fantasy. If so, why bother worrying about such things?"</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong paused for a moment, then changed the subject, "However, not all cultivators in the world may be as open-minded as I am. People in various regions will eventually discover this matter. It cannot be suppressed."</p><p></p><p>"What we need to do is to firmly prevent this matter from erupting in our Tianliang State first," Nangong Shirong said coldly.</p><p></p><p>His words were essentially an affirmation of the authenticity of Peng Qingling's words before his death.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai remained silent and nodded heavily.</p><p></p><p>On the way to leave, Xu Bai's mind was in turmoil: "Shorten his lifespan..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it an indispensable means to complete the resurrection of the true spirit of a cultivator, as the Ascended Venerable One goes against the natural order?"</p><p></p><p>"Or... is there an intention to emulate the Ruomu from the ancient times?"</p><p></p><p>This Ascended Venerable One, from the moment his traces were revealed to his formal defiance of the natural order, has been exuding a sense of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mirror takes the place of Heaven."</p><p>"The Ascended Venerable One takes the place of Ruomu."</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly thought of something, and his steps abruptly froze.</p><p>He also glanced up at the sky, just like the previous Violet Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In Tianjuan State, in the Chaofeng Separate House:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li?" Chaofeng's slightly surprised voice came.</p><p></p><p>In their previous sparring, Chaofeng was enjoying himself. But Li Fan suddenly zoned out, and an attack that he could have easily dodged hit him directly.</p><p></p><p>The vast sword qi slashed through Li Fan's lower body, reducing it to nothingness. Fortunately, this is the era of the new law. Such a minor injury is not a big deal for a Yuanying cultivator. In just a breath, amid the rumbling of the Dongtian, Li Fan's body was quickly restored.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan apologized, "I just recently grasped this 'Shorten Lifespan' divine technique, and after continuous battles with you, Brother Chao, I have become a bit distracted."</p><p></p><p>Chaofeng then realized, "It was my oversight. In the heat of the moment, I forgot that such a top-tier divine technique must consume a great deal."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's all my fault for being too excited. I haven't encountered such a skillful technique in a long time," Chaofeng praised.</p><p></p><p>"It even affected my mastery of the sword..." Chaofeng sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, you should rest for a moment," Chaofeng said, as a flash of sword light sliced off a few strands of white hair on his head. He then let out a roar, and his body shed like a snake shedding its skin, discarding the somewhat aged and dilapidated appearance. The rejuvenated and vigorous Chaofeng flicked his fingers, turning the old body into ashes.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "This 'Unravel and Shorten Lifespan' divine technique of yours is truly remarkable. In terms of combat effectiveness, it is the best I've ever seen in my life."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for my special physique, I probably wouldn't be able to fight you so recklessly," Chaofeng admitted.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be exhausted, waving his hand, "Don't mention it. Although it is a technique I have painstakingly created, it just can't keep up with the changes of the times."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Afterlife Pavilion stands tall in the sky, everyone can be resurrected. My divine technique may be powerful, but its deterrent power is greatly diminished. Since everyone can be resurrected, what does it matter if the body is broken?"</p><p></p><p>Chaofeng shook his head, "Brother Li, you don't need to be so modest. Resurrection..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," Chaofeng interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"True powerhouses in the world must not be indifferent to your divine technique. With just this skill, you have already surpassed countless self-proclaimed heroes."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, your treatment should be improved as well. It's a bit of a shame that you're only a junior offering."</p>

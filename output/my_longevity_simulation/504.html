        <h1>Chapter 504</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In ancient times, cultivators acted without any taboos. Massacring living beings to refine magical tools, destroying mountains and seas, burning forests and sinking land, ignoring agreements and breaking promises, killing for personal gain, seeking only profit... All of this was common.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that as their cultivation level increased and their own strength continued to grow, cultivators were subjected to fewer restrictions.</p><p></p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator set his eyes on a rare treasure obtained by a Foundation Establishment cultivator by chance. He could easily kill the latter and take the treasure for himself. In such a situation, how many would choose to acquire the treasure through "trade"?</p><p></p><p>Likewise, when a Foundation Establishment cultivator faced a Nascent Soul cultivator who was many times more powerful, and the latter proposed a "trade," would he dare to refuse? If the other party breached the agreement or turned hostile, what could he do? He could only swallow his anger and even be grateful that the other party did not take his life.</p><p></p><p>If the two parties in a trade were in an unequal state, the fairness of the trade could not be discussed.</p><p></p><p>However, in the present Five Elders Association, and even in the entire Profound Yellow Realm, this situation had undergone a thorough change.</p><p></p><p>This was primarily due to the existence of various contracts.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Five Elders Association signed the "Soul Contract" when selling themselves, Li Fan had used the "Commerce Contract" multiple times, and there were special golden contracts for buying and selling techniques...</p><p></p><p>These pervasive and mysterious powers could truly place restrictions on cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Even Core Formation cultivators could not resist the power of contracts. Once signed, they had to abide by them.</p><p></p><p>Driven by contracts, order was established.</p><p></p><p>If the Heaven Profound Mirror and Yinfajue were the foundation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, then the "contracts" were the lifeblood of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the "Soul Seal Point." Its essence was a unique energy hidden deep in the soul by the power of the contract. </p><p></p><p>Aside from being used for trade, it had a special purpose - consuming Soul Seal Points to open the "Immortal Sect Arsenal."</p><p></p><p>There, various techniques, scriptures, and treasures from ancient immortal sects could be exchanged as if innumerable as the sea.</p><p></p><p>Another noteworthy point was the existence of real illusions of many ancient sects within the Immortal Sect Arsenal.</p><p></p><p>The power creating these illusions was extremely similar to the Meteoric Immortal Realm. There, cultivators could explore many extinct ancient sects. Many images of ancient cultivators existed within these sects, most of whom had no consciousness, merely empty shells. However, in combat, their might seemed almost indistinguishable from real people.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the Five Elders Association could consume Soul Seal Points to continuously spar with these ancient cultivators, enhancing their combat power. Moreover, within the "Immortal Sect Arsenal," all injuries would not affect the physical body in reality; they would only slightly harm the soul. Furthermore, these soul injuries could be healed by consuming Soul Seal Points.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, if one had enough Soul Seal Points, even a recently cultivated mortal could become extremely powerful in battles.</p><p></p><p>With the "Soul Contract" as a constraint, the Five Elders Association did not need to deliberately suppress the combat power of the majority of cultivators, unlike the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, none of this was free; cultivators had to strive for it themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, at the border of Wuding Prefecture, next to the White Mist Barrier, Lv Fan looked at various "Universal Benevolent Real Boats" and couldn't help but be tempted. Unfortunately, not being a member of the Five Elders Association, he didn't have any Soul Seal Points, so he could only look on enviously.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a small vendor approached and struck up a conversation, "You two, must be from the Myriad Immortals Alliance and have not joined our Five Elders Association yet, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Fan's expression changed slightly at the words. He cautiously scanned around, lowered his voice, and nodded, "Exactly. May I ask how the friend is called? And how did you figure that out?"</p><p></p><p>The vendor brought the two to his stall and said, "No need to be so tense. I am Gu Bingliang, specializing in some buying and selling activities."</p><p></p><p>"As for how I figured it out..." Gu Bingliang smiled slightly, "The feeling people get is entirely different whether one has signed the Soul Contract or not. I happened to hear that a group of Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators was recently captured and undergoing a 'Return and Admonish,' hence my guess."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lv Fan looking a bit nervous, Gu Bingliang continued, "In fact, for most members of our Five Elders Association, we don't bear any ill will towards Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators. After all, there have been many cultivators captured in the past, who, after going through 'Return and Admonish', changed their ways, accepted reality, and eventually became members of our association."</p><p></p><p>"And these individuals are even more loyal than regular members!"</p><p></p><p>At Gu Bingliang's words, Lv Fan's face couldn't help but look a bit ugly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Bingliang, also good at observing words and reactions, immediately skipped this topic and asked, "Is the friend interested in the 'Universal Benevolent Real Boats' but hesitant due to a lack of Soul Seal Points in your purse?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," Lv Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a problem. Even if you don't have Soul Seal Points, you surely have standardized spirit stones on you for daily use," Gu Bingliang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I have some," Lv Fan said in surprise, but then a hint of doubt crossed his face, "Does your Five Elders Association also use these standardized spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahaha, what a thing to say," Gu Bingliang replied. "Since they are standardized spirit stones, naturally, they are jointly manufactured by the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association and recognized by both parties. However, our regular cultivators do not use them. Exchanging them for Soul Seal Points is a bit troublesome. That's why they don't accept them."</p><p></p><p>"But for me, it doesnâ€™t matter. As a true businessman, I still need a considerable amount of standardized spirit stones for intermediation," Gu Bingliang explained.</p><p></p><p>"A true businessman..." Lv Fan instantly understood the other's meaning, "Would you please give me a 'Universal Benevolent Real Boat'?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Gu Bingliang presented dozens of miniaturized flying boats in front of Lv Fan.</p><p></p><p>He enthusiastically explained the differences between them.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the two happily completed the transaction.</p><p></p><p>As Lv Fan was about to leave, Gu Bingliang called out to him, "Do you have any unused items on you? It's very inconvenient to walk in the territory of the Five Elders Association without Soul Seal Points. I can use them to exchange for Soul Seal Points."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he took out a humanoid statue whose appearance was unclear.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Manifested World Celestial Statue,' which can be used to store Soul Seal Points. Even if you are not a member of the Five Elders Association, you can use it to trade with other cultivators," Gu Bingliang explained.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lv Fan couldn't help but be intrigued.</p><p></p><p>He immediately rummaged through the items in his storage ring. Gu Bingliang, being all-embracing, bought any items Lv Fan was willing to sell.</p><p></p><p>When the Soul Seal Points stored in the Manifested World Celestial Statue reached fifty thousand, Lv Fan finally couldn't find anything else he was willing to part with.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any needs in the future, feel free to come to me," Gu Bingliang said with a beaming smile as he handed over a communication talisman.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 935</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In Wei Qizheng's memory, although Li Fan had never met the middle-aged cultivator who spoke with such vigor and conviction, for some reason, this person's behavior, mannerisms, and the way he spoke all made Li Fan feel a vague sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>Especially the occasional flashes of coldness in his eyes, which made Li Fan certain that he must have had contact with this person in one of his previous lives.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan watched, he searched for similar figures from the scenes recorded in the Hua Dao Stone.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders have confronted each other for thousands of years, with victories and defeats on both sides. The Xuanhuang cultivators, affected by the war, have suffered unspeakably."</p><p></p><p>"In order to thoroughly end this situation, many predecessors racked their brains and finally came up with a method that can be called perfect."</p><p></p><p>As the middle-aged cultivator spoke, miniatures of the various states of the Immortal Alliance appeared before the eyes of the young people.</p><p></p><p>"As we all know, inside each floating sky city of our Immortal Alliance, there is a stone statue of the Celestial Venerable. The vast majority of people in the world believe that these were built to commemorate the great deeds of the Celestial Venerable. But have you ever thought that these statues might have other uses?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the youths all showed a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"When you entered the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance, you should have all sensed the remnant aura left by the Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"The construction of these statues was also instructed by the Celestial Venerable himself."</p><p></p><p>"Even the location of each floating city was designated by him in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Each statue contains a remnant of the Celestial Venerable's will. If activated, it can trigger a power equivalent to a glance from the Celestial Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator deliberately slowed down his speech at this point.</p><p></p><p>And those young people also fell for it. Hearing that it was only a "glance" from the Celestial Venerable, they all couldn't help but feel a little unimpressed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable was, it was just a glance, so what could it do?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the young people, the middle-aged cultivator showed a smile that he had expected.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a solemn expression and a resounding voice, he said, "A glance from the Celestial Venerable can withstand the full-strength attack of an ordinary Eternal Life realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>The echoes of his voice continued, and all thirty-three cultivators present slowly widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" a young cultivator couldn't help but retort on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong the Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable was, he was still only in the Eternal Life realm. Being in the same realm, how could the difference be so great?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Celestial Venerable was really that strong, why didn't he simply unify the Xuanhuang realm back then? Instead, he left such a mess?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately erupted into a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the authority of the middle-aged cultivator, the young people started to argue based on reason.</p><p></p><p>As the middle-aged cultivator's gaze swept over, the familiar cold light that Li Fan knew enveloped them, and the young people were forced to quiet down again one by one.</p><p></p><p>"How can we understand the Celestial Venerable's considerations? There must be a reason why he didn't unify the Xuanhuang realm back then. But times have changed, and we have received clear instructions from the Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"It's time for the Xuanhuang realm to have only one voice."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator said, full of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"And you are the key to achieving this great goal."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator pointed casually, and the scene in front of everyone changed again.</p><p></p><p>Then, silver lines connected these bright spots.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see what it is?" the middle-aged cultivator asked.</p><p></p><p>Wei Qizheng was the first to speak, blurting out, "This... this looks exactly like a human body..."</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Meridians?!" </p><p></p><p>The other youths all looked towards Wei Qizheng, and then stared intently at the increasingly obvious diagram of intersecting points and lines in front of them.</p><p></p><p>They all had a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>An unbelievable thought couldn't help but surge in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator spoke, confirming their guess: "The Heavenly Venerate's remnant thoughts are distributed across the Immortal Alliance's land according to the special laws of human body meridians. If one can use secret techniques to mobilize them, they can summon from the void a dharma avatar modeled after the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Venerate's remnant thoughts are equivalent to the power source that drives the dharma avatar."</p><p></p><p>"If all of them can be mobilized..."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator took a deep breath: "The Five Elders will be destroyed in no time!"</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three youths were all stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"And you are the keys to unlocking this powerful force..."</p><p></p><p>Under the middle-aged cultivator's narration, the youths were all drawn in, their eyes filled with eagerness and the desire to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Heavenly Venerate's remnant thoughts was too immense, and a single cultivator simply could not fully mobilize and inherit it.</p><p></p><p>It could only be divided into thirty-three domains.</p><p></p><p>Each domain required an unparalleled genius to preside over it.</p><p></p><p>When these thirty-three immortal-chosen ones could achieve a state of unified minds.</p><p></p><p>And continuously familiarize themselves with the Heavenly Venerate's remnant thoughts, they could then act as a lever to mobilize the power of the Heavenly Venerate's remnant thoughts!</p><p></p><p>"The first time summoning the Heavenly Venerate's dharma avatar, the duration will certainly not be too long."</p><p></p><p>"You must seize this opportunity to familiarize yourselves with and comprehend the profound mysteries within."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, during this process, none of you can have the slightest distraction. You should know that at that time, it will be equivalent to the thirty-three of you jointly controlling the dharma avatar."</p><p></p><p>"If there are disagreements among you, it may very likely cause the dharma avatar to collapse."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator explained in detail to the youths about various matters concerning the Heavenly Venerate's dharma avatar.</p><p></p><p>How difficult would it be for them to be of one mind?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Myriad Immortals Alliance prepared a series of training for them next.</p><p></p><p>Inside a transparent spherical space filled with silvery-white light, there seemed to be countless rapidly evolving different worlds.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three individuals' consciousnesses were cast into the worlds, experiencing all sorts of tribulations.</p><p></p><p>There were chaotic mortal worlds and the rivers and lakes of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>There were encounters in ancient immortal cultivation realms and possible future scenarios.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, the thirty-three of them were forcibly brought together by fate. Due to various reasons, they gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Only by achieving a state of being of one mind and one body could they finally be liberated from the reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>And as long as any one of them had different intentions, the reincarnation would begin again.</p><p></p><p>Even with the deliberate guidance of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, this was still an extremely long period of time.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing how many years had actually passed in the virtual world, when these "youths" finally broke free.</p><p></p><p>The youthfulness on their faces had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with vicissitudes.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there was some wariness and bewilderment on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Clap, clap, clap..."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the middle-aged cultivator's continuous applause, their past suppressed memories finally recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, now let's begin the second lesson." Without any regard for the youths' thoughts, the middle-aged cultivator spoke.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Next, Wei Qizheng and the others experienced even more brutal training.</p><p></p><p>They were all stripped naked and confined to a sealed space with nothing but endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>In the space, there was nothing else besides the simulated aura of the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate.</p>

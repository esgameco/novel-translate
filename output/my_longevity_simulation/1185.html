        <h1>Chapter 1185</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Although he had already decided to search for information about the Star Sea's great power from this other surviving civilization, Saint Embryo Li Fan did not rush in recklessly and directly approach them.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had traversed most of the Darkest Star Sea, and in order to resist the erosion of the void black spot disease, he had to constantly cut his divine soul, greatly weakening his strength.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to gather information and was instead accidentally captured by the other party, wouldn't that be a huge joke?</p><p></p><p>"Since a civilization can survive here, there should also be ways to avoid the various strange erosions in the void. I will first lurk in the shadows, slowly recover my strength, and then make plans."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Saint Embryo Li Fan had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>First, he pointed at his own eyebrows, and surprisingly, he set up a prohibition in his already extremely weak divine soul. If anything went wrong, he could free himself and instantly scatter his soul.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan conceal his figure and begin to explore this sea of relics.</p><p></p><p>He did not follow the sneaky figure from before, fearing that it was a plan to lure the enemy in deep. Saint Embryo Li Fan chose another direction and turned to explore.</p><p></p><p>"In this void full of crises, if there are cultivators hiding, they must use formations, prohibitions and other protections. As long as I find these auras, I can follow the clues. My formation dao level is several generations ahead of the Xuanhuang Realm, and I should be invincible here as well."</p><p></p><p>That's what Li Fan originally thought.</p><p></p><p>But after searching the sea of relics for more than ten days in a row, he did not find any aura of formations or other signs of civilization. He didn't even sense a hint of life.</p><p></p><p>To the point where Saint Embryo Li Fan even began to doubt whether the phantom he had encountered before was his own illusion.</p><p></p><p>But he did not give up easily, like a patient hunter, always lurking in the shadows, waiting for the prey to appear.</p><p></p><p>Another seventeen days passed, and finally he had some gains.</p><p></p><p>A small team of three cultivators, they wore strange armor and walked back to back, very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>And the way they appeared also somewhat surprised Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The position of those relics that were quietly floating in the void changed, and then a passage appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>After the three walked out, those silent relics returned to their original positions, and the entrance to the passage closed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and looked around, taking in all the nearby cultivator relics.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, he suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful! It's not an isolated formation, but a transformation based on these naturally floating relics, almost completely blending in with the surrounding environment."</p><p></p><p>"The key is..."</p><p></p><p>Saint Embryo Li Fan slowly approached these floating relics.</p><p></p><p>"These objects from the destroyed cultivation realms, more or less, are all tainted with some power of the True Immortal Seal characters. This has formed a natural protection that can maximize the shielding of cultivators' divine sense from perceiving them. This is also the reason why I searched hard before but still failed to find their hiding place..." Li Fan instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the ingenuity of this formation was average, but after mixing and introducing the power of those True Immortal Seal characters that led to the destruction of the realms, it suddenly rose more than one level. Even with Li Fan's current formation dao level, there was no good way to break it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he ignored the possible side effects of those relics and wanted to forcibly break the formation, he could still do it. However, this would go against his plan to lurk and gather information.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the entrance of the hidden passage and ultimately gave up the idea of forcing his way in.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he followed behind the three people, carefully observing along the way.</p><p></p><p>Apart from wearing strange armor, these three cultivators looked no different from the people of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, they seemed to be out searching for materials in this sea of relics.</p><p></p><p>There didn't appear to be any commonality in what they collected - from fragments of magic treasures to pieces of building debris, and even some cultivator bones, all were targets of their search.</p><p></p><p>They didn't directly store the items in their storage rings, but instead tied them together with a black rope and dragged them behind.</p><p></p><p>"This scene..." Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>It reminded him of how Chuan Fa used golden chains to transport world fragments in the void.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be some connection between the two?"</p><p></p><p>After about half a day, when the relics tied behind them had reached more than twenty pieces, the three cultivators seemed to have a disagreement.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, under the leadership of the person in front, they gave up the search for this time.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the materials, they turned and flew towards the entrance of the passage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan also quietly followed behind them.</p><p></p><p>The range these three cultivators went out to seemed to have some boundary, not very far from their hiding place. They quickly arrived back in front of the hidden passage.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of their armor began to flash with rhythmic light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed a strange rhythmic fluctuation emitting from the armor.</p><p></p><p>As if triggering some mechanism, the surrounding still relics quickly changed positions and a circular entrance quietly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The three cultivators jointly pulled the twenty-plus items and flew inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also concealed his form, wanting to enter together with them.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he reached the passage entrance, a piercing alarm suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart jumped. He had his prepared avatar attach to one of the items.</p><p></p><p>His true body, however, rapidly retreated far back.</p><p></p><p>Because of the avatar's existence, the alarm did not disappear with Saint Fetus Li Fan's departure.</p><p></p><p>The three cultivators looked around nervously but found no signs of external intrusion. They then focused their gazes on the items they collected this time.</p><p></p><p>After a brief discussion, they separated the items and tried bringing them in one by one.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they found the one with Li Fan's avatar attached.</p><p></p><p>Instead of destroying it, they forcefully threw it into the depths of the relic sea.</p><p></p><p>As the source of the threat disappeared, the warning also stopped.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the three turn back.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, looking at the slowly closing passage entrance, Li Fan ultimately did not choose to force his way in.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, their alert method was actually able to detect me."</p><p></p><p>Eyes flashing, he arrived beside the discarded relic.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, there's something fishy. From the surface, the effects of the True Immortal seal script still remain. But in fact, the attached power is already minuscule."</p><p></p><p>"After so long, my weak avatar didn't suffer any damage at all..."</p><p></p><p>Retrieving the avatar back into his body, Li Fan casually picked up the relic and carefully examined it again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a command flag magic treasure, but the flag had rotted away, leaving only a bare flagpole.</p><p></p><p>Having lost its spirit, it could no longer exert its original abilities.</p><p></p><p>"What are they collecting these things for?"</p>

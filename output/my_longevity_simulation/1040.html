            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was as if an organ of the human body had been shrunk down to the size of a cell. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the Du'e Sect was hidden in the void of the Goumang State within the Wanxian Alliance, unseen and unknown to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Following the coordinates provided by the Tianxuan Mirror's clone, Li Fan arrived at a position 36,000 zhang above the Goumang State.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Du'e Sect was right here.</p><p></p><p>The Du'e Sect, which had been shrunk by a factor of 100,000, was originally like dust, and with the effect of the Dharma-transmitting prohibition, even with Li Fan's current observational power, he still could not detect any traces of the Du'e Sect, even with the premise of already knowing the result.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan silently operated the Wuji Yingxu Technique, and then cut off a small part of his soul.</p><p></p><p>After leaving his body, the soul transformed into a small Li Fan shape, turned into a wisp of white light, and escaped into the tiny void ahead.</p><p></p><p>As the surrounding objects enlarged by hundreds or thousands of times, the space around Li Fan's split soul also quickly became vast.</p><p></p><p>The split soul was flying through the vast void, searching for traces of the nearby entrance to the Du'e Sect.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Du'e Sect, finding the entrance was the first step.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just simply shrinking. Even the space itself here is an superposition of multiple directions."</p><p></p><p>Before long, sensing the familiar aura of the Dharma-transmitting prohibition, Li Fan's figure came to an abrupt halt.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful discernment, Li Fan discovered that there was an area in the void not far away that seemed to have a mirror embedded in it, with a hint of disharmony.</p><p></p><p>It was almost impossible for ordinary people to notice, but Li Fan had deduced and cracked the Dharma-transmitting prohibition countless times in the Dissociation Disk, so he was naturally very familiar with it. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he flew towards that "mirror".</p><p></p><p>It was like suddenly passing through an invisible bubble. In an instant, Li Fan felt the surrounding space's up and down, left and right directions flip multiple times.</p><p></p><p>A slight dizziness came over him, and Li Fan knew he had stepped into the second layer of space.</p><p></p><p>After entering the inner layer of space, in addition to the correct passage, many "forks" were also set up.</p><p></p><p>Once one stepped into them, they would be teleported to other confusing void mazes.</p><p></p><p>There was no exit, only an endlessly enlarging microscopic level.</p><p></p><p>Let alone returning to search for the Du'e Sect again, it was extremely difficult just to not get lost.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately possessing the correct answer, Li Fan proceeded with caution all the way. After penetrating 72 layers of space, he finally saw a mountain floating in the void far ahead.</p><p></p><p>72 layers of space, shrunk by a factor of 100,000.</p><p></p><p>The void was no longer the conventional black, but a strange pale purple.</p><p></p><p>On the boundary illuminated by the purple light, faint lines would occasionally flash by at high speed, leaving only slight traces before quickly disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>It was so fast that even Li Fan could not capture it.</p><p></p><p>Even more strange was that in this space, every once in a while, a variable number of purple orbs would light up, like suns or clusters of stars.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Against the backdrop of these strange scenes, the distant Du'e Sect appeared even more bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's split soul slowly approached the mountain.</p><p></p><p>After passing through a layer of barrier protection, he officially entered the interior of the Du'e Sect.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be an independent space. Sound finally reached Li Fan's ears again.</p><p></p><p>There was no specific sound, just the presence of sound, unlike the previous penetration of 72 layers of silent space.</p><p></p><p>In the process of entering the mountain, the surroundings were absolutely silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's current position was at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the only stone steps extending upwards in front of him, Li Fan tried to fly directly towards the top of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Before flying too far, his vision blurred, and Li Fan actually returned directly to his original position.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this is due to the prohibition of the Dharma transmission, or the original protective means of the Du'e Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself, gave up flying, and stepped up the mountain path step by step.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>After walking a few steps, his feet suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Is it an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, it seemed that a figure had run past him, going straight up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't "see" the existence of the figure, but he truly felt it.</p><p></p><p>"Playing tricks..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly and continued forward.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, every time he climbed a certain distance, he felt the appearance of that ghostly figure.</p><p></p><p>Some went up the mountain like him, while others came down from the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of appearances became more and more frequent, and...</p><p></p><p>"With each appearance, the feeling it brings becomes more obvious."</p><p></p><p>A hint of solemnity appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>At first, it was just like a gust of clear wind. But now, when the figure brushed past him, he could clearly feel the cold and sticky sensation.</p><p></p><p>"Sweat?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly woke up and immediately realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>He scanned his body with his spiritual sense, and nothing seemed abnormal.</p><p></p><p>He then used the Water Mirror Technique and looked into the mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's scalp tingled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that those dark shadows that had brushed past him just now had not disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were stacked and overlapped, one after another, all clinging to his back.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more horrified was that if it weren't for the reflection in the mirror, Li Fan would have had no awareness of this at all!</p><p></p><p>It seemed that from the reflection in the mirror, they saw Li Fan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Those originally blurry faces of the shadows gradually appeared.</p><p></p><p>The pale faces overlapping with each other kept changing, and their voices intermittently sounded in Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Go up the mountain, go up..."</p><p></p><p>"Run! Run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, give me a ride. This mountain path is a bit too difficult to walk."</p><p></p><p>"So tired. So tired. The exit should be close, right?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>And at the same time as these voices appeared, Li Fan was horrified to find that his body actually began to make different movements according to the different contents of these words.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go up the mountain, but also desperately wanted to escape from this place.</p><p></p><p>Neither was willing to let the other.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>In this utterly contradictory struggle, it was as if there were many people in front and behind, pulling hard.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body was instantly torn apart from the middle.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right..."</p><p></p><p>Both sides, having snatched their own part, cheered in unison.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, these figures, each carrying half a body, parted ways.</p><p></p><p>One going up, one going down, they quickly moved on the mountain path.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that being tainted by these shadows, Li Fan's two severed remains were also shrouded in thick shadows.</p><p></p><p>As time eroded and changed, these two separated halves quietly became two complete bodies again.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Du'e Sect, in the normal space of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the scenes transmitted by his two split souls at the same time, Li Fan showed an interested expression.</p><p></p><p>One left, one right; one up, one down.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan also brought them to the Reincarnation Path.</p><p></p><p>Although the originally opened cave mansion was not large, it was more than enough to accommodate these children.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan went back to Wanxian Island and bought items such as "Spirit Spring Eye" and "Blood Red Fruit Tree" in the Tianxuan Mirror to solve their food problem.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he gather these children together.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Li Fan with innocent eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what a celestial being is?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the children instinctively shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>Even Ye Feipeng looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Only Sun Erlang, who was slightly older, showed a hint of enthusiasm and longing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly said, "I know! Immortals can fly, move mountains, control the wind and rain, and do anything!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's words seemed to make the originally timid children become brave.</p><p></p><p>Another child whispered, "I also know. My father taught me since childhood to sing 'To become a god, ride a crane and fly to the sky. Turn stones into gold, it is indescribable!'"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but chuckle at the words.</p><p></p><p>He recognized this child; he was the father of Han Wuyi several years later.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan also brought him and Han Wuyi's mother over. If you want to see if Han Wuyi will still be born in such a dramatically changing situation, this "change and persistence" in the outcome is very important to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the noisy children quieted down instantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then said solemnly, "The so-called immortal is actually just a more powerful person."</p><p></p><p>"But for an ordinary person to become as strong as an immortal, it's not easy at all."</p><p></p><p>"Some are good at writing, some are skilled in martial arts. The most important thing is to find the method that suits you and makes you stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan deliberately paused for a moment, waiting for the children to ponder before continuing, "I have three immortal methods that can make you as powerful as immortals."</p><p></p><p>"The first is the Way of Going Against Heaven. To go against the path of ordinary and follow the path of immortals, overturn the laws of heaven and earth, and you will be able to directly achieve the Dao of longevity. This is the highest method."</p><p></p><p>Although the children understood little, they still grasped the meaning in his words and couldn't help but widen their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The second is the Secret Cultivation of the Stove. The human body has a stove, and training it brings about changes. Activating the boundless potential within the body, when trained to a high level, even with brute force alone, you can move mountains and fill the seas! This is the middle-level method!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, only Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba among the children showed subtle movements in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If the first two methods are not suitable, I have a third method!"</p><p></p><p>"Although it cannot be compared with the first two, it is also one of the many great Dao methods."</p><p></p><p>"It is the Way of Controlling Beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"There have been various exotic beasts in the world, possessing all sorts of incredible powers. If you can harness the power of these exotic beasts, you can also perform the deeds of immortals with your mortal body!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said loudly.</p><p></p><p>The children became eager one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is different, and to cultivate the highest method, only a few are chosen. I will teach you the immortal methods according to your abilities."</p><p></p><p>"You can choose how you want to practice voluntarily."</p><p></p><p>"Think carefully, and after three days, I will come back here!"</p><p></p><p>With a big wave of his hand, Li Fan used a leaving imprint stone to continuously play the explanations of the three methods he fabricated in the air.</p><p></p><p>The children were all fascinated by the various magnificent scenes in the images, immersing themselves in them.</p><p></p><p>Three days passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan reappeared, they immediately quieted down from their discussions.</p><p></p><p>"Those who wish to practice the highest method, take a step forward!" Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu, Sun Erlang, and three other children took bold steps forward.</p><p></p><p>After scanning them, Li Fan said in a deep voice, "Among you, none have excellent qualifications. If you encounter difficulties in your cultivation in the future, do not regret it!"</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu and the others had determined looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flicked his finger lightly, and several streaks of light flew into their minds.</p><p></p><p>"By doing this, I am imparting different methods to you. Remember, immortal methods are rare and cannot be practiced simultaneously. If you encounter doubts in the future, you should only ponder on your own and not reveal the practice methods to others."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, their expressions subtly changed.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't pay attention to them and, with a fresh breeze, led them to another room.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining children, Li Fan continued, "Those who wish to practice the Secret Cultivation of the Stove, take a step forward!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba was the first to step forward.</p><p></p><p>Without saying much more, Li Fan transmitted the "Cultivation Stove of Creation" to their minds.</p><p></p><p>After blowing them away again, Li Fan looked at the three remaining people, his eyelids twitching.</p><p></p><p>Among them were the absent-minded Xiao Heng and the curious Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you only willing to practice the lowest-level method of controlling beasts?" Li Fan pointed at Xiao Heng and asked coldly. "You answer me first!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng was startled and touched his head, feeling somewhat embarrassed. He said, "Teacher, I just felt that I'm a bit stupid and definitely won't be able to learn the first two methods. It's better to honestly learn the method of controlling beasts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered, "Are you sure? Won't you regret it?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan had no intention of blaming him, Xiao Heng secretly breathed a sigh of relief and nodded quickly, "I won't regret it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't say much after that and handed a Yuan Ying Beast Soul Bead to Xiao Heng.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Divine Beast Bead, sealed inside is the divine soul of a powerful exotic beast. It is too powerful for you. Keep it by your side day and night. When you feel it's time, you can try to refine it," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, teacher!" Xiao Heng joyfully put away the beast soul bead.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, I also think the same as Xiao Heng!" Another of the three remaining children, named Zhao Wen, who looked honest and simple, also hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully examined Zhao Wen's body, thought for a moment, and handed him a Yuan Ying Beast Soul Bead.</p><p></p><p>"Do not force yourself," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Gratefully, Zhao Wen knelt down and knocked his head.</p><p></p><p>"What about you?" Li Fan looked at the last remaining Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng scratched his cheek, hesitating.</p><p></p><p>But eventually, he gathered his courage and tentatively asked, "Teacher, why can we only choose one immortal method?"</p><p></p><p>"Can I have all three?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze froze momentarily.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Ye Feipeng, who was full of longing, Li Fan suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Since you put it that way, I will grant your request."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Sea Divine Sword," "Cultivation Stove of Creation," and the beast soul bead made from the essence of the nine-headed divine bird, all flew towards Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, teacher! Thank you, teacher!" Ye Feipeng was overjoyed and repeatedly bowed.</p>

            <p>The situation was worse than expected.</p><p></p><p>Not only in the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>In various places of the Wanxian Alliance, Sister Zhao's albums were secretly circulating.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators have their own pride.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they would not go around proclaiming that they had secretly browsed the albums.</p><p></p><p>But the contents of the albums were really fascinating.</p><p></p><p>As long as one's willpower was not too firm, after viewing them, they would basically be lost in wild thoughts and unsettled in mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Even if they found a cultivator to vent their desires, they could never resolve their lust.</p><p></p><p>They only wanted to see more albums about Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, there would always be more explicit and realistic corresponding albums appearing in secret.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, luring the cultivators, leading them towards the abyss.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was that the timing was chosen extremely well.</p><p></p><p>The attention of the Wanxian Alliance, from top to bottom, was all focused on the grand entrance examination.</p><p></p><p>They completely failed to notice that in the silent and unnoticed corners,</p><p></p><p>An extremely dangerous thing was quietly spreading within the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Already impatient and starting to probe?"</p><p></p><p>"Already aware that the Dharma Transmission has left the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's expression was enigmatic.</p><p></p><p>The methods of the Eternal Life Venerable, even if he was a weakling among the Eternal Life Realm experts,</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, it was still a dimensional strike, extremely difficult to guard against.</p><p></p><p>Even Harmonious Dao Realm experts were within this "ordinary" category.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan was not surprised at all that He Zhenghao was ensnared.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much he missed his wife and daughter, after viewing Sister Zhao's erotic affairs, his soul was directly hooked away.</p><p></p><p>You should know that even Daoist He, who Li Fan now looks down upon,</p><p></p><p>Was actually an outstanding figure among cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Without power or influence, relying only on his own efforts, under suppression, he could still become an island guardian, and had quite some accomplishments in the Dao of formations, able to converse freely with many formation masters of the Strategy Formation Hall...</p><p></p><p>How many cultivators in the world were not as good as him!</p><p></p><p>But when faced with Sister Zhao's albums, even He Zhenghao was like this. The performance of other cultivators could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>"This is something a hundred times more dangerous than any Heart-Aspiring Immortality Pill."</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance actually allowed it to spread without any awareness."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wanted to see the Wanxian Alliance suffer a crushing defeat and reveal their final trump card,</p><p></p><p>When facing the methods of the One-Heart Venerable, he still had some apprehension from the bottom of his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance should have its own set of countermeasures. I don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Ji Shaoli ultimately gave up the idea of meddling.</p><p></p><p>Choosing to be a bystander.</p><p></p><p>He only warned the cultivators in the mutual aid society to never curiously view any albums out of momentary interest.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he closely paid attention to the subtle changes in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, Ji Shaoli realized that he had still underestimated the abilities of the [One-Heart Venerable].</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, curiosity killed the cat.</p><p></p><p>It's not that knowing the danger can completely sever one's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, precisely because they knew in advance that the subject of the albums was a top powerhouse in the Xuanhuang Realm, the ruling Venerable of the Five Elders Council...</p><p></p><p>They actually became even more curious about the contents of the albums.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they had some luck-pushing thoughts and confidence in themselves.</p><p></p><p>Just taking a look, it shouldn't be a big deal...</p><p></p><p>Once such a notion arose, it would be</p><p></p><p>The passage is a bit explicit, so I'll provide a summary rather than a full translation:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes how some members of a mutual aid society became obsessed with a certain album of erotic paintings, despite the efforts of the leader Jishao Li to prevent this. As more cultivators fell under the influence of these paintings, the Wanxian League finally took notice. </p><p></p><p>However, rather than banning the album outright, the League instead released thousands of previously forbidden secret texts about the five Longevity Celestial Lords of the Five Elders Society, including many lurid details. This shifted the focus and gossip to these newly revealed secrets.</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li realized that by removing the mystery around the Celestial Lord "One Heart", and exposing many blood-pumping details about her, the fatal allure of the painting album was lessened in comparison. The cultivators' obsession faded after the initial excitement. Even though they didn't know the paintings spread by the League and Society were completely different things, the removal of secrecy reduced their attractiveness.</p>

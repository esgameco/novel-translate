        <h1>Chapter 769</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After finishing the conversation, Xu Bai hung up the communication. However, his expression immediately turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"One tiny lapse has ultimately exposed a flaw."  </p><p>"Liu Sanri appears unruly on the surface, but unexpectedly his thoughts run so deep."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, during that seemingly ordinary exchange with Liu Sanri just now, Xu Bai made one mistake. </p><p></p><p>It was when Liu Sanri told him that one of his disciples succeeded in building a foundation, Xu Bai remained silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This silence was caused by his distrust towards Liu Sanri. Because he knew the immense difficulty of successfully building one's foundation. He knew it was clearly an impossible feat.</p><p></p><p>So he suspected this might be some kind of trap, an excuse for Liu Sanri to lure him back.  </p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, upon hearing those words, he should have either been surprised or doubtful, and immediately questioned Liu Sanri about the truth.</p><p></p><p>However, he remained silent instead.</p><p></p><p>Although he could come up with countless reasons to explain this silence. </p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai knew in his heart that it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Because Liu Sanri did not say it all at once, but first said the first half, deliberately waiting for Xu Bai's reaction.</p><p></p><p>This itself was a probe.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sanri had obtained what he wanted. From that brief silence, he saw Xu Bai's distrust towards him.</p><p></p><p>When experts cross paths, even the slightest difference leads to a loss.</p><p></p><p>"However, the situation has not deteriorated to the point of no return. The 'True Lure Fruition' restriction is not so easily broken. Although they have noticed something amiss and confirmed their suspicions, they still cannot be my enemy."</p><p></p><p>"Not only have their thoughts been rewritten, more importantly, the Xuanhuang Celestial Tripod is still in my hands."</p><p></p><p>"With the cultivators of the Medicine King Sect sleeping inside the tripod as hostages, they absolutely dare not act rashly."</p><p></p><p>"For now, I'll leave them be. Until the end..." A vicious glint flashed across Xu Bai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the Medicine King Sect and Xu Bai remained in this bizarre state of balance. </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai only communicated with them remotely through spirit communication talismans.</p><p></p><p>While Liu Sanri and the others carried on as usual, seeming to have noticed nothing amiss.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Xu Bai returned to the empire once.</p><p></p><p>As he flew over the imperial capital, Xu Bai vaguely sensed a faint scent of blood lingering in the air.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, a great purge had just concluded not long ago.  </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai revealed his form, and soon Little Qing came to receive him.</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace tower, Xu Bai saw the princess and Little Hong again.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Xu Bai found that in this short time apart, the princess had transformed from a budding young lady to her current voluptuous womanly appearance.</p><p></p><p>"It seems your empire still has some hidden techniques you haven't revealed," Xu Bai said indifferently.  </p><p></p><p>The princess let out a light laugh, her full figure trembling slightly, "The empire has lasted a thousand years, we've never put all our survival methods on just one boat."</p><p></p><p>"Surely you can understand?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, her deep bright eyes gazed intently at Xu Bai, revealing a touch of charming vulnerability and naked seduction.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai's eyes were as clear as a lake, without a ripple. He simply gave her a brilliant, innocent smile in return.</p><p></p><p>The princess' disguise instantly shattered, a hint of panic and shyness appearing on her face.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Let the fellow Dao cultivator not laugh at me." At this moment, Little Red slightly bent her body, blocking the Empress in front of her.</p><p></p><p>The Empress took a deep breath, closed her eyes for a long time, and finally regained her composure.</p><p></p><p>Without blaming or mocking the other party's presumptuous charm, Xu Bai instead asked curiously, "If I'm not mistaken, the Empress is pregnant?"</p><p></p><p>The three present were somewhat embarrassed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing gently waved her hand, setting up a barrier around them, and then quietly explained, "After you left, we followed your advice and purged the imperial aristocracy. All those whose will did not align with ours were arrested."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the Empire has existed for thousands of years. The accumulated strength of these imperial aristocrats is not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>"Before taking action, we had already considered the possibility of failure. In order not to let the imperial bloodline be severed, the Empress had already practiced the Holy Blood Gestation technique early on."</p><p></p><p>Little Qing glanced at the Empress and continued, "In fact, the Holy Blood Gestation technique passed down by the master has made great progress through the continuous research of the imperial family over the years."</p><p></p><p>"It is possible to rely on external forces to complete the birthing process, even if the conditions are not fully met."</p><p></p><p>"The offspring born in this way, rather than being called the next generation, it would be more appropriate to call them a kind of 'clone'."</p><p></p><p>"However, there are also drawbacks. The clone cannot inherit the cultivation, and is only a simple physical body."</p><p></p><p>Little Qing stopped there and did not answer further.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai narrowed his eyes, his expression indecipherable.</p><p></p><p>He did not pursue the question further, but instead announced the approval of the review in front of the three.</p><p></p><p>After the evaluation of several elders, they unanimously believed that the various technologies displayed by the Empire were worthy of investment by the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Empire will also become one of the few small worlds under the protection of the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Xu Bai took out three Apocalypse Discs from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Among the three, the Empress was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing and Little Red, on the other hand, showed expressions of joy.</p><p></p><p>They solemnly put away the Apocalypse Discs, and then, at their prompting, the Empress handed over a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The storage ring was engraved with the image of a Heavenly Mandate Mysterious Bird. The aura was somewhat ancient, indicating it had been around for some time.</p><p></p><p>It was very similar to Xue Ke's spirit pet, Little Black.</p><p></p><p>"The things we previously demonstrated are all inside here," said Little Qing and Little Red, looking at the storage ring with a hint of nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>"This was originally left behind by the master. We have never used it. Today, using it to trade for the future of the Empire, I suppose he would not blame us," Little Qing said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai simply glanced at it and saw that the materials, including the "Fusion of Myriad Beasts into One", were all stored there. He did not directly verify their authenticity.</p><p></p><p>He then put the ring away and looked back at Little Qing and the others.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that Xu Bai still had something to say, they looked at him inquiringly.</p><p></p><p>"The transaction between the Empire and the Myriad Worlds Alliance has been completed," Xu Bai said.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I have a personal transaction with all of you. I wonder if you are willing?"</p><p></p><p>Little Qing's expression became somewhat grave: "Fellow Dao cultivator, please speak."</p><p></p><p>"I am very interested in the improved Holy Blood Gestation technique," Xu Bai said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing's expression changed slightly, and she was about to refuse.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 420</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The only "Heavenly Covenant" that rules over the world of Xuanhuang, integrating all resources.</p><p></p><p>And perhaps, only with the extraordinary strategic planning and calculation ability of the Tianxuan Mirror, it might be possible.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Heavenly Venerables can turn a blind eye to the actions of the Tianxuan Mirror, and even actively facilitate the merger of the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders' Association, thus can be explained.</p><p></p><p>Because once successful, they will completely rid themselves of the threat from the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The vast void, from now on, they can roam freely.</p><p></p><p>No longer confined to the little corner of the world of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The life and death of cultivators, what does it have to do with them?</p><p></p><p>Even if it is unsuccessful, it is not a loss for the Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Heavenly Covenant is not just about slaughtering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It is about suppressing all the cultivators who maintain the "weight" of Xuanhuang within the "Eternal Immortal Wall."</p><p></p><p>No need to worry about controlling the number of cultivators, perhaps the Heavenly Venerables find it more reassuring this way!</p><p></p><p>As for the final plan for Xuanwang to leave the Immortal Realm, whether it was successful or not...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan is inclined to believe it was successful.</p><p></p><p>Because in the previous life, before he truly existed, after nearly a thousand years of silence, he clearly felt the revival of vitality in the world of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The long-lost sunlight reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Although most living beings in the world were extinct, the world itself was rejuvenated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not believe that after falling into the Immortal Realm, the Xuanhuang world could simply revive after a thousand years of silence.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, the so-called Immortal Realm would not have made the Heavenly Venerables so fearful.</p><p></p><p>"For cultivators, the Xuan Network is naturally unforgivable."</p><p></p><p>"But in a sense, it saved the Xuanhuang world."</p><p></p><p>"It even cleaned up all the cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps because of this, when the Xuan Network took over, the Heavenly Dao of this realm did not offer much resistance."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan slowly suppressed those thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to these inevitable events, there are also many developments influenced by the establishment of the Xuan Network."</p><p></p><p>"All the causes stem from my killing the Giant Luan Fish and then personally orchestrating the Heavenly Spirit Grass incident."</p><p></p><p>"The large-scale war of the Heavenly Spirit Province, which should not have happened, had a profound impact on both the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders' Association."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders' Association subtly sensed the disappearance of the Law-Transmitting Venerable and continued to probe in the following days."</p><p></p><p>"Faced with pressure from the Five Elders' Association, the Wanxian Alliance, for self-preservation, created monstrous formations like the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Array."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps even without the Heavenly Spirit Province War, there would still be the Heavenly Judgment Province and the Nine Mountain Provinces War."</p><p></p><p>"But the timing of the wars could lead to completely different future outcomes."</p><p></p><p>"Countless futures, infinite possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"The birth of the Xuan Network is just one of them."</p><p></p><p>"The world after the widespread use of the Xuan Network is too dangerous for cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"A little carelessness and they will be suppressed in the 'Eternal Immortal Wall,' unsuitable for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in this world, efforts must be made to prevent its birth."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"However, whether it's the Heavenly Spirit Grass incident or the widespread deployment of the soul-locking array, I, who have foresight, can benefit from it."</p><p></p><p>"If I give up, it won't be beautiful either."</p><p></p><p>"Then..."</p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, Li Fan immediately had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Balancing and pulling each other, the overall situation can be stable."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang world should not be too chaotic!"</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the previous life, the next step is to plan for this life.</p><p></p><p>The goal is clear, to achieve the Yuan Ying Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before the Great Battle of the Heavenly Spirit Province, cultivate to the perfection of the Golden Dan Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the relocation of the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven, explore the void that can continuously evolve into the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>If possible, break through based on that.</p><p></p><p>If not, then find a way to obtain the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven from the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, there is one thing to do."</p><p></p><p>Without any distractions, he activated the "Purple Heaven Sublime Intent," a secret technique passed down from the sect of Purple Heaven, which he obtained in the previous life in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hadn't forgotten that there were traces left by "It" from the Source Dao Realm on his body.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan vaguely felt that with his reincarnations and transformations, these traces might have already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But having an extra layer of security wouldn't hurt.</p><p></p><p>As the technique operated, Li Fan felt his consciousness soaring continuously.</p><p></p><p>Ascending, breaking through the firmament, he arrived at a sacred and inexplicable place.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Only the profound and great meaning of heaven and earth, overflowing within.</p><p></p><p>This immense and pure aura washed over Li Fan's soul like flowing water.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gradually immersed himself in it.</p><p></p><p>Due to the influence of "It" from the Source Dao Realm and the shadow caused by the Heavenly Healer, the feelings dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Even the vicissitudes brought about by the three thousand incarnations were slowly washed away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Anchor for 3 years.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put away the supernatural ability, feeling his mind clear and body relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"The secret technique of the Purple Heaven Sect is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Casually checking the interface of "It," he was pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly discovered that the charging speed of "It" was much faster than before.</p><p></p><p>"Originally needed nearly nine years, but now, it will probably only take a little over seven years to complete the charge."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Xuanhuang Refining Heart Chant's reverse training of the Dao Heart to strengthen the soul is effective."</p><p></p><p>"Faster charging means I will be able to leave Da Xuan and go to the Xuanhuang world by the beginning of the 8th year of anchoring."</p><p></p><p>"Just in time for the Wanxian Alliance's once-in-ten-years entrance exam..."</p><p></p><p>Following the routine, he descended the mountain and visited the tomb of Yi Yin.</p><p></p><p>He retrieved the Transformative Stone, slowly absorbed it, and waited for "It's" charging to be completed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the eighth year of anchoring arrived.</p><p></p><p>Before setting off, Li Fan opened the "It" interface.</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p></p><p>Realm: Mid Golden Dan Realm</p><p></p><p>Physical Age: 27/599</p><p></p><p>Mental Age: 1326/4200</p><p></p><p>Identity of Void Charging Progress: 100%</p><p></p><p>Anchor Charging Progress: 0%</p><p></p><p>Current Number of Anchors: 3</p><p></p><p>Currently Available Anchor Quantity: 1</p><p></p><p>Bound Items: "Thousand Machine Jade Space Gold Chapter," Taiyan Boat, Stepping Stone Tablet (Damaged), Blood of Ten Thousand People, Transformative Stone</p><p></p><p>Cultivation Techniques: Xuanhuang Refining Heart Chant, Clouds and Water Illusory Dream Technique, Body Transformation Dao, Mystical Xuan Spiritual Transformation, Cauldron of Myriad Forms Technique, Creation Baking Technique, Zuo Shan Jue</p><p></p><p>Supernatural Abilities: Chaos, Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword, Life and Death Connection, Formless Killing Intent, Binding Insects, Sword of the Congregated Clouds, Heaven Overturning Palm</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand incarnations, only a little over a hundred years added to the mental age. For now, there should be no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>"As for the 'Chaos' supernatural ability..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the dreadful side effects, even with the refined puppet body, it completely disintegrates after being used.</p><p></p><p>Although powerful, it was currently too strenuous to use.</p><p></p><p>Closing the interface of "It", in this life, he decided not to cultivate the power of the "Zuo Shan Jue" or plunder the finances of the Great Xuan court anymore.</p>

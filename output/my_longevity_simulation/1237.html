        <h1>Chapter 1237</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"This... this..." Sun Luyuan stammered for a long time, but couldn't say a single word.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Ping didn't make things difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand, he sent out a golden light that flew into Sun Luyuan's body. Li Ping said indifferently, "From now on, I'm afraid you won't be able to return to the Wanxian Alliance. Just stay in our Holy Dynasty for now."</p><p></p><p>"After some time, I will arrange for you to return to the Wanxian Alliance under a different identity."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked up at Li Ping in a daze.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Ping finally showed him the scene of Mo Shihui's destruction in Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>While Sun Luyuan's heart was once again filled with endless fear, he also instantly understood the purpose of the golden light just now.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be to erase the mark left by the Wanxian Alliance in his body.</p><p></p><p>"That Tianyin involves too many secrets. If the entire state is not completely erased, it will be difficult to avoid people tracing it back." Li Ping explained.</p><p></p><p>"Then our Sun family..." Sun Luyuan suddenly thought of something, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"That will depend on your luck. If Tianyin tells the Wanxian Alliance about what happened to her, then the Sun family will definitely be implicated. Completely disappearing from the world, no one can escape."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's words made Sun Luyuan's face turn extremely pale.</p><p></p><p>But then he changed the subject: "However, you don't need to worry too much. Tianyin has no form or shape. If she doesn't want to show herself, I'm afraid the Wanxian Alliance won't be able to find her. Tianyin and the Wanxian Alliance are not on the same side."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, my attack before I left, although it didn't destroy her, it severely injured her. Tianyin's state was already unstable to begin with. When she reappears and wakes up again, she may not even remember us."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Ping said this, it still couldn't make Sun Luyuan feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>The hidden meaning in Li Ping's words was very obvious. There was another terrifying existence behind Tianyin that even the unfathomable Great Awakening Holy Emperor had to be wary of.</p><p></p><p>"Damn Xuyan Xian, saying it was just a simple errand. I really believed your nonsense..." </p><p></p><p>Thinking of how he was inexplicably involved in this kind of thing, not only were all his previous plans disrupted, but even his entire family would be implicated, Sun Luyuan felt a surge of anger.</p><p></p><p>"This old undying one is indeed no good, just like the other Wanxian Alliance higher-ups!" He cursed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the various crises his family would face after his disappearance, Sun Luyuan couldn't help but feel confused and troubled.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Li Ping spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there is a way for you to go back without being suspected. As long as you inform the Wanxian Alliance of our existence, not only will you not be punished, but you can also establish a great merit."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's voice echoed in the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's heart skipped a beat, and he hurriedly expressed his loyalty: "How could this humble one betray the Holy Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Ping smiled and said, "I think you misunderstood my meaning."</p><p></p><p>"Return to the Wanxian Alliance and tell Xuyan Xian everything about Luoyan State and my Holy Dynasty. This is an order."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Sun Luyuan was stunned. He didn't understand why the Holy Emperor would suddenly make this abrupt decision that was completely opposite to before.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he is already prepared to go to war with the Wanxian Alliance?" Sun Luyuan couldn't help but think so in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"When you see Xuyan Xian, say this..." Li Ping slowly transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>And Sun Luyuan's expression gradually became more and more intriguing.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly arrived at the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wanxian Alliance headquarters seemed a bit chaotic due to the destruction of Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>But now, no one would have thought that this matter would be related to Sun Luyuan, a Protector Hall Hedao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Sun Luyuan easily arrived at the Protector Hall headquarters and met Xuyan Xian again.</p><p></p><p>"You're back? How did the task I assigned you go?" Xuyan Xian didn't even open his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xu, something big has happened." </p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan seemed extremely panicked, with a look of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Xuyan Xian suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he set up layers of restrictions before solemnly saying, "Don't panic, speak slowly and carefully."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan took a deep breath: "I did indeed follow Elder's orders and met Senior Qingfeng at Qingfeng Hall on Wanxian Island."</p><p></p><p>"The tree person named Ah Liu has completely gone mad, and Senior Qingfeng was also willing to leave with me. But she didn't want to come to the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, but wanted to go to Luoyan State..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these three words from Sun Luyuan's mouth, and thinking of the recent calamity that occurred in Luoyan State, Xuyan Xian couldn't help but change his expression slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Then what exactly happened in Luoyan State?!" He asked coldly, changing his usual composure.</p><p></p><p>"When I was about to bring Senior Qingfeng to the destination, she suddenly became dazed. She said something like 'there are indeed not many people in the world who are good to me'... Then this subordinate felt his body become unsteady, as if he was about to completely disappear from this world." Sun Luyuan said with some lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Xuyan Xian obviously knew about Qingfeng's habit and didn't show any surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I felt I was about to die, a golden figure suddenly descended. Then..."</p><p></p><p>"He started fighting with Senior Qingfeng."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan projected the image of Li Ping and Qingfeng's confrontation before.</p><p></p><p>"The power of heaven and earth, bestow upon me."</p><p></p><p>The majestic voice in the image said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Xuyan Xian stared intently at the image, his expression gradually becoming a bit solemn.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the appearance of that silver needle that he completely lost his composure.</p><p></p><p>The image abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>"The other senior took me away. When I returned, I found out that Luoyan State had been destroyed. And Senior Qingfeng was nowhere to be found..." Sun Luyuan appeared extremely panicked.</p><p></p><p>Xuyan Xian didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment with furrowed brows, he finally said, "Do you know the name of the cultivator who saved you?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan nodded: "He called himself the Tianming Holy Emperor. But he didn't talk much with me and quickly let me go."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Elder Xu, the small world where the Tianming Holy Emperor was seemed a bit strange..."</p><p></p><p>However, Xuyan Xian didn't take the second half of Sun Luyuan's sentence to heart, but muttered to himself: "Tianming Holy Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan didn't interrupt and just waited patiently for his reaction.</p><p></p><p>"As for this matter, you don't need to ask more. Just pretend that this never happened." Xuyan Xian suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't an act.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xu..."</p><p></p><p>Xuyan Xian raised his hand to interrupt Sun Luyuan: "It was my lack of consideration. I didn't expect that after not seeing each other for many years, it would develop to the point of incompatibility."</p><p></p><p>"I will find another opportunity to compensate you separately. But this matter must be kept secret." Xu Yuanxian's cold gaze locked onto Sun Luyuan. </p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shuddered and quickly vowed to comply.</p><p></p><p>"You may go back first. If there are any issues, I will contact you again."</p><p></p><p>"Remember what I said."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Xu Yuanxian didn't forget to remind him again.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that something he thought would be extremely risky ended up being resolved so smoothly. </p><p></p><p>As Sun Luyuan felt relieved, his heart was filled with a sense of unreality.</p><p></p><p>"However, that old thing's reaction was basically within the Holy Emperor's expectations."</p><p></p><p>"Incompatible like water and fire? What exactly does it mean?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan pondered but couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the situation took a turn. Not only did he save his life, he even gained a favor from Xu Yuanxian. It could be said to be an unexpected delight.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shook his head slightly, suppressing the gloom in his heart for now.</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm at the headquarters anyway, why not go see Lu'er."</p><p></p><p>Sun Ang seemed very pleasantly surprised by his arrival and kept asking about this and that.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan also explained in great detail. </p><p></p><p>"Lu'er, you've really suffered."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the family is safe, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>With one sentence from Sun Ang, Sun Luyuan suddenly felt a little guilty.</p><p></p><p>He also felt embarrassed to stay long and left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Sun Ang, also known as Li Fan, watched Sun Luyuan leave with an indescribable expression.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, every word of the conversation between Sun Luyuan and Xu Yuanxian fell into his ears.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's sudden change of mind was also influenced by him.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, there are people in the Wanxian Alliance who know the true situation of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is being dismembered, transformed, and merged."</p><p></p><p>"This Xu Yuanxian is, and Jiang, the Dharma Transmitter, probably is too. But as subordinates of the Dharma Transmitter, they are undoubtedly on his side."</p><p></p><p>"They may have long anticipated the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's actions. But this has already exceeded their ability to handle, so they chose to watch from the sidelines..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, not everyone has the courage to stand up and oppose the Dharma Transmitter. Even the few Eternal Venerables of the Five Elders Conference let him do as he pleases."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"However, I believe there will still be hot-blooded people in the Xuanhuang Realm who are hard to cool down."</p><p></p><p>The figure of Shang Shaojun flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What's lacking now is an opportunity to unite them."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's starting to become somewhat befitting of the name."</p><p></p><p>This time, the Xuanhuang Realm actually took the initiative to release the Ink Killing to help conceal the whereabouts of the Holy Emperor's avatar. This was something Li Fan hadn't thought of before.</p><p></p><p>"Although this is related to the avatar helping and giving feedback to the Heavenly Dao through the Dark Sea, it's more because the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao has been in a state of isolation and helplessness for too long. Now that a Holy Emperor has suddenly appeared, it's as if it has grasped the last straw of life."</p><p></p><p>"With various coincidences and opportunities, the evolution of this avatar has really taken on some meaning."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his thoughts rapidly turning.</p><p></p><p>This caused a slight deviation in the path of the avatar's advancement.</p><p></p><p>It was like driving a car on the road. Li Fan could still firmly grasp the various functions of the car, but the road itself changed due to the car's own state.</p><p></p><p>"But for me, it may not be a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>"The more help from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, the more the bottom line of the Wanxian Alliance and even the Dharma Transmitter can be forced out."</p><p></p><p>"And it's time to explore the bottom line of that Xuanhuang Evil Thought as well."</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed simultaneously in the minds of Li Fan's true body and the Holy Emperor avatar.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba came to the Holy Emperor's seat together.</p><p></p><p>"What's the current situation in the small world of exotic beasts?" Li Ping first asked Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Answering Master. After personally witnessing the strength of our Holy Dynasty, especially seeing Xuanba's more advanced exotic beast technology, the Imperial Princess has agreed to submit unconditionally."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, its military strength is slowly being incorporated. Although the armies there are all mortals, after three to five years of transformation, they can become the military strength of our Holy Dynasty. Especially those numerous exotic beasts, to a certain extent, have alleviated the shortage of resources in the Holy Dynasty." Sun Erlang said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. The efficiency of our flesh and blood factory is expected to increase fivefold in three years. Moreover, that Imperial Princess does have her own unique insights into the development of exotic beast technology. She's even better than me!" Wang Xuanba spoke up in praise.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the reports from the two, Li Ping nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he told the two the location of the small world where the Xuanhuang Evil Thought, that is, Xu Ke, was located.</p><p></p><p>"You two, go there with Qing'er and Hong'er. See if you can invite Xu Ke back."</p><p></p><p>"Be respectful in your attitude."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They had run errands before, but this was the first time the Holy Emperor was so solemn.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers didn't dare to delay. They immediately took leave of the Holy Emperor and hurriedly came to the small world of the empire first.</p><p></p><p>They found the Holy Masters Qing'er and Hong'er.</p><p></p><p>"What? Xu Ke?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you didn't hear wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Qing'er and Hong'er were stunned after hearing what the two said.</p><p></p><p>Then Qing'er even lost her composure and directly grabbed Sun Erlang tightly, repeatedly asking for confirmation.</p><p></p><p>"Since Master said so, he must not be mistaken. You two, come with us?"</p><p></p><p>They immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>The four of them went together and arrived at the entrance of that small world.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The aura of the Beast Taming Sect's formation." Qing'er and Hong'er said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Their auras became a bit chaotic. Even though the person they wanted to see was right in front of them, at this moment, they suddenly lacked the courage to take that step.</p><p></p><p>It was only at Sun Erlang's urging that they entered the interior of the small world.</p><p></p><p>In the lonely world, only a white-haired old man sat alone on the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke!"</p><p></p><p>Qing'er's trembling voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The old man's body stiffened slightly, and then he slowly raised his head.</p><p></p><p>A green and a red figure were flying towards him at high speed.</p><p></p><p>The memories of the past suddenly flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>The scenes from thousands of years ago reappeared before Xu Ke's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Qing'er and Hong'er still looked the same as before.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Ke was already old and decrepit.</p><p></p><p>The three faced each other.</p><p></p><p>There were a thousand words to say, but they didn't know where to start.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Erlang."</p><p></p><p>"Wang Xuanba."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior."</p><p></p><p>But it was two voices that inappropriately interrupted the reunion of the three.</p>

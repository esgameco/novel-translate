        <div class="content">
            <p>"Do I still need you to remind me? Those few little guys were locked up by me as soon as they came back. It's just that no results have come out from the interrogation yet," Zhou said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan left the small world of the Dharma Transmitter Zhou, but appeared at the border of Tianquan Prefecture. </p><p></p><p>Looking in the direction of the nearby Underworld Prison, Li Fan eventually slowly withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"There will always be a chance to go down and take a look. No rush now."</p><p></p><p>Then he sped towards the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, no one is following, right?" </p><p></p><p>After flying for a while, Li Fan suddenly asked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a layer of transparent armor appeared on his body, with distinct edges, completely enveloping Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's voice came from the armor: "Rest assured Senior Brother, the two tracking divine senses have been cut off by me. And I also gave them a little warning."</p><p></p><p>Compared to five years ago, Tianyang's voice was much more lively now.</p><p></p><p>The sequelae of transforming into a puppet had been completely eliminated, becoming no different from a normal cultivator. </p><p></p><p>And all this was brought about by this immortal-grade [Battle Puppet].</p><p></p><p>This Battle Puppet, or rather Battle Armor, was the source of Li Fan's confidence to enter the assembly alone this time and directly face the two Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>After being tricked by Mo Rubin, Li Fan was deeply stimulated.</p><p></p><p>So he passed this pressure onto everyone in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the Ingenious Artisan perform exceptionally, completing the crafting of the immortal-grade puppet in just five years, but even the Medicine King Sect also frequently produced results, making Li Fan very satisfied. However, this will be briefly omitted for now.</p><p></p><p>After completely transforming, Tianyang's strength underwent earth-shaking changes.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Fan exhausted all his strength, he could not break through its defenses.</p><p></p><p>His divine abilities, such as Thread Pulling Life Severing, Five Elements Annihilation Sword, etc., could not shake Tianyang in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Even divine sense attacks were like mud entering the sea, unable to stir up half a ripple.</p><p></p><p>Only the imitated Chaotic Character Technique could bring trouble to Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>But that was the limit.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the transcendent power of Essence Origin as the core, Tianyang's current strength was definitely not inferior to the new Dharma Eternal of the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps lacking in offensive means, but he had this immortal-grade puppet body. Even if not victorious, he could only be suppressed and could not be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>And with Tianyang, comparable to an Eternal, transforming into armor to protect him, how could Li Fan take those two mere Dharma Transmitters seriously.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for accidentally obtaining the news that Mo Rubin was secretly controlling the entire Myriad Immortal Alliance, Li Fan had even originally planned to directly capture and subdue these two Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>The protection brought by Tianyang was comprehensive. Not only in terms of the physical body, but even soul attacks needed to first break Tianyang's spiritual will before being able to harm Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>How strong was Tianyang's will?</p><p></p><p>At the Foundation Establishment stage, he could crystallize for thousands of years without perishing, transforming into an eternal imprint. Now that he had become an immortal realm puppet, it was further sublimated. Even Li Fan felt inferior.</p><p></p><p>Even if directly facing Mo Rubin now, he was full of confidence and fearless.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang quickly brought Li Fan back to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>After five years, the Spirit Wood Realm had changed greatly again.</p><p></p><p>The Boundary Realm, Empire, Beast Realm, and other small worlds originally connected to the Spirit Wood Realm through spatial passages had slowly begun to integrate with the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan deceived the Heavenly Dao,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Observing the fusion and integration of the Xuanhuang Realm with other cultivation realms, Li Fan gained insights and comprehended the method of world devouring and merging.</p><p></p><p>However, with his current strength, it was still a bit difficult for him to achieve the same level as the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>He could only take a different approach through the method of array refining.</p><p></p><p>From a macro perspective, the current Lingmu Realm looked like a deformed monster grafted with many small worlds.</p><p></p><p>But aesthetics was never Li Fan's focus, as long as it was practical, it was good.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was Li Fan's first attempt. With experience, he believed that the technique of "crafting" and fusing worlds would get better and better in the future.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the changes in the Lingmu Realm itself, the Myriad Realms Alliance was also divided into several different departments according to different functions.</p><p></p><p>It was truly taking shape and no longer just an empty framework.</p><p></p><p>The [Elixir Concoction] department, with the former Medicine King Sect and others as the backbone.</p><p></p><p>The [Artifact Refining] department, led by Ingenious Recluse, Fang Zaiji, and many disciples.</p><p></p><p>The [Abyssal Exploration] department, led by Li Fan's avatar Li Qing, with elite soldiers selected from various small worlds as the core force.</p><p></p><p>There was also the [Enlightenment] department, mainly composed of young cultivators with exceptional talents like Shanhe Xuan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scale had taken shape, and the momentum was magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not disturb them and went straight to a vast space next to the underground secret chamber that was opened up later.</p><p></p><p>Currently, only he himself knew about this space, and the surroundings were all protected by seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan named this yet-to-be-formed department [World Destruction].</p><p></p><p>Just as its name suggests, the cultivators in this department would need to research various methods that could destroy the Xuanhuang Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>It was quite shocking and appalling, so even though the cultivators in the alliance were absolutely subservient to Li Fan, he temporarily did not let them know about the existence of this department.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I can only find those equally extreme individuals." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself while looking at the things wrapped in seven-colored light clusters in the [World Destruction] space.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority were gray mold spots cultivated over the past five years, prepared for a rainy day.</p><p></p><p>But there were also some new things.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stretched out his hand, and a cluster of seemingly faded seven-colored light flew weakly into Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Xuntian Arrow..."</p><p></p><p>"Deceiving the Heavenly Dao, after being able to see through the bizarre power, I can finally replicate it."</p><p></p><p>The Xuntian Arrow was the ultimate tool used by the Tianmeng cultivators to resist the Profound Net in the previous reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the bizarre destructive power, it caused regional damage to the Profound Net.</p><p></p><p>And now, with the Tianxuan Mirror not having replaced the Heavens, the Xuntian Arrow's performance was to cause a large-scale outbreak of the bizarre and loss of control of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre power of the Xuntian Arrow was not generated by Li Fan himself.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he personally went to those areas where the bizarre outbreaks occurred and collected it bit by bit. Then, he wrapped and sealed it with seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>Use one, lose one.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the current dense frequency of bizarre outbreaks in the Xuanhuang Realm, there was no need to worry about not having enough for the time being.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Xuntian Arrow, another major killing weapon in the [World Destruction] space was the [Chaos] Spell.</p><p></p><p>Borrowing the experience of automatic detonation from the 115th world and obtaining improvement ideas from Ingenious Recluse.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Spell was engraved inside the puppet's body and had a certain level of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>It could go to the designated location and time as required by Li Fan to detonate the Chaos Spell.</p><p></p><p>And what was even more wonderful was that this puppet had the function of interfering with cause and effect.</p>

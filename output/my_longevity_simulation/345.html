        <h1>Chapter 345</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This question was actually not important. Since the Wanxian Alliance and many cultivators had already made their conclusion, then no matter what his past was like, from now on, he would be a ghost wandering within the territory of the Wanxian Alliance, preying on people at will, making it impossible to guard against. </p><p></p><p>Every person could potentially be the unforgivably evil Thousand-Faced Demon Lord. And the final right to interpret his identity lay in the hands of the Wanxian Alliance who possessed the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation. This was the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could already foresee that once the Soul-Locking Formation was fully constructed, the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance would face an even more perilous cultivation environment.</p><p></p><p>"If things really deteriorate to that extent, the situation can be said to have completely collapsed. As a mere little Golden Core cultivator, I'm afraid it will be extremely difficult for me to remain unaffected. Perhaps by then I can return to the truth early..."</p><p></p><p>When the troops arrive, block them. When the water comes, use soil to cover it. There are at least more than ten years before the Soul-Locking Formation becomes widespread. No matter how many more concerns, for Li Fan at this time, it was just worrying about troubles that had yet to come.</p><p></p><p>Take one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suppressed the miscellaneous thoughts in his heart and started operating the ritual to enter the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Fusheng Xuanhuang Immortal Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of him gradually became clear from blurry. The sound of howling wind kept coming to his ears. It seemed like he was flying at high speed at a high altitude. The bone-chilling cold around made Li Fan's body shiver a little.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? This time it's actually different from Ningyuan City, I didn't start over again inside the egg?" Li Fan, who had recovered a bit of self-awareness, was a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, he recalled the time point when the scene in front of him occurred. </p><p></p><p>The little boy Xu Ke was tightly hugging the neck of the Qingluan bird, while Li Fan was hanging on his neck.</p><p></p><p>The Qingluan bird was rushing in a certain direction according to the little boy's instructions. </p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the scene when he left the Fallen Immortal Realm last time?</p><p></p><p>It really became a continuous drama?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt it was a bit wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Although he lost the opportunity to infinitely explore opportunities by repeating, he also wouldn't feel anxious because of constantly repeating a certain time and space.</p><p></p><p>It could be said there were pros and cons.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a mysterious bird greatly limited Li Fan's thinking ability. He simply didn't think too much, but scratched Xu Ke's hair and started to ponder the divine ability he comprehended when he entered last time.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the extremely powerful Heavenly Fate Mysterious Light, there was also the [Heavenly Fate Lies with Me] that could condense fortune without dispersing.</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, when he looked at Xu Ke's head again, he saw that beam of purple-gold light pillar rushing straight into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instinctively began to absorb the energy radiating from the purple-gold light of fortune bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had taken the most powerful spiritual elixir in the world. As the starry purple-gold light entered his body, Li Fan felt like he had jumped into a hot spring, feeling warm all over.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he clearly felt that his soul and physique were slowly getting stronger. </p><p></p><p>Letting out a comfortable breath, he turned into an imperceptible thin golden line that ordinary people could not detect, and re-entered the purple-gold pillar of fortune light on top of Xu Ke's head.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Fate Mysterious Bird, so that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately understood what the [Heavenly Fate Lies with Me] divine ability was all about.</p><p></p><p>Between heaven and earth, all kinds of creatures have their own fortune, each different. </p><p></p><p>Some have smooth sailing in everything they do, always able to turn misfortune into blessing.</p><p></p><p>While others are born unlucky to the extreme, even drinking cold water can get stuck in their teeth.</p><p></p><p>But fortune is not unchanging.</p><p></p><p>It is extremely susceptible to the influence of the external environment.</p><p></p><p>Those who have been going with the flow smoothly in the first half of their lives may suddenly encounter bad luck after experiencing certain things, and their lives will take a sharp turn for the worse from then on.</p><p></p><p>And those who have been unlucky for most of their lives may also suddenly have a turn of fortune one day and become wealthy and noble from then on.</p><p></p><p>The reason is that fortune will interact with external things and is extremely variable.</p><p></p><p>The weaker the original fortune, the more so.</p><p></p><p>For someone as noble as Xu Ke, although his fortune is not so easily impacted, every time he encounters a disaster, it will consume some of his original fortune.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in daily activities, it is always in a state of radiating outward, constantly consuming itself.</p><p></p><p>As time goes by, if there is only output and no input, the fortune will naturally become weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>The [Heavenly Fate Lies with Me] divine ability of the mysterious bird can absorb the fortune exposed by the master in daily life, nourishing itself while re-feeding the condensed fortune back to the master.</p><p></p><p>It can also temporarily lend its own fortune to the master in times of crisis.</p><p></p><p>To overcome life and death crisis with strong fortune.</p><p></p><p>In short, the mysterious bird and its master can be said to complement each other and bring out the best in each other.</p><p></p><p>"It seems not bad to follow this kid." Li Fan greedily took another breath of the invisible purple-gold qi, and couldn't help thinking so.</p><p></p><p>"Hey kid, where are you going now?" After absorbing this wisp of fortune, Li Fan felt himself become several times stronger.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he immediately tried to communicate with Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Of course not by speaking, but by silently reciting in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Little Black, you actually learned telepathy!" After a moment, Xu Ke's voice rang out in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Little... Black? Who are you talking about?" Li Fan grabbed hard and scratched Xu Ke fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"Ow, it hurts." Xu Ke touched his head left and right, his tone full of innocence, "The crane is Little Red, the Qingluan is Little Green. You're black all over, so there's nothing wrong with me calling you Little Black, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pecked him hard several times in a row, "I am the great Heavenly Fate Mysterious Bird! How can you use such a vulgar name?!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Xu Ke was in pain and had to compromise.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll still call you Little Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was still a little annoyed, at this moment he was attached to a different creature and his brain was not fully developed.</p><p></p><p>With insufficient brain capacity, he couldn't think of a better name for the time being, so he had to let it go for now.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't answered my question yet, where are we going now?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan acquiesced to the name he gave it, Xu Ke immediately let out a silly giggle.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he replied in his mind, "We're going to find Senior Brother Lu Ya now."</p><p></p><p>"The whole sect is still in a mess. It's all White Sir's fault for being too ruthless and scaring everyone."</p><p></p><p>"Many fellow disciples are unwilling to cultivate in the sect anymore, feeling there's no future."</p><p></p><p>"Some ran away, some escaped. The elders and many seniors, who knows where they all ran to. No one has come out to preside over order."</p><p></p><p>"The chaos is getting worse and worse."</p><p></p><p>"It's really too dangerous. If we encounter someone like Song Yang again, we may not be so lucky."</p><p></p><p>"So it's still safer to go find Senior Brother Lu Ya. He's so strong, staying by his side will definitely be safer."</p><p></p><p>"And maybe we can even see White Sir, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's thoughts were quick, and he spoke in a torrent of words.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know where your Senior Brother Lu Ya is?" Li Fan asked in some surprise.</p>

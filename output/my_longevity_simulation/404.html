        <div class="content">
            <p>"What's going on?" Huang Lao couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Weird, why did the Yàowáng Dǐng's trajectory suddenly deviate?" Liu Rúchén's voice sounded puzzled. "Could it be that there's a problem with the guide's sensor?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Yàowáng Dǐng is all normal."</p><p></p><p>"But what exactly is..."</p><p></p><p>Before Liu Rúchén could find the answer, Huang Lao's panicked voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, it seems like something is not right."</p><p></p><p>"Why do we seem to be going upwards instead of forwards?"</p><p></p><p>The surroundings suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The perspective kept shrinking, and Xiāo Héng and the others saw that shortly after leaving the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yàowáng Dǐng, which was originally flying straight into the distance, for some unknown reason, slowly changed its trajectory.</p><p></p><p>As if there was something above attracting it.</p><p></p><p>In the dark void, the Yàowáng Dǐng drew a curved line.</p><p></p><p>Helplessly, slowly falling towards the top.</p><p></p><p>The speed kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>There was no trace of starlight, just pitch black.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, it seemed like a fierce beast, opening its huge mouth, awaiting its prey.</p><p></p><p>Liu Rúchén's heart turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Staring down representing the Xuánhuáng Realm, the glowing cloud that was continuously drifting away and getting smaller, he seemed to see mocking eyes from within.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, everything became clear to Liu Rúchén.</p><p></p><p>Why the ten sects of the Immortal Path knew that he and others wanted to escape but didn't stop them.</p><p></p><p>Because they already knew.</p><p></p><p>There was simply no way out.</p><p></p><p>"Ten sects of the Immortal Path..." Liu Rúchén gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the Yàowáng Dǐng had exceeded its limits, starting to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>"Leader!"</p><p></p><p>The creaking sounds came from all directions, and Huang Lao cried out in panic.</p><p></p><p>Just a few breaths later.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, you..."</p><p></p><p>First, Huang Lao let out an incredulous scream.</p><p></p><p>"Yàowáng Sect disciples, listen..."</p><p></p><p>Following that, Liu Rúchén started giving orders to the disciples inside the Yàowáng Dǐng.</p><p></p><p>Telling them to quickly return to their respective rooms.</p><p></p><p>"Don't blame me..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Rúchén's low voice echoed in the space.</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on my own strength, there is simply no way to escape from there..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of despair could be heard in his voice.</p><p></p><p>"However, for the Yàowáng Sect."</p><p></p><p>"I must do this."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Liu Rúchén spoke with firm determination.</p><p></p><p>Following that, a large green light enveloped the entire Yàowáng Dǐng.</p><p></p><p>"Ten sects of the Immortal Path!"</p><p></p><p>In a voice full of resentment and roaring.</p><p></p><p>The green light grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the Yàowáng Dǐng suddenly slowed down significantly.</p><p></p><p>But it still couldn't change its fate of falling towards the top.</p><p></p><p>The green light became more dazzling.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the Yàowáng Dǐng slowed down more and more.</p><p></p><p>And more.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in an endless pitch-black domain, it came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, many green lights were drawn out.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Yàowáng Dǐng start to change the direction of its speed.</p><p></p><p>Avoiding the fate of being swallowed, it fell downwards.</p><p></p><p>During the escape, the green brilliance kept flickering.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to be rapidly consuming.</p><p></p><p>In the end, when the Yàowáng Dǐng fell back to the Xuánhuáng Realm, the green light had become nearly invisible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"That's what happened back then." Lìnghú Chāng said with a touch of sadness.</p><p></p><p>Xiāo Héng and the others were still reeling from the shock brought by the scene, unable to react.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?" Sū Xiǎo mèi, who was usually fearless, asked in fear.</p><p></p><p>Though not explicitly stated, everyone present understood who she was referring to.</p><p></p><p>"That is the Immortal Ruins. In ancient times when the path to ascension had not been cut off, it was the passage to the Immortal Realm," Lìnghú Chāng answered her question.</p><p></p><p>"Before the leader passed away, he understood many things," Lìnghú Chāng said.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Path is obscured, and the connection with other cultivation realms is severed..."</p><p></p><p>"All because above the Xuánhuáng Realm, there is a terrifying existence."</p><p></p><p>"It devours everything, even twisting time and space."</p><p></p><p>"Just one circle around it, and a thousand years of time have passed outside."</p><p></p><p>Lìnghú Chāng said in a low voice, narrating slowly.</p><p></p><p>Lìnghú Chāng clenched his fists, his nails almost piercing into his flesh.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Ruins..." Xiāo Héng and the others whispered, their hearts filled with inexplicable horror.</p><p></p><p>"Will our world be entirely sucked up?" Sū Xiǎo mèi opened her mouth, somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Lìnghú Chāng sneered, "Back then, the ten sects of the Immortal Path were still in conflicts, overt or covert."</p><p></p><p>"But suddenly, from a certain moment, they became incredibly united and spoke with one voice."</p><p></p><p>"It is probably due to their contribution that the Xuánhuáng Realm can survive until now."</p><p></p><p>Xiāo Héng and the others slightly relaxed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>But the sense of unease that kept surging in their hearts was not something that could be dispelled in a short time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Xiāo Héng and the others finally realized the true situation of the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fán, who was unaware of all this, had already completed the final verification of the Tianxuān Soul-Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuān Soul-Locking Formation completely covered the area, and all the formation masters involved in its construction received an invitation from the Wànxiān Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Heavenly Spirit Province to witness the debut of the Soul-Locking Formation?"</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fán looked at the black gold invitation in his hand, resembling a jade slip, and asked Huángfǔ Sōng.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's related to the void of the Heavenly Spirit Province," Huángfǔ Sōng whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, it is almost certain that the Five Elders will provoke war again."</p><p></p><p>"So the decision within the alliance was to take advantage of the opportunity when the Soul-Locking Formation is first revealed and give them a harsh lesson."</p><p></p><p>Li Fán nodded slowly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the jade slip, he inexplicably felt a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, many people have already arrived."</p><p></p><p>"It wouldn't be good to miss such a grand event."</p><p></p><p>Huángfǔ Sōng controlled the Dust Crossing Boat, flying towards the Yanghua Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Then, passing through the transmission array, they continued hurrying towards the Tianxuān Province.</p><p></p><p>Midway, Li Fán suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Huángfǔ, you go ahead first."</p><p></p><p>"I have something to attend to and need to make a detour to the Wànxiān Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fán said to Huángfǔ Sōng.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he showed a look that only Huángfǔ Sōng could understand.</p><p></p><p>"The Wànxiān Alliance headquarters?" Huángfǔ Sōng was surprised, but soon understood.</p><p></p><p>"Then, congratulations to Daoist friend in advance!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fán with envy, Huángfǔ Sōng then shook his head inwardly and left first.</p><p></p><p>After Huángfǔ Sōng left, Li Fán's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he recalled the message just received from Lù Xuě Jìng.</p><p></p><p>"Danger."</p><p></p><p>"It seems my premonition was right, there is indeed trouble in the Heavenly Spirit Province."</p>

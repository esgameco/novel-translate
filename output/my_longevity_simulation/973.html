        <h1>Chapter 973</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you want to pry into my secrets, be prepared to pay a terrible price."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the "Ru Wo" ability that catches people off guard upon first encounter, the actual combat power of Jiang the Dharma Transmitter was not as strong as Li Fan had imagined.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, there were still many hidden tricks that hadn't been used. Just relying on the combined divine thoughts of those million demons, Li Fan easily crushed him!</p><p></p><p>"Even if he doesn't die, he'll be seriously injured!"</p><p></p><p>More crucially, it was the gray mold spore that was sent into the other party's divine thoughts!</p><p></p><p>The split small-scale mold spore that Li Fan had previously cultivated with the flesh and blood of exotic beasts and sealed with the seven-colored divine light was finally used by Li Fan as a doomsday weapon.</p><p></p><p>That's right, Li Fan had indeed been unwittingly fooled before!</p><p></p><p>He really thought of himself as that Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he always liked to speak in a veiled and ambiguous manner. So in the process of being questioned by the other party, he did indeed expose many of his own secrets.</p><p></p><p>But not too much was exposed.</p><p></p><p>The fact that he was in the Lingmu Realm was exposed. But the Lingmu Realm was a name Li Fan gave to this small world, and was not known to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>There are countless small worlds in the Xuanhuang realm, which one is the Lingmu Realm?</p><p></p><p>The million demons, although they were brought about by the "Three Calamities and Hundred Tribulations Mingod Dharma" derived from the practice of the Yanfa Jue, were just a change in form. Their fundamental prototype was the "Three Perils Ghost God Mingyou Record". So it was not wrong to say it was a profound heavenly secret art, a legacy of the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Mo Rubin had infiltrated the high levels of the Myriad Immortals Alliance was exposed, but the other party only knew the name Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>As for who Mo Rubin is...</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there are so many people at the Immortal Alliance headquarters, go and guess them one by one.</p><p></p><p>It was exposed that he knew of the existence of the Starving Immortals in the Immortal Ruins, and knew that he had the ability to bring down the Xuanhuang Realm with him...</p><p></p><p>This was not a bad thing instead. Rather, it was a kind of intangible deterrence.</p><p></p><p>What was really fatal was that Li Fan exposed the existence of "Huan Zhen".</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Li Fan immediately released the gray mold spore that had been sealed for a long time as a counterattack after he came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>And the reason why he didn't immediately use Huan Zhen...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully reviewed the other party's reaction at that time.</p><p></p><p>"It was mostly doubt, without much shock or pleasant surprise."</p><p></p><p>"Only knowing that I have 'Huan Zhen', but not knowing the specific use of Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's also possible that he may realize it soon afterwards."</p><p></p><p>"Provided that he can persist in staying alive."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan still decided to wait and see how things would specifically develop in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, his mind was now in harmony with the heaven and earth of the Lingmu Realm. If he really encountered a powerful enemy at his doorstep, he would have ample time to leisurely use "Huan Zhen".</p><p></p><p>"As for those million divine thought demons, they really can't be kept anymore."</p><p></p><p>Faced with this extremely powerful force, Li Fan did not hesitate in the slightest and issued the order to recall them.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan extracted them, what remained was just an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>Although it still had the combat power of roughly a Huashen, it acted without knowledge or consciousness, purely on instinct, and no longer had Li Fan's commands to expand and proliferate.</p><p></p><p>If the Myriad Immortals Alliance wanted to suppress them, although it would still take some effort, the price they had to pay would not be so great.</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, Li Fan told Mo Rubin about his decision.</p><p></p><p>And then he completely severed his connection with these demons.</p><p></p><p>"Using the sea of consciousness of millions of cultivators as an incubator, in a short period of time, my divine consciousness..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The strength has almost doubled."</p><p></p><p>After retracting his mind energy, Li Fan checked and couldn't help but sigh slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a supreme method, but unfortunately it cannot be used often."</p><p></p><p>"Next, let me see how the Wanxian Alliance will deal with the remaining demons and that deadly gray mold."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully they can persist for a few more years."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat still in the Lingmu Realm, closely monitoring the changes in the Xuanhuang Realm through the believers of the Hongchen Cibei True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>At the Immortal Alliance headquarters, in the Guixu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang, the Dharma Transmitter who was defeated by Li Fan, reappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his appearance was very different from the young man he was before.</p><p></p><p>His face was full of cracks, like a cracked earth.</p><p></p><p>His hair had also turned mostly white.</p><p></p><p>Even more horrifying was that part of his flesh and blood had become somewhat blurry.</p><p></p><p>With a series of squirming, it disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had tried his best to support himself, Dharma Transmitter Jiang had almost become riddled with holes.</p><p></p><p>But Dharma Transmitter Jiang did not seek help from other Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that the gray mold that caused all this was also highly infectious.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his own body being a cage, using all the power in his body to barely restrict it; if it weren't for this place being the Guixu Realm, and besides him, the surroundings were completely empty, leaving the gray mold with no way to spread...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps at this moment, the Wanxian Alliance and even the Xuanhuang Realm would have been in a state of utter chaos and destruction.</p><p></p><p>As his life was about to come to an end, there was no trace of fear on Dharma Transmitter Jiang's face for some reason.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the catastrophe back then was related to the Xuantian Sect? Impossible..."</p><p></p><p>There was too much doubt and confusion on Dharma Transmitter Jiang's face.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Dharma Transmitter Jiang was finally completely devoured by the gray mold.</p><p></p><p>Only a large piece of squirming gray-yellow shadow was left, trying to spread to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>But in the Guixu Realm, there was only complete emptiness.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the gray mold could only be trapped in this small world.</p><p></p><p>It hesitated and did not advance.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>A strong wave swept across the Guixu Realm at a constant speed.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold seemed to sense something and boiled like water being heated.</p><p></p><p>Then it rapidly expanded to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to form a huge gray-yellow paper, wanting to occupy the entire Guixu Realm.</p><p></p><p>But a strange thing happened.</p><p></p><p>Where the wave passed, the gray mold of unknown origin, which might have destroyed an entire immortal cultivation realm and made even Li Fan feel very apprehensive, disappeared inch by inch in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The Guixu Realm also returned to its previous state of only emptiness.</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>In addition to the emptiness, there was another existence in the Guixu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without any sign, Dharma Transmitter Jiang, who should have been dead, reappeared in the Guixu Realm!</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang did not seem surprised by his resurrection.</p><p></p><p>He just looked around, and a trace of astonishment appeared on his face: "This time's [Return to Origin], there is no information left at all?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly did we encounter?"</p><p></p><p>"Even the information itself can be contaminated?"</p><p></p><p>As Dharma Transmitter Jiang muttered to himself, everything that happened in the Wanxian Alliance, now and before, appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Failed to catch the culprit and got killed instead."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p>

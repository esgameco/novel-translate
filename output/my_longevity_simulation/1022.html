        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1020: The Realms Beyond Xuan Huang</p><p></p><p>One by one, the heavenly materials and earthly treasures formed the skeletal framework of the puppet, as the golden source energy surged like tides, forming "flesh and blood tissues" that attached to the skeleton.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Machine Puppet slowly took shape.</p><p></p><p>And in the process of the golden source energy emerging, Li Fan also vaguely heard intermittent whispers at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"What's that sound?" Qiao Gong Jushi had a leisurely look, so Li Fan wasn't afraid to disturb him and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Not sure. But it's a phenomenon that inevitably occurs when using source energy, no need to worry. We cultivators of the Heavenly Machine Realm call it [World Whispers]. Once you've seen it many times, you get used to it."</p><p></p><p>While answering Li Fan, he stared intently at the Heavenly Machine Puppet, meticulously manipulating the source energy. </p><p></p><p>Limbs, torso, head, followed by skin and hair...</p><p></p><p>All slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect Master Liu Ruchen looked at the scene before him in utter shock.</p><p></p><p>Such a method of refining puppets was completely beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Heavenly Machine Puppet with an appearance identical to Liu Ruchen was created, Liu Ruchen also inexplicably felt an irresistible desire to possess it.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please." Qiao Gong Jushi said lazily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan nod, only then did Liu Ruchen cautiously fly closer.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Machine Puppet erupted with a burst of faint light. A moment later, it opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>With a new lease on life, Liu Ruchen opened and closed his hands, his expression one of shock: "It feels exactly the same as my original body."</p><p></p><p>"There's even the existence of a dantian and sea of consciousness! How was this achieved?"</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Jushi didn't pay any attention to Liu Ruchen: "Are we done here? If there's nothing else, I'll head back first. Daoist Tian Yang is still waiting for me!" He asked impatiently.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and let him leave.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Liu, how are the methods of our Myriad Realms Alliance?" Li Fan asked, looking at Liu Ruchen who was still experiencing his new body.</p><p></p><p>"Divinely skillful, simply divine." Liu Ruchen said with heartfelt admiration. </p><p></p><p>Then his expression shifted slightly: "Myriad Realms Alliance... Could it be that Daoist Qiao Gong just now is not a native cultivator of the Xuan Huang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded: "Sect Master Liu is indeed insightful. Daoist Qiao Gong hails from the [Heavenly Machine Realm]."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Ruchen exclaimed: "Heavenly Machine Realm? The legendary cultivation realm established atop a gigantic puppet, drifting indeterminately through the starry skies?"</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is, it all makes sense now."</p><p></p><p>After some questioning from Li Fan, he learned that the Medicine King Sect's old ancestor "Medicine King Sun Piaomiao" had once traveled the realms and recorded his experiences.</p><p></p><p>Among them were records about the Heavenly Machine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"But later on, the immortal paths were severed, and there was basically no more interaction between the various cultivation realms. So the records about each realm are still stuck in the distant past."</p><p></p><p>"When I decided to lead my entire sect to escape and flee Xuan Huang, our destination was the closest [Xiaoyao] Realm. The cultivators there revere the Dao of inaction and carefree living, dislike conflict, and are very friendly to outsiders. It's a good place to go. Unfortunately..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen's face darkened slightly.</p><p></p><p>A simple star map suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It marked the Dao coordinates of eighteen cultivation realms surrounding the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be randomly arranged, with no discernible pattern.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were no special rules.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the eighteen fixed and immovable ones, there were two more cultivation worlds without specific locations.</p><p></p><p>One was the Tianji World, and the other was called "Xuanshang".</p><p></p><p>According to the travelogue, Xuanshang was more like a huge flying boat than a world.</p><p></p><p>Xuanshang traveled between various cultivation worlds, exchanging goods and seeking profits.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor Piaomiao, being able to spiritually roam the worlds is truly enviable." After scanning through the contents of the travelogue a few times, Li Fan sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>The era was too ancient, and the starry sea had undergone tremendous changes. Everything recorded in the travelogue had probably turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, it had been devoured by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshang..."</p><p></p><p>"The behavior of the cultivators in this world seems to be somewhat similar to that of the Jiaoxiuyuan. If there is a chance in the future, it can be verified."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen, unaware of Li Fan's thoughts, continued, "It is said that the old ancestor was preparing to travel even further, but for some reason, he changed his mind in the end. It seems to be due to some special reasons in the starry space where we are located. However, the specific reasons were not told to later generations by the old ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression slightly changed: "Something special?"</p><p></p><p>In the era when Sun Piaomiao lived, the path of immortality had not yet been severed. The "High Wall" naturally did not exist yet.</p><p></p><p>But the starry sea where the Xuanhuang World was located was already different...</p><p></p><p>"All the immortals who ascended from the Xuanhuang World throughout history cannot be found in any relevant records."</p><p></p><p>"Either every predecessor has ascended to become a 'Nameless True Immortal', or some powerful being has erased their information."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan led Liu Ruchen to tour the splendid scenery of the Lingmu World.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the mountains, rivers, and lakes modeled after the Xuanhuang World, or the ruins of various ancient great sects that were imitated.</p><p></p><p>Or the towering tree standing in the center, all of them made Liu Ruchen praise endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after solemnly paying respects to the stone statue of the Faceless True Immortal, Li Fan took out the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Now that there is a restriction that prohibits cultivating the same technique, if all the disciples in the cauldron are awakened, they will inevitably fall into infighting. Sect Master Liu, what do you think should be done?"</p><p></p><p>"Our Myriad Worlds Alliance has a cultivation technique called 'Cangshengling Yuan Gong'. It can exempt this kind of restriction..."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Li Fan's introduction, Liu Ruchen pondered for a moment and gave a reply.</p><p></p><p>"Since we have decided to join the alliance, we naturally have to contribute."</p><p></p><p>"In terms of combat power, our Medicine King Sect may not be much. But when it comes to alchemy and cultivating spiritual plants, our Medicine King Sect is quite skilled."</p><p></p><p>"However..." A trace of hesitation appeared on Liu Ruchen's face.</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years have passed, and I don't know to what extent the art of alchemy has developed in the Xuanhuang World today. But if we can get some specific medicinal pills and give us some time, we should be able to catch up."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen clearly understood that the best way to ensure the safety of the entire Medicine King Sect was to demonstrate their value as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>After all, after seeing the tree people who worked tirelessly day and night in the Lingmu World, as well as the flesh puppets that had completely turned into machines for cultivating techniques, Liu Ruchen knew that this Myriad Worlds Alliance was definitely not a kind bunch.</p><p></p><p>And the "envoy" representing the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal in front of him, the former Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>He was definitely not as kind and benevolent as he appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Jishi Changsheng Scripture has special benefits for alchemy. So it's best for the sect elders to choose to retain some of their original cultivation."</p>

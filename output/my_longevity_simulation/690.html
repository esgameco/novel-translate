        <h1>Chapter 690</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>All the cultivators who were playing with and admiring the Tianling flowers in their hands just a moment ago suddenly found it tasteless.</p><p></p><p>"So, there really are true ancient species in the world..."</p><p></p><p>Holding onto this thought, they abandoned the so-called best and top-grade Tianling flowers and began frantically searching for the ancient species.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>To their surprise, after dozens of days passed, almost half of the Wanxian Alliance's power was mobilized, but they still couldn't find the legendary existence of the original Tianling species.</p><p></p><p>So, they couldn't help but doubt the truthfulness of the news about the existence of the original species.</p><p></p><p>However, after strict questioning of the cultivators who witnessed the event that day, they finally believed that the event was real!</p><p></p><p>The Tianling flower that appeared that day was definitely an authentic original species.</p><p></p><p>Now things became interesting.</p><p></p><p>It was known that changes had already occurred in the world of Tianlingzhou, and there were no longer any bloodless Tianling flowers being born in the world.</p><p></p><p>The Tianling flowers displayed by the beautiful cultivator were not in the ordinary state of Tianling flowers but seemed to be sealed in a thin piece of paper.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator, before the great battle of Tianlingzhou, somehow managed to preserve a Tianling flower with seventeen petals!</p><p></p><p>This was most likely the only original Tianling species in the world!</p><p></p><p>It was not the kind that only existed for a moment but the kind that could last a long time, always available for viewing and appreciating with others!</p><p></p><p>The implication in this...</p><p></p><p>The value of things lies only in their rarity.</p><p></p><p>The unique one in the world.</p><p></p><p>Immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>People started frantically searching for the white-robed cultivator who had appeared with the original Tianling species that day.</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled people was that since that day, that person seemed to have evaporated from the earth, never to be seen again. His past was also mysterious, as if he had suddenly fallen from the sky, and no one knew his origin or identity.</p><p></p><p>Even when various cultivators tried to use divination, they couldn't pry into him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there were various speculations.</p><p></p><p>Some said he was a spy for the Five Elders Association. The original Tianling species was also fake, created just to disrupt and destroy the emerging Tianling flower market.</p><p></p><p>Others speculated that he might be a hermit in the mountains and wilderness, living hidden in caves. His sudden appearance and disappearance might have been to wait for the right opportunity to profit.</p><p></p><p>Just when the outside world became increasingly curious about the mysterious Xu Bai,</p><p></p><p>Here, Xu Bai had already returned to the realm of the Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>Fusing his own fortune with the fortune of the small world, his body was like the world itself, resisting the occasional divination pointing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, rest assured, being within the small world weakens the outside world's perception of you."</p><p></p><p>"I and Lao Fang have joined forces to conceal the heavenly secrets for you..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San stroked his beard and confidently said, "As long as it's not the venerable one from Changsheng Heaven, they will never be able to find their way here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was not worried about this.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the defense measures mentioned by Liu San, he also had his "One Hand to Cover the Sky" secret technique at his disposal. Even the profound web could be obscured, and he believed that the current Wanxian Alliance might not be able to divine his presence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the Enlightened Venerable came personally for this trivial matter, then so be it. He would accept it then!</p><p></p><p>After all, he was safe in the vortex thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>"Major Clan Leader, your strategy of teasing your pursuers is quite clever. According to the feedback from our disciples outside, those guys are all impatient, scratching their heads, willing to pay a high price just to see the legendary Tianling flower original species."</p><p></p><p>"Even some cultivators have offered to exchange a genuine Daoist technique with you for the original species. Tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai remained unchanged in expression and said calmly, "No hurry, let them wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>"Major Clan Leader is right," Fang Zaiji responded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"However, Major Clan Leader, the commotion you caused this time is a bit too much. I'm afraid that when you go out later, those treasures I crafted for you may not be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>He furrowed his brows, showing some concern.</p><p></p><p>"If three to five Daoists form an alliance and try to forcefully seize it, your clone, Major Clan Leader, will indeed be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai twitched his face.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have my own plans. Mr. Fang, go and study the King of Medicine's True Ding."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji smiled and disappeared with a flicker.</p><p></p><p>"Lao Liu, I have a matter to entrust to you." After Fang Zaiji left, Xu Bai suddenly said to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, please give your orders," Liu San responded earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Help me find this person." Xu Bai projected the portrait of Jiao Xiuyuan in the air.</p><p></p><p>"And you still do not have the identity of Wanxian Alliance, so you can only search outside the wilderness."</p><p></p><p>"Focus more on the ruins of ancient sects, and it shouldn't be too difficult."</p><p></p><p>"After finding him, hand this item over to him. Tell him I have some business to discuss with him..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai carefully instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, please rest assured."</p><p></p><p>With the order in hand, Liu San immediately left the Changsheng Valley to search for Jiao Xiuyuan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Bai's attention was mainly focused on his main body.</p><p></p><p>In the Ruins of the Netherworld, within the Vortex.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, look, is that the time mirage you were talking about!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao pointed at the huge pillar of light rising into the sky from the whirlpool, extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Although he had almost shouted himself hoarse, amidst the violent storm, the sound was barely audible.</p><p></p><p>Even the transmission of divine consciousness was affected by the surrounding distorted spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>During these months when Li Fan was enlightening Dongfang Yao, he noticed that something unusual was brewing within the Vortex.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao felt nothing unusual, but Li Fan vaguely sensed something.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, on this day, as Dongfang Yao who was rushing into the center of the vortex, forging his body with the black rift's tearing force suddenly fell into a daze.</p><p></p><p>As the power of the rift tore his body apart, leaving terrifying scars and fresh blood flowing, he remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Within the whirlpool, a towering mountain peak mysteriously appeared.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was surrounded by a red snake.</p><p></p><p>Then, from the peak of the mountain, a brilliant white light suddenly flashed.</p><p></p><p>Like the sharpest blade, it tore through the space.</p><p></p><p>Bursting out, straight to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The world trembled, and the mountain peak gradually disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>The red snake, amidst its howls, was forced to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"The rift, this is the true rift..."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao looked at this spectacular scene, murmuring to himself in a daze.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The Mirage of Time, a rare sight in a hundred years. Yet, I have encountered it so easily."</p><p></p><p>(Untranslated Text)</p>

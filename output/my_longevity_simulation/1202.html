        <h1>Chapter 1202</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1200: No One to Reverse the Falling Sky</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, when Yishu and most of the Taiyan Sect disciples first learned about the theories of the Crossing Calamity Sect, they absolutely sneered at them.</p><p></p><p>When calamity strikes, instead of actively seeking ways to deal with it, they chose to be like turtles hiding their heads and pinning their hopes on some illusory "person of calamity crossing". This was a completely baseless and unpredictable variable.</p><p></p><p>However, as one of the Ten Sects of the Immortal Way and inheriting the teachings of the Great Dharma Master of Tiandu, the lineage of the Crossing Calamity Sect had already appeared in ancient times. The fact that it could persist for so many years indicated that it indeed had its unique principles.</p><p></p><p>It's just that outsiders couldn't glimpse the profundity of the Crossing Calamity Sect.</p><p></p><p>Today, when Yishu came to this Holy Dynasty Enlightenment that seemed to have suddenly popped out from the cracks between stones, and saw the many technologies that could rival the top level of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, as well as the new methods that were completely different from the current cultivation practices and could thoroughly subvert the foundation of the Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yishu's mind couldn't help but recall the words of the Crossing Calamity Sect from back then.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the great calamity had just begun to manifest. The core members of the Ten Sects of the Immortal Way gathered to discuss possible countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Each sect expressed their views, but only the Crossing Calamity Sect had a very passive attitude.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the so-called calamity is inescapable. If it could be avoided through a struggle, then what kind of calamity would it be?" The Sect Master of the Crossing Calamity Sect, Lu Chengheng, looked at his nose and his nose looked at his heart, with an attitude of being unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the reason why your Crossing Calamity Sect places those so-called [Observing the World Divine Eyes] everywhere?"</p><p></p><p>The most short-tempered Warden of the Boundless Prison, Xiahou Yan, had an unpleasant expression and retorted on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Xiahou, you don't understand. This is a necessary means to wait for the appearance of the [Xuanhuang Calamity Crossing Person]." Lu Chengheng said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit Xuanhuang Calamity Crossing Person, in the face of calamity, all beings will perish. When everyone is dead, where can this savior pop out from?" Xiahou almost cursed out loud.</p><p></p><p>"Are you questioning the inheritance of the Great Dharma Master?" With just one sentence, Lu Chengheng rendered Xiahou Yan speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't there still you guys." Lu Chengheng smiled, and then said meaningfully, "The Xuanhuang Realm is not so easily destroyed. If there is any cultivation realm in this starry sea that can survive until the end, it must be our Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the leaders of the Ten Sects had no rebuttal.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, perhaps to appease everyone, Lu Chengheng gave a brief explanation: "The theory of crossing calamity is not unfounded. Calamity, life and death, are all part of the cycle of heaven and earth. Even the great calamity of the immortal realm may not be beyond the anticipation of the true immortals."</p><p></p><p>"You are all in a state of constant anxiety, but look at the Great Dharma Master, does He have the slightest concern?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanji, the leader of the Supreme Sect who had been silent all along, finally spoke: "The Great Dharma Master's attainments are in line with the Dao, even in the immortal ashes, He can walk as if on flat ground. The disaster that leads to the destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm, He doesn't care at all. We can't do that. Brother Lu, if you choose to avoid the world, I won't stop you either. But in response to the calamity, you can't completely refrain from contributing."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the gazes of everyone converging, Lu Chengheng finally nodded and made a compromise.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Chengheng's last sentence made everyone present fall silent again.</p><p></p><p>"One day, you will know that our Crossing Calamity Sect is right."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, spanning thousands of years, the collective consciousness of the Taiyan Sect, Yishu's body, suddenly recalled Lu Chengheng's words from back then.</p><p></p><p>After a superficial understanding of [Establishing Foundation with Me]</p><p></p><p>After incorporating this variable into the future extrapolation of the Xuanhuang Realm, the principles of the Hua Dao Shi Mu became clear.</p><p></p><p>The originally clear future, as if encountering a chaotic storm, became blurred and unclear.</p><p></p><p>Even with the now seemingly miraculous computing power of Shi Mu, it became somewhat confused for a while.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Tai Yi Sect had also tried to extrapolate the new and new laws that could subvert the Dharma transmission system.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Creating something out of nothing is not the same as extrapolating the future based on existing data.</p><p></p><p>Even compared to the initial probability of the Dharma surviving under the siege of the Changsheng Realm, it is even smaller.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the difficulty of creating new and new laws themselves, more importantly, the ubiquitous influence of the Dharma on the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as cultivators will gradually forget the catastrophes of the Xuanhuang Realm and infinitely ignore the topographical changes that have been happening in the Xuanhuang Realm for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Extrapolating new and new laws is not only the ultimate embodiment of one's own creativity.</p><p></p><p>It is also a wrestle with the influence of the Dharma.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the extrapolation of Hua Dao Shi Mu, who is well aware of the current strength of the Dharma Tianzun, the probability of the birth of new and new laws naturally approaches zero infinitely.</p><p></p><p>However, things that are far beyond the possibility of extrapolation have happened.</p><p></p><p>In a corner of the Xuanhuang Realm's detached void, where no one knows yet, in a force that has only recently emerged.</p><p></p><p>Not only have new and new laws quietly appeared, they have even developed to the Golden Core stage!</p><p></p><p>It truly made Hua Dao Shi Mu's extrapolation stutter like a stone shattering the sky.</p><p></p><p>Because according to all known factors at present, it is impossible to find the reason why new and new laws can be born at this point in time.</p><p></p><p>It can only be explained by the Xuanhuang Crossing Calamity Person, which is outside the norm and not in the variables.</p><p></p><p>In private, the Ten Sects have also had some discussions about the Xuanhuang Crossing Calamity Person.</p><p></p><p>They reached an almost unanimous conclusion: if there really is a so-called Crossing Calamity Person, they are either from outside the Xuanhuang Realm or the reincarnation of a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>A native cultivator who grows up on his own strength and wants to save the collapsing sky...</p><p></p><p>It's simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented, it's not possible.</p><p></p><p>The environment of the Xuanhuang Realm can no longer create the foundation and soil to resist the Dharma Tianzun.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the origin of this Great Qi Faceless Sacred Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yi Shu, or Tai Yi Sect, has completely lost their contempt.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they regard the Great Qi of the Sacred Dynasty as an equal or even higher force than themselves.</p><p></p><p>And, really contemplating the possibility of allying with the Great Qi of the Sacred Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>As one of the former rulers of the Xuanhuang Realm, now being compressed by the Dharma Tianzun's Wanxian Alliance to only be able to stay in the Tai Xuan Small World, it is impossible for Tai Yi Sect to not have a bit of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Although they no longer need territory and resources, being deprived of what they once possessed, this grievance still lingers in the consciousness of Tai Yi Sect like a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, although the Great Dao, Taishang and other sects appeared to contend with the Wanxian Alliance on the surface, they had long been in collusion and were no different from the running dogs of the Dharma."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm sure, like us, they have not completely submitted. What they lack is just an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>The emergence of the Great Qi of the Sacred Dynasty, especially the emergence of new and new laws, let Tai Yi Sect see this glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>However, after all, it is a sect that has survived from the ancient catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Making any fateful decision is done with great caution.</p><p></p><p>There are still chapters at 12:30.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"Alright, this is not something you should worry about."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing too much is not good for you either."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to sense that spatial fluctuation and find this infected person shows that your ability is not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Focus on learning the jade slip I passed to you, it's much stronger than the half-baked inheritance from Tian Jue and the others."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor nagged a few sentences.</p><p></p><p>"Don't run around if there's nothing important, this Xuanhuang Realm is not as safe as it looks."</p><p></p><p>Finally leaving a message, not waiting for Li Fan to respond.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's figure disappeared into the air.</p><p></p><p>Only his voice remained, echoing constantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood in the room, not daring to let go of his tense mind.</p><p></p><p>Still maintaining a state of mind without distractions, he quietly left Qinghuang State as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he returned to the Lingmu Realm and ensured complete safety that Li Fan finally relaxed completely.</p><p></p><p>"Although I unexpectedly encountered the Heavenly Doctor this time, fortunately..."</p><p></p><p>"I bet right!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed and he let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>That's right, although the process of confronting the Heavenly Doctor just now seemed unusually smooth and without any danger.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, Li Fan was betting!</p><p></p><p>Betting that the Heavenly Doctor is actually a good person!</p><p></p><p>At the very least, when treating cultivators from the same origin as him, the attitude can be different!</p><p></p><p>Based on the previous scenes and dialogues when the Heavenly Doctor fought against Tian Jue and the Master, Li Fan speculated that perhaps the tragic annihilation of Yunshui Tiangong back then was really not the Heavenly Doctor's doing.</p><p></p><p>It was all a misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>And obviously, the crazy Tian Jue seeking revenge on the Heavenly Doctor was not the first or second time.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor, who could instantly kill Tian Jue, had never struck a fatal blow to Tian Jue and the Master.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All of this indicates that it may really be as the Heavenly Doctor himself said.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the moment Li Fan saw the Heavenly Doctor, he used the Five Elements Annihilation Sword containing the Tiansha Sword Intent, and then used the unique ultimate skill of the Qintang, the Yunshui Illusion Dream Technique, to attack the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>It was to disguise himself as Tian Jue's descendant, shouldering the mission of finding the Heavenly Doctor for revenge.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Doctor is truly kind-hearted, just as he appears to be.</p><p></p><p>Then facing the possibly only existing junior descendant in the Xuanhuang Realm, the Heavenly Doctor would definitely not do anything to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And the fact...</p><p></p><p>It was just as Li Fan had anticipated!</p><p></p><p>Not only did the Heavenly Doctor not get angry, he even took the initiative to give out a golden jade slip!</p><p></p><p>"This is called a gentleman can be deceived with righteousness!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the previous psychological shadow, this time he was actually easily deceived by him, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little complacent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in fact, the reason why the process of deceiving the Heavenly Doctor was so smooth this time was mainly because Li Fan already knew in advance about the Heavenly Doctor's "inspection, listening, inquiring, and palpation" ability.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was performing, his inner thoughts also corresponded to the "script".</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Doctor's strength is supreme, he would never have thought that he had already fallen into the trap set by Li Fan early on!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor, who had absolute confidence in his own "diagnostic" ability, misjudged because of Li Fan's deliberate misleading!</p><p></p><p>Reviewing the process just now many times, Li Fan couldn't help but become more and more complacent.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he was exposed in front of the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Nearly died for real.</p><p></p><p>Now after many reincarnations, although his strength is still not as good as the other party's.</p><p></p><p>But he was able to successfully deceive the other party.</p><p></p><p>This is enough to show how much he has grown.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The vastness of it!</p><p></p><p>"Just give me some more time, and I might be able to directly confront Tianyi!"</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about Tianyi's performance when he probed just now.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still slightly frowned.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a performance, those hundreds of Great Five Elements Annihilation Swords were definitely not holding back.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of them were his full-power strikes without activating the [Burning Soul] state.</p><p></p><p>However, such an offensive was easily resolved by Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't even figure out what method Tianyi used to pinch the Annihilation Swords into a ball.</p><p></p><p>"And there's also that [Disease] Tianyi mentioned..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi's visit this time was obviously to deal with the disease carried by Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Running into Li Fan was purely a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this can also explain why the Han Zhong incident in the previous life didn't cause any ripples at all."</p><p></p><p>"Because Tianyi secretly handled everything."</p><p></p><p>"If this disease is allowed to spread, it might even affect the Xuanhuang Realm. In this light, could it be that Tianyi is really a positive character?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>"For me, that's actually good news. The more righteous a character is, the lower the risk for me to interact with them."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the existence of [Huan Zhen] is not exposed."</p><p></p><p>"I might even be able to get some benefits from them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts kept turning.</p><p></p><p>This discovery made him quite excited.</p><p></p><p>While resolving a major concern, Li Fan's mind had already begun to plan how to maximize the utilization of this new discovery.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Tianyi also mentioned that the invisible bubble outside the Xuanhuang Realm where Han Zhong was moved to, is the Eye of the Heavenly Beast?"</p><p></p><p>"Being able to observe the void near the Xuanhuang Realm, and people inside it won't even age..."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Xuantian Sect's handiwork."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan's surging thoughts finally settled.</p><p></p><p>He sorted out his emotions.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, he finally took out the golden jade slip gifted by Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>The graceful and luxurious aura affected the spiritual wood not far above the closed-door room.</p><p></p><p>The branches and leaves swayed without wind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled. After contemplating for a good while, he finally decided to split a thread of divine sense and enter the golden jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Countless information instantly poured into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pressed his throbbing temples, roughly browsed the contents recorded in the jade slip, and his expression became a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>The author of the Heavenly Mending Records was undoubtedly Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mending Records believed that as the Heavenly Dao turned far away, it was very likely that the Heavenly Dao would become like humans, developing all kinds of illnesses.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Heavenly Dao would need to be healed.</p><p></p><p>However, how difficult would it be to heal the Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>Humans are the spirit of heaven and earth, and the human body can reflect a part of the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to heal the heavens, one must first heal humans.</p><p></p><p>A large portion at the beginning of the Heavenly Mending Records was devoted to explaining how to heal all living beings in heaven and earth, including humans.</p><p></p><p>If the previously read Tianyi Immortal Scripture was an encyclopedia introducing myriad species.</p><p></p><p>Then the first half of the Heavenly Mending Records was an extension of the Tianyi Immortal Scripture.</p><p></p><p>The specific application of medical techniques on all species in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And when one can skillfully heal all things in the world, they can develop towards the next stage.</p><p></p><p>That is [Healing the Heavens]!</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite for being able to heal the Heavenly Dao is to be as familiar with the Heavenly Dao as treating the human body.</p>

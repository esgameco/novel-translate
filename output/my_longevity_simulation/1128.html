        <h1>Chapter 1128</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1126: Truly Before the Immortal</p><p></p><p>Nine Mountains State.</p><p></p><p>"Today is indeed a good day." Zhao Xian laughed happily after writing his name on the golden contract in front, waiting for a wisp of golden light to enter his body and establish the contract.</p><p></p><p>The group of Five Elders in the store put away the contract, also showing joyful expressions and echoing in agreement.</p><p></p><p>For most of the day that followed, Zhao Xian engaged in more detailed negotiations with the Five Elders regarding the trade agreement. It was only after escorting them to the reception cave residence in the city to rest that Zhao Xian finally let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Instead of returning to his own cave residence, he turned back to the store and entered the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the faceless stone statue hidden in the darkness, Zhao Xian's expression was complex, his thoughts myriad.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Myriad Realms United Association was exterminated by the Myriad Immortals Alliance and put on the permanent wanted list, as a secret agent of the United Association in the Nine Mountains State, Zhao Xian had been living in constant fear and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Every day he was uneasy, often having hallucinations of the Myriad Immortals Alliance showing up at his door and suddenly arresting him.</p><p></p><p>Without the United Association providing supplies, the store's sources of goods were also greatly affected. Customer traffic declined daily, almost to the point of being unsustainable. In the end, he had to beg everywhere, using up all the family savings accumulated over the years, before he could barely rebuild the supply chain.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, everything is over now." Zhao Xian said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil of the United Association had subsided.</p><p></p><p>During the days when the Myriad Immortals Alliance's manhunt was most severe, they were unable to discover Zhao Xian's true identity. There should be no more danger in the future.</p><p></p><p>After several years of his painstaking management, the store's business had also returned to normal. Recently, he even reached a business agreement with a merchant group from the Five Elders. The value of fixed transaction materials alone amounted to over 10 million contribution points per year.</p><p></p><p>"Although there are no more rewards from true immortals, just relying on the store's profits is enough to support my cultivation all the way to the Primordial Spirit realm."</p><p></p><p>"With the United Association's destruction, profits don't need to be handed over and all go into my pockets. Life is even more prosperous than before..." Zhao Xian thought somewhat smugly.</p><p></p><p>"Misfortune and blessing are indeed interdependent, the world is ever-changing."</p><p></p><p>After taking a final look at the faceless stone statue, Zhao Xian had already decided in his heart to permanently seal this underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>From now on, the secret that he was once a member of the Myriad Realms United Association would never be known by anyone.</p><p></p><p>"The true immortal is merciful, I suppose he won't blame me." Zhao Xian respectfully performed a final bow, then sealed the secret room.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Zhao Xian felt relieved as if reborn.</p><p></p><p>But on the way back to the cave residence, when he looked up at the azure sky of the Xuan-Huang Realm, for some reason a burst of uneasiness suddenly welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian had always been very confident in his intuition. His footsteps paused at once.</p><p></p><p>Carefully recalling the bits and pieces of his recent life, after pondering for a long time, Zhao Xian couldn't find anything amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Strange..."</p><p></p><p>The chaotic feeling in his heart grew stronger. Zhao Xian suddenly had an inkling and looked around at the people nearby.</p><p></p><p>With one glance, it instantly made him break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>It turned out it wasn't just him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators leisurely strolling on the streets of the Nine Mountains Free Trade City seemed to have vaguely sensed something wrong. Their hearts were in turmoil, their expressions tense.</p><p></p><p>Some were even worse off, with cold sweat pouring down their foreheads and unsteady footsteps.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions is about to occur?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian suddenly recalled the origin of this Nine Mountains Trade State for some unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this place was still a chaotic state domain with dragons and snakes intermingled and nine mountains standing, but because the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders were at war, with a glance from the Celestial Venerable's Dharma form, mountains and rivers turned into plains.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the current prosperous Nine Mountains State come to be.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the events of that day are about to replay?" The thought flashed through Zhao Xian's mind, and he couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>Although reason told him that for the sake of mutual interests, neither the Myriad Immortals Alliance nor the Five Elders would go to war again in the Nine Mountains State.</p><p></p><p>But the abnormality before his eyes made him certain that a disaster was about to happen!</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, Zhao Xian made his decision.</p><p></p><p>That's right, he was greedy.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to become a Primordial Spirit great cultivator and dominate a region.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite for all this was being able to keep his life.</p><p></p><p>With the abilities he had tempered over the years in the Nine Mountains State, even if he was reduced to poverty again, he could still rise anew in a different place.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the few most valuable items in the store had always been kept on his person.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Zhao Xian immediately changed direction, disregarding the city's prohibition and flying at extreme speed towards the border of the Nine Mountains State.</p><p></p><p>His abnormal behavior naturally attracted the attention of the cultivators in Nine Mountains City. As if triggering a chain reaction, for no reason, they also began to flee with him.</p><p></p><p>It was like the instinctive struggle of beasts after sensing a life-or-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>And the facts proved that these cultivators' premonitions were not wrong.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't fled very far when a terrifying fluctuation descended from behind.</p><p></p><p>The sky instantly turned dark.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were devoured by an unknown terrifying existence before they could even let out a miserable cry.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the thousands of auras that disappeared in an instant behind him, extreme fear occupied his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his thoughts also began to race at an unprecedented speed.</p><p></p><p>"There must be some terrible calamity befalling the Nine Mountains State."</p><p></p><p>"Now there is still a long way to the border of the Nine Mountains State. There isn't enough time to escape to safety."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why there are no transmission formations in the Nine Mountains State is because the spatial structure here is extremely unstable. Rashly activating transmission will not only fail to reach the target location but also randomly transmit to other places. There's even a possibility of getting lost in the void..."</p><p></p><p>"But there's still hope for survival after all..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian's thoughts turned rapidly, and his body also made an instinctive response.</p><p></p><p>He directly activated the random transmission formation diagram in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene distorted and blurred.</p><p></p><p>After a brief dizziness, Zhao Xian escaped from the Nine Mountains State and arrived at an unfamiliar place.</p><p></p><p>But the scene before his eyes didn't give him any joy of surviving. </p><p></p><p>Instead, it made him feel like he had fallen into an icy pit, his mind going blank.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was floating high in the sky, overlooking the Xuan-Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the earth, over a thousand black spots appeared densely.</p><p></p><p>Like dark abysses, devouring everything around them.</p><p></p><p>The entire world seemed to be torn apart by these black spots, forming pieces of crumpled paper.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators on the earth, no matter how much they struggled, could not persist for a moment in the black domains.</p><p></p><p>One after another, they turned into distorted rays of light and disappeared into the black spots.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So the disaster didn't just happen in the Nine Mountains State?"</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Has doomsday arrived? Is the world about to be destroyed?" Zhao Xian was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, his attention was drawn by the scene that contrasted with this doomsday sight.</p><p></p><p>In this excerpt, the protagonist Li Fan is attempting to absorb the essence of the Xuanhuang realm, which is on the brink of destruction due to his actions. As he does so, he notices a figure standing before a strange ink-splatter painting, which depicts the countless changes and disasters occurring in the realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realizes that the figure is Sun Xian, who has come to this place after suffering a terrible fate. However, Li Fan ignores him and focuses on absorbing the essence of the crumbling realm into his own Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's grotto heaven flourishes and evolves, he senses danger approaching. A beam of light crosses the vast distance and locks onto him, revealing the figure to be Tian Yi, the Heavenly Doctor, rather than the expected Chuan Fa.</p><p></p><p>Both Li Fan and Tian Yi are surprised by each other's presence. Tian Yi is shocked to find Li Fan, the last disciple of the Tianfa realm, mercilessly absorbing the essence of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, realizing that Tian Yi has discovered something, activates his Huan Zhen technique to escape. As the world around him slows down and begins to transform, a brilliant light emerges from the Xuanhuang realm, overpowering the destructive force from the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recognizes this light as the Faceless True Immortal and fears that his deception has been discovered. In a desperate attempt to escape, he activates the "Heavenly Dao, Myriad Spirits, All Beings Refining Divine" technique, creating a vast red net that expands around him, filled with the cries of countless living beings.</p><p></p><p>Despite the red net's efforts, the brilliant white light remains undeterred. Just as it is about to reach Li Fan, he successfully activates Huan Zhen, making everything appear illusory except for the dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>One year later, Li Fan finds himself at the peak of Jieli Mountain, having narrowly escaped death. As he catches his breath, he realizes that his face has disappeared, revealing the true power of a True Immortal and the insignificance of countless living beings' wills in comparison.</p>

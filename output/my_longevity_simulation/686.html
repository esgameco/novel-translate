        <h1>Chapter 686</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The divine consciousness turned the pages of the book, and within a few breaths, had already read through all its contents.</p><p></p><p>A ball of flame leapt out of his hand, destroying the terrain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze turned towards the southeast.</p><p></p><p>"The Extreme South has become South-East. The changes between ancient and modern times are truly unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>"What Westgate Yu said before indeed holds true. Over millions of years, the Xuanhuang Realm has actually expanded by a whole circle, with some areas completely disappearing and others seemingly adding a new piece of territory out of thin air."</p><p></p><p>"The former Nanhua Sacred Beast Mountain has now become a deep-sea vortex connecting to the endless ocean."</p><p></p><p>"Although according to Westgate Yu's detection, there is no longer any Sacred Beast Mountain there. However..."</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the outer periphery of the large vortex, surrounded by a circle of islands, it resembled a dead giant python.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the red snake that I saw in the Fallen Immortal Realm back then, entwining around the Nanhua Sacred Beast Mountain."</p><p></p><p>"It might have died, and the journey that the Yaozu took to leave the Xuanhuang Realm all those years ago probably wasn't as smooth as expected."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew towards Tiancheng in Yueyang City.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he transformed back to his original appearance. As a guest of the Xuan Family, with an authority level of thirty, he could freely use the Teleportation Array.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it would have taken at least half a month to rush through using the regular Teleportation Arrays.</p><p></p><p>But with the Teleportation Array, he could arrive in just half a day.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at Tiancheng in Yueyang, he entered the image of the Transmission Law Sovereign. After verifying Li Fan's identity, the staff was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, with great respect, they led Li Fan into the space of the Teleportation Array.</p><p></p><p>And cutting ahead of several cultivators waiting in line, they directly activated the array for him.</p><p></p><p>The cut-in-line cultivators didn't show much anger. Knowing that Li Fan's identity was not ordinary, they only revealed a hint of curiosity and envy in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>A slight dizziness came over him, and the next moment, Li Fan arrived at the Nethervoid State where the deep-sea vortex was located.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Once out of the Teleportation Array and after adapting to the body's abnormality, Li Fan noticed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed used the Teleportation Array before.</p><p></p><p>Due to traversing many states and passing through many layers of white fog barriers, aside from dizziness and discomfort in the body, the significant loss of lifespan was also apparent. It felt like a part of himself had been extracted, bringing about a sense of deep loss.</p><p></p><p>But this time...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan checked his status panel and his age.</p><p></p><p>"It's not an illusion, and I haven't lost too much lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"Is it that the effect of the devouring white fog has weakened, or has the teleportation technology of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance improved?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled scenes from his journey through the fog in the Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>"The effect of the devouring white fog still remains. How to say..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance secretly mobilizing manpower to enter the fog, seemed like they were searching for something.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that aside from the Purifying True Boat, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance seems to have found a way to deal with the devouring white fog."</p><p></p><p>"What lies within the white fog?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly remembered the Abyss Roar he had seen in the previous life and the many 'Mysterious Realms' supposedly hidden in the white fog.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused his steps.</p><p></p><p>Because he remembered the Mysterious Realm where he had encountered the Reflection Monsters, and had comprehended the 'Chaos' mantra on the Stone Slab.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the use of the 'Chaos' mantra by myself led the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance to venture into the deep fog?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts rapidly spun.</p><p></p><p>"This possibility is not nonexistent. However, according to common sense, the direction of investigation should have been inside the Xuanhuang Realm first. But instead, they directly targeted the depths of the white fog."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it has been investigated and found nothing in the Xuanhuang Realm inside. Or..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Chaos' mantra has appeared before. And the source is actually from within the white fog?"</p><p></p><p>"If this is true, what does it represent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but delve into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist Stone Crystal emitted a bright blue light, as Li Fan continued to ponder various possibilities.</p><p></p><p>But his body didn't stop moving, flying towards the location of the great vortex.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the air became richer with violent water-attributed spiritual energy, reminding Li Fan that he was not far from his destination.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy here is a bit strange," Li Fan furrowed his brows lightly.</p><p></p><p>With his current physique, even if he inadvertently absorbed the violent water-attributed spiritual energy of this place, he felt an intolerable pain.</p><p></p><p>As if sharp blades were continuously cutting within his body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan temporarily closed off his body, blocking the influx of external spiritual energy. He plucked a strand and absorbed it in his palm, examining it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Not only is it violently attributed, making it difficult for cultivators to absorb and utilize. It even inherently contains the attribute of 'Tearing'..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the population in this state is sparse, and the closer to the big vortex, the rarer the human presence."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to fly towards the target location, and the spiritual energy around him indeed became sharper.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>During the flight, the cutting gale on his face stung Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He had to lay down a protective layer of spiritual energy around his body.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have the Five Elements Grand Cave, establishing an internal circulation. If it were an ordinary cultivator, their spiritual energy would be exhausted shortly after flying, avoiding such circumstances."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the speed at which his spiritual energy was depleting, Li Fan was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Flying steadily all the way, after a stick of incense's worth of time, he finally saw the magnificent deep-sea vortex and the snake-shaped island lying beside it.</p><p></p><p>Without getting closer, he merely observed from a distance.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if he had traveled back thousands of years, witnessing the exodus of the Yaozu group.</p><p></p><p>"This vortex should be the anomaly caused by Sacred Beast Mountain and the Realm's fracture."</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years have passed, but it has not subsided. It is enough to see what kind of scale it was at the beginning. This is yet another form of destruction to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>"Every group that broke through the boundaries seemed to be creating a rift on the Xuanhuang Celestial Globe, like it was about to be devoured by the Heavenly Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Those within the Xuanhuang Realm naturally wouldn't allow this."</p><p></p><p>"They will definitely come to stop it. Perhaps the Red Snake died because of this."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Tianjian Sect back then, is it because they are one of the Ten Daoist Sects that no one came for them, or because the other cultivators from the Realm who left with the weapons weren't just from the Tianjian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, after the Tianjian Sect left, the other cultivators of the Ten Daoist Sects were slow to react?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts couldn't settle for a long time, and his anticipation for the next journey to the Fallen Immortal Realm only grew.</p><p></p><p>"The bigger the storm, the stronger the comprehension of Daoist techniques!"</p><p></p><p>"This place is where I should prove my Dao!"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1144: Crossing Time and Space to Meet</p><p></p><p>"After finding Senior Yin, persuade him and bring him back to the Great Qi. {What? You don't know yet | Read COM, error-free chapter reading | Hurry up and google it}"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the persuasion content with only a few words, Wang Xuanba couldn't help but scratch his head.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't quite understand the meaning of the words, it didn't prevent Wang Xuanba from believing it without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>With a low roar, the shadow under him began to squirm slowly. Not long after, a body identical to Wang Xuanba crawled out of the shadow.</p><p></p><p>This was the ability he awakened after absorbing the exotic beast [Like Shadow].</p><p></p><p>The shadow body has half the strength of the original body, and its death will not have any impact on the original body.</p><p></p><p>It was most suitable for running errands with certain risks.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Wang Xuanba's shadow body transformed into a dark swimming dragon and broke through the void.</p><p></p><p>More than ten days later, he finally found the location of Yin Yin Island.</p><p></p><p>The faint wailing sound coming from the island made Wang Xuanba feel a little uneasy.</p><p></p><p>He called out a few times, but no one answered. Wang Xuanba walked into the building, and the strange and bizarre creatures he saw made his scalp numb.</p><p></p><p>"These things are even more disgusting than the exotic beasts I've merged with."</p><p></p><p>Going deeper, he finally saw the person in question in front of a transparent cage.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, my master wants to invite you to a gathering." Wang Xuanba said neither humbly nor arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin had no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba said it several times, but it was the same.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this situation, Wang Xuanba simply followed the Holy Emperor's instructions and said directly, "Sir, do you want to know who created the Immortal Miasma?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin's body trembled, and he slowly moved his gaze from the experimental subject to Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say...?"</p><p></p><p>The double overlapping voice made Wang Xuanba swallow his saliva.</p><p></p><p>But he still plucked up the courage to repeat it.</p><p></p><p>Then, without waiting for Senior Yin to speak, he said again, "Sir, do you want to know the perfect method of [Building Foundation with Me]?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin's originally stooped body slowly straightened.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Wang Xuanba, a dangerous light flashing in his eyes: "Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba chuckled, "I'm just a errand runner. If you want to know the answers to the questions, just come with me."</p><p></p><p>"Lead the way!"</p><p></p><p>What surprised Wang Xuanba was that this time Senior Yin agreed so readily.</p><p></p><p>Thick fog sprayed out from the cage behind, and several mortals screamed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba's whole body tightened, and he quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin's eyes turned cold, and the murderous intent in his eyes could no longer be concealed.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the fearless Wang Xuanba, he still forcibly suppressed his killing intent.</p><p></p><p>After searching on his body, he didn't find the rib.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the rib was found in the nest of that human-handed puppy.</p><p></p><p>Kicking the dog away with one foot, Senior Yin indicated that they could go.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba then flew ahead to lead the way, passing through the entrance to the small world concealed by the formation, and returned to the Great Qi Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Slightly surprised by the rich concentration of spiritual energy here, Senior Yin still focused his attention on the tallest tower-like building in the Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that there seemed to be an extremely powerful existence there.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Senior Yin stood in front of Li Ping, the faceless Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what's the intention of going to great lengths to bring me here?"</p><p></p><p>The expression on Senior Yin's face was not very pleasant.</p><p></p><p>"I've just long admired your talent, sir." Li Ping sat on the high Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>, looked down at Yin Shangren and said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think of this method?"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Yin Shangren to react, Li Ping lightly tapped.</p><p></p><p>A light screen unfolded in front of Yin Shangren. </p><p></p><p>Originally, Yin Shangren didn't care much, but after a glance and seeing the contents on it clearly, his expression suddenly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Solemnity immediately turned to shock.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>He observed it repeatedly several times before turning his gaze to Li Ping's avatar in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that you have a rib bone in your collection?" Li Ping's avatar asked again instead of explaining.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren nodded: "It is the bone of the first cultivator in the world infected by the mortal miasma..."</p><p></p><p>"May I take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren hesitated a little, but in the end still took it out and handed it to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held the rib bone in his hand and fell into some kind of reminiscence. </p><p></p><p>Then he returned the rib to Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's avatar's performance made Yin Shangren somewhat doubtful and suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>"Seeing an old friend again, already in this state. Just a bit sentimental, don't blame me." </p><p></p><p>Li Ping's words falling into Yin Shangren's ears were no less than a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>"What? An old friend?"</p><p></p><p>Eyes full of doubt, Yin Shangren stared at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping didn't mind, his voice low: "Hehe, besides me, who else in this world still remembers him now?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, the truly perfect man in the world. Su Bai, Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, a figure appeared in front of Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Instantly attracting Yin Shangren's gaze.</p><p></p><p>The person in the picture, his appearance was so perfect, without a trace of flaws to be found.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were even more full of gentleness and love. Even if it was an illusory scene, when eyes met, one couldn't help but tremble in the heart.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was in a daze for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Then recalling Li Ping's words, his body shook violently, reacting: "What did you say? Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate?"</p><p></p><p>He subconsciously gripped the rib in his hand, as if struck by lightning. </p><p></p><p>Eyes dull, muttering to himself: "Defying the principles of heaven and earth, defying the principles of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"Mortal miasma, two Heavenly Venerates..."</p><p></p><p>"It turned out to be like this?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren staggered and fell to the ground weakly.</p><p></p><p>As if suffering a major blow, he seemed to have lost his goal, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping waited for a long time until Yin Shangren slowly recovered from the shock.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he continue to speak, revealing his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal path ahead cannot be trodden, the Dharma-transmitting Heavenly Venerate is at the top."</p><p></p><p>"Can you help me fulfill Mr. Bai's unfinished wish, using a new method to break the foundation of the transmitted Dharma and save Xuanhuang from the midst of water and fire?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stepped down from the throne, came to Yin Shangren, helped him up, and asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren also quickly understood the meaning of Li Ping's words.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, this flawless [Foundation Building Method], is his handiwork?" Yin Shangren's voice trembled a little.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping nodded and sighed: "Yes. In the entire Xuanhuang realm, besides him, who else could have such talent?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's heart was even more shocked. </p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes." He kept repeating.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the characters on the light screen in front of him again, Yin Shangren seemed to cross time through the words and exchange glances with Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>"My thoughts actually coincide with his from thousands of years ago?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, he even far surpasses me..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Fanping, seeing Yin Shangren who had completely lost himself, knew that the plan had succeeded.</p>

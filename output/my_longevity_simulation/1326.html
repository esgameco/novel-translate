        <h1>Chapter 1326</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1315: The Shocking Creation</p><p></p><p>"This humble one never lies!" </p><p></p><p>"Moreover...there is no need to exaggerate." Li Fan looked down on everyone with a disdainful expression. </p><p></p><p>The elder Taoists on the celestial boat originally had restless emotions, but they suddenly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>They secretly discussed the credibility of Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Lie: "A single true Taoist symbolic character outweighs the sum of everything? I don't believe such nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Gan Jing Da: "It's better to believe it exists than to believe it doesn't exist. The civilization this person is from is no less advanced than our celestial boat in researching true Taoist symbolic characters...if they're lucky and truly discovered something, it would be rash to take action, we might completely miss the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yu Zhi: "Correct, it's too difficult to capture him alive while he possesses a true Taoist symbolic character. We can only launch a sudden attack to kill him. In that case, we should try to extract as much knowledge from his mind as possible before taking action."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, this kid knows too many secrets of the celestial boat. We definitely cannot let him leave." This was the consensus the celestial boat elders had reached long ago, so when Zhong Dao Gong said this, no one objected.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ai Tian Jue transmitted his voice: "Why don't we do it this way..."</p><p></p><p>After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion again. This time, Jian Dao Sheng spoke: "Since you are so certain, friend, then we are truly interested."</p><p></p><p>"Something outweighing the sum of over ten true Taoist symbolic characters...if it's true as you say, we are willing to pay any price to see its true form."</p><p></p><p>The remaining celestial boat elders also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"But we don't know what else you can offer. Ordinary true Taoist symbolic character transcripts are not enough," Li Fan said in an intimidatingly arrogant tone.</p><p></p><p>Jian Dao Sheng smiled slightly: "Rest assured, friend. Our world has the ancient Bai Wen Xian Lu passed down from antiquity, which contains the specialties and treasures of those extinct cultivation realms in this star sea. If what you say is not false, in addition to that true Taoist symbolic character transcript, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not seem moved by Jian Dao Sheng's offer, only muttering repeatedly: "Bai Wen Xian Lu, Bai Wen Xian Lu...it seems I've heard of it somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>The celestial boat elders were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan realized and uttered four words: "The Xuan Shang Celestial Boat?!"</p><p></p><p>It resounded like a thunderclap in the ears of the celestial boat elders.</p><p></p><p>Their auras fluctuated as if facing a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Dao Gong saw the situation was not right and secretly signaled to the other elders to prepare to take action, while forcing himself to maintain a smile and ask: "Friend, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands: "In ancient times, the Xuan Shang Celestial Boat roamed the myriad realms. Who didn't know, who wasn't aware? I originally thought the celestial boat had disappeared with the decline of the star sea, but unexpectedly it has survived for millions of years!"</p><p></p><p>"If my teachers knew, they would definitely be very excited. No, I must quickly tell them this news..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words made Zhong Dao Gong's eyelids twitch.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly interrupted Li Fan's words and changed the subject: "Friend, you flatter us. Since you have already recognized us, we won't hide our identity anymore."</p><p></p><p>"We are indeed descendants of the former Xuan Shang Celestial Boat. However, many things have happened over these millions of years. Although we avoided the catastrophic destruction, the Xuan Shang Celestial Boat split into two. We are one of them."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Dao Gong looked at the somewhat surprised Li Fan and raised his eyebrows: "However, there is one thing I really don't understand. Even within our celestial boat, the Bai Wen Xian Lu is highly confidential. How could you, an outsider, know of its existence?"</p><p></p><p>After learning the identity of the celestial boat, Li Fan's attitude became somewhat friendlier. He explained to the celestial boat crowd: "To be honest, my homeland Da Qi has a connection to the Xuan Shang Celestial Boat. It was by relying on the celestial apparatus obtained from trading with the celestial boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the great catastrophe until now."</p><p></p><p>"Even now, that celestial apparatus is still protecting us. Hence, the entire Da Qi has always felt some gratitude towards the celestial boat..."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Li Fan's account, the celestial boat elders were dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>Zhong Dao Gong frowned, recalling the records of the celestial boat in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, the celestial boat did complete a number of celestial apparatus trades. However, according to the rules and the customers' requirements, the relevant information was destroyed after the transactions were completed. The core of the Xuan Shang Celestial Boat should have a backup, but due to the internal strife back then...now this part of the information should be with the Shang Celestial Boat," said Jian Dao Sheng, the chief of the Xuan Shu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The fact that the Xuan Shang Celestial Boat sold celestial apparatus was only known to an extremely small number of forces back then. Since this person can speak of this matter, it should not be false..." Nan Gong Lie said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Quite knowledgeable about true Taoist symbolic characters, and has a celestial apparatus protecting him..."</p><p></p><p>In the minds of the celestial boat elders, a powerful ancient cultivation civilization emerged: Da Qi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are people of the celestial boat, then the matter is easy to resolve."</p><p></p><p>"The celestial boat has always dealt with people in good faith when doing business. I can trust you!"</p><p></p><p>"Originally I was going to not show the rabbit before releasing the falcon, because this true Taoist symbolic character transcript is too precious, obtained from the remnants of a celestial apparatus recording the scenes of the celestial realm..."</p><p></p><p>Every word Li Fan said captivated the celestial boat elders' minds.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose a few degrees.</p><p></p><p>The illusory scene of pavilions, bridges and flowing streams vanished, turning into an endless grassland instead.</p><p></p><p>On the grassland, a lone rock stood independently. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the earth began to shake.</p><p></p><p>Large swaths of green grass also seemed to be stimulated, beginning to grow wildly.</p><p></p><p>In a fleeting moment, they became taller than a person.</p><p></p><p>They even lifted the lone rock on the grassland off the ground.</p><p></p><p>An arc of light appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored light flickered, vaguely showing images of lightning, storms gathering.</p><p></p><p>Around the seven-colored light arc, countless invisible shadows gradually gathered, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>A streak of jet-black lightning fiercely struck the ground from the light arc.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The world was split into two halves, with space torn into deep crevices that could not heal for a long time. And on the grassland, the endless green grass was ignited, with raging fires rapidly spreading.</p><p></p><p>The grassland shook, and under the raging fires, it seemed something was awakening.</p><p></p><p>There even seemed to be conflicts arising from vying for position.</p><p></p><p>Huge booming and collision sounds kept ringing out.</p><p></p><p>The storm brewed to the extreme, then suddenly fell into stillness. The rolling black clouds...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In a fleeting moment, it disappeared without a trace. </p><p></p><p>Within the seven-colored light arc, in the vast clear sky.</p><p></p><p>An extremely profound symbol suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>At this point, the scene abruptly stopped. </p><p></p><p>The deeply immersed elder cultivators of Xianzhou were instantly enraged, turning to look at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"What was that!" Jiandao Sheng shouted urgently and impatiently.  </p><p></p><p>This chief of Xianzhou's Xianshuyuan had previously glimpsed a part of the true celestial talisman character contained within that light arc. </p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan suddenly cut off the scene before he could see the whole thing.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiandao Sheng was still convinced that the power of that true celestial talisman character far surpassed any other true celestial talisman characters he had seen before!</p><p></p><p>This great cultivator in front of him was not lying!</p><p></p><p>"How much did you all see?!" Jiandao Sheng asked in an almost shouting tone.</p><p></p><p>"Too fast! The speed he cut it off was too fast! How could we see such a powerful true celestial talisman character in that instant?!"</p><p></p><p>"No doubt about it, that feeling of the entire spirit trembling...it was even stronger than the first time I glimpsed a true celestial talisman character. Its power far exceeds a single talisman character!"</p><p></p><p>"That scene just now, was it celestial immortals fighting over the character in the lone light? Even immortals would fight to seize it...unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>"Must obtain it at all costs!"</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders remained outwardly calm, but inwardly they were completely shaken.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing that profound character in the lone light, they had not the slightest doubt about what Li Fan had said before. At the same time, they instantly reached a consensus - they must obtain this true celestial talisman character!</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders were extremely impatient, but Li Fan seemed completely oblivious.</p><p></p><p>He solemnly said: "There is one point that needs to be addressed upfront. The scene I just showed comes from the memory imprint deep within this celestial instrument from back then. It was originally hidden inside, impossible to easily detect. However, over these past millennia, as our great cultivators have deepened the development and utilization of this celestial instrument, we finally managed to excavate it."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the celestial instrument had just been born and its power was weak. It was insufficient to perfectly record that true celestial talisman character. So what we have restored from it is merely an imperfect replica..."</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders were all deeply studied in true celestial talisman characters, how could they not understand the meaning behind Li Fan's words?</p><p></p><p>"Friend, since the conversation has reached this point, why not come to Xianzhou? The true celestial talisman character originals and treasures of the Celestial Archives are at your disposal to choose from!" Zhong Daoqing said with a suppressed tone, holding back his inner excitement.</p><p></p><p>Under everyone's hopeful gazes, Li Fan pondered for a moment before finally agreeing: "I have long heard of Xianzhou's reputation. Now I have the honor of visiting, I must certainly boast about it to my master and fellow disciples when I return..."</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders all heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The group surrounded Li Fan as they left the illusory formation in the void, heading towards the Sea of Relics.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the Sea of Relics, they arrived at the outer region. Zhong Daoqing formed hand seals, revealing the hidden Xianzhou.</p><p></p><p>A hint of disappointment flashed across Li Fan's eyes. </p><p></p><p>But it was quickly concealed.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering Xianzhou and seeing the divine tree floating in the void, he seemed somewhat amazed again.</p><p></p><p>The elders introduced it to Li Fan: "This is the Transformative Divine Tree, whose main body is said to be a magnificent divine tree rooted beneath the boundless starry seas, its branches and leaves stretching endlessly across countless cultivation worlds."</p><p></p><p>"After the divine tree's branches invaded the cultivation worlds, they could absorb the world's spiritual energies, with the roots fusing with the worlds. Hence the name 'Transformative'. It is by this method that the divine tree was able to proliferate across the starry seas."</p><p></p><p>"But it's all legend. No one has ever seen the divine tree's main body. Now that the starry seas are shattered, who knows if this divine tree even still exists..."</p><p></p><p>The elders' topic soon shifted to the other sights within Xianzhou.</p><p></p><p>"This three-eyed golden skull comes from the ancient cultivation world of Chengxuan. It is said that this world passed down the bloodlines of true celestial immortals, so its cultivators mostly had a third eye and extraordinary talents imbued with inconceivable divine abilities. However, after the great catastrophe descended, Chengxuan was one of the first worlds to suffer misfortune."</p><p></p><p>As they discussed, they soon arrived at the top of Xianzhou's divine tree.</p><p></p><p>With a signal from the elders, not hiding anything from the outsider Li Fan, they joined forces in casting spells.</p><p></p><p>Ripples emanated outwards from the top of the divine tree.</p><p></p><p>Then, a pink flower bloomed from nothingness, slowly unfurling.</p><p></p><p>It was only an image, not a physical form, yet it exuded a fragrant aroma.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the flower, a path appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please," Zhong Daoqing said, looking at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly, seeming completely unguarded as he stepped directly onto the path.</p><p></p><p>As he strode in, the scene before him instantly transformed.</p><p></p><p>Rows of wooden crates were neatly arranged.</p><p></p><p>The end was not in sight.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's foreign presence, the long arm that had been moving suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>It extended five fingers, about to grab at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Xianzhou elders who rushed over stopped the long arm's action.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the long arm with interest and asked, "It doesn't seem to be a living creature?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing nodded, "Friend has a keen eye. Strictly speaking, this long arm is also a true celestial talisman character, but it is an amalgamation of countless true celestial talisman character fragments."</p><p></p><p>"Many years ago, due to a momentary lapse, Xianzhou was robbed. This Celestial Archives lost a few priceless treasures. Afterwards, we learned our lesson and developed this Severed Celestial Arm."</p><p></p><p>A hint of pride flashed across Zhong Daoqing's face, "Without the collective permission of the Xianzhou elders, no matter one's strength, it is absolutely impossible to take away any treasures in front of this Severed Celestial Arm."</p><p></p><p>Jiandao Sheng also said, "Friend, can you discern the profundities of this Severed Celestial Arm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, observing for a moment before seeming to gain an understanding, "Xianzhou has directly carved the structural fragments of true celestial talisman characters into this space itself?"</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the place we are in is within the body of the Severed Celestial Arm?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing smiled, "Not only that! Even the many treasures within this Celestial Archives have now become part of the Severed Celestial Arm. To take away a single item requires using our secret celestial methods to peel it off."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, one could only take the entire Severed Celestial Arm..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this is absolutely impossible for a human to accomplish."</p><p></p><p>Nan Gonglie also said, "Not to mention us old fellows being here. Just this Severed Arm alone, infused with the powers of numerous true celestial talisman characters..."</p><p></p><p>"I fear there is currently no cultivator in the entire starry seas capable of forcibly moving it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Xianzhou elders' words, Li Fan could only nod in praise.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 568</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan pondered for a moment before answering, "It will take at least twenty days."</p><p></p><p>The person opposite him became a little anxious instantly, "That's too slow! The battlefield is constantly changing. In over twenty days, who knows..."</p><p></p><p>He stopped abruptly halfway through his words.</p><p></p><p>Bluntly, he said, "We can't wait that long!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and gave a cold snort, "It seems like you people from the Five Elders Council are really in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>"Even the initial formation map is not easy to steal. It requires careful planning; you can't just take it at will."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the spy from the Five Elders Council's expression turned slightly grim.</p><p></p><p>"But..." at that moment, Li Fan suddenly changed his tone, "There are slow methods and fast methods."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to get the formation map quickly, it all depends on your sincerity."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's straightforward behavior, the spy from the Five Elders Council couldn't help but ask, "What else do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression turned displeased, "We just agreed on the price for the formation map. Now we are discussing the price to expedite the process."</p><p></p><p>"What's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"If you are unwilling to trade, then forget it..."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned and walked away without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>"Wait! Let's talk about it!" The spy from the Five Elders Council panicked and quickly caught up, bringing Li Fan back. </p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhou, don't be so impulsive. I did say, everything can be discussed," he said with a forced smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat back down and calmly said, "This time, agreeing to trade with you has put our organization at great risk."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we need to receive sufficient benefits."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used his finger as a pen to write a few lines on the stone table, then said, "We don't need contributions. Some of the special products of your Five Elders Council are very popular among us. They can be used as bargaining chips."</p><p></p><p>The spy from the Five Elders Council looked closer and saw written on the table: Enlightenment Pill, Universal Virtue Boat, Carefree Crystals, Human Star Dust, True Temptation Fruit...</p><p></p><p>His eyes widened in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Through the aid of Jiao Xiuyuan's puppet body, Li Fan had previously visited the Five Elders Council, not only experiencing warmth from Sister Zhao in the illusion but also gaining a rough understanding of the Council's basic situation and customs.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightenment Pill, Universal Virtue Boat, and Carefree Crystals were self-explanatory.</p><p></p><p>Human Star Dust was a special product of the Human Realm, corresponding to the stars formed in the sky by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the Human Realm, cultivators had to transform and ascend to the sky to become starlight. By absorbing the star dust, one could clearly sense the process of changing heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The changing of heaven and earth in the Human Realm was actually a "reversal of heaven and earth" system created by the Human Venerable. While not as high-level as the reversal of the Profound Yellow Realm, it was invaluable for cultivation insights.</p><p></p><p>The laws involved were not only precious for Harmony Path cultivators but also beneficial for cultivators at any other level.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the True Temptation Fruit was a unique item of the True Realm.</p><p></p><p>It could pre-set the information contained in the fruit.</p><p></p><p>Upon consumption, it could distort a cultivator's thoughts, leading them to firmly believe in things they originally thought were false.</p><p></p><p>Turning falsehood into truth was extremely handy.</p><p></p><p>Even Harmony Path cultivators would be influenced if they consumed it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As his gaze shifted from the stone table, the spy from the Five Elders Council looked at Li Fan, who was sitting with his eyes closed, feeling a dry throat.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhou, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Wiping the cold sweat off his forehead, he turned around again.</p><p></p><p>This time took longer than before.</p><p></p><p>His whole body seemed to be shaken as if hit by a massive impact, continuously trembling.</p><p></p><p>Only after the sky darkened did they finally have a result on their end.</p><p></p><p>As if coming out of a fierce battle, the spy from the Five Elders Council was physically exhausted, almost stumbling.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, he finally said weakly, "Alright. But the quantities of each item need to be carefully discussed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had been feigning sleep with his eyes closed, opened his eyes suddenly, showing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>After that, negotiations began between both parties.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, when they finally reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>Something that slightly surprised Li Fan happened.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling golden light surged from the opponent's body, completely engulfing him and turning into a "contract" floating quietly in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council cultivator seemed to dissolve in the golden light and disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the discomfort in his heart, Li Fan took the golden contract and carefully read it.</p><p></p><p>The handwriting was a dim golden color.</p><p></p><p>The contents of the agreement traded were consistent with the prior agreement between them.</p><p></p><p>What caught Li Fan's attention was that one side of the agreement was left blank for him to sign, while the other side was engraved with five mysterious symbols that kept flashing and appearing on the contract.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't understand the specific meaning of these symbols, upon seeing them, Li Fan understood that they represented the five immortal elders of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the content explained by the scholar responsible for brainwashing in the valley of the Five Elders Council earlier, Li Fan seemed to have an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"This contract seems somewhat similar to the Five Elders Council's Soul Contract. Both involve the immortal elders, although the content of the trades differs."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated as he touched the contract, contemplating whose name to sign.</p><p></p><p>A strange sensation suddenly entered his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Confirmed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The inexplicable sensation did not disappear but grew stronger. Li Fan confirmed again.</p><p></p><p>After three times, a golden light leaped into the depths of Li Fan's soul, while the rest shattered the void and vanished to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>"The contract is sealed, and those whose names are on it cannot disobey."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes and sensed this faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Even the immortal elders..."</p><p></p><p>"It won't work."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only someone of the same realm, strong enough to make Sister Zhao's thoughts unreadable, could force them to submit."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe this person's cultivation is even stronger."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan finally confirmed his speculation about the last unidentified immortal elder of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>It was her contractual power that kept the Five Elders Council in order.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the main body of Li Fan thousands of miles away, after the clone Zhou Qing'ang signed the contract, closed his eyes and carefully examined the unusual changes appearing in his body.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly, nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>Yet, a feeling of premonition lingered in Li Fan's heart.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1328</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1317: The Divine Tree Concealing Immortal Characters</p><p></p><p>"This person's expression is full of compassion, not looking like a deceitful female bandit at all," Li Fan commented.</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng snorted coldly, "That's what we on the Immortal Boat thought too initially. So the saying goes - you can know a person's face but not their heart!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong then asked, "Can we track this person down just based on their appearance? Or do we need other methods?"</p><p></p><p>"If we have some personal belongings from the bandit, that would be best. If not..."</p><p></p><p>"It's no problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a very confident look about the "Great Awakening Divine Instrument". "Based on their appearance and life story, it's enough to deduce and track them down."</p><p></p><p>"However, I'll need to return to Great Awakening first and report the information upwards."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words caused some minor disagreements among the elders on the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>Jian Daosheng said, "Actually, we don't necessarily have to kill this person. The Great Awakening civilization's research on the true immortal characters is not inferior to our Immortal Boat's. If we can take this opportunity to maintain communication and share knowledge, it may not be a bad thing for our Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>Several elders agreed with Jian Daosheng's words: "That's right, the reason we originally planned to eliminate them was out of concern that the true immortal characters our Immortal Boat researched would be leaked. But from the current situation, this Great Awakening civilization's research has much in common with our Immortal Boat's. Moreover, they don't seem to guard and pass down the knowledge as strictly as we do..."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, from this person's words, the immortal cultivation world where the Great Awakening civilization is located is not small in scale and does not lack various resources. Don't forget our Immortal Boat's main business - trading across all realms and being well-versed in the ancient ways. This has been our Immortal Boat's creed since ancient times. Killing them has no benefits. If we befriend them, we may even be able to get out of the Immortal Boat's current predicament!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget that plan! The more true immortal characters we can collect, the better. Based on our Immortal Boat's current collection pace, it may take a few hundred more years to complete it. But if we can get supplements from this Great Awakening civilization, we may be just a step away from achieving the goal!"</p><p></p><p>The elders' words made sense logically and emotionally. Gradually, those who had insisted on killing Li Fan afterwards also became somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>After all, only by weighing the pros and cons could they lead the Immortal Boat further. Being rigid and inflexible would only lead the Immortal Boat towards destruction. This was the principle the Immortal Boat concluded after going through numerous calamities and hardships to survive until today.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was Zhong Daogong who made the final decision and unified the opinions: "Let's first see how powerful these true immortal characters really are."</p><p></p><p>During the period when the Immortal Boat crowd was discussing, Li Fan had already completed his selection in the secret vault.</p><p></p><p>They were the three items he was interested in before: the bronze-cast immortal crane, the seven-colored flowing light, and the drooping servant doll.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, are you sure about these few items? Once selected, you cannot change them," Zhong Daogong smiled and reminded him, his gaze scanning over them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in confirmation.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong then joined the other elders in casting spells in the void, summoning a piece of white paper.</p><p></p><p>The severed immortal arm from the Immortal Records controlled and imprinted itself on this white paper.</p><p></p><p>The blank paper surface was instantly dyed black by ink.</p><p></p><p>Three profound patterns formed, extremely similar to the true immortal characters yet more rudimentary, with the shapes reflecting the three items' features.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan also noticed that the three items he had selected in the secret vault shimmered before disappearing into thin air.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had been engraved onto the white paper.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong waved his large hand, rolling up the completed engraved white paper and holding it.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, he said, "The items you need are here. After completing the transaction, present it with both hands!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! Straightforward!" Li Fan revealed an approving look.</p><p></p><p>"Originally I planned to show you the full extent after letting you witness the true immortal character transcripts of the Immortal Boat. But now it seems fine to let you have an eyeful first," Li Fan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It may not be possible to fully unleash them within the Immortal Boat. Why don't we go out into the void?" Li Fan suggested eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Having finally lured Li Fan onto the Immortal Boat, how could the elders possibly let the tiger go back to the mountains?</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong waved his hand dismissively. "Right here will do, using various methods. Rest assured, this secret vault has the severed immortal arm fused with myriad incomplete character structures that mutually restrict each other, able to reduce the influence of the true immortal characters to the minimum."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed a bit disappointed. "I was hoping to give a full display of my learning in front of you all..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong made hand seals again, and the severed immortal arm then exploded in front of everyone, transforming into countless incomplete character structures, like swimming tadpoles, sealing off the area above, below, and on all four sides.</p><p></p><p>Forming a cage for the true immortal characters.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you may begin," Zhong Daogong said, and all the elders of the Immortal Boat fixed their gazes on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cleared his throat lightly, his expression solemn: "Friends, let me reiterate that the true immortal characters I will depict next are generated from my own understanding and memory of them. I won't claim they are comparable to the original versions in the immortal world, or even the one in the Great Awakening Divine Instrument's memory..."</p><p></p><p>"But rest assured, my level is top-notch even in the entire Great Awakening. I definitely won't let you down!"</p><p></p><p>After saying a bunch of nonsense to whet the appetites of the Immortal Boat crowd, Li Fan finally displayed that scene again of the boundless green plains with surging arc-lights.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shifting lights, an extremely profound character appeared before everyone.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of its descent into the world, the originally drifting character fragments in the cage suddenly stilled.</p><p></p><p>Many of them even flew out from the cage structure, converging towards the radiant character in the center.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just an illusory projection of light, it still drove the character fragments into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The severed immortal arm spontaneously disintegrated, and the Immortal Boat elders had to divert some attention to maintain its stability.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, just like those character fragments, these elders' attention was also uncontrollably drawn to the two characters of "creation"!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, no empty boasts - just this single character surpasses the total sum of all!"</p><p></p><p>"Creation...it's actually creation!"  </p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Boat is saved!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Boat elders had been immersed in the true immortal characters for most of their lives, so their comprehension was unquestionable. After seeing the true form of "creation", they all couldn't help exclaiming in astonishment, without exception.</p><p></p><p>While all the Immortal Boat elders had their attention captured, Li Fan quietly observed and analyzed the guardian of the Immortal Boat's secret vault - that severed immortal arm.</p><p></p><p>He had to admit, the security method of fusing all the treasures through incomplete character structures into one entity was indeed ingenious.</p><p></p><p>Even with the intention to steal, and his experience of cyclical reincarnations, extensive witnessing, and the final separation disk, Li Fan couldn't find a suitable way to break through it for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Solution.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, as the characters "zao hua" (造化, the Dao of creation) were revealed, the characters that formed the Broken Immortal Arm began to disintegrate and spontaneously converge towards "zao hua". </p><p></p><p>This allowed him to glimpse the specific composition structure of the Broken Immortal Arm.</p><p></p><p>"It would be quite difficult to completely shatter this broken arm in an instant. However, it should still be possible to abduct some key items from it," Li Fan contemplated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal seal script characters of "zao hua" were truly profound and extraordinary, not something that could be comprehended overnight.</p><p></p><p>As the elders of Xianzhou were immersed in understanding it and saw that Li Fan was just quietly waiting by the side, they did not pay much attention to him either. This gave Li Fan ample time to analyze this Bai Wen Xian Lu (Hundred Heard Immortal Records).</p><p></p><p>"This item, this item, and this item, it would be best to take them away later..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally saw through the Xianzhou elder's hidden murderous intent towards him. </p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan himself did not have any good intentions either.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the chaos caused by "zao hua" in the secret vault, Li Fan had already quietly laid out his plundering methods.</p><p></p><p>It was the same incomplete true immortal seal script characters, disguised and integrated into the Broken Immortal Arm to cause confusion.</p><p></p><p>The longer the Xianzhou elder was immersed in comprehending "zao hua", the more abundant the hidden moves Li Fan had planted would become.</p><p></p><p>The more items he could plunder later on.</p><p></p><p>"No need to make a move hastily," Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, his hands working tirelessly in secret.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than thirty days had passed.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong was the first to awaken from his comprehension, his expression somewhat dazed, and then he let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>He then bowed to Li Fan: "Thank you, Daoyou (fellow cultivator)!"</p><p></p><p>"To be able to witness 'zao hua' in person is truly a blessing from the heavens! If not for your grace, I would probably not have such an opportunity in this lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan accepted it calmly and waved his hand, saying, "It was just a transaction!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogong shook his head: "How can mundane objects be compared to 'zao hua'? In this transaction, Xianzhou has truly gained an immense advantage!"</p><p></p><p>The other Xianzhou elders also gradually awoke from their comprehension one by one.</p><p></p><p>They first slightly bowed to Li Fan, then their gazes intertwined, and finally all fell on Li Fan together.</p><p></p><p>The implication contained in their eyes was almost completely consistent.</p><p></p><p>That was the desire to see a purer, more complete form of "zao hua".</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "Desires are hard to fill." After witnessing the true immortal seal script characters written by Li Fan and vaguely experiencing the boundless power contained within these characters, an even deeper need inevitably arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyou, I wonder if we could take a look at the 'zao hua' within the Great Opening's Protective Universal Immortal Artifact..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Dao Sheng asked amiably.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan showed a difficult expression: "Even in our Great Opening, only those who have inherited the orthodox teachings and passed through multiple levels of scrutiny have the qualification to glimpse the true memory of the immortal artifacts. Others can only learn through layers of indirect transmission..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the expressions of the Xianzhou elders and smiled: "I can fully understand your feelings. However, this is only our first transaction. Perhaps in the future, as we interact more, I may agree to your request to go and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Xianzhou elders' expressions varied.</p><p></p><p>But they privately discussed it again among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhong, what do you think now?"</p><p>"We definitely can't kill him! We must maintain our connection with the Great Opening, in the hope of obtaining a more complete understanding of 'zao hua'..."</p><p>"Right, compared to 'zao hua', those other true immortal seal script characters seem rather insignificant."</p><p>"The Great Opening can even transmit 'zao hua' externally. Compared to them, our Xianzhou is truly small-minded."</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the power of "zao hua", the attitudes of all the Xianzhou elders underwent a unified change.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhong Daogong had already made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"According to our agreement, next we will lead Daoyou to see that true immortal seal script relic," he said with a smile to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Although this relic may not be as impressive as the 'zao hua' you demonstrated, it is still written by the hand of a true immortal, and I believe it will definitely be able to provide you with some enlightenment," Zhong Daogong said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Then I can't wait," Li Fan smiled back in response.</p><p></p><p>Following the Xianzhou elders, he temporarily left the secret vault.</p><p></p><p>From the top of the divine tree, all the way down to the heart of the divine tree.</p><p></p><p>In this space filled with lush greenery, a relic was suspended.</p><p></p><p>On the ground of the relic, a true immortal seal script character was engraved.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the obstruction of the divine tree's branches, its full appearance could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw this relic, Li Fan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>Because the architectural style of this relic was very similar to what he had seen on the Xian Xu (Immortal Ruins) continent before.</p><p></p><p>"A relic from the immortal realm?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask, looking very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyou has good knowledge," the Xianzhou elders were also slightly surprised that Li Fan could recognize the origin of the relic. Their evaluation of the Great Opening civilization rose again.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this relic fell from the upper realm when the path to immortality was severed," Zhong Daogong said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the news of the severed path had not yet spread through the starry sea. Therefore, no one had expected that this abruptly appearing building would be related to the immortal realm. It was only the true immortal seal script character engraved within that caused a catastrophe."</p><p></p><p>"Our Xianzhou only discovered the source of this catastrophe in the relics of the starry sea after millions of years."</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders joined their hand seals together, and the divine tree branches entangled on the ground of the relic slowly loosened.</p><p></p><p>Revealing the true appearance of the true immortal seal script character.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because too much time had passed, and also due to the divine tree's constant absorption, the fluctuations emanating from the character were already extremely faint.</p><p></p><p>But this did not prevent Li Fan from instantly seeing the meaning of this character.</p><p></p><p>"Gu (ancient)..." Li Fan murmured, using his hand as a brush to try and copy it down.</p><p></p><p>This "gu" character on the relic grounds seemed very similar to the "luan" (chaotic) character he had seen in the White Mist Maze Domain before.</p><p></p><p>True immortal seal script characters are descriptions of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>But unless it is the manifestation of the Dao itself, when written by different people, they will exhibit different characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had studied true immortal seal script characters for many years and could naturally clearly distinguish such characteristics.</p><p></p><p>This "gu" character and the "luan" character were written by the same person.</p><p></p><p>However, they were not from the same source as the "ji" (hunger) character in the Xian Xu continent.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, 'gu', 'luan', and the true immortal seal script character that caused countless apocalyptic disasters in the Darkest Starry Sea, were all written by the same person with the intention of causing chaos in the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Meanwhile, the 'ji' character in the Xian Xu may have only been used by the true immortal for comprehending the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Although their original intentions were different, they ultimately led to the same result - the destruction of the starry sea and its descent into complete stillness."</p><p></p><p>"In the eyes of true immortals, we cultivators are truly like ants..."</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Although the fluctuations on this relic have long dissipated, it still has its uses."</p>

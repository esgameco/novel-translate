        <div class="content">
            <p>However, this is not a pretense. After carefully observing for a moment, it was then noticed that He Zhenghao might not be lying. On him, there was an extremely mysterious aura hidden. It was extremely secretive, and if He Zhenghao did not expose it himself, and in fact, the current "Zhou Qing'ang" was actually transformed from Li Fan's main body, it might not be easily detectable.</p><p></p><p>Replaying the records of the transformation stone in his mind, Li Fan quickly understood the origin of this change. It was when He Xingxing, before regretfully leaving, handed He Zhenghao a plain white jade, instructing him to nurture it in his elixir field.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't really practiced properly, just relying on this white jade, I have the confidence to go from Golden Core to Nascent Infant in such a short time..."</p><p></p><p>"This white jade is indeed quite a valuable treasure! I'm afraid even for the Heng family in Tianyu Prefecture, it is extremely rare. He Xingxing truly went all out to save his elderly father."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang" looked at He Zhenghao with a barely noticeable cold gaze, sneering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>And then pretending to be very surprised, "Friend, your cultivation has progressed so quickly? It's really unexpected. It seems like your talent surpasses mine and Gao Yuan's by far."</p><p></p><p>A hint of embarrassment flashed across He Zhenghao's face, but it was quickly hidden, confidently saying, "Hehe, friend, don't be discouraged. The cultivation of us cultivators, apart from being influenced by talent, is also closely related to diligence and opportunities. Friend, although your talent is slightly inferior, with the opportunities at hand, you shouldn't miss out!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to He Zhenghao's advice, Zhou Qing'ang seemed to be lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Just when He Zhenghao thought the other party had been convinced and was pleased in his heart, Zhou Qing'ang sighed and refused his suggestion.</p><p></p><p>"As the friend said, wanting to better serve the envoy is very important. But opportunities often come with dangers. As for me..." Zhou Qing'ang shook his head, looking regretful.</p><p></p><p>"I've never been lucky! Even if there really is some opportunity in the Chaoyuan Sect, it probably won't be my turn! I'd rather stay in the Cloudsea and do my job well."</p><p></p><p>"Wait until the envoy..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang deliberately paused, and then said, "The envoy never mistreats his subordinates. Seeing our hard work, maybe with a little happiness, he might generously reward us with something that can help us improve our cultivation levels!"</p><p></p><p>"But still, thank you for your kindness, friend!" Zhou Qing'ang clasped his hands and left the Political Affairs Hall.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Zhou Qing'ang's back, He Zhenghao's expression was uncertain: "This kid is indeed the envoy's confidant, really knows something! It seems like my decision was right, since he's not willing to leave the Cloudsea, it shows that there is not only no danger here, but also great benefits..."</p><p></p><p>With his last trace of doubt erased from his mind, He Zhenghao made a firm decision. As he gazed at He Zhenghao's gloomy yet ardently desirous eyes, Li Fan knew what he was thinking inside.</p><p></p><p>"The more greedy, the more stupid. The more stupid, the more greedy."</p><p></p><p>"A vicious cycle; this worldly He Zhenghao is no longer the friend I used to know!"</p><p></p><p>"Different experiences have such a profound influence on character shaping."</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Li Fan had some insights.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has something to do with the foundation of greed and seizing the heavens of the new law."</p><p></p><p>No longer thinking about this matter, in the following period of time, Li Fan pretended to handle various matters as meticulously as the previous Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>And the "Secret Envoy Li Fan," the transformed alter-ego, stayed in the deep secret chamber of the Political Affairs Hall, supposedly in seclusion for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Quietly switching between the original body and the alter-ego, Li Fan also began secretly creating a puppet figure in the appearance of Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Cloudsea, he manipulated the Earthfire Return to Origin formation, consuming some common materials to build a skeletal puppet. Later, using the method of "Strange Profound True Spirit Transformation," he attached a layer of skin and flesh to the skeletal puppet's exterior.</p><p></p><p>Then he attached a strand of his divine consciousness to it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he successfully created a puppet body that looked exactly like Zhou Qing'ang's appearance.</p><p></p><p>After transferring all the items, including clothes and storage rings, Li Fan's main body looked over the azure Cloudsea and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave," he thought.</p><p></p><p>Reverting back to his original appearance and without looking back, he sped towards the location of the Longevity Valley Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the puppet Zhou Qing'ang, controlled by the remaining divine consciousness of Li Fan, returned alone to the Cloudsea Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Since Zhou Qing'ang usually was not one to talk much, even though his expression seemed a bit reserved, for a while, he did not raise any suspicion among other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan intentionally reduced his interactions with others and when in contact, he was seen as diligently and earnestly handling state affairs, appearing extremely busy.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the vast Cloudsea City, even though there were many cultivators coming and going, none of them noticed that Zhou Qing'ang had completed the swap in secret.</p><p></p><p>Although there were still some flaws, in due time, someone would definitely discover them.</p><p></p><p>However, the entire Cloudsea, including all the beings within it, had already reached their limit.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's main body was still on the way.</p><p></p><p>One day, both himself and the puppet controlled by his divine consciousness suddenly felt a peculiar movement. </p><p></p><p>"What is that!"</p><p></p><p>The continuous exclamations from Cloudsea City caused Li Fan to look up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>A huge black fireball appeared in the sky without warning, carrying a dark tail behind it, and fiercely smashed towards the Cloudsea.</p><p></p><p>"This is!" Li Fan's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>"Fiery Blaze?" Sensing the seemingly uncertain aura emanating from the black fireball, Li Fan was somewhat unsure.</p><p></p><p>The black fireball was extremely fast, before the cultivators inside the Cloudsea could react, it had already fallen from the sky into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it touched the sea water, it instantly evaporated due to the high temperature.</p><p></p><p>In the sea, a huge cavity appeared first. Then the black fireball hit the seabed fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the loud roar, the entire Cloudsea shook violently. Even the Cloudsea City high up in the clouds was soon swept over by the shockwave, swaying like driftwood in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Under the fierce impact, with towering waves, a towering tsunami surged out from the black fireball's point of impact, sweeping towards the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators saw that within the hundreds of meters high waves, there were half-black flames mixed in.</p><p></p><p>Where the waves and fire collided, countless islands were instantly reduced to ashes!</p><p></p><p>(Translation Complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 967</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Originally, seeing "Sun Xingwang" return to normal, Moru Bin couldn't help but show a few traces of joy on his face. </p><p></p><p>But what made him extremely uncomfortable was that Li Fan suddenly stopped talking halfway through.</p><p></p><p>The other party's face suddenly became extremely dazed, with a blank look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, there was finally a little bit of light, and he subconsciously looked around.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." Li Fan stared at Moru Bin in front of him and asked with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>This strong contrast between before and after made Moru Bin take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew that the cultivation method practiced by Sun Xingwang was extremely strange and was the most among the Twelve Dharma Kings.</p><p></p><p>But being bizarre to this extent still made him feel a bit horrified.</p><p></p><p>"However, what Brother Xingwang is thinking is actually the same as mine without prior agreement."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... It turns out that he deliberately guided the Dharma transmitter [Feng] to the place where I was sleeping that day. He just wanted me to lurk inside the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Just as Moru Bin was deep in thought, Li Fan also seemed to recognize him.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Brother Bin."</p><p></p><p>"How are we here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around.</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin sighed slightly and sighed in his heart: "It's okay, at least he still remembers me. It saves me the trouble of having to say more."</p><p></p><p>Then he briefly introduced to Li Fan the fact that he had replaced the Dharma transmitter Feng, entered the high level of the Wanxian Alliance, and was plotting to obtain the Xuantian Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Mirror is the only magical weapon that the Xuantian King refined with all his heart back then. Although it has been used by the Wanxian Alliance in recent years, according to my observation, the Wanxian Alliance has not completely gained control over it. Instead, they have reached a certain cooperative relationship."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we can regain control of the Xuantian Mirror, it is very likely that we can determine the whereabouts of the Xuantian King through it."</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin said concisely while Li Fan was still lucid.</p><p></p><p>"In my state, knowing these things is useless. What do you need me to do?" Li Fan also asked very cooperatively and with self-knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin was very gratified and whispered, "In today's Wanxian Alliance, the Dharma Transmitter faction and the Mirror Holder faction have a division of power and checks and balances. In addition, there is also the [Huanzhen Sage] faction, hidden in the dark, acting as a balance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, "The high-level of the Wanxian Alliance is actually so complicated? And what Mirror Holder, Huanzhen Sage..."</p><p></p><p>"I have never heard of them before."</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin nodded slightly, "I also only learned about this after occupying the body of Dharma Transmitter Feng. These three factions in power rarely show their faces, so it's normal for the outside world to not know their true situation."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Dharma Transmitters are the surviving cultivators who followed behind the Dharma Heavenly Venerate back then and promoted the new methods."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Mirror Holders, as the name suggests, they control the power of the Xuantian Mirror. Over the years, the Wanxian Alliance has never given up on the idea of completely possessing the Xuantian Mirror. Relying on the means left behind by the Dharma Heavenly Venerate back then, they have gradually eroded and increased their control over the Xuantian Mirror step by step."</p><p></p><p>"As for the most mysterious third faction, the Huanzhen Sages..."</p><p></p><p>"I have had very little contact with them during this period. However, it seems to have something to do with the creation called [Era] and the beast clan's Emperor Sanmao. Using the supreme power of deduction and a certain extremely illusory yet real power, they are able to turn the unreal into the real, and summon countless powerful cultivators out of thin air to fight..."</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin shared the currently known information with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Li Fan impatiently</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Bothered, he waved his hand: "What is the plan?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin nodded, not denying it: "But my plan has already begun to take effect."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Mirror has its own spirit. Since it's not easy to control, we'll force it to cooperate with us."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, you have already passed the Xuantian Sealing Spirit Formation Diagram to the Immortal Alliance through some means. With my help, the Dharma Transmitters are now eager to act."</p><p></p><p>"Trying to completely control the Xuantian Mirror through the power of Xuantian Sealing... "</p><p></p><p>"But you and I both know that Xuantian Sealing is just forcing the Xuantian Mirror to execute certain commands. To truly fully control the Xuantian Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm afraid no one in the world can do it except the Xuantian King!"</p><p></p><p>"But the Xuantian Mirror naturally doesn't want to be manipulated like this. When the restraints deepen step by step, we can try to contact it. Cooperate with it in turn to help it resolve the crisis. The price is to help us find the Xuantian King."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if it is unwilling..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's eyes flashed: "It doesn't matter to let Xuantian Sealing go a step further."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted Mo Rubin's words: "The Xuantian Mirror's attitude is unknown, I'm afraid it won't be too enthusiastic about finding the Xuantian King. It may even obstruct..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin smiled: "Brother Xingwang, you forgot that the Xuantian Mirror has been refined by the Xuantian King and is tainted with the Xuantian Dao. It cannot lie and must also keep its word."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes: "Is that so..."</p><p></p><p>He looked confused, as if his memory was slipping again. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mo Rubin quickly changed the subject: "So now what Brother Xingwang needs to do is to cooperate with me inside and out to gradually increase my prestige."</p><p></p><p>"Gain the trust of most Dharma Transmitters, so we can continue to promote Xuantian Sealing."</p><p></p><p>"Your Divine Possession should expand at the maximum speed within half a month. When it causes panic, I will make my move. At that time, you cooperate with me to put on a show. Most of the Divine Possessions will be destroyed, leaving only a small portion for backup."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded repeatedly and agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, your condition..." Mo Rubin looked worried.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I have ways to record the truly important matters."</p><p></p><p>With that said, the faceless immortal stone statue appeared in the sky again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the statue and meditated with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>A faint golden light appeared again, enveloping the entire statue.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan opened his eyes and dispersed the statue.</p><p></p><p>"That's all we can do."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was pensive but did not continue discussing this topic.</p><p></p><p>"Our plan is almost foolproof, the only thing we need to worry about..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin paused, then said, "It's that Dharma Transmitter Jiang."</p><p></p><p>A rare solemn expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"If there is anyone in the current Myriad Immortal Alliance who can truly take on the responsibility of reviving the Immortal Alliance, it is none other than this person."</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmitter Jiang..."</p><p></p><p>"Truly has some of the Xuantian King's demeanor back then."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin gave the other party an extremely high evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmitter Jiang..." Li Fan's heart moved, but he didn't ask.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he pretended to be completely uninterested.</p><p></p><p>"With you presiding, I am very reassured. I just need to cooperate with you in secret."</p>

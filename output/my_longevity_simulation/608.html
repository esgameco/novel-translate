        <div class="content">
            <p>Forcing their way out of the "Immortal Ruins," the formations were somewhat affected to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Li Fan also knew that a cultivator named Linghu Chang from the Medicine King Sect did not have the chance to fully enter the "Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation."</p><p></p><p>The room he was in was not completely sealed and still had a slight gap.</p><p></p><p>If he could grasp the memories in his mind, the Medicine King True Cauldron would be almost completely defenseless against Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators above the Nascent Soul realm were left undisturbed, allowing them to continue sleeping.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators below the Nascent Soul realm, if needed, they could be individually subdued with the use of the "Binding Insects" technique.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even though these Medicine King Sect disciples each possessed many magical treasures and pills, for the current Li Fan, these external items were not very useful.</p><p></p><p>What he truly cared about was the Medicine King Cauldron itself, which had the ability to traverse through space.</p><p></p><p>And inside the Medicine King Sect, there was a set of signposts that led to another cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Even though the Immortal Ruins exist, I can't escape the Xuanhuang Realm for the time being. But one day, I will have to leave this place."</p><p></p><p>"Holding the signposts in my hands would be a precaution."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan had another reason for coming all this way.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to witness the existence of the "Immortal Ruins" with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head to look up at the sky, calming his thoughts and waiting for the arrival of the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>During the wait, he felt the unique "Immortal Seal Power" of the vast abyss of Cangwu, sighing at the marvels of creation.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the weakening of cultivators by restrictions and formations, this "Immortal Seal Power" seemed to compress one's cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>With his current cultivation at the early Nascent Soul stage, although his strength seemed unlimited, he could only display power equivalent to the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly marvelous, like an ordinary person entering the land of giants. Despite no change in their own height, compared to the surrounding objects, they turn out to be nothing but 'little people.'"</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan marveled silently, the ruins floating beside him, as if blown by the wind, began to slowly move with creaking sounds, heading towards Li Fan's position.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning, they seemed to have a life of their own, appearing quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>Furrowing his brows slightly, Li Fan chose not to destroy these ruins but to actively avoid them as they passed by him.</p><p></p><p>However, as the rubble and remnants passed by him, Li Fan seemed to have discovered something, his gaze focusing suddenly.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, landing on one of the stone pillars.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing countless years, the carvings on the stone pillar were already almost indistinguishable. Even the pillar itself had been worn out for the most part.</p><p></p><p>However, with the "Transcendental Dao One" secret technique, Li Fan could firmly imprint all past experiences in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Thus, even with only some incomplete lines remaining, the patterns on the pillar still seemed familiar to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes showed bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the patterns before his eyes with those he had seen somewhere in his memories, there was not a single difference!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head once again, looking at the vast architectural ruins in the "Lost Enchantment City," feeling somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"These buildings, could they all be from the mist?"</p><p></p><p>In the realm of the "Chaos" he had entered before, Li Fan had seen twelve large relics.</p><p></p><p>The patterns carved on those relics' buildings were identical to those here.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also recalled the origin of the Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>At a certain time, the entire landscape of Cangwu Province vanished, leaving behind only this deep abyss resembling a footprint.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but look down into the depths of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Dark and profound, the end was not visible.</p><p></p><p>"Cangwu Abyss, connecting to the depths of the white mist?"</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, there was no devouring white mist in the Xuanhuang Realm. And now, the white mist has cut off and divided the whole world..."</p><p></p><p>"Where did it come from? And what identities did those unfortunate cultivators I encountered in the mist domain have?"</p><p></p><p>Countless questions surged in Li Fan's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could think carefully, a shooting star streaked across the night sky, illuminating the firmament.</p><p></p><p>"It's here!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up to see the streak heading straight towards his position.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a strangely inexplicable agitation arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a sense of unease, his body trembled slightly uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that this was the residual influence of the Immortal Ruins that the Medicine King True Cauldron had barely escaped from.</p><p></p><p>Slightly moving away from the landing point, Li Fan's gaze remained fixed on the fiery meteor in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King True Cauldron fell at a rapid speed, only taking a few breaths to descend from the sky to the ground, heading straight towards the Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the abyss, its speed gradually slowed down, and the external fiery light gradually extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the aura of the Immortal Ruins, all creatures within the abyss subconsciously panicked and fled, making way for it.</p><p></p><p>Having stopped at the same place as before, the Medicine King True Cauldron unfurled itself.</p><p></p><p>After emitting a mysterious wave for help towards the outside world, the Medicine King Cauldron gradually became transparent and vanished into the air.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not rush to act but waited until the aura of the Medicine King True Cauldron completely dissipated before using the small Medicine King Cauldron to enter it.</p><p></p><p>With the exploration experience of Xiongcheng and others from the previous life, Li Fan had an unimpeded journey and reached the door of Linghu Chang's room, which was slightly ajar.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Linghu Chang lay on the ground, immersed in deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Also at the early stage of Nascent Soul, but..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, and the illusory image of the Five Elements Paradise behind him suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Paradise acted like shackles, restraining Linghu Chang.</p><p></p><p>Confiscating all the items on him, Li Fan operated his power.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, without a chance to scream, Linghu Chang's body turned into dust under the tremendous power of the Five Elements Paradise.</p><p></p><p>His Nascent Soul in the dantian was unharmed under Li Fan's precise control.</p><p></p><p>Awakening from his deep sleep, Linghu Chang's body was destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Staring at his tiny purple body like a baby, he was filled with hatred and fear as he looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The only response was a purple thunderbolt flashing before him.</p><p></p><p>"Zixiao Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang's tone was filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>After completely absorbing Linghu Chang's memories, Li Fan, who already knew everything, waved his sleeve and temporarily suppressed Linghu Chang's Nascent Soul in his own Paradise.</p><p></p><p>Advancing further, Li Fan arrived at the deepest part of the Medicine King True Cauldron, standing outside the "Gate of Life and Death," pondering deeply.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Life and Death is closed, and even the Dao will find it hard to break through."</p><p></p><p>"Only the 'Eternal Green Power' manifested by practicing the Medicine King Sect's true scripture, 'Saving the World for Longevity,' can instantly reverse the Gate of Life and Death and enter it."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Saving the World for Longevity' scripture is a Dao scripture."</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary cultivator suddenly obtained such a dao scripture, they would likely be extremely excited and lose sleep throughout the night.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan remained calm with no waves in his heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Although the "Saving the World for Longevity" scripture was a Dao scripture, the practice method was focused on saving the world, healing the sick, and helping people.</p><p></p><p>Saving others meant saving oneself, and the more people one saved, the faster their cultivation progressed.</p><p></p><p>Even breaking through cultivation barriers required meeting a certain number of conditions by helping others.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a low compatibility with this scripture and felt no need to switch cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, being a Dao scripture, its value was undoubtedly high. By annihilating all the Medicine King Sect disciples, this scripture would become a lonely copy known only to Li Fan. But there was no need for such actions as the Medicine King Sect members had more important uses.</p><p></p><p>The main trouble now was that there were too many practitioners of the "Saving the World for Longevity" scripture, a total of four hundred and sixty-two.</p><p></p><p>Trying to activate this scripture, Li Fan felt as if the spiritual energy in his body was completely blocked, making it impossible to even touch upon it.</p><p></p><p>Even wanting to comprehend it was nearly an impossible task.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, he came up with an idea.</p><p></p><p>Based on Linghu Chang's memories, Li Fan found some rooms of the Golden Core cultivators from the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Breaking into them, he forcibly extracted a portion of the "Eternal Green Power" from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Merging these forces together to condense them into an energy body, Li Fan projected a trace of his divine sense into the green energy body, stretching out his limbs to adapt for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Green Power is overflowing constantly and won't last long. But it should be enough."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the energy body condensed into the shape of a green Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan plunged into the Gate of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>As if passing through a thin gray film, the next moment, Li Fan thought he had flown out of the Medicine King Cauldron and returned to the Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was because the inner wall of the Medicine King Cauldron had become completely transparent.</p><p></p><p>In the scene, there were only two skeletons.</p><p></p><p>One stood up, and one lay on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The standing one should be Li Ruochen. The one lying on the ground should be Huang Lao."</p><p></p><p>"To escape the Immortal Ruins, Li Ruochen had no choice but to sacrifice the life source of some disciples within the sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the sights from his previous life, silently pondering.</p><p></p><p>"Having turned into bones, they shouldn't still be alive, right?"</p><p></p><p>Slowly approaching Li Ruochen, when he reached the corpse of Li Ruochen's bones, a shadow suddenly appeared at Li Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>Startled at first, Li Fan quickly realized that the figure had no vitality and was nothing but a projection.</p><p></p><p>The overflowing Eternal Green Power on Li Fan's body was absorbed by the shadow.</p><p></p><p>As if passing a certain verification, after a while, the shadow spoke, "Disciples of the Medicine King Sect, listen carefully."</p><p></p><p>"When you see this image, I should have already perished."</p><p></p><p>"I was wrong."</p><p></p><p>"I foresaw the arrival of the calamity of heaven and earth but did not expect that on top of our Xuanhuang Realm, there is something even more terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Immortal Sects, clearly aware of everything, yet they just watch us perish."</p><p></p><p>"This grudge is irreconcilable!"</p><p></p><p>"But remember, the Ten Sects are powerful, and direct confrontation is not advisable. After returning to the Xuanhuang Realm, seek refuge in the 'Longevity Valley' and preserve your strength as much as possible. Wait until the calamity has completely passed, then act accordingly."</p><p></p><p>"After my death, my son, Li Yihang, will temporarily take over the sect leader's position, with the elders assisting him. When he breaks through to the Divine Transformation stage, he can officially inherit the position."</p><p></p><p>"At this critical moment of life and death, there must be no internal strife!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mechanically reciting Li Ruochen's last wishes, Li Fan stood in place, quietly listening.</p><p></p><p>After all the instructions had been given, the shadow dissipated into tiny specks of starlight, leaving behind a glowing rhombus crystal in its place.</p><p></p><p>Originally meant to be handed over to Li Yihang by Li Ruochen, it was now preempted by the foresighted Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Using the control core of the energy body, Li Fan opened the Gate of Life and Death and stepped into the control room.</p><p></p><p>After spending seven days refining it, Li Fan gained control of the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Though many functions could not be activated temporarily due to the lack of Eternal Green Power, most of the basic functions were able to be used.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan accessed the images recorded by the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>It was consistent with what Xiongcheng and others had seen in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>In the endless void, the glowing sphere representing the Xuanhuang Realm appeared so small.</p><p></p><p>While the Immortal Ruins above seemed to want to devour everything, it also appeared terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The footage continued to play.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Cauldron that flew out of the Xuanhuang Realm lost control and continuously descended towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Despite emanating numerous radiance to break free from the gravitational pull of the Immortal Ruins, it could not escape.</p><p></p><p>It drew closer and closer to the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly on the verge of being completely overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, countless different light points suddenly rushed out from the Cauldron, as if gaining infinite power in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Amid constant rumbling, the Medicine King Cauldron changed its direction of motion.</p><p></p><p>Yet, all of Li Fan's attention was focused on the Immortal Ruins' image recorded by the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to being close enough, Li Fan was able to see the appearance of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>On the desolate land, nothing but ruins remained.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there seemed to be a tall human figure standing upright.</p>

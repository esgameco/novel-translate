        <div class="content">
            <p>Especially the chest wound, under the effect of this warm flow, it unexpectedly alleviated significantly in a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what medicine is this? It's so efficacious..." Li Fan asked subconsciously.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, some memories from the past also emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He and this Zhao sister were both from the Village of Longfeng on the Great Qing Mountain, acquainted since childhood.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, a group of bandits attacked the Village of Longfeng, and the vast majority of villagers fell victim to their hands. Only he and Sister Zhao escaped because they were playing outside together.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the fire in the village and rushed back, they inadvertently ran into the bandits returning with their loot, preparing to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Though Sister Zhao was young, her exceptionally beautiful appearance attracted the attention of all the bandits.</p><p></p><p>At this critical moment, a Taoist happened to pass by. After seeing the blood spurting into the sky below and the two trembling children in front of the bandits, the Taoist instantly understood what had happened. He killed all the bandits on the spot, saving Sister Zhao and Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Recognizing Sister Zhao's outstanding talent, he decided to take her back to the sect.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Li Fan seemed average in talent and did not catch the Taoist's eye. It was only due to Sister Zhao's plea that the Taoist reluctantly agreed to take him along.</p><p></p><p>After flying for over ten days, the Taoist brought them back to the sect. Clouds and mist enveloped the area, with towering mountains. Every now and then, one could see immortals dashing through the clouds, leaving trails of rosy light. In the sea of clouds, many magnificent buildings stood faintly, resembling a divine court in the heavens, emitting a sacred aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this splendid scene of the immortal world, Sister Zhao and Li Fan were instantly mesmerized. From the words of the Taoists who brought them back, Li Fan learned the name of this sect, Da Dao Zongâ€”the Grand Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Da Dao Zong had nine branches and seventy-two peaks.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the main branch, which was passed down by the generations of Sect Masters, the other eight branches were managed by various elders.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist they believed was their master was only a fourth-generation disciple of the Moonlight Branch of Da Dao Zong, named Zhang Rong, with the cultivation base of Yuanying.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhang Rong's guidance, they naturally joined the Moonlight Branch and became outer disciples of Da Dao Zong, settling at the Qingning Peak.</p><p></p><p>They were also given a cultivation technique called the "Taiyuan Qi Art."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Rong instructed them that once they successfully cultivate this technique, they could advance to become inner disciples. They would no longer have to labor for various chores and could focus solely on cultivation. Their status within the sect and the resources they could obtain monthly would be vastly different.</p><p></p><p>During their leisure time, the two of them studied and practiced this technique together.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao was slightly older, with better understanding and talent that Li Fan couldn't compare to.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, she had already mastered the Taiyuan Qi Art and passed the test. She was highly valued by the Moonlight Branch and was taken in by the Immortal Lord Zhang Wangshuang, leaping to become the fourth-generation disciple of the Da Dao Zong, referred to as Brother and Sister with Zhang Rong, their former Taoist.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Li Fan, despite Sister Zhao secretly sharing insights and occasionally giving him elixirs, progressed very slowly and couldn't break through.</p><p></p><p>Due to Sister Zhao's frequent visits, it aroused jealousy among the surrounding disciples. Although they showed great respect towards Li Fan on the surface, even flattered him, in private, they looked down on him, often belittling him. They considered Li Fan nothing more than a useless freeloader.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, after Li Fan overheard their conversation by chance, he was so ashamed and furious that he couldn't help but fight back.</p><p></p><p>In the end, due to his lack of skill and being outnumbered, he ended up being beaten almost to death.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, due to fearing the presence of Sister Zhao, the other disciples didn't go too far.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Memories faded, returning to reality.</p><p></p><p>"This is Tianjing Powder, not only can it help you quickly recover from your injuries but also further enhance your spiritual sense."</p><p></p><p>"These materials were painstakingly collected by me. Since you haven't built your foundation yet, many elixirs can be harmful if taken, so I asked the master for this prescription." Sister Zhao wiped away the remnants of medicine from Li Fan's mouth, smiling as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>The warm flow was like spiritual energy, lingering for a long time, even running spontaneously. In a short moment, Li Fan felt his injuries completely healed, his whole body filled with inexhaustible strength.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you are so good to me..." Li Fan held Sister Zhao's fair and delicate hand tightly, looking into her eyes with deep gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Sister Zhao's cheeks blushed slightly, wanting to pull her hand back. However, Li Fan held it too tightly, and she was afraid of exerting too much force and hurting him. So, for a while, she had to let Li Fan hold her hand, letting his fingers glide over her palm intentionally or unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>The warmth emanating from Li Fan's hand seemed even more scorching than the earth veins' fire, making her feel slightly weak.</p><p></p><p>A strange emotion began to spread in the room.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan suddenly said, "By the way, Sister. There are still many parts of the Taiyuan Qi Art that I don't understand. Can you explain it to me again?"</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao was momentarily surprised.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a hint of disappointment in her heart, but also some joy.</p><p></p><p>She had wanted to explain the essence of the Taiyuan Qi Art to him before, but perhaps out of male pride, he was not willing to listen, saying he wanted to comprehend it on his own.</p><p></p><p>She had no choice but to give up.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, now he seemed to have a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao then patiently began to explain to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful. This sentence can actually be understood like that. Sister, you are so brilliant!" Li Fan listened while praising, his eyes shining with admiration.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, as evening approached, Sister Zhao's face showed regret, reluctantly stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Master instructed me to return before dark. So, I have to leave now!" She looked at Li Fan cautiously, saying carefully, fearing he might be displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Sister's duty is important, then you should hurry back." Li Fan nodded, showing no signs of displeasure. "When you have time, you can come again next time."</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao lightly acknowledged before intending to leave. However, she realized that while Li Fan was listening attentively, he had already loosened the tight grip on her hand. Surprisingly, she had been holding onto him tightly all along, for whatever reason.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a warmth rushing to her face, she was afraid that Li Fan would notice. After bidding farewell, she left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>With her heart pounding fiercely, she felt extremely elated, even her steps becoming much lighter.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan had already put the ambiguous atmosphere between them behind him.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the mysteries of the Taiyuan Qi Art, he could not extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>"So that's it, so that's it!" With Sister Zhao's guidance, he unraveled all the difficulties he had encountered while practicing the technique every day.</p><p></p><p>Understanding thoroughly, clear in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I am not far from building my foundation!" The spiritual energy in his body flowed without obstruction, feeling like it was innate.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but rejoice.</p><p></p><p>"If I had asked Sister for guidance earlier, I wouldn't have wasted half a year in vain!"</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why did I have such 'awkward' thoughts before!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, realizing that his previous behavior was somewhat unreasonable.</p>

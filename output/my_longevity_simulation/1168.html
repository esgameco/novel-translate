            <p>Chapter 1166: The Mirror People Contend</p><p></p><p>"A dynasty created by the mortals who were expelled to the small worlds in those years. There may be unknown powerful beings intervening behind the scenes, as the speed of their civilization's development completely defies common sense."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has something to do with the group of people who fled the Xuanhuang Realm before the great calamity struck and the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao escaped."</p><p></p><p>"After preliminary judgment, the possibility that important members within the Immortal Alliance have already been infiltrated by them cannot be ruled out."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan carefully read these text fragments, his brows tightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Qi Dynasty of the Sacred Court was extremely mysterious, and it was not yet known which small world they were hiding in. The Tianxuan Mirror could only judge their approximate strength based on the state of the Great Qi Dynasty's active personnel in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that we couldn't capture the complete reasoning basis of the Tianxuan Mirror, only sporadic data fragments."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan couldn't help but feel a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Luyuan still had great faith in the Tianxuan Mirror's judgment.</p><p></p><p>As the foundation of the operation of the Immortal Alliance, the Tianxuan Mirror received an unimaginable amount of data at all times. If a cultivator, even an existence at the Changsheng realm, wanted to process so much data at the same time, they would probably fall into a state of sluggishness. But the Tianxuan Mirror could not only handle everything perfectly, it could even make predictions about the future to a certain extent based on the information it currently possessed.</p><p></p><p>But for these "things that have not happened", apart from knowing them himself, the Tianxuan Mirror could not give any suggestions or take any measures.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Sun Luyuan was also very puzzled about this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, it was only during one of his conversations with the Mirror Holder Fu that he comprehended the mystery within.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance is ruled by people, not by the mirror. No matter how extraordinary it is, it's just an artifact. If it could make all kinds of decisions without our consent, then where would that leave us? Once this precedent is set, won't the Immortal Alliance be in chaos?"</p><p></p><p>"As for why even its judgments cannot be trusted lightly..."</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Holder Fu was silent for a long time, and said faintly, "No major chaos can arise in the Xuanhuang Realm. No matter what happens, it cannot shake the position of our group of people."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror's judgment is a purely rational inference. Long ago, we also tried to use more of the Tianxuan Mirror's abilities to better manage the Immortal Alliance. But..."</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Holder Fu paused, "Hehe, it actually made suggestions about us."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to just be an honest 'artifact'."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan understood that the group of people who actually ruled the Immortal Alliance would never allow the Tianxuan Mirror to surpass them. They always had to keep the power firmly in their own hands. Moreover, the Tianxuan Mirror was ultimately an artifact, and whether it could be completely trusted was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Sun Luyuan's heart, which was originally eager to act, calmed down again.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance has ruled for so many years and has deep roots. Its foundation is even more profound than one can imagine. Moreover, with the Venerable Chuanfa suppressing everything, how could it be so easily shaken?" Thinking this way, Sun Luyuan couldn't help but feel incredulous at the thought that had just surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"However, there are no absolutes in all things."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the various things he had seen in the daily operation of the Immortal Alliance, it invisibly struck a blow to his confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Let's observe for now. The Great Qi Dynasty of the Sacred Court..."</p><p></p><p>"If it really has that momentum, it won't be too late to make a decision then."</p><p></p><p>After all, as the head of the family, his every move was related to hundreds of people.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The nature of the family's life and death must be treated with the utmost caution.</p><p></p><p>After deeply suppressing the relevant information in his mind, Sun Luyuan immediately began to worry about his younger brother's situation.</p><p></p><p>His painful expression just now truly made Sun Luyuan quite concerned.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I'm fine. For you, for the Sun family, I can hold on a little longer." Sun Luyao said with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's heart trembled. Despite having thousands of words to say, they all turned into silence when they reached his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, brother, you just said that Lord Fu's mission requirement this time is to find the human avatar of the Tianxuan Mirror? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The underground chamber was quiet for a long time, and it was finally broken by Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Sun Luyuan begin to explain: "Lord Fu discovered that another mirror holder, Cang, seems to be secretly plotting something. Cang belongs to the radical faction among the mirror holders and has always advocated for stricter restrictive measures on the Tianxuan Mirror. But recently, his attitude has become somewhat shaken."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Fu judged that Cang's abnormality may be related to the avatar of the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao seemed to have some difficulty understanding: "...How was this deduced?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shook his head: "That I don't know. Maybe Lord Fu knows something else that he didn't make clear to me."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just an unfounded speculation, since he has already issued the order, we must go and complete it anyway."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, he also knows that this matter is extremely difficult, so he hasn't been too demanding."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Sun Luyao: "It's just that you'll have to suffer again."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he said in a low voice: "Then let's begin. While my condition is still good."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's expression was complex as he nodded, then took out a small Tianxuan Mirror from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>It faced the Boundless Black Mirror from afar.</p><p></p><p>An invisible stance suddenly descended upon the underground chamber, and a passage seemed to form between the two mirrors. Countless shadows intermingled with wisps of green light were sucked into the Boundless Black Mirror along the passage.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's blurry figure began to become increasingly unstable.</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards the Tianxuan Mirror revealed an uncontrollable greed. However, in an instant, he forcibly suppressed this greed.</p><p></p><p>Amidst his constantly changing complexion, more and more information was being absorbed by the small Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was somewhat nervously monitoring the changes in the field at all times.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the timing was about the same as before, he had the intention to put away the small Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Because the longer the duration of each glimpse into the Tianxuan Mirror, the higher the possibility of being discovered by it. One long attempt was not as safe as multiple attempts.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Sun Luyao's words made his mind tremble.</p><p></p><p>"A human avatar, there really is such a thing."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, give me a little more time! I've already found some clues!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect it to go so smoothly this time, making Sun Luyuan feel somewhat ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>However, upon second thought, he wondered if this was an excuse made up by his younger brother to devour more.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had done such things before.</p><p></p><p>"Trust me, brother!"</p><p></p><p>The mental connection between biological brothers made Sun Luyao take the initiative to speak, dispelling Sun Luyuan's doubts.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan gritted his teeth, but in the end, he still didn't put away the small Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>There are about twenty more minutes left in the chapter.</p>

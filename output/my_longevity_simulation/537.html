        <h1>Chapter 537</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Li Fan's mind, Emperor Yi's words kept echoing.</p><p></p><p>With the ability to restart almost infinitely because of "Huan Zhen," he could understand the meaning behind the words more than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>And suddenly, there was a surge in Li Fan's heart. He had a premonition that there seemed to be some deeper secret hidden in these words.</p><p></p><p>Related to his future, or perhaps to "Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>But just like looking at flowers through mist, he could not see the full picture at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell into a self-induced brainstorm, while the child Emperor Yi remained silent after speaking.</p><p></p><p>After being stared at by her eyes, Xu Ke couldn't help but shudder and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Although he was usually fearless, he became aware of the danger in his words and didn't dare to continue questioning.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, perhaps to break the awkward silence, he chuckled and changed the subject, "Right, since 'Emperor Yi' is you..." Xu Ke tapped his head as if he had just remembered something, took out a crimson wooden box, and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>"This was brought here by Brother Lu Ya for me. He didn't say who specifically to give it to, but since you are the boss here, then there should be no problem in giving it to you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke looked at Emperor Yi and said with some relief.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..."</p><p></p><p>As Emperor Yi's gaze passed over the wooden box, a hint of seriousness appeared on her small face. There was a flash of black brilliance in her hand, and in an instant, she broke the seal on it.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>A monstrous aura accompanied by a resentful and furious roar suddenly soared out of the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>The murderous aura seemed substantial, forming a tornado.</p><p></p><p>Endless blood rushed out as if in a shockwave, sweeping around.</p><p></p><p>In a trance, a figure of a fierce monster roaring could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke, who was not prepared at all, was scared and fell to the ground immediately.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, who was lost in thought, was also startled by this horrifying scene.</p><p></p><p>His feathers stood on end as if facing a mortal enemy, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the small hand of the child Emperor Yi curved slightly to form an extremely strong cage.</p><p></p><p>Locking and controlling the murderous aura within it.</p><p></p><p>No matter how it struggled, it couldn't break free.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you die, you can't change your foul temper." Emperor Yi snorted coldly, and a dim black light appeared in her hand.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, as if sensing Emperor Yi's presence, the monstrous creature inside the wooden box gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The roar became quieter and eventually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the shaken Xu Ke and Li Fan finally saw what was inside the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>It was the furious glare of a beast's head, with eyes wide open and unblinking.</p><p></p><p>It was covered with cracks like broken porcelain, with wounds oozing blood and flesh still wriggling at the wound. It seemed like the beast had not completely breathed its last.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke, who had been entrusted by Senior Lu Ya to transport it to the Southern Ming Demon Mountain, was instantly pale at the sight of this unexpected item.</p><p></p><p>He quickly waved his hands, explaining, "It wasn't me!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi was immediately stunned and then burst into a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even if you say you killed it, no one in this world would believe you."</p><p></p><p>"The master of hunting and killing demonic beasts, known as the 'Emperor Erli'..."</p><p></p><p>"There are not many beings that can kill it. You are definitely not one of them."</p><p></p><p>There was not much grief or anger on Emperor Yi's face. After a calm explanation, she carefully stared at the head of the 'Emperor Erli,' as if studying or looking for something.</p><p></p><p>"'Emperor Erli'?" Xu Ke, who had cleared his suspicion, did not relax but was even more alarmed.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed hard, "It's the second one, so isn't it even stronger than Grandpa San? How did it end up like this..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke subconsciously glanced at the head in the wooden box, finding it difficult to ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>From Emperor Yi's words earlier, it could be inferred that this 'Emperor Erli' was probably the strongest member of the demonic beast clan besides Emperor Yi.</p><p></p><p>In terms of human cultivator realms, it should be comparable to the Eternal Life Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, its head had been cut off...</p><p></p><p>Who did it?</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a singular and independent figure emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Was it him?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Xu Ke exchanged a glance, seemingly coming to a realization.</p><p></p><p>While they were figuring out the mastermind, Emperor Yi seemed to have found some clues at the wounds of the head.</p><p></p><p>"The skilled warrior will eventually perish in battle."</p><p></p><p>"I warned you many times, but you didn't listen. Now, ending up like this is your own fault."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi's face was stern, her tone icy.</p><p></p><p>Faint roars seemed to come from the head of 'Emperor Erli,' seemingly responding resentfully.</p><p></p><p>"Come back."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi suddenly said something inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>And then, something horrifying happened that made Xu Ke shudder.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi placed her hand on the head of 'Emperor Erli,' and her originally childlike, fair hand began to swell and distort.</p><p></p><p>Chunks of flesh, like black sludge, surged out from Emperor Yi's hand, engulfing and devouring the head of 'Emperor Erli.'</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously, Xu Ke pulled Li Fan and took a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>Away from the seemingly harmless child Emperor Yi.</p><p></p><p>Within a few breaths, the flowing black flesh cloud was drawn back.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi returned to her original innocent appearance.</p><p></p><p>And the head of 'Emperor Erli' disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for bringing back this dummy."</p><p></p><p>"If it's not for several tens of thousands of years, I won't let him leave again."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke awkwardly scratched his head, momentarily unsure of what to say.</p><p></p><p>"I understand Emperor San's intentions too..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yi glanced at Xu Ke and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Rather than blaming, she calmly said.</p><p></p><p>Her belly suddenly bulged, quickly growing several times larger than her current child body, seemingly harboring something that kept rolling back and forth.</p><p></p><p>"Splat!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of flesh tearing came from her body, and before long, a round creature detached and fell out from her.</p><p></p><p>"Take this little guy back and give it to Lu Ya."</p><p></p><p>"He knows what to do with it."</p><p></p><p>Transformed back into a child, Emperor Yi looked at Xu Ke, fell silent for a moment, and then suddenly spoke, "This is the task you brought for 'Emperor Erli.'"</p><p></p><p></p>

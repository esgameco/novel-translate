            <p>Chapter 1095: The Swallowing of the Dharma King by Darkness</p><p></p><p>"From now on, we are one entity."</p><p></p><p>"If anyone discovers that the three people who fell behind want to return, report it immediately. Then, everyone will strike them down together."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, do not trust anyone who comes back from the darkness. Even if they were once your closest companion."</p><p></p><p>On the cautious path forward, the members of the Immortal Alliance reiterated the prohibition.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, through communicating with Dharma Transmitter Zhou, Li Fan also learned about the origin of this Dark Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the Immortal Ruins, the Xuanhuang Realm was constantly affected by an extremely vast suction force.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, if not stopped, everything in the Xuanhuang Realm would slowly fall into the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance once believed this.</p><p></p><p>But the discovery of the Dark Abyss shattered this perception. </p><p></p><p>The Dark Abyss is a collection of all worldly matter that goes against the direction of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Although it is still a part of the Xuanhuang Realm, it has its own unique rules here.</p><p></p><p>In addition to what was mentioned before, divine sense and sound cannot leave the body.</p><p></p><p>Lost cultivators will have their minds taken by unknown existences in the darkness. They become something else.</p><p></p><p>Yet they themselves cannot perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"This... seems somewhat similar to Mo Rubin's possession technique?" Li Fan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. But it's just that the characteristics are a bit similar, that's all. It doesn't indicate anything."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou seemed to intentionally avoid this topic and continued, "Since the discovery of this place, the Immortal Alliance has attached great importance to it internally. Because of the Dark Abyss' characteristic of going against the Immortal Ruins, it may be possible to find a way to break free from the Immortal Ruins by studying it. But previously, only the few core Dharma Transmitters knew about it."</p><p></p><p>"That Xuantian Sect's Dharma King once occupied the bodies of Chen and the others, so he also learned about the existence of this place."</p><p></p><p>"The Dark Tribe people do not live in the Dark Abyss, but they were the first to discover how to open the Dark Abyss and master the use of the power of darkness. It was only when we conquered the small worlds where the Dark Tribe people lived and clashed with them that we discovered this secret."</p><p></p><p>"The power of darkness? Could it be a completely different existence from Immortal Spiritual Power?" Li Fan asked pensively.</p><p></p><p>"That's not the case. After years of observation, we found that the power of darkness also fully possesses certain characteristics of Immortal Spiritual Power. But..." Dharma Transmitter Zhou paused, as if searching for the right descriptive language.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Spiritual Power and the power of darkness. They are like a person and their shadow."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, the two should have been indistinguishable and mutually integrated. But due to the existence of the Immortal Ruins, the power of darkness was forcibly separated from it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan vaguely understood.</p><p></p><p>Just like a centrifuge separating different components from a liquid.</p><p></p><p>Because of its characteristic of going against the Immortal Ruins, the power of darkness also converged in the opposite direction while the entire Xuanhuang Realm gradually fell into the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>"The suction force of the Immortal Ruins is due to the existence of the character 'Hunger'."</p><p></p><p>"Then what exactly is this power of darkness? How can it resist the power of a True Immortal character?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"If you observe carefully, you should also be able to perceive it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Dharma transmitter Zhou reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately frowned and sensed the gloom surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>After a while...</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that this is like the regular rhythm of water ripples?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. We discovered Mo Rubin's aura at the source of this rhythm. However..."</p><p></p><p>The tone of the Dharma transmitter Zhou became somewhat uncertain: "He has been here for probably more than ten days. Yet, he has never changed his position. It's as if he has lost consciousness due to serious injuries."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a trap?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"No." The Dharma transmitter Zhou said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's a trap... with so many of us coming this time, we are not afraid of a mere ancient immortal practitioner."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Dharma transmitter Zhou so confident, Li Fan did not speak up to refute.</p><p></p><p>Without anyone communicating, the surroundings once again fell into a terrifying silence.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful and stay alert, we're almost there."</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the Dharma transmitter Zhou's reminder came.</p><p></p><p>Locking onto the direction from which the rhythm came from afar, the Immortal Alliance members formed an encirclement circle according to the instructions.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding Mo Rubin, who was hidden in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Just waiting for an order, they would attack him together.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan also received constant reminders from the Yayizhen formation.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really Mo Rubin?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but be a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Strange..."</p><p></p><p>Although there were still doubts in his heart, Li Fan did not act on his own.</p><p></p><p>He just followed the actions of the Immortal Alliance members and gradually reduced the hunting circle.</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath and waited, but Mo Rubin never made any response.</p><p></p><p>It remained so until the Immortal Alliance cultivators finally arrived in front of him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Stand down."</p><p></p><p>"He seems to be dead."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Dharma transmitter Zhou came with a hint of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>A chill suddenly surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Following the bodies of the Immortal Alliance cultivators, he arrived at the center.</p><p></p><p>The moment he touched Mo Rubin's body, his divine sense also perceived his current specific appearance.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's face had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only a mass of darkness, constantly separating and merging. Surging on his head.</p><p></p><p>This scene was indescribably bizarre, but what made Li Fan feel even more horrified was Mo Rubin's body.</p><p></p><p>Half of it was still a human body.</p><p></p><p>But the other half seemed to be occupied by the darkness here.</p><p></p><p>Constantly transforming between darkness and physical form.</p><p></p><p>Under the probing of the Immortal Alliance's black-clothed death soldiers, it was confirmed that the darkness engulfing half of Mo Rubin's body was not an illusion.</p><p></p><p>But the flesh was really disappearing and reappearing in constant change.</p><p></p><p>When the darkness appeared and a hand reached out to touch it, what was felt was a void.</p><p></p><p>But after a while, when the physical body reappeared.</p><p></p><p>The darkness suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Along with it, the hand of the death soldier that had reached into the darkness also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The darkness seemed to be able to spread like an infection, and that black-clothed death soldier couldn't make a sound.</p><p></p><p>He was engulfed by the darkness that surged from his own hand.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Dharma transmitter Zhou decisively cut off the connection with the death soldier at the first moment and ordered to execute him immediately.</p><p></p><p>This prevented the spread of darkness among the Immortal Alliance members.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what are your thoughts?" The Dharma transmitter Zhou asked with a somewhat heavy tone.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Li Fan slowly said, "The darkness on Mo Rubin's corpse seems to be different from that in the Dark Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"The one on the corpse is infectious, while the one in the surrounding environment is not."</p><p></p><p>"Before figuring out the reality of this place, it's best to avoid touching it as much as possible."</p>

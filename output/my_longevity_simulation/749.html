        <h1>Chapter 749</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"This feeling...it's so wondrous."</p><p>The young lady's tone became somewhat dreamy: "It's like looking at another version of myself in the mirror, and I can't help but feel a sense of closeness."  </p><p>"Master Qing, what is going on here exactly?"</p><p>Seeing the young lady's affirmative response, Xiao Qing's eyes also flashed with disbelief.</p><p>"Could it be that..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was of course unaware of what was happening on the other side of the wall. </p><p>At this moment, his mind was completely immersed in the epiphany about the sword intent of the red rope.</p><p>As his understanding deepened, the red rope suppressing the black flesh seemed to come alive. It floated lightly beside Xu Bai, coiling around him affectionately.</p><p>After who knows how long, Xu Bai suddenly opened his eyes and flicked his finger.</p><p>An imperceptible red light flashed from his hand, then shot out twisted towards the flesh ahead.</p><p>The wailing sounds echoing in the temple instantly fell silent.</p><p>Though they soon resumed moments later.</p><p>But such an anomaly still left the woman in the gauze dress behind Xu Bai utterly shocked.</p><p>"Sir..." she couldn't help but inquire.</p><p>However, Xu Bai raised his hand to stop her question, only looking at the trace of blood that had somehow appeared on his wrist.</p><p>For a Xinfa Yuantai cultivator, even wounds from swords and blades would heal in an instant. But this minor cut seemed innate, unable to dissipate.</p><p>"So there are such severe side effects," Xu Bai couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p>"It seems Xu Ke's disappearance back then may also be related to his repeated use of the Red Rope Sword Art."</p><p>"The wooden sword contains all the sword principles of the world, yet cannot strike first."</p><p>"The rope sword has unmatched killing intent, yet requires risking one's life."</p><p>A flash of light shone in Xu Bai's eyes: "So they both have their limitations. Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Bai visited the remaining eight temples one by one.</p><p>Besides deepening his understanding of the Red Rope Sword Art, he also saw the three unblinking skulls of the Crimson Nine-Headed Beast.</p><p>One skull had its hair, flesh, and eyeballs completely excavated by the imperial people, leaving only a mottled white cranium.</p><p>But the other two still appeared lifelike, as if they had just died.</p><p>Even without getting close, one could sense the boundless murderous aura and resentment emanating from them.</p><p>"What an evil beast!"</p><p>"A thousand years after death, its ferocity remains undiminished. I can't imagine how vicious it must have been at its peak when the White Ancestor, who slew it with just a red rope, was alive..."</p><p>Xu Bai's mind wandered.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his tour, Xu Bai returned to the palace tower.</p><p>Seeing the veiled woman sitting beside Xiao Qing, Xu Bai felt an inexplicable sense of connection.</p><p>He tried raising his right hand.</p><p>To his surprise, the veiled woman simultaneously raised her right hand as well, completely in sync without any prior agreement.</p><p>It was as if there was a mirror between them.</p><p>Aside from some differences in appearance, the veiled woman was almost like himself.</p><p>"The Sacred Blood Reincarnation Technique," Xu Bai realized the reason for this phenomenon in an instant. </p><p>He also knew the identity of the veiled woman before him.</p><p>The Imperial Princess.</p><p>The descendant of Xu Ke, the nominal ruler of the empire.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He obviously could not reveal it.</p><p>Pretending to be extremely surprised, he suddenly stood up, pointed at the Empress, and exclaimed in a loud voice, "What is this all about?"</p><p>Qing carefully observed every expression on Xu Bai's face, trying to find some flaws in it. But she was disappointed.</p><p>Xu Bai's performance was almost identical to the Empress's.</p><p>"It seems he is also unaware of his true identity," Qing thought.</p><p>"What do you mean, fellow Daoist?" However, she still decided to probe further, and asked knowingly.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai seemed to have recovered somewhat from his initial shock. He stared at the Empress, his eyes filled with deep confusion.</p><p>"Who is this? Although I'm meeting her for the first time, I feel a strong sense of closeness and familiarity with her."</p><p>"It's not an illusion. I have the same feeling," the Empress replied softly.</p><p>Xu Bai seemed even more shaken by this.</p><p>Qing looked at him for a long time before speaking. Instead of answering, she asked, "Fellow Daoist Xu, how much do you know about your own origins?"</p><p>"Origins?" Xu Bai was taken aback.</p><p>"I'm just an ordinary mortal. I used to live in a small world. Later, by chance, I joined the Alliance of Myriad Realms and embarked on the immortal path. My close blood relatives have long since passed away..."</p><p>"What, is there something wrong with my origins?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p>Qing looked into Xu Bai's eyes, as if trying to discern the truth in his words.</p><p>After a long silence, she finally gave up.</p><p>Then Qing took out a portrait, and the figure in the painting was almost identical to Xu Bai.</p><p>"This is..." Xu Bai continued to play dumb.</p><p>"This is the Founder of the Empire, and also my master. His name is Xu Ke," Qing said in a somber tone.</p><p>"Many years ago, he bid farewell to everyone and disappeared without a trace."</p><p>Xu Bai stared at the portrait, as if stunned by this weighty information, standing there motionless.</p><p>After a long while, he slowly spoke, "He also has the surname Xu. Could it be that I might be a descendant of Xu Ke?"</p><p>"At the moment, this seems to be the only reasonable explanation," Qing's tone also had some uncertainty.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xu, where exactly is your hometown, in which small world? Based on my understanding of the master, he doesn't seem like the type to marry and have children..."</p><p>"My hometown is in..." Xu Bai started to say, but suddenly stopped.</p><p>Coming to his senses, he took the initiative to accuse. Looking at Qing and the Empress, he was full of suspicion: "Fellow Daoist Qing, are you trying to trick me like a child? Such a coincidence?"</p><p>"Tell me, what are you two up to?"</p><p>Xu Bai looked at Qing coldly.</p><p>Faced with Xu Bai's sudden change in attitude, Qing was also momentarily stunned.</p><p>Then she let out a bitter laugh: "To be honest, I also find it hard to believe. But everything is just so coincidental. It's as if it was destined, that I would meet you thousands of years later, after I had already given up."</p><p>"As for whether what I said is true or not, there is a way to test it."</p><p>Qing then gave the Empress a signal with her eyes.</p><p>The Empress took out a scepter and lightly tapped the ground.</p><p>Suddenly, a hole appeared in the floor, and the three of them were instantly swallowed into it.</p><p>Xu Bai did not resist, and soon found himself in a vast, endless space.</p><p>There were rows and rows of the corpses of different strange beasts.</p><p>Even further away, there seemed to be various kinds of mechanical devices.</p><p>Xu Bai wanted to move forward, but found an invisible barrier blocking his path.</p><p>"This is the Imperial Treasure Vault, where the Empire's accumulated wealth of thousands of years is stored," Qing said.</p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

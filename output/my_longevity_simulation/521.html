        <h1>Chapter 521</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Due to the deaths of a large number of mortals, the concentration of the fairy plague in the environment skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>In order to cope, before their departure, the Season Sect Leader rewarded the two with various abundant resources including the Creation Purple Gold Dan.</p><p></p><p>But this was not enough to completely alleviate the heavy hearts of the two.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the news that the "fairy plague" could be contracted multiple times, they knew that even with sufficient preparation and protection in place, they would inevitably be infected with that weird disease again under constant contact.</p><p></p><p>The various pains of being infected a month before were still vivid in their minds.</p><p></p><p>As practitioners, they hadn’t felt this living hell for a long time.</p><p></p><p>If the continuous repetition happened time and time again...</p><p></p><p>The taste of it might be better off with a direct death.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just a momentary burst of anger.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie and Li Fan were both individuals who were dedicated to the Dao, seeking longevity, how could they easily give up their own lives?</p><p></p><p>But one cannot defy the order of their master, even Zhao Shijie, now honored as the Daozi of the Daodao Sect, could only obediently follow commands.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is quite strange. I have asked around, although the other ten sects also send disciples to travel the world, most of them are in the level of true transmission. I have never heard of any sect, like our Daodao Sect, sending out Daozis of this level!" Li Fan shook his head slightly, full of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Sister-in-law, you are the next candidate for the Sect Leader, how noble. In this troubled autumn, what you should do the most is to stay in the mountain gate to cultivate hard and improve your own cultivation, rather than undertake such inexplicable tasks. If in case..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at the other person and continued, "I mean, in case something happens to you, and you fall, how much would it cost the sect to cultivate a new Daozi?"</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't all the resources invested in you before go to waste?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Leader's decision this time is truly hard to understand. Moreover, none of the elders had any objections..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie glanced at Li Fan and said calmly, "Junior Brother, you are overthinking. The Daodao Sect, as the leader of the fairy gates, sending out Daozis is a way of showing importance to this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Her voice suddenly lowered, "Junior Brother, perhaps your speculation was right in the past. But now..."</p><p></p><p>"The times have changed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was suddenly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Yes. He was still immersed in the past prosperous era of cultivating immortality, and his mindset had not changed.</p><p></p><p>In today's world of cultivation, it was like a different world.</p><p></p><p>For example, with Daozis, the faster their cultivation increased, in the eyes of the elders of the sect, it was considered a threat.</p><p></p><p>In the past, one could cultivate together, and if one didn’t want to become the Sect Leader, they could become a senior elder and pass on the position of Sect Leader early.</p><p></p><p>But now, if one didn’t want to become the Sect Leader? Fine, then you couldn't still hold on to the "Execution of Heaven Dao Scripture," right? Please change your sect’s cultivation method!</p><p></p><p>This, no one could bear.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, suppressing the growth of Daozis had become a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the key points, Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The two followed the bloody light and arrived at a wasteland.</p><p></p><p>They remembered that just a few years ago, this was an extremely prosperous mortal city with a population of at least five hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there was no longer any trace of life here.</p><p></p><p>As their divine senses swept through, the ruins were filled with the corpses of mortals everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Men, women, old and young, none were spared. The gruesome scene, even in the most terrifying nightmares, had never been seen.</p><p></p><p>"This is simply outrageous..."</p><p></p><p>Killing intent surged in Zhao Shijie's eyes. While carefully guarding against the continuous spread of the fairy plague below, she cast spells and traced the whereabouts of the culprit.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Zhao Shijie, who had found the tracking target, transformed into a stream of light and flew away quickly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, when Li Fan caught up, he found Zhao Shijie standing in place looking somewhat confused and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the cultivator who had slaughtered the city earlier had already been deeply infected with the fairy plague and had died.</p><p></p><p>With the culprit dead, Zhao Shijie's raging anger could not be vented.</p><p></p><p>“Did they do wrong? If it were us, without so many elixirs to save our lives, in times of life and death, wouldn’t we do the same?” At that moment, Zhao Shijie couldn't help but ask in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was about to answer but noticed a strange phenomenon in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>“Cultivator Qu Xin Feng, cultivated for fifty-six years, achieved the foundation with the ‘Deep Mountain Stone Sword’...”</p><p></p><p>“Now dead and vanished, soaring to the heavens!”</p><p></p><p>While seeing the scene in the sky, a message suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" Li Fan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Zhao Shijie also noticed the bizarre scene in the sky at this time and looked up.</p><p></p><p>She swung out a sword aura, wanting to dissipate that vision.</p><p></p><p>However, the vision seemed to be engraved in the sky, and Zhao Shijie's attack was in vain.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? Is it Heaven's mockery?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Conflict between the Dao and the Immortal Plague.</p><p></p><p>Now with this bizarre "death sentence" appearing, one couldn't imagine what would happen in the future.</p><p></p><p>He sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, Sister. Don't delay here, complete the task sooner, and return to the sect." Li Fan spoke, advising.</p><p></p><p>After some time, Zhao Shijie did not reply.</p><p></p><p>Only after completely destroying the body of Qu Xin Feng, who had caused boundless slaughter but had now fallen, did Zhao Shijie turn into a stream of light and fly away.</p><p></p><p>Over the next two years, the two traversed the entire Xuanhuang Realm, preventing numerous tragedies.</p><p></p><p>While they killed many deranged practitioners, they also saved many mortal lives.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning about the Great Migration Plan, the remaining practitioners gradually calmed down, no longer wanton in the slaughter of mortals.</p><p></p><p>Of course, occasional incidents in some places remained unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>The two were limited in their capabilities and could not reach everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Having fulfilled their Sect Leader's instructions, the two were about to return to the sect as planned.</p><p></p><p>However, a decree caught them off guard.</p><p></p><p>Season Changxi said that the Great Migration Plan had officially begun.</p><p></p><p>They were not to return for the time being.</p><p></p><p>They were to stay in the Xuanhuang Realm, help coordinate the various sects, big and small, and carry out this plan which was crucial for all practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the almost dripping dark expression on Zhao Shijie's face, Li Fan dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing how to console her, he quietly stood by her side.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Zhao Shijie's complexion returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>She smiled gracefully, "Let's go, Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Orders must be obeyed, after all."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, seeing Zhao Shijie's expression at that moment, a kind of indescribable fear quietly emerged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, okay, Sister." He responded cautiously and quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>With the concerted efforts of all the cultivators, the Great Migration Plan was completed.</p><p></p><p>All mortals were driven into hidden realms and small worlds, and the Xuanhuang Realm was cleansed of them.</p>

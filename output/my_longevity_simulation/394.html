        <h1>Chapter 394</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Mountain peaks in the form of stone pillars hung in the air, densely packed like a forest of a thousand needles.</p><p></p><p>Below the floating mountains, there was a terrifying forbidden area completely made up of black and gray. Even flying thousands of feet high in the air at this moment, Li Fan could still feel the unsettling aura coming from below from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the Dust Ferry, Huang Fu Song looked at the scenery below, his expression changing slightly: "It is truly a remote and desolate place."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to this ghostly place, the Flame Incineration Wasteland we saw earlier doesn't seem that dangerous," Li Fan replied.</p><p></p><p>At his words, Li Fan also looked towards the bottom of the deep valley.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of black and grey, he could still see sporadic dark flames that had not been extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, a light breeze would lift a strand of black from the sea of grey, causing it to flutter and rise, colliding with the Dust Ferry where Li Fan was.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly weightless black and grey, upon collision with the Dust Ferry's protective barrier, caused a violent shake.</p><p></p><p>As if hit by a tremendous force, a small hole appeared in the red light barrier.</p><p></p><p>Then, ripples spread out in succession towards all directions.</p><p></p><p>Even though only a small part of his mind was controlling his body, Li Fan was still surprised by the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "What kind of thing is this black and grey stuff?!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song first guided the Dust Ferry to fly upwards to avoid the rising black and grey below the deep valley, then explained, "This is the remnant of the 【Final Silencing Flames】 after burning. All life energy has vanished, leaving only the power of extinction that lingers without dispersing."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite eerie, it's better to avoid it if possible."</p><p></p><p>Before his words could finish, the Dust Ferry accelerated, heading towards the central area of Linyin Province.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the seemingly endless world of black silence and extinction below, Huang Fu Song couldn't help but feel emotional, "Fortunately, by using tens of thousands of mountains as a formation, we managed to confine the 【Final Silencing Flames】 within the Linyin Province. Otherwise, the surrounding areas would have suffered the same fate."</p><p></p><p>"【Final Silencing Flames】?" The pervasive aura of black and grey made the exhausted Li Fan feel increasingly uncomfortable, frowning and pondering to himself.</p><p></p><p>The name seemed familiar to him.</p><p></p><p>Within his consciousness, the Dao patterns of stone shimmered and after a moment, fragments of words he had read in the past suddenly surfaced.</p><p></p><p>"In the ninth year after the disappearance of the mountains and rivers of Cangwu Prefecture, black fire in the form of water flowed out of the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"The fierce flames raged on, unable to be extinguished. People called it the 【Final Silencing Flames】."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then asked, "Is it the black fire that emerged from the abyss of Cangwu Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song was slightly startled, then squinted his eyes as if recollecting something.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he nodded, "Yes. After the Final 【Silencing Flames】 emerged from the Cangwu Abyss, it spread out to the surrounding areas."</p><p></p><p>"Several provinces in a row were affected. It wasn't until here in Linyin Province that it was contained."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was suddenly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Cangwu Prefecture was in the southwest corner of the Xuanyellow Realm, while Linyin Province was almost directly south.</p><p></p><p>The range of devastation caused by the Final Silencing Flames seemed to be quite large.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry. Since that time, the Final Silencing Flames have not reappeared."</p><p></p><p>"The cause of this world-ending calamity is still a mystery."</p><p></p><p>"At first, the alliance thought it was the Five Elders' doing. But after on-site investigations, it was denied."</p><p></p><p>"That is the true power of the heavens and the earth, perhaps beyond the reach of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song shared his insights with Li Fan while joking around.</p><p></p><p>Later, they reached their destination half a day later.</p><p></p><p>"Before inspecting the Soul-Locking Array, let's visit the main official of Linyin Province who resides here first."</p><p></p><p>"This senior was originally a cultivator from Tianyu Prefecture and has taken care of me in the past. Now that we are here, we cannot neglect the proper etiquette."</p><p></p><p>Pointing to a mountain peak piercing through the clouds in the distance, Huang Fu Song said to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts turned, and he already guessed who the senior Huang Fu Song was referring to.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, the former Commander of the Tianyu Prefecture Garrison, Master Guan Xingxiu?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song nodded with a smile, then put away the Dust Ferry and led the group to fly towards a small courtyard at the top of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"All acquaintances, no need to be so formal. Come in, I won't personally greet you, young man!" A voice sounded from afar, reaching everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" Huang Fu Song smiled and responded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>He gestured for the other cultivators to wait at the door, while only taking Li Fan with him as they walked into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was quite simple, with only a single pine tree standing alone.</p><p></p><p>Holding a palm-leaf fan, it occasionally waved a few times.</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see, Senior, you still look as gallant as ever!" Huang Fu Song bowed in respect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also followed, saying, "Greetings, Senior Guan!"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard about you, Li Fan," Guan Xingxiu assessed Li Fan, a playful look in his eyes. "Your fighting spirit is much stronger than mine."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was taken aback, chuckling as he replied, "Haha, Senior is flattering me."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Fu Song also interjected, "Although Li Fan is very tenacious, he still falls short compared to Senior. Everyone knows the prowess of cultivators from Tianyu Prefecture..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Guan Xingxiu interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, a hero doesn't boast of past glories. In my present impoverished state, you are here glorifying my past achievements. What is your intention?" Guan Xingxiu glanced at Huang Fu Song with a displeased expression.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly hitting a sore spot while trying to flatter, Huang Fu Song awkwardly said, "Senior, you know me."</p><p></p><p>"I dare not oppose you even if I were given the courage."</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu coldly snorted but then his face returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"I was just jesting. Since arriving here, it has been a long time since I've seen old acquaintances. It's not bad that you came to visit."</p><p></p><p>"I understand your intentions, go ahead and do so boldly."</p><p></p><p>"With me here, this three-acre plot of Linyin Province won't be turned upside down."</p><p></p><p>With that, Guan Xingxiu lightly waved the palm-leaf fan, and a small golden sword suddenly appeared, flying into Huang Fu Song's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Coincidentally, I haven't appeared in front of everyone for a long time. I want to see if anyone really dares to test whether my sword is sharp."</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song was overjoyed and quickly said, "Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, yes..." Putting away the golden flying sword, Huang Fu Song wanted to say something more.</p><p></p><p>But he was stopped by Guan Xingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"I have seriously considered Senior Ji's advice. But now I am only a Nascent Soul cultivator, so going there won't be of much help."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the previous leadership has passed away, and the position of Supreme Commander has been settled."</p><p></p><p>"I have no intention of competing for anything anymore."</p><p></p><p>"You may go now!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Guan Xingxiu waved his palm-leaf fan.</p>

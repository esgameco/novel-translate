        <h1>Chapter 482</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sikong Yihé and Baili Chen cautiously surveyed their surroundings to ensure that no one was following them before entering the hidden cave they had built.</p><p></p><p>The interior was not spacious and quite rudimentary.</p><p></p><p>Despite this, Sikong Yihé felt especially relieved being there.</p><p></p><p>Baili Chen stood guard at the entrance, being cautious.</p><p></p><p>As for Sikong Yihé, he was completely relaxed, lying on the bed, contemplating his future plans.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, the anomaly at the center of the Cloud Mist Sea should be a precursor to the manifestation of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace in this world."</p><p></p><p>"And the 'Cloud Water Chart Scriptures' should be in this ancient ruin."</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand contribution points."</p><p></p><p>A glint of desire flashed in Sikong Yihé's eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, a moment of hesitation followed.</p><p></p><p>"There should be successors of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace still alive. If I were to disguise myself as a disciple and were to be discovered..."</p><p></p><p>At the thought of this, Sikong Yihé felt a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Recently, his avatar cultivating the 'Sea-settling Divine Sword' suddenly sensed that someone else was practicing the same technique in a certain position within the Cloud Mist Sea.</p><p></p><p>This Golden Core technique was something he had obtained from the remnants of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace disciples.</p><p></p><p>In the present world, besides him, there should be no one else who knew about it.</p><p></p><p>Yet, such an incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>His first reaction was that there must still be successors of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace alive.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he intended to follow this sense to investigate. But the closer he got to the destination, the stronger the unease in his heart became.</p><p></p><p>Going there would mean a dead end!</p><p></p><p>Arriving at this conclusion, Sikong Yihé was frightened and immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, he decided to temporarily let go of the 'Sea-settling Divine Sword' technique and only focus on his cultivation, remaining within his Dantian.</p><p></p><p>Under this influence, the strength of his avatar significantly decreased.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he became increasingly cautious in his actions, avoiding going out unnecessarily and staying as much as possible in the Celestial Mirror and this hidden cave.</p><p></p><p>Now, as the day of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace's opening approached, his thoughts gradually became active.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand contribution points, a hundred thousand contribution points..."</p><p></p><p>He murmured to himself constantly, and gradually, a hint of determination flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That old turtle Taiyi is muddled; I must hurry to him first. Then, I will re-cultivate the 'Sea-settling Divine Sword,' disguise myself as a disciple of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace, deceive them, and obtain the Cloud Water Chart Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>"After leaving the Cloud Water Celestial Palace, I will quickly revert to my original cultivation level and go to the Celestial Mirror to claim the rewards. This way, even if that successor senses something amiss and tries to find me, he should be too late."</p><p></p><p>"All I have to do is be faster than him."</p><p></p><p>"Fortune favors the bold!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling determined, Sikong Yihé let out a long sigh, about to enjoy a good sleep, as a way of boosting his energy before the upcoming adventure.</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly noticed some movement outside the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yihé's expression changed abruptly, and he quickly got up, arriving at the entrance along with his avatar, both on high alert.</p><p></p><p>"Is Baili friend here?" </p><p></p><p>One sentence caused Sikong Yihé's heart to skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? How does he know my identity, and even the location of this cave?" </p><p></p><p>In an instant, various figures flashed through Sikong Yihé's mind, but each was dismissed.</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Sikong Yihé and Baili Chen remained silent and instead took out their artifacts from their storage rings, secretly gathering their strength.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the lack of response, the voice outside spoke again, "Hehe, Baili friend, don't worry, I mean no harm."</p><p></p><p>"I've come uninvited this time just for the ten thousand contribution points from the Cloud Water Chart Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sikong Yihé's heart shook dramatically. The artifact in his hand almost slipped off due to his changing expressions. After much contemplation, he finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>The other person smiled, "Baili friend, no need to play dumb. Do you really think that besides you, no one else in this world knows the secrets of the 'Sea-settling Divine Sword'?"</p><p></p><p>Finally confirming that the other party was not playing tricks, Sikong Yihé remained silent for a long time before asking in a deep voice, "What do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"What do I want? This question." The other party chuckled, "Naturally, I want to get a share. Who wouldn't be envious of ten thousand contribution points?"</p><p></p><p>Learning about the other party's intentions, Sikong Yihé actually felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>After a long discussion and exchange between the three, Sikong Yihé eventually learned the whole story.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that this person had secretly observed the battle where his avatar had used the 'Sea-settling Divine Sword' against someone.</p><p></p><p>Although this man's cultivation level wasn't high, he had broad knowledge and had studied numerous classics. He had recognized this technique from the Cloud Water Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the abnormal sight at the center of the Cloud Mist Sea had also caught his attention. After observing it on-site for a while, he inferred that this was a sign of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace's imminent appearance.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, considering the task that promised a reward of ten thousand contribution points, he thought that with Baili Chen's inheritance from the Cloud Water Celestial Palace, he would certainly be able to retrieve the Cloud Water Chart Scriptures from the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he had been secretly following and visited.</p><p></p><p>"It's my own ability to obtain the Cloud Water Chart Scriptures; why should I share with you!" Sikong Yihé said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, friend, don't joke. You wouldn't want news of you obtaining the inheritance of an ancient sect to spread throughout the Cloud Mist Sea, right?" Han Wuyou rubbed his beard and a flash of coldness appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>With a rising sense of murderous intent in Sikong Yihé, just then, he heard the man say again, "However, I won't take advantage of you for nothing."</p><p></p><p>"You have your path to wealth, and I have my way to the sky."</p><p></p><p>"If you generously share a portion of the ten thousand contribution points with me, then I have a clear path to share with you."</p><p></p><p>"The three of us working together, with ten thousand contribution points, is just the beginning!"</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yihé was intrigued, "Explain it clearly!"</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou smiled slightly, "Our strengths are meager. Even if we acquire ten thousand contribution points, it will soon be depleted if we don't use it wisely. Isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Sikong Yihé nodded and said, "Indeed, it is slow to earn contribution points at the Foundation Building stage. But once I break through to the Foundation Establishment stage..."</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou waved his hand, "What about at the Foundation Establishment stage? Aren't Foundation Builders in the Cloud Mist Sea struggling every day just to accumulate those meager contribution points? It would take more than a decade or two, even without eating or drinking, to accumulate ten thousand contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"What can you do then?" Sikong Yihé felt somewhat defiant.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou lifted his head slightly, looking proud, "Have you heard of Master Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yihé was momentarily puzzled, then suddenly his body shuddered, "Are you talking about that Ancient Heaven Mechanism Sect cultivator who is extremely adept at calculating and is as wealthy as a country?"</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou nodded, proudly continuing, "Exactly! I am friends with Master Li..."</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment before continuing, "Fan, Ho Zhenghao, Ho Senior, we have some connections!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 703</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Powerful cultivators in the world of cultivating immortality can easily move mountains and seas. However, creating mountains and rivers out of thin air is much more difficult, the extent of which is unknown.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators seem to be able to achieve this, but in reality, they are simply moving water and earth from elsewhere in the world to another place.</p><p></p><p>However, what Xu Bai did in the world of beast races was different.</p><p></p><p>It was like creating a masterpiece effortlessly, creating things out of nothing.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was like changing the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>As powerful cultivators of the Dao, Liu San and Fang Zaiji could see this clearly.</p><p></p><p>In the world of beast races, the sudden appearance of mountains, rivers, and trees was originally not within the natural evolution range of this small world's heavenly principles.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai forcefully rewrote the rules of nature, causing corresponding changes to occur.</p><p></p><p>This not only involved purely material aspects but also involved changes in fundamental laws.</p><p></p><p>As the rumbling in the world of beast races gradually calmed down, Xu Bai awoke from his enlightenment in the complex gazes of Liu San and Fang Zaiji.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the gazes focused on him, Xu Bai was slightly puzzled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he keenly noticed the changes in the mountains and rivers of the world of beast races and suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"While still in the process of comprehension, the body can naturally exhibit it. Intention merges with the heavens, as if it were natural."</p><p></p><p>"Amazing!" Whispered.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Fan's sincere admiration was not for himself but for this clone. </p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was for the uniqueness of the clone created, the grace of Mr. Bai's presence.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, everything that happened in the world of beast races during his enlightenment process suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai pondered, "With hands as the pen, changing the heavens and the earth. This technique can be named [Heavenly Transformation]."</p><p></p><p>The initial inspiration for the [Heavenly Transformation] technique came from the reverse Five Elements cycle sword.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan, from the wonders of the heavens and earth like the Five Elements Heavenly Cave, the amalgamation of the Five Elements, after realizing this technique, was able to achieve simple "creation": turning scattered spiritual energy in the air into spiritual stones.</p><p></p><p>But when it came to creating complex objects out of thin air, Li Fan was helpless.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, he was able to reshape the world at will with a wave of his hand precisely because of the existence of the seventeen petals of the Heavenly Spirit Flower.</p><p></p><p>On the petals of the Heavenly Spirit Flower, mountains, rivers, and streams were displayed. The clone Xu Bai carefully examined as if he had entered the petals, swiftly flying over the once-occupied space of the Heavenly Spirit Land. The scenery changed rapidly before his eyes, and the entire process of the birth of mountains and rivers in the world unfolded.</p><p></p><p>To put it plainly, it was akin to the heavens and earth acting as teachers, displaying the process of creating mountains and rivers on the petals of the Heavenly Spirits Flower for Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xu Bai's enlightenment was systematic. Following and imitating the teacher of the heavens and earth, he unconsciously completed a "copy" in the world of beast races.</p><p></p><p>"The [Heavenly Transformation] technique is displayed by Xu Bai without any obstruction. But the true mastery still requires repeated attempts," Li Fan praised from the bottom of his heart, knowing it wasn't about him but the capabilities of the clone. </p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the current Heavenly Transformation, beyond the world of beast races, had a much greater viewing effect than actual usage.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan was only at the Yuanying stage, his impact on the heavens and earth was quite limited.</p><p></p><p>However, this was an incomparable divine technique with a promising future.</p><p></p><p>The greatest utility Li Fan could think of at the moment was self-creating the "Essence of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>As a necessary item for ascending to the Nascent Divinity stage, the Essence of Heaven and Earth was the "driving force" for change in the world.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Spirit would create thousands of waters, and the Taihua would create thousands of mountains...</p><p></p><p>For a Yuanying cultivator to use this as a basis to break through to the Nascent Divinity stage, they must observe the changes about to occur in a territory.</p><p></p><p>Then extract and absorb this "driving force" to complete their own promotion.</p><p></p><p>There were hundreds of Yuanying cultivators in the Sea of Clouds, but there were only two Nascent Divinity cultivators, Purple Cloud and Hongxi. </p><p></p><p>This vast gap clearly indicated the difficulty of the task.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary Yuanying cultivator to predict the changes in the heavens and earth was already extremely difficult. And to absorb the Essence of Heaven and Earth alone unnoticed by other prying Yuanying cultivators was even more challenging.</p><p></p><p>However, for Li Fan, who had mastered the [Heavenly Transformation] technique, he could easily trigger changes in a remote and uninhabited area, steal that power, and effortlessly ascend.</p><p></p><p>If he had more courage...</p><p></p><p>It would not be impossible to mass-produce Nascent Divinity cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Dao cultivators were almost the rulers of a territory, while Nascent Divinity cultivators were considered the backbone force of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>If an organization suddenly appeared with dozens or even hundreds of Nascent Divinity cultivators, whether it was the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance or the Five Elders Council, they would have to treat it with caution.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this was premised on the fact that the triggering of the mysterious changes by [Heavenly Transformation] would not be detected by the stronger cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, a few discreet actions might go unnoticed. But significant changes would undoubtedly be exposed.</p><p></p><p>This would attract the attention of the Dao cultivators, and even the venerable Longevity Heavenly Lords, rightly so.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, currently, the key was how Li Fan could safely perform [Heavenly Transformation] in the Xuanyellow Realm to ensure his safety while exploring step by step.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Young Master, on your progress on the path of Dao!" </p><p></p><p>Liu San congratulated Li Fan joyfully as he regained consciousness, a faint smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>And Fang Zaiji, controlling the [Omniscient Eye], also chimed in, "Using mountains and rivers as a scroll, laws as ink, and divine techniques as the brush..."</p><p></p><p>"Lord, you are truly amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"I remember that the Godly Pen Sect had a similar technique in the past. But it is said that shortly after Chu Youhong created this move, the Godly Pen Sect was annihilated..."</p><p></p><p>"This move..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San's face twitched, not waiting for Fang Zaiji to finish speaking, he waved his sleeves and stored the golden eye.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji fell silent immediately, and the surroundings became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Liu San then relayed Jiao Xiuyuan's conditions to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao is still as quick to react as ever," his response was expected by Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Extending his left palm, the seventeen petals of the Heavenly Spirit Flower flew to his palm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai chuckled as he admired the flower.</p><p></p><p>Although the frozen Heavenly Spirit Flower remained intact, a transparent petal reflecting "the early sun shining on the mountains" inexplicably appeared in Xu Bai's right hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is something I 'copied' from the original Heavenly Spirit Flower, which lacked a tenth of the original charm. But it's enough..."</p><p></p><p>"Hand this over to Friend Jiao, and he will naturally understand the preciousness of the Heavenly Spirit Flower," Xu Bai said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Liu San solemnly held the transparent petal in his palm and nodded before departing.</p><p></p><p>"We need to accelerate the progress; we must complete this before the official exploration era begins in the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, when everyone is out exploring the white mist, who will come to buy my Heavenly Spirit Flower?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking to himself, Xu Bai waved his hand like a brush, drawing one imitation "Heavenly Spirit Flower petal" after another in the air.</p>

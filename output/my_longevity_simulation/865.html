        <h1>Chapter 865</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar stared at Li Fan for a moment, seemingly a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he spoke, his tone inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you still feel depressed now, what's the point of competing with a dead man?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The former Du'e Sect has long ceased to exist in this world," the stone tablet scholar said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"The Eyes of the World are merely executing the final orders they received."</p><p></p><p>"The Du'e Sect is gone?" Upon hearing this news, Li Fan couldn't help but be shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's look of utter disbelief, the stone tablet scholar smiled slightly and nodded in confirmation, "Absolutely true. They're dead as dead can be."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a trick to avoid calamity and deceive the eyes?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had been fighting wits and bravery with the air all along, still refused to give up and asked about his long-standing imaginary enemy, the old villain hiding behind the scenes, who had already been completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar smiled disdainfully, "The Venerable One of Transmitting Dharma personally took action. There's no way the Du'e Sect could have survived. It was also a matter acknowledged by all sects back then."</p><p></p><p>"But it's normal for your younger Myriad Realms Alliance to be unaware."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but fall silent.</p><p></p><p>"After the Venerable One of Transmitting Dharma achieved immortality by going against the principles of heaven and earth, he rarely took action. Exterminating the Du'e Sect was one of the few times. Even escaping to the outer realms, they couldn't avoid the fate of perishing," the stone tablet scholar said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Although the culprit is dead, the damage caused can no longer be undone. We can only allow the Eyes of the World to remain."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, if you don't pay attention, you really can't notice this thing. So everyone just let it be."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in ten thousand years at most, these paper men will naturally dissipate due to the passage of time. So everyone doesn't take it to heart either."</p><p></p><p>The scholar explained very earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>It was still the previous analogy of comparing the Profound Yellow Realm to a building.</p><p></p><p>After going against the principles of heaven and earth, the Venerable One of Longevity became part of the building.</p><p></p><p>But due to a momentary oversight, this building was actually filled with surveillance by someone.</p><p></p><p>Security cameras were all over the house and were all unsightly.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was that when these cameras were installed, they were all connected to the main structure of the building.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to remove them, it would inevitably cause irreparable damage to the building.</p><p></p><p>Being outside the immortal ashes and hovering between life and death in the first place.</p><p></p><p>This outcome was unbearable for the cultivators within the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>So even if they felt reluctant, they could only hold their noses and accept this fact.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had sorted things out, fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Why exactly did this Du'e Sect do this?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of remembrance flashed in the eyes of the stone tablet scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Those guys were always talking nonsense. Who could know what was really in their minds?"</p><p></p><p>"However, it can be certain that they should have foreseen long ago the possible consequences of doing so."</p><p></p><p>"Yet they still insisted on doing it."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm also very curious," the scholar said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the deceased are gone. Perhaps this mystery will never see the day it gets unraveled."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>From the other party's words and since his appearance...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Based on the various manifestations of the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>This scholar was definitely a powerful cultivator who had survived from ancient times to the present.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask for your name, senior?" Li Fan asked with clasped hands.</p><p></p><p>The scholar did not conceal it: "Among the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao, the one without a name is me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when searching for information on the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao, no matter how he searched, he could only find the names of nine sects.</p><p></p><p>The remaining one had no records whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had even once thought that the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao was just a conventional saying.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, one sect had already been exterminated.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that today he would actually be able to see the most mysterious, nameless last sect!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the words of this stone tablet scholar were also very thought-provoking.</p><p></p><p>"The one without a name among the Ten Sects is me..."</p><p></p><p>"Just like Senior Sister Zhao, one person is one sect?"</p><p></p><p>Even though the scholar in front of him looked harmless, Li Fan's heart was now on full alert.</p><p></p><p>This was possibly the second true expert at the Longevity Realm that he had really encountered.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so tense. I'm not concerned about the conflicts between the Five Elders Council and the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not even very interested in the survival or destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If one day, the Xuanhuang Realm is truly destroyed once and for all. I will definitely be the first to applaud." The scholar seemed to have hidden meaning in his words.</p><p></p><p>The scholar glanced at the stone tablet on his back, his expression somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the other party did not seem to be lying, and had not shown any malice, Li Fan's courage grew.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this stone tablet..."</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, cultivators often used Ruomu fruits to steal the power of longevity from heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"However, due to a coincidence, I obtained this stone tablet. Thus, I can exist alongside heaven and earth, imperishable for tens of thousands of years." The scholar's tone was filled with vicissitudes and weariness.</p><p></p><p>"This object is called the Creation Stone Tablet. Everything that happens in the Xuanhuang Realm, no matter how big or small, will automatically appear on this stone tablet."</p><p></p><p>"The world believes it to be a supreme treasure and wants to snatch it from me."</p><p></p><p>"I wish they could take it, but no one can."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist of the Alliance, do you want to try as well?" The scholar asked very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the Xuanhuang Realm would be automatically recorded?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't this be the ultimate fusion and enhanced version of the Bloodline Chronicles and the World-Observing Divine Eye?</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain it, all secrets from ancient times to the present would be at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>What kind of fortune was this?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mouth instantly felt dry.</p><p></p><p>However, he still had some reason left in him.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the scholar's inquiry, Li Fan did not dare to act rashly and shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar was a bit disappointed and explained, "My words are not false. There's truly no harm in trying."</p><p></p><p>Although the other party spoke very sincerely, Li Fan still refused to listen.</p><p></p><p>The scholar shook his head somewhat desolately, not forcing the matter.</p><p></p><p>"People nowadays have less and less courage."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, pretending not to have heard anything.</p><p></p><p>After a while, seeing that the other party no longer mentioned this matter, he asked again, "Senior, with your identity, why would you take the trouble to come and meet with me?"</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar stared at Li Fan, a hint of amusement flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I have come precisely for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart tightened: "Senior, don't scare me. I'm just a small Foundation Establishment cultivator, how could I catch your attention?"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Creation Stone Tablet can record everything in the world."</p>

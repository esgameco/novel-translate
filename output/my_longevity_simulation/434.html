        <div class="content">
            <p>Of course, Li Fan admired Senior Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Procedures that must be followed.</p><p></p><p>Same method as the last life.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in Mr. Bai's underground room, creating the Immortal Stone Needle.</p><p></p><p>Then tricking Senior Zhang to come.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, sealing his veins with the stone needle, pretending to interrogate him about the "Purple Dan Nirvana Technique."</p><p></p><p>Senior Zhang stared at Li Fan with unbelieving eyes, as if trying to remember him forever.</p><p></p><p>And then he committed suicide.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with Senior Zhang, people like Song and Song from Ningyuan City couldn't stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, with the experience of passing the level, Li Fan efficiently resolved the event of the destruction of the cultivation battle in Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings suddenly became blurry.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw Mr. Bai standing bewildered in the blood-colored ruins once again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how hard Li Fan tried, he couldn't see his face clearly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the screen went black.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan left the Immortal Realm and returned to the real world.</p><p></p><p>Feeling his own gains, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>"The clearance reward for ‘Ningyuan Fruit of Life,' three that can increase life by three hundred years, still exists."</p><p></p><p>"Just that after defeating Senior Zhang, I couldn't obtain any new techniques."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan quickly felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhang is still alive, I don't need his cultivation technique."</p><p></p><p>"It would be even more troublesome to really summon him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan analyzed his journey in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, it seems that I cannot perceive my past experiences in the Immortal Realm after reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>"But one thing is certain, I am extremely unique in the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like some kind of guidance, making me go through fixed events."</p><p></p><p>"First was ‘Ningyuan Fruit of Life,' next will be the ‘Change of the Beast Control Sect,’ right?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't know what caused this special situation.</p><p></p><p>But since the effects of the Immortal Realm on ‘Hazhen’ couldn't be sensed, he had no fear.</p><p></p><p>Instead, these reserved programs in the Immortal Realm became a way for him to obtain fixed treasures in every life.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Daoist stone in Yi Yin's tomb.</p><p></p><p>With his continuous exploration in the Immortal Realm, in the future, he would be able to access more resources quickly in each life.</p><p></p><p>This was beneficial for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining three Fruit of Life in the Immortal Realm, the restrictions on re-entry also slightly extended.</p><p></p><p>But unlike the previous life which lasted a year, it would probably only take about eight months this time.</p><p></p><p>"The Beast Control Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan began to look forward to what he could gain in the scene of the ‘Change of the Beast Control Sect.’</p><p></p><p>From the level of the Fruit of Life, there shouldn't be much of a difference.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, it wasn't long before the scheduled meeting with Wu Man and the Five Elders with Stone Faces.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cleaned up the traces of the secret room and transformed into the appearance of Zhou Qing'ang, flying towards the agreed location.</p><p></p><p>It was still an uninhabited small island. After searching for a while, Li Fan found a stone engraved with coordinates.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that besides Zhou Qing'ang, the Five Elders also have other undercover agents in the Sea of Cloudbanks."</p><p></p><p>"This stone, the communication stone for communication, and the funds distributed each time Zhou Qing'ang is needed, all need someone to arrange them."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not advisable to startle the grass and startle the snake. Let's trick the five million contribution points first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan crushed the stone and went to the marked place.</p><p></p><p>Also, an underwater ruin.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed his palms on the inconspicuous stone, successfully connecting the communication.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, how should we proceed?" Li Fan pretended to ask nervously.</p><p></p><p>"Above has already agreed to this transaction."</p><p></p><p>"Good! I'll go back and explain it to He Zhenghao." Li Fan was a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, boss, I've made such a big contribution this time. Is there any reward for me?"</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his hands, Li Fan looked expectantly at the Stone Face.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's reaction seemed to have been expected by Stone Face.</p><p></p><p>He sneered and said, "Don't worry, I won't treat you unfairly. You've been coveting the ‘Heart Lord’ painting book, haven't you? As long as this mission is completed successfully, I'll send someone to deliver it to you."</p><p></p><p>"The ‘Heart Lord’ painting book?" Li Fan instantly recalled the enchanting scenes he felt from the residual souls of the Five Elders at the Soul Gathering Pearl back then.</p><p></p><p>Cursing inwardly, Li Fan hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Stone Face was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, this... I've seen it. Can I exchange it for something else?" Li Fan lowered his head slightly, his voice lowered, and his face somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Stone Face paused, then suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder your funds have been used up so quickly! It turns out they were spent on this?" He exclaimed angrily.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Stone Face's anger subsided.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he said, "Forget it, considering your merit this time, I won't hold you accountable."</p><p></p><p>"How about the ‘Blissful Crystal Lattice’ of the ‘Blissful Land’? Floating and wanting to ascend, heading towards the Extreme Bliss. You've been clamoring for it for a long time, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, he found an excuse and said tactfully, "Boss, this is what I think."</p><p></p><p>"You told me to improve relations with He Zhenghao, right? But ever since he changed his Yuan Infant technique, his cultivation has been rapidly increasing day by day. It won't be long before he breaks through to the Golden Core stage."</p><p></p><p>"While I have been stuck at the Foundation Building stage for a long time. If I can't break through for a long time, with a Foundation Building cultivation base, it will be a bit difficult to get along with him."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this person..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Do you know about improvement?" Stone Face looked at Li Fan somewhat incredulously.</p><p></p><p>But after pondering for a moment, he found what Li Fan said made sense.</p><p></p><p>He nodded immediately, "Yes, He Zhenghao is crucial. He is one of the key people you need to focus on next."</p><p></p><p>"Also, you can find a way to obtain the formation structure of the Heavenly Yuan Rebirth Formation from him."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Stone Face continued, "Hmm, the task is arduous. It seems that you need to quickly improve your cultivation to the Golden Core stage."</p><p></p><p>"As for the techniques, you'll have to figure out how to exchange them at the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. We can't provide help in that area."</p><p></p><p>"However, I can give you a few bottles of Enlightenment Pills."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan felt slightly happy.</p><p></p><p>He had experienced the miraculous effects of the Enlightenment Pills before.</p><p></p><p>But due to their rare acquisition channel, even money couldn't buy a lot.</p><p></p><p>If he could get some from Stone Face, it would be excellent.</p><p></p><p>"Just these, totally not enough!"</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still wore an insatiable look.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, you know my aptitude. The Enlightenment Pills, while miraculous, have limited effects on me!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop whining, I'll think about it!" Stone Face said impatiently.</p>

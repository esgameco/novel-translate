        <h1>Chapter 952</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The various policies indicate that the Wanxian Alliance attaches great importance to the Jiushan State. At the very least, the determination could indeed be felt by all the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance from the terms and conditions.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, the one who promulgated the decree and presided over the construction of the Jiushan State was none other than Jiang, the Dharma Transmitter who had previously led the Wanxian Alliance to a great victory over the Five Elders Association!</p><p></p><p>As the only well-known Dharma Transmitter, with the previous major victory as a foundation, Dharma Transmitter Jiang's reputation among the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance was extremely high, second only to the Dharma Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"If the Jiushan Free Trade State is successfully built and proves to be effective, then the prestige of this Dharma Transmitter Jiang will likely rise even further."</p><p></p><p>"How interesting. Is he a representative collectively put forward by the Dharma Transmitters, or...?"</p><p></p><p>"The actual leadership of the Wanxian Alliance is divided into two factions: the Dharma Transmitters and the Heavenly Profound Mirror. Now, the Dharma Transmitters are making frequent big moves and even attempting to create the Profound Heavenly Sealed Spirit, completely seizing control of the Heavenly Profound Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Heavenly Profound Mirror faction just sitting and waiting for their demise?"</p><p></p><p>It is said that a great wind rises from the tip of a blade of grass. In the Wanxian Alliance, very few could see through the bustling appearance of the Jiushan State and discern the internal struggle of the high-level factions within the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was one of them.</p><p></p><p>However, regardless of the outcome, he actually didn't care.</p><p></p><p>With the cover of the Jiushan State craze, the rapid expansion of the Divine Possession organization was what concerned him more.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, the Wanxian Alliance had always maintained a strong control over its own territory.</p><p></p><p>When more and more cultivators had mastered the divine magic projections of Nascent Soul and even Void Refinement realms, this abnormal phenomenon still attracted the attention of the official Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, since no one had violated the laws of the Immortal Alliance, they temporarily refrained from taking action against those cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They only dispatched some cultivators from the Dharma Protector Hall to also cultivate the "Divine Possession" technique, trying to uncover the secrets behind it.</p><p></p><p>When one of these cultivators summoned a divine magic projection and Li Fan's consciousness avatar attempted to lurk into the other party's sea of consciousness,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan discovered that this cultivator actually wanted to probe Li Fan by tracing the source of the consciousness avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Truly not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth..." Li Fan sneered coldly and did not stop the other party.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he carefully made arrangements and then guided the other party over.</p><p></p><p>Thus, after the initial surprise faded, what this cultivator named Wei Ziguan from the Dharma Protector Hall saw was a series of incredibly realistic scenes.</p><p></p><p>A black sun appeared in the sky of the Profound Yellow Realm, devouring everything.</p><p></p><p>Countless living beings wailed, but had no time to react at all.</p><p></p><p>They all disappeared into that endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Yellow Realm shattered, and living beings were in misery.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying doomsday scene rushed into Wei Ziguan's mind in a torrent when he was caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>It was not an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The expressions on the faces of every cultivator facing imminent catastrophe were extremely real.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Ziguan went mad.</p><p></p><p>He only had the cultivation of Golden Core realm and had cultivated for less than a hundred years. Having had a smooth journey all the way, when had he ever witnessed such a hellish scene?</p><p></p><p>Severing the probe and returning to reality, Wei Ziguan screamed uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>He appeared to be in a state of madness, constantly mumbling about the impending end of the world.</p><p></p><p>His colleagues quickly restrained him.</p><p></p><p>After reporting, the cultivators who came to investigate, upon understanding Wei Ziguan's experience,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His brows were also tightly furrowed, and his face was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Realizing the seriousness of the matter, the cultivator ordered someone to keep Wei Ziguan under watch, and then hurriedly returned.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Similar incidents in various parts of the Immortal Alliance were not just one.</p><p></p><p>After the reports from various places were gathered and submitted, it finally caused a shock among the high-level members of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But this matter was quite strange, and it was hard to say whether it was a secret plot by the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>So before the final decision was made, the Immortal Alliance suspended the investigation of [Divine Possession].</p><p></p><p>They only ordered various places to secretly control those cultivators who practiced Divine Possession.</p><p></p><p>But with Li Fan, the instigator, continuing to spread the seeds.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance's move was just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Possession organization continued to grow as always.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had successfully bewitched another cultivator, suddenly felt a sense of being watched out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had found Li Fan's whereabouts directly through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan always changed his appearance when he went out. So his true identity was not exposed.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Li Fan lightly pointed at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sharp sword energy severed the source of the secret probe.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in this moment, his position seemed to be locked.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Patrol Arrow!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance obviously attached great importance to Li Fan, the person who secretly sowed the evil.</p><p></p><p>Not one, but three Heavenly Patrol Arrows in succession locked onto Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Even a Harmonized Dao cultivator would have to pay a heavy price in this situation!</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>He just looked with bright eyes, and waved his sleeve at the Heavenly Patrol Arrows that were about to fly in front of him!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three Heavenly Patrol Arrows that broke through the air and seemed to tear everything apart disappeared for no reason!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed a disdainful smile, and then his figure flew away and left this place in an instant.</p><p></p><p>When a team of fully armed Immortal Alliance cultivators arrived late and figured out what had happened, they all showed an undisguised look of horror on their faces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the spatial passage leading to the small world of the empire.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, looking at the Heavenly Patrol Arrows raging in his own Five Elements Great Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>The beggar version of "Sleeve Heavenly Cave" just now was indeed handsome.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was a sharp weapon that could seriously injure the Harmonized Dao.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly taking it into one's own heavenly cave naturally required a considerable price.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly cave rumbled and trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The water, fire, and earth caves, due to the attack of the Heavenly Patrol Arrows, even had faint cracks in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there were still the gold and wood caves to support, and Li Fan personally took action to help suppress it with the seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>In the end, these three Heavenly Patrol Arrows were completely subdued by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The five elements circulated, and in just a moment, the impact brought by the Heavenly Patrol Arrows disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held an arrow in his hand and quietly studied it.</p><p></p><p>I don't know what material it was made of, it was extremely hard.</p><p></p><p>Even when Li Fan used the Annihilation Sword to bombard it, the arrow body could still remain intact.</p><p></p><p>The arrow body was engraved with many complex patterns. After Li Fan analyzed it with the Doomsday Decomposition Disk, he obtained 100,000 superimposed compatible formation laws.</p><p></p><p>More than half of them were formation laws that Li Fan had never learned, and even the decomposition disk's own deduction database did not exist.</p><p></p><p>It was very different from the formation law system of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, and seemed to come from another cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"This is a great nourishment for the decomposition disk!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was overjoyed in his heart.</p>

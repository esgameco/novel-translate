        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1028: Tianyang's Longevity</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan first used his newly born Five Elements Grotto Heaven to form his Nascent Soul, he had a vague strange feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, in order to seize the instant when the Grotto Heaven descended into the world to successfully form his Nascent Soul, Li Fan didn't have time to consider too much.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he ignored that subtle different feeling.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until recently, when Li Fan, who had upgraded his Dao Transformation Stone, looked back at every detail he had experienced again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he rediscover it.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, there should still be new Five Elements Grotto Heavens born in the 【Root of Heaven and Earth】 of Tianling Prefecture. When the time comes, I'll know with one test."</p><p></p><p>"However, the original Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven of this world was absorbed and promoted by me. With some loss to Heaven and Earth, it will take some time to nurture new Grotto Heavens."</p><p></p><p>"If after verification, my guess is true, then the number of anchor points I can use should be able to increase by a few more."</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Li Fan's eyes: "Although newborn Grotto Heavens are not easy to find, there are quite a few in the vast Xuanhuang Realm after all."</p><p></p><p>"To take it to the extreme, directly annihilating the Grotto Heavens and reconstructing them..."</p><p></p><p>"This is also a good method."</p><p></p><p>There was a time when Li Fan wanted to increase the number of anchor points by having cultivators form Golden Cores, and he had to secretly look for shady resources. Because of this, he stumbled upon Ruomu by chance.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could already wantonly destroy the Grotto Heavens of the Xuanhuang Realm at will.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Li Fan's mentality had inflated, but there were really not many things left in the Xuanhuang Realm that could pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was wholeheartedly preparing to help Tianxuan Mirror break free from its predicament, Qiaogong Jushi had already made a breakthrough on his side.</p><p></p><p>He excitedly ran to find Li Fan, wanting to make use of the 【Quintessence of Source Power】.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Fellow Daoist Fang, although his artifact refining level is a bit lacking and he hasn't received any proper training, it's also because of this that he naturally has no mental restrictions and can always come up with some whimsical ideas!"</p><p></p><p>"I have already drafted a preliminary plan to help Tianyang re-forge his puppet body, let the Venerable One take a look!"</p><p></p><p>With that said, Qiaogong Jushi pointed at a spot in the void.</p><p></p><p>An image of a puppet that seemed to be wearing black metal armor and looked majestic instantly appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Referencing part of the appearance of 【Ancestor】 back then, as well as Tianyang's own wishes, this version of the appearance was designed. Fellow Daoist Fang and I are also very satisfied with it."</p><p></p><p>"However, the appearance can be changed at will, but this is not the key point."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi pointed into the air again, and the image of the puppet was instantly enlarged again.</p><p></p><p>The internal structure of the puppet was thus revealed.</p><p></p><p>Passages resembling human blood vessels spread throughout the puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>The golden Quintessence of Source Power flowed endlessly like a surging river within them.</p><p></p><p>"The most direct difference between immortal puppets and mortal puppets is that immortal puppets can absorb external forces and continuously evolve and grow stronger like real living beings."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Tianyang, transforming his body into an object and merging as one with the puppet. Being both a cultivator and a puppet, he unknowingly satisfied the most difficult condition for becoming an immortal puppet."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan frowned: "Just a simple accumulation of materials? Can this enhance Tianyang's strength? He is already at the Harmonized Dao realm now, after completing the puppet refinement, how far can he go?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi was full of confidence: "Absolutely no problem..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, Tian Yang's state is like that of a cultivator who has already met the conditions for advancement, but lacks the corresponding resources, which is why he has not completed his transformation."</p><p></p><p>"He has both a puppet body and the spiritual intelligence of a cultivator. Since he already has a path to upgrade to an immortal puppet, why bother seeking a new method in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Qiaogong Jushi's words, Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm who want to break through in their cultivation must all abide by the rules set by the Dharma Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But by a coincidence of fate, Tian Yang became a being that is half puppet and half cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In addition to being able to follow the path of a cultivator's advancement, he can also follow the path of an artifact's upgrade.</p><p></p><p>There was some excitement in Qiaogong Jushi's eyes: "After completing the forging, it is currently impossible to determine exactly how strong he will be. However, it can be certain that he will definitely not be weaker than the Longevity Realm cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed: "If that's the case, then you can go ahead and do it."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan separated a body filled with golden source power essence to accompany him.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi's eyes were instantly firmly attracted.</p><p></p><p>"If your idea is feasible, doesn't that mean we can mass-produce Longevity Realm combat power?"</p><p></p><p>"I also know a thing or two about Tian Yang's body transformation technique. As long as one cultivates this secret art and transforms into a half-puppet, half-cultivator existence, then uses the source power essence to help them upgrade..." Li Fan's eyes turned as he thought of something and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi's attention was still focused on the golden body.</p><p></p><p>It took a good while before he reacted.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and directly denied Li Fan's speculation: "I thought the same way before. However..."</p><p></p><p>"After inquiring about the details of Tian Yang's body transformation technique, I knew that this is by no means an easy task."</p><p></p><p>"Transforming one's body into an object, especially a puppet, is extremely easy to lose oneself. Losing human nature and truly becoming a puppet. Only those with great willpower and spirit can do it. Tian Yang's firmness of will is rare in the world." Qiaogong Jushi praised.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought of the [Eternal Memory] from Tian Yang's remains and silently nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This is just one aspect. The bigger constraint is still this source power essence." Qiaogong Jushi pointed to the golden body and said.</p><p></p><p>"I know that what the envoy has taken out is already extremely precious, but this is only enough to meet the most basic forging requirements."</p><p></p><p>"The gap between immortals and mortals is too huge. Without the baptism of immortal spiritual energy, relying solely on source power essence..."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi paused and deliberated: "It is estimated that even ten times the amount would not be enough to satisfy it."</p><p></p><p>"Just forging one puppet consumes so much. How can we mass-produce?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan did not agree.</p><p></p><p>For him, these two constraints were not a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>As long as the base number is large enough, one can always find those with exceptionally firm willpower.</p><p></p><p>And as long as there are enough believers and enough time spent, one can always accumulate enough source power essence.</p><p></p><p>As long as one can cultivate Longevity Realm henchmen, it is all worth it.</p><p></p><p>The only thing to consider is whether such a large-scale mobilization of source power essence will attract the attention of the Faceless Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Although in theory, true immortals are no longer interested in source power essence, the Flower of Dao is still very close to the power of the Root of Dao that true immortals pursue.</p><p></p><p>If it reaches a certain level, it would not be unexpected to attract the gaze of true immortals.</p>

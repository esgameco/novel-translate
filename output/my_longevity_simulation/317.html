        <h1>Chapter 317</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After thinking for a long time, he still couldn't recall it.</p><p></p><p>Frustrated, he started scratching the little boy's hair with his claws again. Seeing no reaction from the boy, Li Fan fiercely pecked him with his long beak.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch! It hurts!" The little boy's gaze finally withdrew from the distant figure of Lu Ya.</p><p></p><p>But he mistakenly thought Li Fan was urging him to find food, so he hurriedly reassured, "Okay, okay, I know you're hungry, I'll go find something to eat right now."</p><p></p><p>"Little Red, let's go!" The boy patted the wings of the red-crowned crane beneath him.</p><p></p><p>The crane obediently flapped its wings, its form changing from still to swift again, constantly passing through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the howling wind, Li Fan vaguely heard the little boy muttering regretfully, "Senior Brother Lu Ya is so handsome and kind, and now his strength has become so powerful, he's simply too perfect. If everyone in Ningyuan City knew, they would definitely be very happy. It's a pity that for some reason, Senior Brother suddenly has such great hostility towards Mr. Bai. Not only does he not let me go back, he won't even let me send flying messages..."</p><p></p><p>The boy frowned, his face full of worries that were extremely incompatible with his age. However, Li Fan's body suddenly stiffened. The two terms "Ningyuan City" and "Mr. Bai" instantly activated the memories deep in his mind.</p><p></p><p>A skinny figure with slightly yellowish hair suddenly appeared in front of Li Fan's eyes. "Is it him?" "The plot of this Beast Taming Sect actually follows the previous events in Ningyuan City?"</p><p></p><p>"The little beggar boy from back then can now command such powerful beasts. Judging from its might just now, that tiger-faced, human-bodied beast has a cultivation of at least Nascent Soul stage or above. How many years have passed?"</p><p></p><p>"However, the cultivation methods of the Beast Taming Sect have long been lost. It's possible that the beasts being controlled are even more powerful than the cultivators themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai... it's this mysterious fellow again."</p><p></p><p>"Why is it that every time I enter the Fallen Immortal Realm, the events I experience are all related to him?" "Once is a coincidence, twice or thrice, one can't help but become suspicious."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many thoughts surged in his mind. Under the emotional turmoil, Li Fan felt the little bit of energy he had just accumulated being rapidly depleted again.</p><p></p><p>His eyelids couldn't help but droop down. At the moment before falling asleep, he seemed to see that blurry figure again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was awakened by a sweet fruit delivered into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>As the fruit entered his stomach, waves of warmth washed over his whole body, quickly dispelling his drowsiness.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes, he saw the little boy sneakily squatting on the ground, using spiritual plants taller than him to conceal his form.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, he would select one or two plump, red fruits from above and hand them to Li Fan. Li Fan also ate them without hesitation, swallowing them directly.</p><p></p><p>His strength seemed to have increased a bit more. Li Fan continued scratching the boy with his claws, indicating for him to bring more.</p><p></p><p>The boy kept shuttling through the spirit fields, taking away all the fruits that looked the most appetizing and giving them to Li Fan to enjoy.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was feasting, he also started to view the little boy more favorably.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that's about enough. If we steal any more, the missing amount will be too noticeable and we'll be discovered." "Hehe, let's change to another place." The boy straightened Li Fan who was sitting a bit askew on top of his head from eating too much.</p><p></p><p>Without summoning the crane, he stepped on the wind and rushed directly towards the next field.</p><p></p><p>In this way, after raiding several places, they unexpectedly ran into a group of companions. "Xu Ke, why are you here?!" A voice suddenly came from behind the little boy, startling him.</p><p></p><p>However, after turning around and seeing the other party's appearance clearly, the boy breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Sizing up the other person, the boy named Xu Ke made a shushing gesture and lowered his voice, saying, "Of course for the same reason as you, to give my companion spirit beast a treat."</p><p></p><p>Very dissatisfied that his eating progress was interrupted, Li Fan gave the person called Song Yang a displeased glance.</p><p></p><p>Skinny build, sinister gaze, not looking like a good person. Coiled around his neck was a black two-headed snake.</p><p></p><p>One head had its eyes tightly closed, while the other head was staring fixedly at Li Fan, constantly flicking its tongue. Xu Ke subconsciously gathered his hair, hiding Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Song Yang looked at Xu Ke with disdain, as if he had heard some huge joke, "The same as me? You're not qualified!"</p><p></p><p>"My companion spirit beast is a descendant of the Black Water Snake God Zhu Jiuyin. Its potential is limitless and it's a sure thing that it will achieve Nascent Divinity in the future. If it's not full, it's only natural for me to come and give it some extra food."</p><p></p><p>"As for that strange bird of yours, what is it? One look and you know it doesn't have any powerful bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, a dragon begets a dragon, a phoenix begets a phoenix, and a mouse can only dig holes. Xu Ke, you don't really think you can turn things around by relying on a random bird, do you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was after all just a child. Hearing his companion spirit beast being disparaged, he couldn't help but argue, "My bird isn't bad either. Everyone says it's a descendant of a divine bird, in the future..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, he was rudely interrupted by Song Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of a divine bird? Which divine bird? Phoenix? Vermilion Bird? No matter how I look at your strange bird, it doesn't resemble any of them!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you took people's casual words of comfort seriously? How foolish!"</p><p></p><p>Song Yang mocked and ridiculed. Even the two-headed snake hanging on his body cooperated by showing a mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>"You're talking nonsense!" Xu Ke's face couldn't help but flush red, his voice suddenly rising several degrees.</p><p></p><p>However, Song Yang seemed to deliberately want to anger Xu Ke. Not only did he not stop, he even intensified his ridicule.</p><p></p><p>On top of Xu Ke's head, Li Fan, who was already a bit impatient, heard himself being slandered by this skinny bamboo stick in front of him. He became even more enraged for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take action, he was pressed down by Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>"Little guy, don't be impulsive. You can't beat that snake. Besides, the sect's rules prohibit disciples from infighting. If discovered, there will be severe punishment. The one who starts the fight will be punished even more heavily."</p><p></p><p>"Let's just ignore him." Xu Ke's voice simultaneously resounded in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had gone through a hundred reincarnations, how could he not see that this fellow called Song Yang was deliberately stirring up trouble? It's a pity that possessing a strange bird, with its innately irritable temperament, was hard to control.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Xu Ke used both hands with all his strength to barely suppress Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Li Fan would have rushed up long ago.</p><p></p><p>No longer paying attention to Song Yang's sarcasm, Xu Ke left in a huff. Song Yang looked at Xu Ke's departing figure, a flash of coldness passing through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In order to appease Li Fan, Xu Ke took him to sweep through the spirit fields a few more times.</p><p></p><p>With his belly filled with different kinds of spiritual plants, Li Fan gradually calmed down.</p>

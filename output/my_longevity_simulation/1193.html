        <h1>Chapter 1193</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1191: Weaving a False Immortal Web</p><p></p><p>The sound of devout prayers echoed in the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>Like ancient chants, enduring and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>These people were naturally the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>Under the joint efforts of Li Ping's disciples, almost the vast majority of the Youzu people were captured and brought to the small world of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that the existence behind the Dark Sea did not mind if its believers had other faiths.</p><p></p><p>So after intimidation, enticement, and finally demonstrating in front of the entire Youzu people that coexistence was real, these Youzu people quickly adapted to this way of life.</p><p></p><p>Some even had a firmer and more fanatical belief in the Holy Emperor than in the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the critical moment of the tribe's destruction, the Dark Sea did not manifest any miracles. Whereas the Destined Holy Emperor would truly distribute large amounts of supplies to the people every once in a while.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, listening to the chanting of the Youzu people in unison, Li Ping felt specks of golden source power being generated within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Just a hundred Youzu people, the power of faith they condense and generate is more than the sum of all the Daqi subjects."</p><p></p><p>"What secret is hidden within the Youzu people..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had already sent the corpses of some individually resisting Youzu people to Yin Shangren, asking him to help with the research.</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that his research on the new law has also hit a bottleneck. Changing the research topic might unexpectedly spark inspiration."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Ping was not particularly concerned about the true reason behind the Youzu's special physique.</p><p></p><p>The cause didn't matter as long as it could be used by him.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, and Li Ping arrived at another enclosed place near this prayer space.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanba, how goes the research? Can the transplanted flesh and blood promote the reproduction of the Youzu people?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba, who was concentrating and staring at something in front of him, quickly withdrew his gaze upon hearing the arrival of his revered master.</p><p></p><p>He respectfully saluted and then reported, "After several experiments, I have found the optimal combination of exotic beast flesh and blood."</p><p></p><p>"I have named it the [Elemental Embryo of Life]."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there is sufficient male and female essence, it can cultivate a large number of young at a terrifying speed."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it's not nurtured in the mother's body. These young are innately deficient and extremely frail when born, not to mention their life expectancy is probably not very long." Wang Xuanba said very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Different from the honest, strong young man he was before, Wang Xuanba was now thin.</p><p></p><p>He received careful guidance from Li Ping, and then devoured the flesh and blood of many exotic beasts, mastering many of their abilities. His current level of understanding of exotic beasts even surpassed Li Ping's.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that his master was troubled by the low birth rate of the Youzu people, he volunteered to share his worries.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he actually created something quite shocking called the [Elemental Embryo of Life].</p><p></p><p>Completely composed of squirming pink exotic beast flesh, its interior consisted of chamber after chamber.</p><p></p><p>Countless tubes connected these chambers to the main body of the elemental embryo.</p><p></p><p>"This is a win-win process. With each new offspring cultivated, it will become more and more intelligent and powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Although this progress is very small, it can accumulate quantity to achieve metamorphosis within the expected time."</p><p></p><p>"If my prediction is correct, the Elemental Embryo of Life may not even need male and female essence in the future..."</p><p></p><p>After refining, there is no longer a need to create life on their own. As long as there is enough energy." </p><p></p><p>When it came to discussing the strange beasts, Wang Xuanba's tone was full of confidence, even in front of his own teacher.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's gaze pierced through the darkness, looking towards the distant, constantly jumping, seemingly breathing giant "flesh mass".</p><p></p><p>"I only need the number of them that can work for me at the same time. As for their lifespan..."</p><p></p><p>"If they die, they can be recreated."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's words were full of coldness. Upon hearing this, Wang Xuanba's heart did not feel anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>After all, in his eyes, these headless Youzu were actually no different from those strange beasts and could not be considered human at all.</p><p></p><p>"You need to keep everything here strictly confidential. Even to your fellow disciples, it should be the same." Li Ping said again.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple understands."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>After Li Ping left, he began to continue his research work.</p><p></p><p>Compared to dealing with the complex things in the outside world, he still preferred these pure and simple matters.</p><p></p><p>In just a few years, the trajectory of the sturdy youth from the foot of Jieli Mountain had undergone such tremendous changes.</p><p></p><p>However, among Li Ping's disciples, Wang Xuanba was not the one who changed the most.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba's actions still vaguely resembled his past self.</p><p></p><p>The one who had completely changed, becoming an entirely different person, was Li Ping's fifth disciple, Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>Following his father to Daqi and being accepted as Li Ping's personal disciple, he changed from being silent, vigilant, and lacking self-confidence to the current spirited youth.</p><p></p><p>Decisive in his actions, looking down on all things.</p><p></p><p>Although he was the youngest among the disciples, in terms of true strength, he surpassed everyone.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Daqi, except for Li Ping, there was probably no one who could match him.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Ping were to intervene, it would not be an easy task to subdue Ou Shangtian without using some secret magical powers.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the two strange objects that Ou Shangtian was born with, the Kunqian Bone Hands and the Book of Ten Thousand Deaths.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Ou Shangtian also fished out the Seven-Colored Divine Light from the Fishing Pond under Li Ping's guidance.</p><p></p><p>With the Seven-Colored Divine Light protecting his body, plus the Kunqian Bone Hands and the Book of Ten Thousand Deaths' heaven-defying life-saving abilities, Ou Shangtian's ability to preserve his life was even stronger than most Hedao in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After easily suppressing several small worlds with a few moves, this young man became increasingly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately, with his father and Li Ping's suppression, he did not do anything outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he joined forces with Wang Xuanba to capture the Youzu people, he became interested in Wang Xuanba's strange and unpredictable beast abilities.</p><p></p><p>So he asked Li Ping for the cultivation method of [Zaohua Honglu Gong] and had been working hard to cultivate it recently.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not worried that Ou Shangtian would lose control.</p><p></p><p>Before he showed any signs of losing control, he would decisively take action.</p><p></p><p>The golden source power condensed by the Youzu people had already been quietly injected into the bodies of key figures in Daqi by him.</p><p></p><p>This power, which was infinitely close to the power of true immortals, was not something that these so-called geniuses could perceive.</p><p></p><p>Only Baihua, that old thing from the ancient immortal cultivation world, could know the truth behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Since they have fallen into my net, they can only work hard until they die."</p><p></p><p>"After all, all the gifts have already been marked with a price."</p><p></p><p>With the pure golden source power as a trump card, they could already start to envision the plan to invade the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>

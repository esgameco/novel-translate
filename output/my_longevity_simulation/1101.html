            <p>Chapter 1099: Seeking Opportunities in the Dark</p><p></p><p>"The more frequently one begs for the power of darkness, the more cracks it will create. The possibility of darkness invading will also increase," Li Fan calmly analyzed the characteristics of the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>It was conceivable that if the mysterious power that fixed the dark ocean did not exist, the Xuanhuang realm would have long been eroded and riddled with holes by the dark tides.</p><p></p><p>"The existence of the Immortal Ruins created the dark ocean. Then what is it that conceals this crisis in an invisible manner without the world's awareness?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Mo Rubin's desperate attempt to enter the dark realm, Li Fan could almost be certain that there must be something related to the Mysterious Heavenly King.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was his residual power.</p><p></p><p>Or...</p><p></p><p>It was him in person.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan selected three young disciples from the Dark Tribe and had them respectively teach the ritual of communicating with the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>He then took the Dark Tribe leader and more than a dozen strong tribesmen out of the Lingmu realm.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the dark tides would lead to the invasion of the power of darkness. Naturally, Li Fan would not perform the ritual in his own home.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he knew of quite a few ownerless small worlds.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, Li Fan selected a suitable one and infiltrated it.</p><p></p><p>This small world had no ground.</p><p></p><p>There were only continuous underground caves. The only luminous objects were the light moss that occasionally grew on the cave walls.</p><p></p><p>It was quite suitable for the Dark Tribe to live in.</p><p></p><p>Under Fang Zaiji's urging, the Dark Tribe leader began the ritual to open the passage to the dark realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan ordered him to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan himself, along with Tian Yang, Qiao Gong Jushi, Liu Ruchen, and Fang Zaiji, the five of them held hands tightly and followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Entering the boundless dark world again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had adapted a lot.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong and the others, however, were clearly feeling tense and fearful emotions from them.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had heard about it before and had sufficient mental preparation.</p><p></p><p>But when they were truly experiencing it, it was still difficult to get rid of these emotions.</p><p></p><p>The group, connected as one, communicated with their divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"Can you sense the presence of the people from the Wanxian Alliance here?" Li Fan asked the Dark Tribe leader.</p><p></p><p>However, he gave a negative answer.</p><p></p><p>"The power of darkness is too profound. Even we, the long-term residents, find it difficult to see things around us. Moreover, I haven't been home for a long time. Your Excellency, please let me adapt a little more..."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was just overthinking.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the Dark Tribe leader finally roughly distinguished the direction.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me. Not far away is where our original residence was located. If the people from the Wanxian Alliance are stationed here, they will definitely choose that place," he explained to Li Fan and the others, his tone filled with hatred.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan noticed.</p><p></p><p>The inexplicable rhythm he felt from Mo Rubin's corpse when he entered last time seemed to have disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And on top of the darkness, it was impossible to distinguish the location.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that we can only find clues from this Wanxian Alliance's stronghold."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Can you figure out how many people are inside?"</p><p></p><p>The Dark Tribe leader sensed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"There should be around five people. As for their strength, it's similar to this person..." </p><p></p><p>He was referring to Liu Ruchen among the group.</p><p></p><p>"You can actually distinguish our strengths?" Fang Zaiji had</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Youzu leader seemed somewhat proud as he said, "Naturally, it cannot be done outside. But in this dark sea, for us Youzu people, it is an easy task."</p><p></p><p>"It's like how objects of different weights will cause varying changes when placed in water. He should be able to distinguish through this," Qiaogong Jushi explained, looking towards the endless darkness surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji finally understood.</p><p></p><p>"What are the people from the Wanxian Alliance doing here?" Li Fan frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"We need to get a little closer."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan agreed to his request: "Don't push yourself. Now is not the time to directly clash with the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Having fought with the Wanxian Alliance before, the Youzu leader naturally understood how terrifying their strength was.</p><p></p><p>Indicating his understanding, he slowly approached forward step by step.</p><p></p><p>"How dare they!"</p><p></p><p>The Youzu leader's emotions suddenly experienced a huge fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, being in the dark ocean, they were not discovered by the people of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Youzu leader shared the scene he sensed.</p><p></p><p>Several white figures, forming a circle.</p><p></p><p>In their center, there seemed to exist a small vortex formed by the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>This vortex was very small in scale, not even the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>Its appearance was also quite strange, with the center of the vortex pointing upwards, opposite to what is commonly seen in ordinary vortexes.</p><p></p><p>But the few Wanxian Alliance Hedao cultivators guarding it seemed very nervous.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Fang Zaiji asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"They are stealing the great power of darkness!" The Youzu leader said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan and the others were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Even with the limitations of the dark sea's own power, it still cannot stop these shameful thieves!" The Youzu leader wished he could rush over immediately to stop the Wanxian Alliance's actions.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he still had some reason and only spoke about it without actually taking action.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the scene in his mind, Li Fan asked everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The power of darkness, turning away from the immortal ruins. It's very obvious that the Wanxian Alliance is not satisfied with just the small amount that seeps out during the tidal period. They want to extract the power of darkness on a large scale now," Liuruchen, who had received Li Fan's information sharing, couldn't help but sigh slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in the end, they couldn't resist the temptation to escape the immortal ruins."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what method they used to create this vortex. They couldn't have specially used a small world to attract the power of darkness, right..." Fang Zaiji said casually.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he himself was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"It's not impossible. It's just a small world with no special value. If it can divert such a vast amount of dark power, it's worth it even if it's destroyed," Qiaogong Jushi said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, perhaps we can also imitate the Wanxian Alliance," he even suggested that Li Fan do the same.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that combining this dark power with the essence of source power and using it on the immortal puppets may be able to further create true immortal puppets," Qiaogong Jushi's tone even carried a hint of fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had the same thought, he did not immediately agree with him.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he asked the Youzu leader if he could sense the presence of any corpses left behind by fallen cultivators in the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? If Your Excellency hadn't mentioned it, I almost wouldn't have noticed."</p><p></p><p>"But this doesn't seem to be a corpse."</p><p></p><p>"It's more like just an empty shell."</p>

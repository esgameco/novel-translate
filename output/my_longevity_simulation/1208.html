            <p>Chapter 1206: The Ancient Immeasurable Mirror Covered in Dust</p><p></p><p>"It's really strange. Even the urgent matter of the Heavenly Profound Mirror possibly escaping in the form of a human avatar has been put on hold..."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the fact that we can still communicate with the outside world unilaterally, I would almost think that the Immortal Alliance has already fallen." Sun Luyuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao also looked surprised at this moment: "There's even such a thing? I actually didn't detect anything related to this in the Heavenly Profound Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>The two brothers looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao said a little uncertainly: "I don't know if I failed to detect it, or if the Myriad Immortal Alliance is hiding this even from the Heavenly Profound Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>"The headquarters of the Immortal Alliance is an independent space within the Heavenly Profound Mirror. If they want to shield it from the perception of the Heavenly Profound Mirror, I'm afraid it would require the joint efforts of the Dharma Transmitter Council and the Mirror Holder..." Sun Luyuan's expression was solemn, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"The headquarters of the Immortal Alliance is inside the Heavenly Profound Mirror?" Sun Luyao, however, was not aware of this and was shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Sun Luyuan came back to his senses and nodded, but did not explain too much.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing for us that the old fellow Fu can't spare time to deal with this. Let's take this opportunity to go find that fragment of the Immeasurable Mirror that you sensed."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, brother." Sun Luyao naturally had no objection to this.</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to take you to the 'Essence Blood Pool' to nourish you during this rare gap. We'll have to wait until we come back." Sun Luyuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Essence Blood Pool was a secret place of the Sun family, where the essence blood donated by the direct descendants of the family was stored.</p><p></p><p>With the addition of secret techniques, the effect was even better than the essence blood of Sun Luyuan, who was a close relative.</p><p></p><p>However, the collection of the essence blood of the family members could not be done too frequently at one time, otherwise it would definitely arouse suspicion. So it took a considerable amount of time to accumulate enough for nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao had tasted it a few times before, and it did have some effect.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the methods of the predecessors, it's far inferior."</p><p></p><p>The nourishment of the family's essence blood was, in the end, to strengthen the power of Sun Luyao's remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's own power, the easier it was to erode the Immeasurable Mirror.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan directly demonstrated the method of mastering the Immeasurable Mirror right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he no longer need to use brute force to erode it, but even the damaged and disordered Immeasurable Mirror showed signs of slow recovery, making him no longer feel the previous pain when facing the Immeasurable Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Although he thought this way in his heart, he still had to do the superficial work.</p><p></p><p>So he pretended to look a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan saw this and comforted: "Let's see if this trip goes smoothly. If we come back quickly, there will still be ample time."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Sun Luyuan went back and made some preparations.</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the secret room again, he had already taken on the appearance of a junior member of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>It was Sun Luyuan's usual disguise.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Putting the Immeasurable Mirror in his bosom, Sun Luyuan quietly left the Sun family and headed towards Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this distance was not too far for a Dao-merging cultivator, and they quickly arrived at the entrance of the Hundred Stones Grotto-heaven.</p><p></p><p>According to Sun Luyao's perception, they kept going deeper into the underground cave.</p><p></p><p>When they encountered a dead end, they forcibly broke through it, getting closer and closer to their destination.</p><p></p><p>"What a ghostly place." But the deeper they went, the harder the walls of the cave became, and even Sun Luyuan began to struggle a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, we're almost there." Sun Luyao sensed the familiar aura ahead.</p><p></p><p>Excitement stirred in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because he was too deep underground before, which affected his perception. When he truly arrived here, he discovered that this fragment might be a bit larger than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?! Someone's behind me?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was almost a wall away from the Infinite Mirror fragment, Sun Luyuan's expression suddenly changed, and he stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"I was actually being followed."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan reacted quickly and promptly changed his direction of travel, continuing to delve deeper into the cave.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly accelerating, his figure instantly vanished among the maze-like passages.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two cultivators wearing blue robes appeared, their expressions somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, he still discovered us."</p><p></p><p>"It seems Sun Luyuan's cultivation has improved again."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, we have already sealed off the entrance. He can't escape."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>However, what these two didn't know was that deeper in the cave, Sun Luyuan had already used the Infinite Mirror to observe their every move.</p><p></p><p>"Tianquan, Chen family."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>He naturally had long known about the various little schemes of the Chen family from the Medicine Hall, who had been coveting the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But after all, the other party still had some foundation, and there was no reason to make a move before they took concrete action.</p><p></p><p>"But they've taken the initiative to come to my door, giving me an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>A plan instantly formed in Sun Luyuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Revealing his own aura, he lured the two Chen family members to head deeper underground.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Opening up a sealed cave, Sun Luyuan quickly locked onto the location of the fragment.</p><p></p><p>This place seemed to be the ruins of an ancient sect, and the Infinite Mirror fragment had actually been fused into another mirror-like magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this sect had long been destroyed, and this mirror-like magic treasure had also been buried underground for thousands of years, gathering dust.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that this place was not suitable for staying long, Sun Luyuan had no time to examine it closely and collected it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, no longer bothering to hide, he even burned his essence blood, instantly erupting with all his strength.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had already rushed to the exit of the Hundred Stones Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The two cultivators guarding the entrance were caught off guard and couldn't resist for a moment. They actually let Sun Luyuan charge out just like that.</p><p></p><p>"Chen family! If I don't avenge this grudge, I vow not to be human!"</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't really injured, Sun Luyuan suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and his aura rapidly weakened.</p><p></p><p>His voice was like thunder, echoing in the sky above Shilin Prefecture for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Sun Luyuan transformed into a beam of light and continued flying towards the center of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He left the two Chen family cultivators somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>When the two Hedao cultivators who had been lured away in the cave finally arrived, they realized what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad." The four of them exchanged glances, their expressions gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Now that the matter had been exposed, it was impossible to openly pursue and kill in broad daylight.</p><p></p><p>"This operation has failed. The Sun family will likely completely tear off their mask. Let's return early to discuss how to deal with this."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, at worst, we won't take that magic tool. We'll directly make this matter public. I refuse to believe that his tiny Sun family can still keep this magic tool!"</p><p></p><p>The four Chen family members disappeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>Inside Shilin Prefecture, discussions gradually began to arise regarding Sun Luyuan's furious shout just now.</p><p></p><p>A storm was slowly spreading.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Sun Luyuan had already returned home.</p><p></p><p>He went straight to the underground secret room and took out the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>That's all for today... Too tired after returning from a business trip.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

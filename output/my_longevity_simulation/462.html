            <p>So, please prove it yourself, friend!</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan, his voice stern.</p><p></p><p>Now the pressure was on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>More and more gazes came from all directions, converging on him.</p><p></p><p>Since the friend claimed to be able to deduce future events, then please perform again on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Since the friend can accurately predict the rise and fall of specific items' prices, it must be easy to deduce something else as well. Gongsun Qixuan said in a low voice, showing no room for Li Fan to refuse.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Li Fan had to agree.</p><p></p><p>In that case, I will offer a demonstration! With a polite gesture, he took out the long-prepared Heavenly Dice, closed his eyes and concentrated, standing still in place.</p><p></p><p>The place fell silent instantly, everyone staring intently at Li Fan, waiting for his next move.</p><p></p><p>In the jade slips obtained in the ruins of the Tianji sect, there were indeed some spells for deducing the future.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all minor spells, hitting the mark only one out of a hundred times, requiring a lot of luck.</p><p></p><p>After carefully studying them, Li Fan roughly grasped the method of operation, enough to show off.</p><p></p><p>However, it was absolutely impossible to truly deduce anything.</p><p></p><p>Seeing all the countless eyes on him, Li Fan did not dare to be too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>He prepared himself to run away immediately once exposed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the "Sky-covering" secret technique, enveloping his whole body in a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dice flew to Li Fan, spinning rapidly. The surfaces of the twenty faces flashed scenes of shattered images.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that even though these images were fleeting, they couldn't escape the scrutiny of the hidden cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>So the images shown by the Heavenly Dice were not manipulated by him at will.</p><p></p><p>They were truly events that Li Fan would experience in the future in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>True within falsehood, seemingly real.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could he deceive the people in the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how realistic it seemed, Li Fan knew that this fabrication could not withstand careful scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>So, as the Heavenly Dice spun faster and faster, gradually revealing a dark scene, Li Fan's body began to tremble constantly, his face growing paler.</p><p></p><p>The look of horror on his face grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>[Continued in the next message...]</p>

        <h1>Chapter 901</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's aura weakened rapidly. But his voice was very loud, instantly spreading throughout the entire Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong stared at the scene before him in astonishment, his mind going blank for a moment, unable to react.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure quickly flew towards Zhang Qianmo, while not forgetting to turn his head and throw the jade box containing the three Longevity Fruits in the opposite direction.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong hesitated for a moment, but ultimately chose to go and catch the jade box first.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan bought himself some breathing time.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother?!" Zhang Qianmo sensed what was happening on Li Fan's side and let out a furious shout. His body was like purple lightning, arriving at Li Fan's side in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Take action!" Although he didn't know why Song Hesong chose to make the first move, things had come to this point, and the arrow had to be released from the bowstring.</p><p></p><p>Chu Liang and the other three Wanxian League cultivators who were lying in ambush in the city immediately revealed themselves.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the Longevity Fruits, Song Hesong also slowly flew over.</p><p></p><p>The five of them had unpleasant expressions, surrounding Zhang Qianmo and Li Fan, who seemed to have already fallen into a coma, in the center.</p><p></p><p>The other four stared intently at Zhang Qianmo, while only Song Hesong looked at Li Fan, a trace of doubt flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhang! Long time no see!" Chu Liang said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother? Do I know you?" Zhang Qianmo's cold gaze swept over the other party, his tone revealing a hint of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Chu Liang's voice faltered, and then he became furious.</p><p></p><p>What followed was not much different from what Li Fan had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, in order to protect his heavily injured "junior brother" under the siege of the crowd, Zhang Qianmo revealed his Purple Pill in advance.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the siege of five people, Senior Brother Zhang crushed them with overwhelming force.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he no longer cared about these irrelevant characters and quickly returned to Purple Empyrean Sect with the still unconscious Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the noisy sounds, Li Fan soon felt someone treating his injuries.</p><p></p><p>In order to make the act more realistic, he didn't go easy on himself with that self-mutilation just now.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was not an incurable condition.</p><p></p><p>After slow treatment, the injury finally stabilized and his life was no longer in danger.</p><p></p><p>However, under Li Fan's deliberate control, he remained in a comatose state.</p><p></p><p>At first, quite a few people came to visit.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed and Li Fan still showed no signs of waking up, gradually only Zhang Qianmo would occasionally come to see him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's room became quiet.</p><p></p><p>And so, half a year later.</p><p></p><p>That night, a ghostly figure quietly came to Li Fan's bedside.</p><p></p><p>Just staring at the sleeping Li Fan, it revealed a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>Then, a faint dividing line appeared between him and Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The scene became distorted, and the room was divided into two completely opposite mirror worlds by the dividing line.</p><p></p><p>The figure whose features couldn't be seen clearly also appeared to be heavily injured, lying quietly on the bed.</p><p></p><p>As the dividing line emitted a flickering light, the two mirror worlds gradually approached each other and merged.</p><p></p><p>When the two figures completely fused together, the dividing line also disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In the dark little room, the usual tranquility was restored.</p><p></p><p>However, in the sea of consciousness of the body lying on the bed, earth-shattering changes were taking place.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? This Li Chen's soul is actually an empty shell?"</p><p></p><p>After devouring this Li Chen of Purple Empyrean Sect lying on the bed, the Dharma King of Xuantian Sect didn't gain anything from his soul.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>West.</p><p></p><p>It was like an apple that had been hollowed out by worms, with only the thinnest layer of skin remaining on the surface!</p><p></p><p>The Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect inwardly thought that something was amiss, believing that this was a trap set by the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao to capture him.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, his face changed.</p><p></p><p>Because after merging with "Li Chen's" soul, it seemed that some foreign objects had also appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>They were hidden very well.</p><p></p><p>In fact, due to his shock just now, he had overlooked their presence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, coming back to his senses, this tiny speck naturally could not escape his Dharma Eye.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Discovering that the other party was actually peeking at the memories in his mind, the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect became even more furious.</p><p></p><p>With a roar of his divine sense, he instantly crushed that speck into pieces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that due to this encounter in the Fallen Immortal Realm, his soul had suffered no small injury.</p><p></p><p>The Wuji Yingxu Technique naturally operated, repairing the damage.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was still immersed in the memories he had glimpsed from the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a fleeting glance, it also allowed him to glimpse a large amount of very critical and shocking information.</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian King, Fudu Starry Sky Grand Formation."</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>"Faceless True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>A strange light burst forth from Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect who had possessed Li Chen was named Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient Immortal Cultivation World, before the Xuantian Sect was established, he was a member of the cultivation sect [Nine Refinement Observatory].</p><p></p><p>Later, he was persuaded by the Xuantian King to join the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Darkest Starry Sea, the High Wall."</p><p></p><p>"I never thought I would transmigrate to such a desperate situation."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's heart did not have the slightest despair.</p><p></p><p>After learning about the larger world background, his horizons were also instantly broadened.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my previous idea of escaping the Xuanhuang Realm is impossible to achieve. To seek a glimmer of life, I still have to base myself in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The power of a True Immortal is needed to leap over the High Wall."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan thought of the Treasure Fishing Pool.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to realize a possibility of breaking the situation, and his thoughts turned rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Stone Tablet said before that while we are fishing in the Fishing Pool, the Fishing Pool is also fishing the myriad heavens, collecting treasures from the outside world to supplement itself."</p><p></p><p>"If the information I learned from Mo Rubin's sea of consciousness is true, then the vast majority of the Immortal Cultivation Realms in this starry space where the Xuanhuang Realm is located have long been devoured by the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Then..."</p><p></p><p>"It is very likely that the latest treasures collected by the Fishing Pool come from [outside the High Wall]."</p><p></p><p>"This also means that the so-called High Wall has not been completely sealed."</p><p></p><p>"The inside and outside of the High Wall can still be connected. Just like..."</p><p></p><p>"That Faceless True Immortal Statue."</p><p></p><p>Knowing part of the truth, Li Fan's worry about this stone statue was temporarily reduced by a few points.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, even True Immortals do not want to easily set foot in a place like the Darkest Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>To look on the bright side, this also means that except for that True Immortal in the Immortal Ruins, Li Fan at least does not have to worry about other True Immortals descending and slapping him to death for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"The Darkest Starry Sea. The forbidden land of living beings."</p><p></p><p>"But for me, it is a relatively safe place to develop."</p><p></p><p>"The premise is that I can successfully walk out of this place of death."</p><p></p><p>Knowing a lot of information about the other party, Li Fan's fear in his heart towards the one named Mo Rubin also lessened a lot.</p><p></p><p>He even began to plan how to seek some benefits from the other party.</p>

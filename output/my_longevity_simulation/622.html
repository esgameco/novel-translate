        <h1>Chapter 622</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Since the foundation of Cloud Immortal City by Li Fan in the 11th year of anchoring to the end of the 14th year of anchoring.</p><p></p><p>A total of four years of settlement data appeared in front of Li Fan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"New Immortal Calendar 2021: Comprehensive ranking: 231st, rewarded with a second-class medium-grade merit three times, with a contribution of 11,000 points."</p><p></p><p>"New Immortal Calendar 2022: Comprehensive ranking: 226th, awarded a second-class medium-grade merit three times, with a contribution of 15,000 points. In addition, during the Heavenly Spirit Province Great War, the Cloud Sea region actively responded to the summoning policy of the Immortal Alliance practitioners and performed well. Extra reward: one first-class medium-grade merit."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With the instant retrieval of thirteen meritorious missions, Li Fan's merit level also rose all the way to Yan 22 before stopping.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Li Fan relied on his extraordinary merit in building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array to raise his merit level to 31 just before his life was about to end.</p><p></p><p>And now, almost like acting as an idle boss, he smoothly ascended to Yan 22 without any hindrance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also due to the first-class armor merit bestowed by the Immortal Alliance when Cloud City was founded.</p><p></p><p>The rise in merit level unlocked many hidden techniques and treasures in the mysterious mirror. However, Li Fan had reached even higher levels in his previous life. Upon a glance, he found that compared to his past life, the list only had a few more treasures that could only be exchanged by regional administrative officials. </p><p></p><p>For instance, the Mirror of Sentient Beings, which could monitor the total number and distribution of practitioners in a province. The Myriad States Bell could display the approximate development of other provinces within the year and the predicted ranking of the province in the annual comprehensive assessment.</p><p></p><p>Overall, these were some artifacts that made the internal competition more convenient. For Li Fan, they didn't serve much practical use.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan was more concerned about was the appearance of the date in the settlement prompt.</p><p></p><p>"The New Immortal Calendar..."</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, the New Immortal Calendar was a chronological system implemented since the reconstruction of the Wan Xian Alliance by the Law-transmitting Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan looked through various classics before, all specific time references were intentionally obscured.</p><p></p><p>Only concepts like ancient times, antiquity, pre-antiquity, and vague notions of thousands and hundreds of years ago were mentioned.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Fan had seen a precise record of a specific year.</p><p></p><p>As for Sima Changkong's Bloodline History Book, similar to Li Fan's anchoring years, it took its initial year as the original year. It did not apply to the overall cultivator world's situation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that within the Wan Xian Alliance, there must be a detailed system of historical regulations. It's just kept secret."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't find this surprising. Since the Museum of Divine Treasures preserved various precious relics from the history of the Xuan Huang Realm, it was only natural that there were records of the real history. </p><p></p><p>"The ancient history is not suitable for the masses to mention. Obscure, to maintain stability," Li Fan thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>"I remember that after reaching Yan 30 in authority level, there will be a chance to visit the Museum of Divine Treasures for free." As the skull at the center of the museum flashed in front of him, Li Fan seemed to feel the hunger of the hound again.</p><p></p><p>However, soon after, Li Fan forcefully suppressed the restlessness in his heart. The museum was heavily guarded, with the Sacred Beast Emperor Tri-Mo sitting in it. Taking action recklessly would be equivalent to falling into a trap. At least it was not something Li Fan could covet at the moment. </p><p></p><p>The only way was to gradually enhance his strength in the cycle of reincarnation, discover more secrets, and find a suitable breakthrough. Perhaps then, there would be a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>Closing the record of merit, Li Fan sent a message to Hongxi Immortal Lord, indicating that he had received all his merits from the past few years and thanked him for his guidance.</p><p></p><p>Hongxi laughed heartily, saying nothing more, just encouraging Li Fan to keep up the good work. The thoughts of the people below would be taken care of with his help.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, three days later, Hongxi Immortal Lord, who had returned, gathered all the practitioners within the Cloud Sea to hold a meeting.</p><p></p><p>Just when everyone thought that Li Fan, who had once been prominent, would lose power and fall into obscurity, Hongxi Immortal Lord publicly declared that Li Fan would continue to be in charge of the administration on his behalf.</p><p></p><p>This sudden announcement instantly made the previously anxious He Zhenghao and others overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The other practitioners also looked incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Glancing discreetly at Li Fan's calm face, they were both shocked and fearful.</p><p></p><p>The background behind Li Fan, especially his hidden strengths that forced the ruler of the Cloud Sea for a century like Hongxi Immortal Lord to yield, raised various speculations in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the changing expressions of the crowd, Li Fan bowed to Hongxi Immortal Lord and expressed his gratitude once again.</p><p></p><p>However, Hongxi Immortal Lord just waved lazily, took a step out, and disappeared from the scene.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally understood that Hongxi Immortal Lord was no longer interested in dealing with the trivial matters of the Cloud Sea and just wanted to be an idle boss.</p><p></p><p>But others were unaware of this!</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the figure of Hongxi Immortal Lord leaving seemed somewhat dejected!</p><p></p><p>The truth was apparent! In the power struggle, Hongxi Immortal Lord had indeed lost to Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>A tumultuous wave surged in the hearts of the practitioners, making them lower their heads and avoid looking directly at this vigorous and proud envoy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the reactions of the practitioners, Li Fan knew what they were thinking.</p><p></p><p>But he was too lazy to explain and followed Hongxi's example.</p><p></p><p>"The priority for the affairs of the Immortal Alliance is stability. Everything in the Cloud Sea will remain the same, with Zhou Qing'ang, He Zhenghao, Gao Yuan, and others helping me manage the affairs."</p><p></p><p>Zhou and others were delighted and readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>"That's it for now!" Li Fan waved his hand, said his piece, and then took a step out, disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan left, the Bureau of Politics suddenly bubbled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhou, congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>"Master He, this is truly a cause for celebration!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened in and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>About to return to the Body Transformation Island, he suddenly received another message.</p><p></p><p>"The second Wan Xian Alliance and Five Elders friendly exchange event will be held in Tianling Province in ten days."</p><p></p><p>"On this former battlefield, the two sides will forget their grudges and rebuild new friendships."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately thought of the devastated scene in Tianling Province he had witnessed before.</p><p></p><p>"They chose such a place for a friendly exchange? Isn't it questionable," Li Fan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that on the surface, it's a friendly exchange, but in reality, the tension still persists."</p><p></p><p>After searching for more related information, Li Fan indeed found some peculiarities.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the display of the two sides' "Eternal Weapons of the World," the exchange event would also include competitions like martial duels, debates, and trial matches.</p><p></p><p>Representing the sides would be the finest young talents within their respective organizations.</p><p></p><p>And the entire competition process would be disclosed in real-time.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 915</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>How difficult is it for an ordinary cultivator to change heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Even the long-lived strong ones of the Xuanhuang Realm can only go so far as to reverse some of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the second major part of the "Patching Heaven Records" is a discussion on how to make up for deficiencies and strengthen oneself.</p><p></p><p>Breaking out of the framework and limitations of the so-called cultivation system, starting from the origin of life.</p><p></p><p>It lists more than a hundred possible methods to break through one's own limits.</p><p></p><p>The last and most voluminous part of the Patching Heaven Records is a detailed explanation of how to "heal heaven".</p><p></p><p>If there is an abnormality in the operation of the Dao of Heaven, then like a person getting sick, various "symptoms" will appear.</p><p></p><p>Treating the symptoms with the right medicine is the only way to cure the disease.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Patching Heaven Records is not a cultivation technique. Rather, it is a summary of the Heavenly Doctor's own cultivation experience, a concrete combination of methodology and practical insights.</p><p></p><p>Many of the views and wonderful ideas in it were truly unheard of by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And the many phenomena of abnormal changes in the Dao of Heaven recorded in it also greatly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could almost be certain that the Heavenly Doctor had definitely been to more than one cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Without observing the Dao of Heaven in over a hundred cultivation worlds, it would be impossible to write this vast masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was so engrossed in reading that he couldn't help but have a few more feelings of admiration and wariness towards the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Although he temporarily made the Heavenly Doctor believe that he was the successor of Tian Jue by taking advantage of the information he knew in advance.</p><p></p><p>And Tian Jue himself was crazy and erratic, with his mental state being good at times and bad at others, and he would appear and disappear unpredictably, making it generally impossible to verify Li Fan's claims.</p><p></p><p>But for the Heavenly Doctor, there might be ways to forcibly peek into Tian Jue's mind and memories.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clearly remembered that in the previous confrontation with Tian Jue and Master, the Heavenly Doctor, who revealed his true form, subdued the crazy Tian Jue in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>And even performed "surgery" on him.</p><p></p><p>So, even though Li Fan had achieved a small victory, he did not get carried away.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he tried his best to forcibly memorize this vast "Patching Heaven Records" in his mind first.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Doctor discovered that he had been deceived and came knocking, Li Fan would return it immediately.</p><p></p><p>Even if all the other arrangements in this life were wasted in vain, having this "Patching Heaven Records" was definitely not a loss.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just the worst-case scenario Li Fan had come up with.</p><p></p><p>In fact, according to Li Fan's inference, possessing the heritage of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace and Tian Jue, he could indeed be considered their successor.</p><p></p><p>As for how this inheritance came about...</p><p></p><p>It might not matter at all to the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>As long as the fact that Li Fan possessed the "Returning Truth" was not exposed, the Heavenly Doctor would not do anything against him!</p><p></p><p>The Patching Heaven Records was profound and obscure. Even with Li Fan's current knowledge reserves, studying it was quite a struggle.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the Wanxian Alliance forced the cultivators of the world to cultivate..."</p><p></p><p>"It ultimately facilitated the final transformation of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror into the Mysterious Net."</p><p></p><p>"They are all about making up for one's own deficiencies. Now it seems that these two have something in common. Perhaps there is no difference between the two."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the process of reading, Li Fan suddenly recalled the experience of his previous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>Combining the process of transforming the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror into the Mysterious Net and ultimately replacing heaven with the theories in the "Patching Heaven Records", Li Fan had various insights welling up in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He was instantly overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in his studies, Li Fan didn't know...</p><p></p><p>How much time has passed?</p><p></p><p>When he read the last paragraph of the "Patching the Heavens Record", about the ultimate means of healing the heavens, his whole body trembled violently and he instantly sobered up.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes burst out with an unbelievable light, his body shaking slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He read this discourse carefully and repeatedly more than a dozen times.</p><p></p><p>It was just a possibility speculated by the Heavenly Doctor, and even he himself had never implemented it before.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Crossing Void Grand Formation, capturing other worlds and cave heavens..."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient great war..."</p><p></p><p>"Yunshui Tiangong, Tianjue..."</p><p></p><p>"In the thousands of years, the earth-shattering changes in the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by Mr. Tiandao Bai when he appeared in the 115th world and faced the transmission of the Dharma.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The many clues from the past flashed one by one in Li Fan's mind, mutually corroborating with the contents.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but gasp.</p><p></p><p>"If it's really like this..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he no longer had the intention to read the "Patching the Heavens Record".</p><p></p><p>If his guess was true, then the true strength of the Heavenly Doctor...</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who was very rare, felt a sense of urgency, wanting to verify this guess as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, he still forcibly suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to wait until the next life."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the Heavenly Doctor, I should be the only one who knows the contents of the Patching the Heavens Record. If I probe it in this life, I will definitely be exposed!"</p><p></p><p>"In the next life, everything can be put aside first. I must verify this matter first..."</p><p></p><p>"If it's really like this..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the complacency brought by deceiving the Heavenly Doctor disappeared without a trace in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was replaced by an unprecedented solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Along with it, even this "Patching the Heavens Record", which could be called the supreme Dharma, became somewhat daunting.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Li Fan finally decided to finish reading it.</p><p></p><p>"It cannot be fully learned."</p><p></p><p>"But the viewpoints in it may be used for reference. Transform it to suit oneself."</p><p></p><p>"Absorb its essence, integrate it with my strengths, deduce and create a Patching the Heavens Record that belongs to me."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan's divine sense began to browse the ocean of knowledge in the Patching the Heavens Record again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Sect, Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The clone Li Qing sat cross-legged beside the black sword, feeding the other party with his own sword dao insights.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a large amount of content suddenly appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>They were all transmitted from the original body.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Heaven has flaws, I shall patch it myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing carefully savored the mysteries between the lines, and his eyes couldn't help but become brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>Due to the restrictions of the original body, Li Qing did not know where this profound Dharma came from.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from its exquisiteness, it was obviously impossible for the original body to have comprehended it himself.</p><p></p><p>This point could be almost certain for Li Qing, who was very clear about the original body's aptitude.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the original body should have encountered something extraordinary..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing no longer cared about other things, but focused on studying this Dharma.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of the Sword is one of the Dao of Heaven. Since the Dao of Heaven may have flaws, so does the Dao of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>"So the Wooden Sword Tian's Oddity also instinctively wants to complete itself. This black sword is one of its instinctive attempts."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes were full of brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"The Wooden Sword Tian's Oddity is already infinitely close to perfection. How easy is it to take a step further?"</p><p></p><p>"But perhaps we can take a different path and start from other [Dao]."</p><p></p><p>"This is the so-called 'stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade'."</p>

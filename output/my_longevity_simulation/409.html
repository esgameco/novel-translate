        <h1>Chapter 409</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Thinking about the countless caves and small worlds in the mysterious yellow realm, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>It was the accumulation from previous years that created such a strong foundation for the mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>This enabled it to withstand the looting of cultivators for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"After the death of cultivators in this realm, they will 'return to the heavens'. This is a self-generated response strategy of the world to threats it senses."</p><p></p><p>"This method of retrieval also greatly delays the rate of loss of 'weight'."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'weight' was only Li Fan's term representing the ability of the mysterious yellow realm to resist the attraction of the 'Immortal Realm' in a situation where information was limited.</p><p></p><p>Currently, after the death of cultivators and their return to the heavens, the 'weight' is far less than before their death.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps because the energy returning to the heavens after the collapse of the cave world is intangible. And for the heavens to reconsolidate the energy into tangible 'weight', it takes years of long time."</p><p></p><p>"When the rate of birth of cave worlds is less than the rate of disappearance, the income is insufficient. This will affect the safety of the mysterious yellow realm."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the number of cultivators must be controlled to maintain balance."</p><p></p><p>"This is a possibility."</p><p></p><p>"Another possibility is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"After the fall of cultivators, not all will return to the heavens. A part will disappear instead..."</p><p></p><p>"Some thoughts are terrifying, but they are quite common in the mysterious yellow realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the scene he recorded when the Medicine King Cauldron broke through the boundary and emerged.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the protection of the world, the Medicine King Cauldron, attempting to cross the void, was like a moth flying into the flame, inevitably falling towards the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The strongest fear is the fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Immortal Realm passage from the past become the devouring entity it is now?</p><p></p><p>Does the past Immortal Realm still exist?</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Realm no longer exists, what caused its destruction?</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more an instinctual fear welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan took a deep breath and pushed aside his many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>For now, these things are still too distant for him to worry about.</p><p></p><p>At least after he achieves the status of the Heavenly Emperor of Longevity, then he would need to consider these issues.</p><p></p><p>Putting them aside for now, Li Fan started contemplating his own situation.</p><p></p><p>"Although the world I crossed into is constantly on the brink of destruction."</p><p></p><p>"But on second thought, this situation might even be better for me."</p><p></p><p>"After all, even the lofty Longevity Realm cultivators are essentially like insects on a boat, just as vulnerable as ordinary beings in the mysterious yellow realm."</p><p></p><p>"On this sinking ship of the mysterious yellow realm, the actions of the Heavenly Emperors of Longevity also need some consideration. They can't act recklessly."</p><p></p><p>"In a world where such powerful beings have complete control, and can easily annihilate all living beings with a single thought without any burden, that would truly be irreversible calamity. Even assistance from the 'Heaven's Will' would be futile."</p><p></p><p>"Fortune in misfortune!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven-Sealing Spirit Array is equivalent to the 'nuclear deterrence' that existed in the world before my crossing."</p><p></p><p>"Until the Five Ancients find a way to break it, massive wars are unlikely to occur. Only occasional small frictions may happen."</p><p></p><p>"But this also confirms the disappearance of the Master of Transmission of Law. It's hard to say what will happen in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan summoned his mind panel.</p><p></p><p>"Physical age: 884/899."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, being on a high place lets you see far. In the past, the most I could live without being forced to return was 50 years. 50 years of foresight is enough for mortals. But in this unpredictable mysterious yellow realm, it might not be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in some lifetime, I can try doing nothing and just observe the changes in the mysterious yellow realm. With time settling, I might discover more valuable information."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After organizing his thoughts, to avoid suspicion, Li Fan took out the jade card given to him by the guide Bing Yin and resumed his visit to the Museum of Divine Collections.</p><p></p><p>In fact, at this point in this world, Li Fan could have directly returned. But visiting the Museum of Divine Collections as a significant location within the Immortal Alliance was not an easy feat.</p><p></p><p>Since he was there, he might as well broaden his horizons. Li Fan had been interested in the first head infected with the Immortal and Mortal Miasma in the museum's central area for a long time.</p><p></p><p>According to the guide Bing Yin, based on the nature of the artifacts, the Museum of Divine Collections was divided into several major areas.</p><p></p><p>The area where Li Fan currently was, was the first area that visiting cultivators must explore.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Li Fan looked at the huge sphere floating in front of him, filled with interest as he asked.</p><p></p><p>The sphere consisted of several areas that displayed different scenes. The images flashed at an extremely fast speed, making it difficult to see the details clearly.</p><p></p><p>Not only were there buildings with diverse styles, but many figures could also be seen flashing through them.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that the different areas had distinctly different scenery styles.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Epoch'," Bing Yin explained to Li Fan very professionally.</p><p></p><p>"Using a Core Transcendence Stone as its core, it deduces scenes from various eras in the history of the mysterious yellow realm."</p><p></p><p>"The desolate wastelands you see here, full of ruins, depict the era of the wastelands."</p><p></p><p>"The one filled with blood and killing is the Great Dark Age."</p><p></p><p>"Here, where many figures are flashing through, is the period of the great plague. Hmm, it seems to have simulated the period of the large-scale forced relocation of mortals by cultivators."</p><p></p><p>As Bing Yin spoke, the mentioned era areas would enlarge, allowing Li Fan to barely see the rapidly changing details.</p><p></p><p>"The Core Transcendence Stone..." Li Fan stared at the sphere for a while and couldn't help asking, "And what about the so-called peaceful times?"</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin smiled, "The Core Transcendence Stone is a mysterious object from the ancient Taiyan Sect. It holds the power of transcendental divination and predicting the future."</p><p></p><p>"The results it deduces are indistinguishable between true and false, extremely close to reality."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps for us external spectators, the various different time-space worlds simulated within the 'Epoch' are just illusory existences."</p><p></p><p>"But for the countless beings inside, everything they experience is undoubtedly real."</p><p></p><p>"And when we invest a strand of divine awareness, or even a bit of divine soul into it, we can experience firsthand the events that truly happened in history."</p><p></p><p>After introducing the background of the 'Epoch', Bing Yin continued, "We once conducted an experiment with a million memory-wiped blank divine souls."</p><p></p><p>"Injected into different periods, deduced for five hundred years, and then ranked based on the final results."</p><p></p><p>"And our era, the one controlled by the Immortal Alliance, undoubtedly ranked first."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the survival rate of cultivators or the overall cultivation level of cultivators, they surpass all other eras."</p><p></p><p>"The title of a peaceful era is well-deserved!"</p><p></p><p>Bing Yin said proudly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1222</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist came to report his work to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Of course, more importantly, he was seeking the essence of the Source Power.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing it several times and experiencing a rapid increase in strength, Hundred Flowers had already developed an insatiable appetite for it and found it difficult to let go.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the golden Source Power created by the prayer ceremony of the Youzu people was still slightly different from the true essence of the Source Power.</p><p></p><p>However, for an ancient immortal like Hundred Flowers, being able to progress further was already no different from the real thing.</p><p></p><p>While greeting Li Ping, Hundred Flowers also noticed Qiao Gong and Tian Yang beside him.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Yang appeared to be only a teenager, the power contained within his body made Hundred Flowers secretly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>As for Qiao Gong, Hundred Flowers sensed a familiar aura from him.</p><p></p><p>It was the aura of a cultivator from outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After carefully observing the two for a while, Hundred Flowers did not say much.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment had gathered too many strange and eccentric characters. She had long been accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>This was actually a good thing for her.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the essence of Li Ping's Source Power, Hundred Flowers returned happily.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, who was that?" Qiao Gong asked somewhat uneasily.</p><p></p><p>"Hundred Flowers Daoist, the former sect master of the Heavenly Lotus Sect of the Wansheng Realm," Li Ping introduced concisely.</p><p></p><p>This simple sentence not only shocked Qiao Gong but also made him lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, just like him, she was also a being from another cultivation realm. Could there be more in this small world?</p><p></p><p>With this question in mind, Qiao Gong and Tian Yang, under Li Ping's guidance, took a general tour of the Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>From the Immortal Spirit Tower that released spiritual energy day and night without rest to the Patrolling Heavenly Arrows that guarded vigilantly, everything amazed them.</p><p></p><p>During their journey, the occasional encounters with unfathomable individuals made them realize that the Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment was full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers, and there were many beings like them.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they arrived at the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping returned to his rightful position, looking down at the two, his voice echoing in the empty building.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qiao Gong, I know your artifact refining skills are superb."</p><p></p><p>"I have some ideas for crafting new types of puppets. You might as well take a look."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong was quickly attracted by the plan presented by Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of Source Power, combined with the Shen Hua Dao, and the artifact refining techniques of the Heavenly Machine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Creating beings with their own consciousness, comparable to immortal-level puppets."</p><p></p><p>The more Qiao Gong read, the more excited he became.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the plan was completely feasible. Even many of the ideas within it aligned with his own concepts.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang will also assist you."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping continued, "First, refine some puppets to get started. Once there are no issues, help Tian Yang with his transformation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiao Gong looked at Tian Yang and suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"With Ink Flame as the foundation and the essence of Source Power to help sublimate..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid once it's fully developed, his strength will not be inferior to Xuanhuang immortals!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the possibility of truly giving birth to immortal beings, or in a sense, immortal-level existences, Qiao Gong couldn't help but feel extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Not long after completing the connection with the relevant personnel of the Great Enlightenment, Qiao Gong couldn't wait to start his work.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is ready. Next, we just have to wait for the people from the Medicine King Sect to return," Li Ping thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had long...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>They laid out a vast net, waiting for the Medicine King Cauldron to return to the Xuanhuang Realm, where it would be directly drawn into the Daqi Small World.</p><p></p><p>Although the medicinal pills had little effect on improving the overall strength of Daqi, Li Ping had mastered quite a few vicious pill formulas that could severely weaken the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sacred Emperor sat on the Sacred Emperor's Throne, his mind flashing through all the recent affairs of the Sacred Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Without him having to inquire about everything, it was all orderly and developing steadily in a positive direction.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that under the constant watchful gaze of the Sacred Emperor, no one dared to slack off.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing some minor matters, the Sacred Emperor's thoughts gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he arrived in the dark secret chamber below the Sacred Emperor's Throne.</p><p></p><p>Here, it was like an endless starry sky, with dozens of treasures floating quietly like stars, emitting a dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>The fishing competition of the Sacred Dynasty never stopped for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The treasures fished out from the fishing pool were also countless.</p><p></p><p>The oath Li Ping made at the beginning was not broken either.</p><p></p><p>These treasures were all owned by the people of the Sacred Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for those who, due to their personal temperament or unclear specific use, did not need the treasures, they could also choose to hand them over in exchange for other rewards.</p><p></p><p>In this treasury, there were treasures from the fishing pool that had no owner yet.</p><p></p><p>Most of them, Li Fan didn't care much about.</p><p></p><p>Except for one among them...</p><p></p><p>One of the light clusters in the treasury reacted the fastest. Before the other light clusters made any move, it had already come to Li Ping's side.</p><p></p><p>It kept rotating as if trying to please him.</p><p></p><p>Inside the light cluster, a small kitten could be vaguely seen, looking at Li Ping with eager eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping condensed the essence of the Source Power on his fingertips, and the little kitten instantly understood his intention.</p><p></p><p>It cheered and approached, licking Li Ping's fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Neither beast nor artifact. The vast starry sea is indeed full of wonders. Even such a creature exists." Li Ping couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This little kitten looked harmless.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, when it approached, the golden Source Power net inside Li Fan's body sensed danger and automatically protected him.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed like a living creature, there was not the slightest breath of life.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after it was fished up, it was initially just a small cat-shaped statue.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the lucky angler tried various methods to probe, he couldn't find the use of this cat-shaped statue. In the end, he handed it over to the Sacred Dynasty in frustration, exchanging it for other rewards.</p><p></p><p>At first, even Li Ping did not detect its abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Until one day, he suddenly realized that the treasures collected in the treasury had inexplicably decreased. After using the essence of the Source Power to investigate, he finally caught the culprit.</p><p></p><p>A cat was just one of its forms.</p><p></p><p>After eating its fill, it was about to lazily fall asleep, but it sensed the intention from Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Although still a bit reluctant, considering the future food, the little kitten still let out a weak roar.</p><p></p><p>After a flash of dark green light, the little kitten transformed into a small square box.</p><p></p><p>Around the box, some strange images were engraved.</p><p></p><p>Falling stars, the earth teeming with beasts.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sea, countless huge ships stretched endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Two giant figures confronted each other, with a river of light and shadow dividing them in the middle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Ping held the square box and pointed it at one of the light clusters in the treasury.</p><p></p><p>One end of the box instantly released a faint green light.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping the light cluster inside.</p>

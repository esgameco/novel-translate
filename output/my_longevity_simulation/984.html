        <h1>Chapter 984</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Did I cause the disturbance in the fishing pool? Fellow Daoist, you're overestimating me." </p><p></p><p>The golden figure first made a self-deprecating remark, then began to introduce herself: "My original name is Baihua Daoren, and I am the sect leader of the Tianlian Sect in the Wansheng Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"But that was thousands of years ago."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of melancholy in Baihua Daoren's tone: "Back then, the [Mo] character formula suddenly erupted and swept through the realms. Although the Wansheng Realm tried its best to resist, it still couldn't stop its spread. Left with no choice, we had to abandon the realm and flee. We originally wanted to find a safe place to take refuge, but unexpectedly..."</p><p></p><p>"Wherever we went, it was an apocalyptic scene."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren's golden figure flickered slightly, as if blown by a gentle breeze, revealing her inner turmoil. Even after such a long time, every time she recalled the scenes from back then, it still stirred up waves in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"The calamities faced by each realm were not the same. In the star domains surrounding our Wansheng Realm, the gray mold was like a surging sea, engulfing everything in the world. And in some worlds, distorted creatures appeared and completely destroyed each other in constant infighting, like a bloody purgatory."</p><p></p><p>"If it were just these, as long as we ran far enough, we might still be able to find a glimmer of hope. But..."</p><p></p><p>"Inside the Immortal Ruins, there are [True Immortals]." Li Fan said in a faint tone at this point.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren glanced at Li Fan and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Fallen Star Domains, there are invisible barriers blocking us from leaving. And inside the Fallen Star Domains, there are True Immortals who use the [Ji] character formula to comprehend the Dao, disregarding the life and death of the living..."</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Wait a minute. You just said that there are True Immortals who use the [Ji] character formula to comprehend the Dao? What does that mean?" Li Fan's eyes flashed as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't the True Immortals suppressed by the Ji character formula?" Li Fan raised the question in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren was stunned at first, then suddenly realized: "It seems that Fellow Daoist from the Xuanhuang Realm doesn't know much about the True Immortals, and thus has some misunderstandings."</p><p></p><p>"According to the research of the surviving cultivators from various immortal realms back then, the immortal seal characters such as [Ji], [Luan], [Mo], etc., which caused disasters in our star domains, should all be from the same True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"This True Immortal has the supreme power to concretize the laws of the world into characters. With just a few strokes, they can easily destroy a domain and countless immortal realms."</p><p></p><p>"So, all the calamities we have suffered are the doing of this True Immortal?" Li Fan asked in a deep voice, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Baihua Daoren shook her head in denial: "Didn't I just say that if it were really that True Immortal who made a move, our star domains would have been instantly destroyed. The Ji and Luan character formulas that erupted during the calamities, although they also brought boundless world-destroying disasters, are not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as the True Immortal's methods."</p><p></p><p>"Then it is..." Li Fan was slightly stunned, then suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Imitation?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Back then, the surviving cultivators from various realms, after compiling the records about the True Immortals passed down from each realm, all unanimously came to this conclusion. The immortal seal characters that caused the calamities in the lower realms were all from the same person, or rather, immortal." Baihua Daoren said slowly, but there was no hatred in her tone, only a sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little puzzled: "..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"In our world of Xuanhuang, we have experienced all kinds of tribulations. We know very little about the true immortals. But for no reason, why did that immortal create such boundless killing karma?"</p><p></p><p>"Immortals do not do meaningless things. Just like that immortal in the Immortal Ruins who sat in meditation for ten thousand years, comprehending the Dao of 'Hunger' to the extreme. It was all for the sake of taking a step further and achieving the realm of the 'Nameless True Immortal'," Baihua Daoren said with infinite sighs.</p><p></p><p>"Nameless True Immortal? I have heard of this. Unable to know their name, all records have disappeared..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there are levels among immortals? Are not all immortals like this?" Li Fan humbly asked for guidance.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. When the path of immortality was not yet severed, we cultivators could also ascend and become immortals. Receiving the baptism of immortal spiritual energy and shedding our mortal bodies, we could officially become immortals. Our strength would instantly be turned upside down, expanding by more than a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>"But compared to the 'Nameless True Immortals', there is still a vast difference. Every immortal is an extreme seeker of the Dao. When they can thoroughly grasp one of the world's Daos, they become beings that transcend all things. All their past is erased, and the world cannot know their names. They can only be referred to by the Dao they have mastered."</p><p></p><p>"That nameless true immortal who carved Dao with words, we respectfully call him the 'Inscription Dao Immortal'."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Listening to Baihua Daoren's description of the realms above immortals, Li Fan couldn't help but let his mind wander.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only the Five Elders of the remnants of the Ten Schools of Immortal Dao still retain some information.</p><p></p><p>To be able to encounter a survivor of the ancient immortal tribulation by chance today and learn the secrets of true immortals was definitely no small opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Fan also didn't completely trust this Baihua Daoren.</p><p></p><p>He just listened for now.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren continued, "The Inscription Dao Immortal has already transcended, but he may have left behind a few true inscriptions of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, some unknown changes occurred in the immortal realm, the path of immortality collapsed, and the immortals all fled and scattered. These true inscriptions may have been obtained by one of those immortals."</p><p></p><p>"He copied and wrote down the words 'hunger', 'chaos', 'destruction', etc., wreaking havoc on the world. This must be related to the Dao he cultivated."</p><p></p><p>"'Chaos' and 'destruction' annihilated countless cultivation realms, while the word 'hunger' was obtained by another immortal. Perhaps because the word 'hunger' aligned with this immortal's Dao, he sat cross-legged at the former passage to the immortal realm and began to comprehend it on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"You should know, ten thousand years of time may be extremely long for us. But for immortals, it is just the time for one closed-door cultivation session."</p><p></p><p>"As for what consequences his comprehension of the word 'hunger' will cause..."</p><p></p><p>"We lower realm cultivators are all ants in their eyes. How could he care?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren's words finally contained a few traces of resentment.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing everything the other party said, Li Fan slowly pondered.</p><p></p><p>"These are all your speculations, right? Do you have any substantive evidence?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren shook his head, but he was still very certain: "Back then, our group of survivors who were able to survive the tribulation were all the most powerful people from various realms. With the help of the remnant information from various realms, this is what we deduced..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not the absolute truth, it's not far off."</p><p></p><p>"Especially those who copied the true immortal's seal script and comprehended the Dao of 'hunger', they are only at the realm of immortals. Although their strength absolutely crushes us cultivators, they have not reached the unfathomable level of nameless true immortals." Baihua Daoren's tone carried a sense of pride.</p>

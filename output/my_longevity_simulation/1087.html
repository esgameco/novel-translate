            <p>Chapter 1085: The Mystery of the Ancient Immortal Artifact</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a strong crossbow at the end of its power cannot pierce even a thin silk cloth.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of the Eternal Life Realm, Li Fan's sword probably couldn't even hurt an ordinary mortal, let alone cause any harm to Mr. White.</p><p></p><p>However, even if it didn't leave a single mark, this sword strike ultimately landed on Mr. White's body.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan disregarded his own life.</p><p></p><p>Because of Mr. White's appreciation for talent and his compassion.</p><p></p><p>As they say, a gentleman can be deceived by sincerity!</p><p></p><p>This sword was the answer Li Fan had pondered over these years in the second act of the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The first act tested benevolence.</p><p></p><p>The second act tested wisdom. </p><p></p><p>And this third act should be testing martial prowess!</p><p></p><p>Mr. White wielded his sword to suppress the Heavenly Sword Sect. If one could defeat him, or gain his recognition in the confrontation, they would likely pass the test of the third act.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan had now achieved this.</p><p></p><p>"I concede," Li Fan said, his face deathly pale as if he could stop breathing at any moment, coughing non-stop. He clasped his hands towards Mr. White.</p><p></p><p>Although Mr. White had reversed the process of Li Fan burning his life force, unleashing that [Life Sword] still greatly wounded Li Fan's vitality.</p><p></p><p>Mr. White looked at Li Fan, his expression a bit complex.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said indifferently, "I'm different from you. You always consider too much. As for me, I'll use any means to achieve my goals! Even if it means giving up my own life!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene of the Heavenly Sword Sect had already gradually faded, leaving only Mr. White's figure still clear.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "So what you can do, I may not necessarily be able to do."</p><p></p><p>"But what you can't do, I might be able to."</p><p></p><p>It sounded like a tongue twister, but Mr. White already understood Li Fan's meaning. </p><p></p><p>"Sometimes, if you want to survive, you have to be ruthless."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Li Fan's body also slowly became transparent.</p><p></p><p>And finally completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Mr. White frowned, as if encountering an extremely difficult decision.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, he suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. I always have too many concerns."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, being like him is the only way to ultimately grasp a thread of hope for survival..."</p><p></p><p>Mr. White's figure, along with his voice, gradually fell silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Li Fan didn't know how long he waited.</p><p></p><p>A familiar dizzying sensation came, and the scene before his eyes suddenly became bright again.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he had not returned to the real world, but arrived in a new environment. </p><p></p><p>"My guess was indeed correct."</p><p></p><p>"Although it was a bit inglorious, I ultimately defeated Mr. White and passed the martial test."</p><p></p><p>"Not asking about the process, only proving the result."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a bit of joy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Now let me see, what will the test of this fourth act be?"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, countless information suddenly surged forth from Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>His expression instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's composure, he was still a bit stunned at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He quickly used the Water Mirror Technique and then looked at himself in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>A peerlessly beautiful countenance, making people feel like a refreshing spring breeze, naturally evoking respect and love.</p><p></p><p>This face was all too familiar to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He had even just competed with him not long ago.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Mr. White!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled with shock.</p><p></p><p>There was both pleasant surprise and wariness.</p><p></p><p>The pleasant part was that by borrowing Mr. White's body, he could take the lead in experiencing...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To test the Profound Yellow Heavenly Venerate. From now on, no matter which aspect of cultivation, it will definitely benefit greatly.</p><p></p><p>Be vigilant, the matter of Mr. White borrowing a body to be reborn before will be staged again.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan calmed his mind and began to sort out the information in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, because it was just a test.</p><p></p><p>The memories of Mr. White in his mind are incomplete.</p><p></p><p>There are only intermittent fragments, as well as the "main mission" involved in this test.</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, he has passed the recognition of the Dao of Heaven and officially became the Profound Yellow Great Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"The mission objective is..."</p><p></p><p>"Find the immortal artifacts left in various places in the Profound Yellow Realm and escape from the Profound Yellow Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression instantly became extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>It was completely contrary to Mr. White's behavior that he knew in the past, so that Li Fan confirmed it again and again.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? No."</p><p></p><p>"This is not the test of the Fallen Immortal Realm. But..."</p><p></p><p>"At this point in time, the mission that Mr. White bears on his shoulders!"</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the Profound Yellow Great Heavenly Venerate, the urging of the Profound Yellow Realm's Dao consciousness vaguely emerged in Mr. White's mind.</p><p></p><p>The catastrophe is coming, and it is inevitable.</p><p></p><p>It is better to abandon the body of the world and leave early.</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Yellow Realm is no longer a good place, with demons running rampant inside and the Immortal Ruins coveting outside."</p><p></p><p>"It is better to cross the Immortal Wall and reopen the world outside."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned and slowly pieced together the fragmented memory information.</p><p></p><p>"However, before the immortal path is cut off, the upper realm occasionally bestows immortal artifacts. Some of these immortal artifacts are still sealed in the sect's treasure vault at this time, while others have been deeply buried underground and no one knows about them."</p><p></p><p>"But they can't escape the control of the Dao consciousness of the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Just gather these immortal artifacts and use them as sacrifices. Even without completely destroying them, it is enough to burst out the power to cross the Immortal Wall."</p><p></p><p>An expression that was completely inconsistent with the physique's temperament instantly appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal artifacts? At least no less than ten immortal artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>According to the information transmitted by the Profound Yellow Dao consciousness, each of these immortal artifacts has a power no weaker than the Profound Yellow Mirror.</p><p></p><p>If he could collect them all and use them for himself...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was instantly filled with thoughts.</p><p></p><p>You know, in so many lifetimes of reincarnation, except for the Profound Yellow Mirror and the Fishing Pool, he has not seen the traces of other immortal artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Now it's like being hit by a big gift package. Suddenly learning about the information of more than ten immortal artifacts, how could he not be excited!</p><p></p><p>"Wait, all these immortal artifacts disappeared in real history?"</p><p></p><p>But soon, Li Fan reacted.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered an ancient anecdote he had collected before.</p><p></p><p>When the great calamity descended, the sects were already in chaos due to the incompatibility of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>And the unexplained loss of the immortal artifacts stored in the sects further accelerated the demise of the immortal cultivation sects.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that all those immortal artifacts that mysteriously disappeared at that time were secretly taken away by Mr. White?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>He began to search the information about these immortal artifacts in his mind again.</p><p></p><p>These immortal artifacts were passed down from the upper realm when the immortal path was not yet cut off.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the major sects of the Profound Yellow Realm were not the later Ten Immortal Dao Sects, but had long disappeared in the long river of history.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Reincarnation Sect, the Desolate God Sect, and so on.</p><p></p><p>And the immortal artifacts they possessed were also divided up by the Ten Immortal Dao Sects.</p><p></p><p>However, the immortal artifacts are spiritual and cannot be used by non-orthodox disciples of the sect. So even if the Ten Immortal Dao Sects got most of the immortal artifacts, they couldn't use them at all.</p><p></p><p>Brothers, don't give me monthly tickets this month. The updates this month were sloppy, and I feel unworthy of receiving them. Please vote for "The Ring of Destiny" instead.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1305</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the path to immortality was severed, it had been countless years since the aura of immortals had appeared on the vast lands of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the sacred aura that emerged from the earth and spiraled upwards seemed to bring no benefit to the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it brought a terrifying calamity comparable to extinction.</p><p></p><p>The greed of the cultivators was a hundred times more frenzied than seeing the essence of heaven and earth. They would abandon everything around them to pursue and obtain it. Anyone who dared to block their way was a mortal enemy to be killed. It didn't matter if they were soldiers of the Great Qi or cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Regardless of identity, rank, or cultivation level, they were all the same.</p><p></p><p>The original battle between the Holy Dynasty of Great Qi and the Myriad Immortals Alliance turned into a chaotic slaughter among all cultivators with the release of this immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>With each breath, thousands of cultivators perished.</p><p></p><p>The sky accumulated a thick layer of strange clouds due to the continuous anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Even the terror brought by the Dharma Transmission Patriarch could not disperse it.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Xuanhuang realm, only two armies could barely maintain their sanity in such a terrifying doomsday scenario.</p><p></p><p>One was the Forbidden Army of Great Qi. The other was the Qingxuan Army guarding the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Their common point was that they both cultivated the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>The Forbidden Army of Great Qi was personally taught by the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Army was instructed by the Holy Fetus before leaving the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>As the few lucky ones, witnessing this tragic scene unfolding in the Xuanhuang realm at this moment, their faces turned pale and bodies trembled. Even with the Immortal Heart Mantra automatically circulating to maintain their mental clarity, the instinctive fear in their hearts could not be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Birds, beasts, plants, flowers, and even the earth and mountains in the Xuanhuang realm slowly lost control due to the appearance of the immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>Beasts were like humans, desperately pursuing the immortal aura. Either they succeeded and exploded to death, or they died miserably in the struggle.</p><p></p><p>Although plants could not actively pursue, there were lucky ones that received the immortal aura descending from the heavens without effort. Compared to other living beings in the world, although the vast majority of plants also turned to dust in an instant after obtaining the immortal aura, there were still some that successfully survived under the baptism of this vast power. It was thought that this would create an immortal plant in the Xuanhuang realm. Unexpectedly, not long after, crazed cultivators came after smelling the scent. Although the transformed immortal plants completed their metamorphosis in a short time and gained protective power, they could not withstand the desperate attacks of the cultivators. Before long, they were divided and consumed by the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Then, those who were lucky enough to snatch and swallow the immortal plants also exploded in blood and flesh and turned to ashes shortly after.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, with the filtering of the immortal plants, they were able to enjoy the wonder of the immortal aura for a period of time. Then they perished in intoxication and enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>If there was any existence in the entire Xuanhuang universe that could truly benefit from the innocently spreading immortal aura...</p><p></p><p>Then it was only the Xuanhuang universe itself.</p><p></p><p>Like a long-dried land nourished by a heavy rain from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang realm was shrouded in a fantastical haze.</p><p></p><p>The earth roared, mountains leaped, plains stretched, and the changes of millions of years now occurred in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The sky, which had fallen slightly before to support the Holy Emperor of Great Qi, was now slowly recovering its former appearance and even becoming more distant.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang realm was "growing" at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>In the strange rhythm, the white fog barriers that originally served as the boundaries of various states slowly became dim due to the spontaneous growth of the Xuanhuang realm under the pressure of tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>There were even many barrier structures that directly dissipated after a thunderous bang. Their power was absorbed into the Xuanhuang universe as nourishment.</p><p></p><p>The growth of the Xuanhuang realm brought such a remarkable effect of power increase.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this unprecedented change in the Xuanhuang realm, the three forces that arrived one after another from outer space had different reactions.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was slightly stunned in this earth-shaking change.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, the bond with the Xuanhuang universe that had been formed through various previous measures was becoming more and more faint as the Xuanhuang universe grew. This feeling was like childhood close friends gradually becoming estranged as both sides grew up.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a sense of loss, the Holy Emperor quickly came back to his senses. Seeing the soldiers of Great Qi still fighting endlessly in the world, he moved his mind and directly imparted the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra to all of them. Although there were very few cultivators who could calm down and cultivate in the midst of madness, saving one was better than none.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission Patriarch looked at this scene of drastic change with a somewhat complex expression.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what he was thinking, but the only thing he did was tightly guard the restless Xuanxian Boat beside him.</p><p></p><p>On the Xuanxian Boat, the voices of the elders came.</p><p></p><p>"What a waste, what a waste! The immortal aura is rare in the starry sea! How can it be ruined by these mortals!"</p><p></p><p>"If this old man could obtain a wisp, perhaps I could fully unleash the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters..."</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmission! Step aside! Let our Xuanxian Boat collect some immortal aura, and past grievances can be written off!"</p><p></p><p>Gan Jingda was still able to restrain his inner excitement and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission Patriarch stood tall with his crown, his figure unmoving: "Your Xuanxian Boat..."</p><p></p><p>"Just stay here and watch honestly."</p><p></p><p>"Don't go anywhere!"</p><p></p><p>Gan Jingda snorted coldly, unable to suppress his anger: "What a big tone! If you continue to obstruct, don't blame our Xuanxian Boat for not giving face!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Xuanhuang realm is indeed the last pure land in this starry sea... in comparison, the immortal aura is still a bit more important!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Jingda, don't waste words with this old thing! That's immortal aura! If we can control more of it, maybe we can use it to cross the high walls! There's no need to stay in this darkest starry sea!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the noisy voices coming from the Xuanxian Boat like a vegetable market, the Dharma Transmission Patriarch's expression remained unchanged, only a hint of mockery flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hidden beneath the roar of heaven and earth, faint footsteps sounded behind the Xuanxian Boat.</p><p></p><p>Without any sign, a shadow attached itself to the Xuanxian Boat.</p><p></p><p>In an instant...</p><p></p><p>The entire immortal boat disappeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>As if it had never come to the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The footsteps gradually faded away, leaving only a faint, frost-like aura of death in the original place.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?!"</p><p></p><p>The shadow came and went extremely swiftly.</p><p></p><p>Not only were those on the Xuanxian Boat caught off guard, even the Holy Emperor did not see it clearly.</p><p></p><p>He could only vaguely sense the dense and almost solidified aura of death on that figure.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor couldn't help but look at the Dharma Transmission Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the Dharma Transmission Patriarch had anticipated the appearance of this shadow. Perhaps, the shadow's attack on the Xuanxian Boat was also under the instigation of the Dharma Transmission Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have the ability to make this thing obediently listen. It's just a small hint I gave it."</p><p></p><p>"To deal with that group from the Xuanxian Boat, this thing is the most suitable."</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission Patriarch's gaze had always been tightly focused on the anomalies happening in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>He did not have much concern for the mysterious shadow and the Xuanxian Boat.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the Dharma Transmission Patriarch would not explain to him, the Holy Emperor did not pursue further questions and instead looked down at the world with the same perspective.</p><p></p><p>The drastic changes in the Xuanhuang realm continued.</p><p></p><p>If the overall power of the Xuanhuang realm before the spread of the immortal aura was "1".</p><p></p><p>Then in this short period of less than half a day, the overall power of the Xuanhuang realm had expanded to nearly "19".</p><p></p><p>It was not purely relying on the wonder of the immortal power, but rather acting as a catalyst, allowing the Xuanhuang realm to truly absorb and integrate the origin power from those foreign worlds.</p><p></p><p>If before, it was just a simple blood fusion.</p><p></p><p>Then what the Xuanhuang realm was doing at this moment was like a cultivator absorbing the spiritual energy within spirit stones and transforming it for their own use.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency was countless times higher.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>The remnant world powers that were originally hidden deep within the foreign realms and remained dormant were now also found by the Xuanhuang realm under the instigation of the immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>They became the nourishment for the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha"</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the increasingly rapid aura outside the starry sky, the Dharma Transmission Patriarch suddenly let out a laugh of realization.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission Patriarch's expression suddenly changed as he looked at the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's continue fighting!"</p><p></p><p>Expressionless, in an instant, he unleashed another Palm of Holding Things, attacking the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Without the support of the Xuanhuang realm's power, it was not enough to activate the Eternal Xuanhuang Realm. But after all, he had broken this move before. The golden origin power essence transformed into towering pillars, rising from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Tightly blocking the descending giant palm of the Dharma Transmission Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of collision, the Holy Emperor noticed that the Dharma Transmission Patriarch seemed to not have used his full strength.</p><p></p><p>This Palm of Holding Things was completely incomparable in power to the one he had used in the starry sky before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Holy Emperor saw that after trapping him, the Dharma Transmission Patriarch immediately tried to leave.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be urgently searching for something to stop the drastic changes in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor instantly understood something in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit unbelievable, he still erupted with all his strength and broke free from the Dharma Transmission Patriarch's giant palm.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Heart is eternal."</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Favor lasts forever!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor chanted, and a ray of light immediately shone down from the small world of Great Qi.</p><p></p><p>This was the origin power essence stored in the Holy Heart Temples throughout Great Qi.</p><p></p><p>It was one of the Holy Emperor's last trump cards.</p><p></p><p>Once exhausted, his combat power would be greatly weakened. But at this moment, the Holy Emperor had no hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the diffusion of the immortal aura, the integration of various realms led by the Xuanhuang realm was underway.</p><p></p><p>Things were developing in a direction favorable to the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can stall the Dharma Transmission Patriarch..."</p><p></p><p>"My mission can be considered complete."</p><p></p><p>"Although there were some twists and turns."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor thought in his heart and once again fought with the Dharma Transmission Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Neither of them wanted to destroy the Xuanhuang realm, so they both restrained their power.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the battle between the Dharma Transmission Patriarch and the Holy Emperor fell into a stalemate again.</p><p></p><p>On the vast lands of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were still slaughtering each other to fight for the immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>Tongyuan State.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the immortal aura gathered here seemed to be a bit more than in other states.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the slaughter here was the most tragic.</p><p></p><p>Another fierce battle for the immortal aura ended with a Foundation Establishment cultivator turning to ashes in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Because too many cultivators had died, the competition was not as fierce as before.</p><p></p><p>There was a rare lull in the battle before the next cultivator appeared.</p><p></p><p>A golden light figure quietly arrived before the next cultivator appeared.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the wisp of immortal aura in front, a hint of greed flashed in the eyes of the golden light figure.</p><p></p><p>But this greed seemed to be different from what was revealed by the cultivators of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as the little figure was about to make a move, he suddenly sensed something and looked back.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator with a scruffy face and dark complexion, looking a bit sleazy, was trying to approach.</p><p></p><p>He was even holding a net in his hand, seemingly trying to capture the golden light figure along with the immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>The black-faced man, upon being discovered, hurriedly put away the net in his hand and laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death..." A hint of killing intent flashed in the eyes of the golden light figure.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the person in front of him was really low. He could kill him with a single slap. Yet he dared to have designs on him...</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to make a move, a sense of crisis suddenly arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he abandoned the immortal aura that was about to be within reach and instantly transformed into a beam of light and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the golden light figure disappear in the blink of an eye, Jiao Xiuyuan slapped his thigh in frustration.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I've been following for so long..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He still let him escape!" </p><p></p><p>After a flurry of emotions, Jiao Xiuyuan ultimately chose not to continue pursuing the golden figure.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he solemnly gazed at the immortal spiritual energy that was about to dissipate into the world not far away. </p><p></p><p>More than that, it was an unprecedented caution.</p><p></p><p>Extending his palm, a sprout emerged from its center.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, this seedling grew into a small tree, with lush green leaves swaying in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Carefully guiding this wisp of immortal spiritual energy to the tree trunk, slowly absorbing it.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan closed his eyes, attentively comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed immortal spiritual energy, no mistake." A glint flashed through Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes, followed by surging bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Too strange, with such vast immortal spiritual energy, there are truly too many things that could be done."</p><p></p><p>"Yet it was just wasted like this?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought, the more uneasy Jiao Xiuyuan felt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>In that instant just now, he seemed to vaguely sense a familiar aura. Though it had now vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be my misconception?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, if it was really that group, they would definitely be frantically fighting over the immortal spiritual energy now."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan furrowed his brows tightly. Sensing someone approaching, he flashed away and departed.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance headquarters was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, because the Chuanfa Tianzun had returned to Xuanhuang, all Chuanfa cultivators, Zhangjing people, and even the Huanzhen Xianzi lineage had all temporarily left to have an audience with the Tianzun.</p><p></p><p>During this time, however, an earth-shattering explosion occurred at the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>Not only were many collections inside the Divine Treasury damaged, even the entire Immortal Alliance headquarters suffered intense tremors.</p><p></p><p>The surviving Immortal Alliance cultivators had not even had time to investigate the cause of the accident.</p><p></p><p>They were horrified to discover that the connection between the Immortal Alliance headquarters and the outside world had been severed.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding what exactly happened, the Immortal Alliance was filled with unease.</p><p></p><p>However, the panic had not yet spread to the Hufa Hall, within the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Especially "Sun Ang".</p><p></p><p>His aura fluctuated, his face flushed red, beads of sweat occasionally dripping from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Sun, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>The three had worked together for a long time and had become much closer to each other.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Although he also felt some palpitations, it was definitely not as unbearable as Sun Ang.</p><p></p><p>"After all, he's still too young." Zhang Xu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Something seems amiss." Sun Ang, who was actually Li Fan's true self, said with some unease.</p><p></p><p>"I just tried to contact Elder Xu but received no response."</p><p></p><p>Hua Yueye comforted: "Brother Sun, don't overthink it. Even if some changes occur, nothing will happen inside the Immortal Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu also frowned and said, "Actually, my predecessor who guarded this place also experienced a similar scene. It was about five hundred years ago. Just like this, the space trembled incessantly and lost contact with the outside world. But later, everything was fine."</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope so." Li Fan wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said.</p><p></p><p>The Yanfa Jue space once again fell into an eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>The violent tremors that came from time to time plucked at the heartstrings of the three.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind settled, even ignoring the call of the Yanfa Jue.</p><p></p><p>He didn't feel as unbearable as he appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan felt unprecedentedly well.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal spiritual energy, so this is immortal spiritual energy..."</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the End Separation Disk was emitting a dazzling light never seen before.</p><p></p><p>After truly witnessing the legendary immortal spiritual energy, the last piece of the puzzle for the End Separation Disk to deduce the immortal-level grand formation was finally filled in.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although he had learned the formation diagrams of three kinds of immortal-level formations through various coincidences.</p><p></p><p>Without immortal spiritual energy, it was still a castle in the air, just talk on paper.</p><p></p><p>Although the grand formation was profound, it was still within the limits of the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, the situation was completely different!</p><p></p><p>He had the ability to truly deduce and deploy immortal formations.</p><p></p><p>Although it required guiding the power of immortal spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>But based on the ancient protective formation inherent to the Xuanhuang realm itself, and the newly succeeded Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate.</p><p></p><p>It made Li Fan's plan to activate the immortal formation a possibility.</p><p></p><p>The formation was named Immortal Descent, All Things Return to Void!</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that there were many unexpected changes in this life that caught Li Fan off guard.</p><p></p><p>Including but not limited to the loss of control of the Saint Emperor's avatar.</p><p></p><p>And the fact that he would actually cooperate with Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>"Once one's strength reaches a certain level, it becomes unlikely to control them like chess pieces."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the many backup plans he left behind at least prevented the situation from directly spiraling out of control.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't to the point where he had to hastily return to the truth in this life after making arrangements to this extent.</p><p></p><p>The sudden descent of the Immortal Boat naturally played an indispensable role for Li Fan's Saint Fetus.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he was able to successfully persuade the Immortal Boat to expedition to Xuanhuang was that in addition to collecting ancient records proving that complete True Immortal seal characters might exist in the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>He also secretly controlled cultivators to heavily damage the Immortal Boat's Divine Tree.</p><p></p><p>With the Divine Tree damaged, losing the foundation it relied on to survive, the entire Immortal Boat had no choice but to unanimously decide to expedition to Xuanhuang ahead of schedule.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Boat Elder Council also suspected that someone was secretly instigating and promoting all this to happen.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Divine Tree was severely injured was true.</p><p></p><p>That culprit also self-detonated and perished, leaving no evidence.</p><p></p><p>To continue surviving in this darkest starry sea, coming to the Xuanhuang realm was their only choice.</p><p></p><p>Arriving near the Xuanhuang realm, out of caution, the Immortal Boat did not directly invade Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they planned to first secretly investigate the situation in the Xuanhuang realm and quietly infiltrate and penetrate some of their forces.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could implement their plan, the violent energy fluctuations in the void caught the attention of the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was the battle between Chuanfa and the Saint Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The power displayed by the two Supreme Elders with every move made those on the Immortal Boat extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Boat had no choice but to reveal itself.</p><p></p><p>In the confrontation with the two Supreme Elders, the Immortal Boat consumed a nearly complete set of True Immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Fetus speculated that it should be the character for "Hate".</p><p></p><p>It was personally written by the Grand Elder of the Broken Immortal Tower, Zhong Daoheng, who had never appeared in front of everyone and only focused on studying the remnant power of True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder's strength was unfathomable. For this expedition plan, he released a total of three nearly complete True Immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>However, after the first character for "Hate" did not have a particularly good effect, the people on the Immortal Boat also became cautious.</p><p></p><p>They came up with the idea of forming alliances.</p><p></p><p>But they were forcibly interrupted by the fluctuations of immortal spiritual energy suddenly coming from the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the Xuanhuang realm and saw the true immortal spiritual energy running rampant all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the activation of those True Immortal characters that suddenly came to life, spread throughout the entire Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Immortal Boat went completely crazy.</p><p></p><p>Even the Grand Elder Zhong Daoheng made his first appearance, gazing at the immortal spiritual energy below with a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>"It is pure immortal spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a moment, Zhong Daoheng made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary cultivators have no use for it. But we can."</p><p></p><p>"Guiding the power of immortal spiritual energy, infusing it according to the operation of the original power of True Immortal seal characters..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoheng muttered to himself and gave the final conclusion: "The power unleashed can rival that of a True Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"If we detonate the Immortal Boat's entire stockpile together..."</p><p></p><p>"We may be able to leap over the high wall with this!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoheng's words quickly unified the opinions of everyone on the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>However, just as they wanted to coerce Chuanfa to open up the path.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoheng shouted "be careful".</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>A moment ago, in the Xuanhuang realm where immortal spiritual energy was running rampant.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoheng reacted the fastest, unleashing a character seal.</p><p></p><p>The entire Immortal Boat instantly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The group of people, with cold sweat dripping from their foreheads, looked at the scene outside the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were in a pot, with the Immortal Boat floating on the water's surface.</p><p></p><p>Outside the pot, an invisible existence seemed to be stirring the water in the pot.</p><p></p><p>The water's surface kept rotating, and the Immortal Boat was also drifting unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>The people on the Immortal Boat clearly felt that the surrounding temperature had dropped significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Elder Gan tried to communicate via telepathy.</p><p></p><p>However, this telepathic message seemed to be heard by the formless existence above the pot.</p><p></p><p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p><p></p><p>That figure peeked in, gazing down.</p><p></p><p>The temperature of the Immortal Boat plummeted again.</p><p></p><p>Just from this glance, one-tenth of the lives on the Immortal Boat couldn't withstand it and directly perished.</p><p></p><p>What made the people on the Immortal Boat even more terrified was that.</p><p></p><p>Those who died on the Immortal Boat all turned into a faint white light, passing through the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>Flying towards the outside of the pot.</p><p></p><p>A small ball condensed in the hand of the formless existence.</p><p></p><p>Inside the small ball, those who had just died on the Immortal Boat were lying peacefully!</p><p></p><p>The small ball was put away by the formless existence, seemingly discovering that there were living beings below.</p><p></p><p>It cast its gaze again.</p><p></p><p>This time, it even tried to reach out its hand to scoop up the Immortal Boat in the pot.</p><p></p><p>The entire Immortal Boat fell into a deep chill.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment, Zhong Daoheng once again unleashed a set of True Immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, as if forgetting what had happened before, it slowly stopped trying to scoop up the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>Only still stirring the water in the pot.</p><p></p><p>Never leaving.</p><p></p><p>With the previous lesson learned, the people on the Immortal Boat no longer dared to communicate with divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they switched to the most primitive method of communication, using their hands as pens, gesturing and writing in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhong, what exactly is that thing outside?"</p><p></p><p>"Its gaze seems to be able to absorb the vitality of living beings. That glance just now brought great casualties to the Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it doesn't seem to differentiate based on cultivation level, it seems to be random..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang realm actually has such a terrifying existence?!"</p><p></p><p>Fear, accompanied by chaos, condensed within the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, he was gazing outside the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>That formless existence, he had seen it in this life before venturing out of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the mysterious existence encountered when exploring the Reverse Life and Death Grand Formation with Shao Jun.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking that the entire small world of the Reverse Formation was just one of the nine Yin-Yang Pearls.</p><p></p><p>Within each Yin-Yang Pearl, there were countless frozen cultivators who had passed away.</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa is actually able to control this formless existence..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is indeed a connection between him and the Wangsheng Tianzun."</p><p></p><p>"This existence has an ancient aura and should have existed since the ancient Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this thing again, the insights in Saint Fetus Li Fan's heart were already different.</p><p></p><p>And Zhong Daoheng's subsequent analysis also confirmed his speculation.</p><p></p><p>"This thing should not be a living being."</p><p></p><p>"In the records of the Immortal Boat, there may be a passage that can correspond to it."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoheng's fingertips slid quickly in the air as he explained his guess.</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient cultivation world, those who had close ties with the upper realm, in addition to setting up the position of Great Celestial Venerate to be responsible for communication with the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"To prevent possible loss of control, they would occasionally also establish so-called Watchers."</p><p></p><p>"Watchers do not necessarily exist in every cultivation world, and may not even be living beings or cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"But undoubtedly, they undertake the mission bestowed by the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"A task completely different from the mission of the Great Celestial Venerate."</p><p></p><p>The auras of the people on the Immortal Boat became obviously chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The creation of the immortal realm clearly exceeded what everyone could handle.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because they were skilled in mastering the power of True Immortal seal characters, the people on the Immortal Boat were extremely clear about how powerful immortals were.</p><p></p><p>And how could a Watcher granted a mission by immortals possibly be weak?</p>

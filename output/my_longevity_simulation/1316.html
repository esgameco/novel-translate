        <h1>Chapter 1316</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Before dying, I finished that off with him. These 100 worry-free coins should be the reward for the kill," Sun Erlang was not foolish at all. After briefly recalling, he guessed the origin of the worry-free coins on his body.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, what exactly did we just experience?" Wang Xuanba shuddered, subconsciously touching his chest. It felt as if the wound that pierced through him still existed. </p><p></p><p>"Was it a dream? But the feeling before death was too real," Wang Xuanba muttered.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang stared at the few lines of small characters in front of him, trying to find more useful information. </p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, apart from these phrases themselves, there was no other explanation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we still have to explore on our own," Sun Erlang's expression didn't look too good.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yue Zhenwei suggested, "Why don't we go check out the situation at the border where we encountered the dog-headed demonic beasts again?"</p><p></p><p>"The strength of those two demonic beasts was actually about the same as ours. As long as we're careful and don't get ambushed, it should be fine."</p><p></p><p>"Good! I also want to take revenge on them! Dying just now was too stifling!" Wang Xuanba's eyes revealed a fierce light.</p><p></p><p>The three headed towards the border of Qiuxizhou again.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, however, Sun Erlang discovered that the cultivators they encountered seemed to have increased compared to before. And they no longer looked depressed, but rather gathered in groups of three to five, as if discussing something.</p><p></p><p>When Sun Erlang and the others wanted to get closer to eavesdrop, they found that these people did not communicate with each other using sound or spiritual sense, but rather a mode of communication that they could not observe.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can ask them," Wang Xuanba's eyes flickered as he looked at the five cultivators at the middle stage of Foundation Establishment gathered not far away.</p><p></p><p>Yue Zhenwei stopped him, "Don't be impulsive, Xuanba! If nothing unexpected happens, these people should be the same as us and can be revived. For people who don't even fear death, brute force is useless in getting anything out of their mouths..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the target location first!" Sun Erlang also growled softly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba nodded and finally shifted his gaze away.</p><p></p><p>In this life, the young Sun and Wang had learned formidable skills at the Lecture Platform. They were already arrogant at a young age, and after leaving Great Xuan, they could easily break through any formations they encountered. Therefore, they were even more conceited in their hearts. It was only after being schemed and ambushed by the demonic beasts previously that they restrained themselves somewhat.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the place where they had "fallen" before, the scene they saw surprised the three of them. "Why is the world on the other side different from what we saw last time?"</p><p></p><p>The giant rock scene on the beach of Shilin State had disappeared, replaced by a murderous sword forest. Millions of rotten swords were thrust into the ground, swaying with the gentle breeze.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because they were too close, at the moment when the rotten swords in the sword forest trembled together, Sun Erlang seemed to hear a simultaneous sword cry in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart trembled, and he instinctively tilted his head to dodge.</p><p></p><p>An invisible sword aura grazed his cheek, slicing off a piece of flesh. Ignoring the pain on his face, Sun Erlang retreated hastily. It wasn't until the sense of danger faded that he stopped. Without a doubt, if he had failed to dodge just now, it wouldn't have been just a minor flesh wound.</p><p></p><p>"This world seems to be more dangerous than the three we encountered last time?" Yue Zhenwei frowned and guessed.</p><p></p><p>Next, the three of them roughly investigated all the worlds adjacent to Qiuxizhou.</p><p></p><p>Sword forest, deep valley. There was also a place that seemed to be the location of a certain demonic sect. Inside, there were no less than a thousand ferocious and vicious cultivators gathered.</p><p></p><p>From a distance, one could see these demonic cultivators eating humans, taking pleasure in torturing people, and refining instruments from human bones.</p><p></p><p>That hellish scene made Wang Xuanba's blood boil, and he wished he could charge over immediately to exterminate the entire demonic sect.</p><p></p><p>However, Wang Xuanba was only impulsive, not stupid. In the end, he did not act rashly, only spitting fiercely towards the other side.</p><p></p><p>The three gathered again to discuss, "Should we first inquire about some common knowledge from the local cultivators here, or try to venture into other worlds again?"</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators of the Worry-free Utopia clearly know some rules that we are unaware of.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible that their lives are worry-free, but they might also be trapped here forever."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we try soul search? The sage teacher taught about this aspect. Although I haven't formally used it on cultivators, I think we can give it a try," Wang Xuanba was eager to try.</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget, we are likely in a dream realm now. The soul search technique may not work," someone said.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, they still decided to try it first.</p><p></p><p>"Find a lone cultivator with weaker strength."</p><p></p><p>"Knock them out first."</p><p></p><p>The three searched in Qiuxizhou for half a day before finally finding a suitable target.</p><p></p><p>This person seemed to be only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, and appeared to have somehow become separated from his team, anxiously searching around.</p><p></p><p>"Move!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shout, the three unleashed their lethal moves simultaneously on that Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Black whirlwind, gray giant axe, and Yue Zhenwei's purple air long sword.</p><p></p><p>However, to the three's astonishment, their all-out strike, powerful enough to severely injure a Spirit Embryo cultivator, did not cause any damage to the Foundation Establishment cultivator before them!</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivator flickered, and all the attacks missed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Sun Erlang and the others with an expression of disbelief, and instinctively took a step back.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Sun Erlang noticed that the few lines of characters constantly displayed in front of him flickered.</p><p></p><p>There was no other change.</p><p></p><p>Only the number of worry-free coins had become zero.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba also transmitted a wail, "How can the Utopia coins be negative? 100 were deducted!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Zhenwei's expression also darkened considerably, "Me too."</p><p></p><p>In the brief moment they were communicating, a white light suddenly emerged from the body of the attacked Foundation Establishment cultivator. The white light engulfed him, and finally looked at Sun Erlang and the others with a foolish gaze before the Foundation Establishment cultivator vanished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The three from Great Xuan looked at each other speechlessly in silence.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this should also be a natural restriction within the Utopia. We are of the same kind as these cultivators, while the monsters we encountered before, including those in the border worlds, are perhaps another kind. Cultivators cannot attack or even harm each other, and will be punished. But killing the monsters in the border worlds will earn rewards including worry-free coins..." After a brief dejection, Sun Erlang quickly cheered up again, recalling and summarizing their experiences.</p><p></p><p>"We cannot confirm what consequences will arise if too many worry-free coins are deducted. But we'd better not try. Let's go to the border world first and earn back the negative worry-free coins."</p><p></p><p>If they can't even attack, what's the point of soul searching!</p><p></p><p>Venting their pent-up frustration, after discussion, they ultimately chose the demonic sect world, which seemed the most dangerous among the three border worlds, based on their intuition.</p><p></p><p>"Although that hellish place looks like it has many enemies, how powerful can cultivators who refine magic weapons from ordinary human corpses be?"</p><p></p><p>"Their spells are also crude and unrefined. They may scare ordinary people, but my axe can easily shatter through their flashy tricks," Wang Xuanba said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"However, we still need to be careful. After all, we've already died once. I have a feeling that this number of deaths may be even more important than the worry-free coins," Yue Zhenwei said solemnly, looking at the constantly flickering characters in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After making their plan, the three charged into the demonic sect world with their backs against each other.</p><p></p><p>The myriad demonic cultivators in the sect world were stunned by the three who descended from the heavens. After a momentary daze, they shouted in a language Sun Erlang didn't understand and swarmed to attack.</p><p></p><p>With bloody auras and resentful souls, they looked terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>However, a single gray giant axe easily tore apart the bloody resentful souls jointly released by hundreds of demonic sect cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The axe's momentum didn't diminish as it swept left and right. With each swing, it could take the lives of dozens of demonic sect cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba's eyes were bloodshot with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Erlang, these beasts are even weaker than I imagined!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang, who was also rapidly reaping the demonic sect cultivators, did not respond in agreement. Instead, a sense of unease welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just like when they faced the dog-headed demonic beast whose head had already been severed!</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang immediately scanned his surroundings, searching for the real target while eliminating the enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Look over there!" Yue Zhenwei reminded Sun Erlang to observe the giant statue standing within the demonic sect.</p><p></p><p>This statue did not appear when they observed the world from the outside before.</p><p></p><p>Even after Sun Erlang descended into this world, it remained hidden.</p><p></p><p>It only manifested itself unknowingly to the three of them as the battle gradually intensified.</p><p></p><p>The statue seemed to be stitched together from countless human corpses, emanating a towering evil aura.</p><p></p><p>And the statue's face had no specific features.</p><p></p><p>Only countless protruding pale white arms were constantly waving.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Sun Erlang and the others killed a demonic sect cultivator, another pair of arms would extend from the statue's face.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's slaughtering movements paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>But the frenzied demonic sect cultivators had no intention of sparing them. They did not even fear the deaths of their companions, casually stuffing the scattered corpses and remains into their mouths, and then howling as they launched even more manic attacks.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do? Kill or not kill?"</p><p></p><p>It was clear that killing the demonic sect cultivators would somehow charge the giant statue. Watching the countless pale white arms grow like bamboo shoots after the rain, Sun Erlang couldn't help but tremble in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he still responded resolutely, "Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Purple air howled, and the long dragon bowed its head. With a single strike, thousands of demonic sect cultivators were slaughtered, and the encircling tide-like enclosure was instantly emptied.</p><p></p><p>However, the fearless and undaunted demonic sect cultivators soon filled this gap again.</p><p></p><p>The only consolation was that these demonic sect cultivators were not endless. As the trio from Great Xuan fought and killed, these cultivators who seemed human yet inhuman, swarming from all directions, finally began to slowly diminish from their sight.</p><p></p><p>No one knew how long had passed, but the nauseating smell of blood in the air almost condensed into a physical form. Even if Sun Erlang and the others sealed their sense of smell, they still could not prevent this bloody scent from penetrating their souls.</p><p></p><p>The vast demonic sect was covered in the shattered remains of dead cultivators. Blood flowed like rivers, as if being gradually devoured by the breathing of the demonic sect land.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang panted heavily, his hands trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>These demonic sect cultivators were indeed pitifully weak, no match for the trio from Great Xuan. But their sheer numbers were simply too overwhelming. Even if they just stood there and let the cultivators kill them, it would have made Sun Erlang's hands go soft.</p><p></p><p>"If I were at the Spirit Embryo realm, where would I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In such a sorry state?" </p><p></p><p>"With the Grotto-Heaven to replenish spiritual power, I'm not afraid of this human sea tactic at all."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang couldn't help thinking this in his mind. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it seemed like he realized something, slightly frowning: "A difficulty level that's just right?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment in the Demon Sect, apart from the Great Xuansanren trio, only that huge statue stood towering. </p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Sun Erlang and the others didn't want to eliminate the hidden dangers in advance, but there was an invisible barrier blocking their way.</p><p></p><p>Unable to attack preemptively, they could only wait for the huge statue to complete its final metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom...</p><p></p><p>The entire Demon Sect base began to violently shake.</p><p></p><p>The originally motionless huge statue suddenly came to life.</p><p></p><p>Lowering its head, it gazed down at the Great Xuansanren trio below.</p><p></p><p>A pair of arms fell off from the statue's face.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish.</p><p></p><p>More and more arms fell, like a torrential downpour.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang and the others blocked these falling arms outside their bodies, their expressions solemn as they watched the statue gradually reveal its true face.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly the face of a pig.</p><p></p><p>The pig's face had a compassionate expression, its eyes showing sadness. Looking at Sun Erlang below, it seemed endlessly regretful.</p><p></p><p>As if they had committed some unforgivable sin!</p><p></p><p>Being gazed at by the huge pig-headed statue, Wang Xuanba suddenly felt a nameless anger rise in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Sensing that the invisible barrier blocking him had disappeared, he was the first to charge up.</p><p></p><p>"Today grandpa will make your pig head into a drinking snack!" Wang Xuanba roared, his gray giant axe having grown to the same size as the statue.</p><p></p><p>Aiming at the pig's face, he fiercely chopped down.</p><p></p><p>The pig-headed statue didn't dodge or evade, the compassionate sad look still in its eyes. But it opened its mouth, revealing the ferocious teeth inside.</p><p></p><p>It directly bit down on the giant axe.</p><p></p><p>And then chewed.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The gray giant axe instantly shattered into countless pieces, even the ash was chewed and swallowed by the pig-headed statue.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba violently spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, but a hint of madness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Explode!"</p><p></p><p>The countless ashes in the pig statue's mouth suddenly danced like a group of dragons. Its cheeks slightly bulged, as if about to burst.</p><p></p><p>But what left Wang Xuanba dumbfounded was that the pig statue took a deep breath and actually managed to swallow all the ashes into its belly.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that this gray giant axe was no ordinary treasure weapon, but Wang Xuanba's own foundation-establishing miraculous artifact: the Mottled Time Axe. It was a reward personally bestowed by the Holy Master, ranking third on the Tao Discussion Platform.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba had achieved the Golden Dan by comprehending the principles contained within this miraculous artifact.</p><p></p><p>The ashen force of the stone axe contained the principles of the flow of time and aging, injuring people with the power of passing years.</p><p></p><p>Yet after the pig statue swallowed all the infinite ashes from the axe, it showed no side effects whatsoever. In fact, the statue's body seemed to become even more refined.</p><p></p><p>With his foundation-establishing miraculous artifact devoured, Wang Xuanba's aura visibly plummeted.</p><p></p><p>Severely injured and barely clinging to life with no strength left to fight, Wang Xuanba was in dire straits before Sun Erlang and Yue Zhenwei could even lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the pig statue absorbing the ashes, Sun Erlang transmitted his voice: "There must be something wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"The worlds within the Carefree Utopia should be some kind of test. With the power the pig statue has revealed, even a Yuan Ying cultivator couldn't contend against it. For us Golden Dan cultivators, it's a dead end. There's no way we can pass, so it wouldn't be a test anymore..."</p><p></p><p>"So there must be some detail we've overlooked within this Demon Sect base." Yue Zhenwei also realized this and examined the surroundings again.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the ashes of the Time Axe, the pig statue's aura became unstable, as if it was comprehending something and about to break through to become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, we don't have much time left."</p><p></p><p>They had already carefully searched this Demon Sect base more than once. Apart from the bones of Demon Sect cultivators littering the ground, there was nothing else hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the key to breaking this deadlock?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the crisis, Sun Erlang felt himself becoming calm instead.</p><p></p><p>From the scenes they saw before entering the Demon Sect to everything experienced in battle, countless images slowly replayed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Master once said, when you reach an impasse, seek change."</p><p></p><p>"To the Demon Sect, we outsiders are variables. But these variables can only slaughter the cultivators, yet are no match for this huge statue. So..."</p><p></p><p>A ray of light flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes: "We need to seek more variables!"</p><p></p><p>"These variables cannot possibly come from outsider cultivators like us. Rather..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart was suddenly enlightened. He quickly transmitted his voice to Yue Zhenwei: "Bypass the pig statue! Attack the sky!"</p><p></p><p>A black whirlwind shot towards the heavens. Sun Erlang's figure merged with it, soaring upwards.</p><p></p><p>This black demonic wind was naturally Sun Erlang's foundation-establishing miraculous artifact, the Extinction Demonic Wind, also personally bestowed by the Holy Master.</p><p></p><p>The pig statue, in the midst of absorbing and evolving, sensed Sun Erlang's actions. That seemingly eternal compassionate gaze suddenly revealed anger and fear.</p><p></p><p>It let out its first roar since the battle began.</p><p></p><p>Just as it was about to stop Sun Erlang, a purple sword energy flew straight at it.</p><p></p><p>The purple energy crisscrossed like the rising sun.</p><p></p><p>It was the Profound Purple Firmament Sword, Yue Zhenwei's foundation-establishing miraculous artifact personally passed down by the Holy Master!</p><p></p><p>Dragon roars echoed within the purple energy.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of that momentary pause, Sun Erlang's black demonic wind had already broken through its defenses.</p><p></p><p>Fiercely striking the heavenly canopy above.</p><p></p><p>Cracks began appearing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even the high-hanging sun showed inch-by-inch cracks.</p><p></p><p>The false sky shattered completely.</p><p></p><p>Countless fragments rained down, revealing the truth above.</p><p></p><p>It was merely a huge dark cave.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the false sky caused the pig statue to let out an almost maddened roar.</p><p></p><p>But it no longer had any intention of dealing with Yue Zhenwei and Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that something extremely terrifying was about to happen, as a ray of light shot out from the pig statue, trying to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic beast!"</p><p></p><p>A voice like thundering erupted from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Then a purple lightning bolt appeared in midair, directly striking that escaping ray of light!</p><p></p><p>With a miserable scream, the being within was reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang vaguely saw that it was actually a pig demon that seemed to have just been born.</p><p></p><p>The purple lightning descended without warning, easily killing the pig demon, and did not appear again.</p><p></p><p>In this Demon Sect, apart from the Great Xuansanren trio, there were no other living beings.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang only felt a profound weariness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>While Wang Xuanba and Yue Zhenwei felt immense relief, they also found it somewhat strange: "Was it really that simple to win?"</p><p></p><p>"There was no need to fight desperately against that terrifying pig statue. We just had to break through the false sky above, and this pig demon would be struck by heavenly lightning?"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of thing is this? Didn't I struggle in vain?!" Wang Xuanba coughed lightly and complained.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene suddenly froze at his complaint.</p><p></p><p>Then, it shattered like countless pieces of glass breaking apart simultaneously. </p><p></p><p>Countless images of the same world flooded into the three's minds. Their brains bombarded by the rapidly moving shards, a wave of dizziness passed before...</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Meeting Hall, Qingxi Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? I'm fine again." Wang Xuanba, whose cultivation had plummeted to the Refinement realm and was on the verge of death after the Demon Sect battle, had now recovered to his normal Golden Dan level.  </p><p></p><p>Not only that, there wasn't even a trace of injury on his body. As if the life-and-death battle they just experienced was merely a shared dream.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that what they went through was definitely not as simple as an ordinary dream.</p><p></p><p>"The sky has returned to its normal bright color," Yue Zhenwei observed their surroundings and remarked.</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Tally is finally not negative anymore. It's at two hundred now!" Wang Xuanba checked and said with relish.</p><p></p><p>Although they still didn't know the purpose of this Carefree Tally.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang stared at the few lines of small words in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Erlang, Golden Dan, Death Count: 1."  </p><p>"Utopia Experience Level: 1."</p><p>"Carefree Tally: 500."</p><p></p><p>After the Utopia Experience Level, a small progress bar appeared.</p><p></p><p>A pinkish hue filled almost 30% of its length.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these changes in data, Sun Erlang's mind also gained some other things.</p><p></p><p>"Humans, the foremost among the myriad beings."</p><p>"Consuming the human brain can increase wisdom."</p><p>"Consuming the human liver can improve eyesight."  </p><p>"Consuming the human kidneys..."</p><p></p><p>One statement after another constantly surfaced in Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>There was no sinister or evil aura, only pure reasoning and explanations.</p><p></p><p>However, when the memories of tasting and experiencing the consumption of the corresponding organs synchronized with his heart, that utterly realistic feeling, as if he had personally tried it, finally made Sun Erlang unable to endure it any longer.</p><p></p><p>He immediately started vomiting uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Sun Erlang suddenly retching nonstop, Wang Xuanba and Yue Zhenwei were both puzzled until Sun Erlang struggled to his feet and explained his experience.</p><p></p><p>Their faces also turned somewhat pale.</p><p></p><p>"This...Second Brother, you're not going to develop a taste for human flesh, are you?" Wang Xuanba's head shrank back.</p><p></p><p>"This Devouring Spirit Technique should be the cultivation method of that pig demon. By passing the test in the boundary world, we can bring back any items that appeared?" Yue Zhenwei seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, try circulating this Devouring Spirit Technique," he suggested.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba was startled, but Sun Erlang slightly nodded after his complexion eased.</p><p></p><p>Forcefully suppressing his nausea, he closed his eyes to sense it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he looked at Yue Zhenwei: "I don't sense any other practitioners of this technique."</p><p></p><p>Yue Zhenwei stroked his chin: "The Carefree Utopia has existed for so many years, yet this Devouring Spirit Technique has no other practitioners..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba's expression turned solemn: "I understand now, there's a problem with this technique."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang shook his head slightly: "That's not the key point. Although the Devouring Spirit Technique was used by that pig demon to devour humans, its targets are not limited to just humans. Any being with spiritual essence can be devoured."</p><p></p><p>"So, although not as good as the Holy Master's personal teachings, this Devouring Spirit Technique can definitely be considered an extraordinary technique. One can cultivate it all the way to the Yuan Ying realm without issues. Even after Yuan Ying, one can continue practicing by constantly devouring spiritual beings to increase one's strength."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba also understood: "Such a technique appeared in a world that newcomers like us would experience. Yet there are no traces of anyone else practicing it..."</p><p></p><p>"There are two possibilities. First, the dream realm of this Carefree Utopia is not bound by the principle that prohibits sharing the same technique."</p>

            <p>第1283章 初试灵虚阵（7K）</p><p></p><p>李凡闻言，顿时一惊："怎会如此？难不成，这玄黄界还会跟传说中的仙界有什么瓜葛不成？"</p><p></p><p>艾天觉语气莫名道："呵呵，琢磨不定、琢磨不定啊！这玄黄界的历史，可颇有点意思。等从那蓝羽脑子里挖出来更多，说不准那几个老东西会改变主意。"</p><p></p><p>"就是不知，对我仙舟而言，是福是祸了。"</p><p></p><p>艾天觉说完沉默了片刻，方才开始为李凡正式授课起来。</p><p></p><p>李凡这一声声老师、可不是白喊的。</p><p></p><p>没有法不可同修的限制，这里的师徒之间传承的，都是真正妙法。</p><p></p><p>李凡拜入艾天觉门下五年，得其认可，得授【玉虚内景泣灵功】。</p><p></p><p>这门玄功，也正是艾天觉自己修行的根本功法。</p><p></p><p>"坎离乾坤倒，玉虚玄功妙。碧海炼真空，泣灵化神通……"</p><p></p><p>艾天觉手握一卷发光书本，缓缓诵读【玉虚内景泣灵功】内容。</p><p></p><p>而李凡也跟在后面默默诵读。</p><p></p><p>别看只是一字一句的朗读、并没有详细的讲解，但随着艾天觉的抑扬顿挫、宛若道律的声音传入耳中，李凡脑海中就自然而然的浮现出，诸多艾天觉对【泣灵功】的感悟。</p><p></p><p>这种授课方式，实际上也是一种仙舟通用的教学功法。</p><p></p><p>或者与其说功法，更像是一门神通。唤作【众生觉】。</p><p></p><p>据说也是仙舟自星海残界中搜刮而来，大大减轻了仙舟传承教学的难度。一经推出，广受好评，风靡仙舟。</p><p></p><p>【众生觉】的教学效果，跟老师与学生的资质以及领悟能力息息相关。</p><p></p><p>艾天觉乃是断仙楼最顶尖强者之一，对真仙篆字都能研究的颇为深刻，其能力毋庸置疑。</p><p></p><p>而李凡附着的这具赵闲身躯，资质也绝不算差。加之李凡多年轮回、见闻广博，所以他修行【泣灵功】的进度也是突飞猛进。</p><p></p><p>这玉虚内景泣灵功，乃是玄仙舟自古相传一门绝顶神通。据说还是上古仙路未绝之时，玄商仙舟用一至宝跟一修仙大界门派兑换的绝妙功法。</p><p></p><p>玄商仙舟中人，常年穿梭于星海之内、往来各个修仙界中，居无定所、难以真正静心修行。</p><p></p><p>而这泣灵功则是很完美的解决了这两个痛点。</p><p></p><p>功法本质，就是于自身神魂内部，搭建内景天地。</p><p></p><p>于内景天地中，泣灵而修。泣者，哭也。</p><p></p><p>泣灵，非是要在修行中哭泣。而是效仿人本能哭泣时，那自然而然、由心而生的顺畅之感。</p><p></p><p>久而久之，内景天地中一切、皆是随心而动。</p><p></p><p>别的功法，随着境界的提高、修行速度就会变得逐渐缓慢。而这泣灵功，则是初期进度很慢，需要体验、真正与自身内景天地搭建情感联系。越到后面，修炼越快。</p><p></p><p>泣灵功无需闭关，哪怕小半天的功夫，也能加深内景天地的情感关联。并且越是心思活络、感情细腻者，越适合修行。</p><p></p><p>虽然距离李凡上次哭泣，已经不知道是什么时候了。但对于能后化假为真的李太师而言，模拟重现自身哭泣时候的情感波动，并非是什么难事。</p><p></p><p>并不清楚艾天觉其他弟子的修行速度如何，但从每次他都让李凡单独上课这一点，就足以看出艾天觉对李凡的重视。</p><p></p><p>而李凡则是依旧闭眼，好似还沉浸在艾天觉的言传身教中。</p><p></p><p>"可有不明之处？"艾天觉问道。</p><p></p><p>"学生已悉数明了。"李凡沉声回答道。</p><p></p><p>艾天觉微微点头，露出赞许的目光："回去后，还需每日诵读、不可荒废。你泣灵功已经修行至最关键时期，一旦内景天地成型，心随念动下，不出半年或许就能赶上我。"</p><p></p><p>李凡点头应下。</p><p></p><p>艾天觉又嘱托道："虽然仙舟中主流认为研究真仙篆字才是根本，但你也需谨记、境界实力是探索勘悟的基础。基础不牢，纵使一时侥幸能登天之高，也随时都会有从高处摔死的风险……"</p><p></p><p>艾天觉叨叨絮絮，甚至显得有些啰嗦。</p><p></p><p>然而这正是玄仙舟内，为师者人人都会做到的地步。</p><p></p><p>李凡躬身行礼，告辞离开，同时心中想到："师者以真心待人，学生以诚意奉师。这才是玄仙舟绵延数千年不绝的真正传承。什么仙枢院、断仙楼，不过是换了层皮罢了。真正的内里，还是这些师徒脉络。"</p><p></p><p>从艾天觉房屋中出来，李凡并没有直接离开断仙楼。</p><p></p><p>他转身去拜访了另外一位长老。</p><p></p><p>池恭道。</p><p></p><p>虽然李凡跟这位池长老没有具体的师承关系，但因为李凡多次上交的见解独特的真仙篆字感悟，因而受到了对方的赏识。</p><p></p><p>跟艾天觉略显有点"传统"不同，这位池恭道可谓是仙舟不折不扣的激进派。</p><p></p><p>主张摒弃一切功法根基，直接全身心投入到真仙篆字之中。</p><p></p><p>不得不说，池恭道对真仙篆字的研究，的确有些旁人所不及之处。</p><p></p><p>经过李凡鉴定，断仙楼一众长老中，他是还原真仙篆字最多、还原度也是最高的存在。</p><p></p><p>而且池恭道还有一门不传之秘，他能够精确的从无边无际的遗器之海中，找到真仙之力将散欲散，恰好能被仙舟修士利用的真正有价值界灭遗器。</p><p></p><p>据说断仙楼十之八九的，双重真仙力遗器，也都是这位池恭道池长老寻获。</p><p></p><p>所以他在断仙楼乃至整个仙舟的地位都是十分超然。 </p><p></p><p>呼呼……</p><p></p><p>李凡一推开小楼门扉，一阵阴风伴随着低低絮语就扑面出来。</p><p></p><p>已经习惯似的，李凡直接无视，径直走到了池恭道面前，安静坐下。</p><p></p><p>前方一根看上去由血肉、毛发构成的笔，顿时出现在李凡面前。</p><p></p><p>识海浮现残缺不全的真仙篆字模样，手中也随之起舞。</p><p></p><p>滴滴血水从笔尖流出，凝结如墨，在空中留下无法磨灭的痕迹。</p><p></p><p>老实说，李凡第一次来此时，差点露出马脚、险些将完整真仙篆字写出。</p><p></p><p>若不是他反应及时，恐怕此刻的仙舟已经在真仙篆字的灭世威能下、荡然无存了。</p><p></p><p>笔走龙蛇，红血喷飞。</p><p></p><p>不多时，一个残缺、扭曲的真仙字符，出现在此处。</p><p></p><p>正是二分之一的【饥】字。</p><p></p><p>"饿哦饿饿饿饿！"</p><p></p><p>手中的笔忽然传来怒吼，缠住的发丝又更加勒紧。甚至有大部分直接如同蠕虫一般，试图顺着李凡的手，钻入他的体内、吞噬他的血肉。</p><p></p><p>李凡眯着眼睛，没有激发体力灵力、将其驱逐体外。而是在自身血肉被吞噬的同时，感受着那发丝的饥意。</p><p></p><p>并没有贪心不足，发丝仅仅只是浅尝辄止，而后又迅速回缩。笔脱手而出，飞回黑暗之中。</p><p></p><p>片刻之后，诡异的咀嚼之声响起。</p><p></p><p>其中偶尔还掺杂着些许的嚼碎骨头的咯吱咯吱声。</p><p></p><p>池恭道的声音同时传来："不错，比起上一次，味道更加纯正了几分。"</p><p></p><p>"赵小子，你真是个天才。若不是艾老儿不肯，我怎么说也得把你收为学生。"</p><p></p><p>李凡没有接话，而是沉声道："池长老，我感觉，目前对于这枚字符的感悟已经达到了瓶颈。想换个新的。"</p><p></p><p>池恭道怪笑道："嘿嘿，贪心。我喜欢！"</p><p></p><p>嗖！</p><p></p><p>七只同样是由血肉、毛发构成的笔，从黑暗中飞出，来到李凡面前。</p><p></p><p>"要哪个，你自己挑吧！" </p><p></p><p>李凡闭眼，感应着不同笔上所流露的气息。</p><p></p><p>"就是它了。"</p><p></p><p>良久之后，李凡决定了目标，朝最左边、血肉最为黯淡的那只伸出手去。</p><p></p><p>血肉翻腾，黑发附身。</p><p></p><p>龙飞凤舞，一个血红的真仙字符、慢慢浮现。</p><p></p><p>李凡凝神感悟，而其余六只笔，早已经不知什么时候、消失不见了。</p><p></p><p>"独"。</p><p></p><p>"万古天地只此身之独。"</p><p></p><p>圣胎李凡当初横跨星海时，曾经跟这个真仙篆字打过照面。</p><p></p><p>当时甚至体内已经跟道基融为一体的黑剑天之奇，都有被奇分离出来的趋势。</p><p></p><p>而此刻，李凡再度从眼前的鲜红字符中，感受到了那股力量。</p><p></p><p>只不过周围空间中，隐隐存在着禁制、遏制着【独】以及其他显现真仙篆字的力量散发。</p><p></p><p>李凡的感知中，时间过的漫长又急速。</p><p></p><p>当【独】字书写完毕之后，他还有些意犹未尽。</p><p></p><p>这种未见真仙篆字本体，通过其展现力量反推的过程，着实有点让人着迷。</p><p></p><p>缠绕手中的笔，已经返回黑暗之中。</p><p></p><p>池恭道的桀桀笑声再度在李凡耳边响起："赵小子，还想再体验下吗？只要你弃暗投明，从艾天觉那来我这，我保管把这些我推测出来的真仙篆字，全都手把手交给你……"</p><p></p><p>李凡面不改色："不劳前辈挂心了。若有我有需求，还会同样用感悟来换的。"</p><p></p><p>说罢，也不等池恭道回应，就返身离开了。</p><p></p><p>小楼内安静了片刻，池恭道的声音再度响起："意志坚定，我更喜欢了……"</p><p></p><p>"桀桀桀桀……"</p><p></p><p>池恭道眼馋李凡、却不知道的是。</p><p></p><p>仅仅只是一次切身体悟，李凡对【独】字的解读，就已经在悄无声息间超越了他。</p><p></p><p>毕竟有着亲眼见过真正真仙篆字的先天优势，再加上曾经的切身遭受【独】字诀余波攻击，李凡转瞬之间已经青出于蓝胜于蓝，也可以理解。 </p><p></p><p>"先试试看，光凭我自己，能不能继续还原。如果失败，就借助仙舟这群天才。"</p><p></p><p>"毕竟，掌握的真仙篆字力量，越多越好。"</p><p></p><p>李凡回到了自身居所，整理起自己在艾天觉以及池恭道处的收获起来。</p><p></p><p>并且等待着下一次他们的召唤。</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>玄黄界。</p><p></p><p>万仙盟修士对于离界虹光的关注度，依旧居高不下。</p><p></p><p>虽然频率略有降低，但万仙盟官方，仍然时不时会公布一些至暗星海之中的画面。</p><p></p><p>种种危险灾劫，让身处玄黄界的修士直呼刺激。</p><p></p><p>"看看就好，他们每次都</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems the true Leaving Realm Rainbow Light has likely met with misfortune," Li Ping said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Holy Dynasty had once again gathered enough Void Clear Crystals. While Li Ping wanted to personally venture outside the Xuanhuang Realm to comprehend the Dao again, he also wanted to familiarize himself with the future battlefield environment where he would clash with the Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>In the sky that no one paid attention to, the Holy Emperor had already flown to the border of Xuanhuang. </p><p></p><p>This time, Li Ping refused the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's request to accompany him. After all, he wouldn't be going far on this trip and would only be active around the periphery of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>As layers of rainbow light separated, he began to break free from the pull of the Immortal Ruins and fly into the dark void.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's not necessary to rely on these Void Clear Crystals," Li Ping mused as he looked at the dazzling, confusing lights around him. "The properties of Xuanhuang creations and manifested Xuanhuang laws could possibly be imitated with spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his gaze towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>There, it was a piece of darkness.</p><p></p><p>The ruins of the ancient Immortal Realm passage devoured all eyes that wanted to peek.</p><p></p><p>Some blurry scenes flashed through his mind. For some reason, Li Ping actually felt a faint, elusive sense of familiarity with the mysterious Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Although it disappeared in an instant, it was still captured by the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Ruins..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping shook his head. After a long while, he suppressed the thought.</p><p></p><p>The first issue that needed to be resolved now was the problem of the Xuanhuang Realm being revived by corpses and having its sky and earth changed.</p><p></p><p>As for how to escape the Immortal Ruins after completing the goal...</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning from Mo Rubin that day about the uniqueness of the Youzu originating from the bloodline of the first generation Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, Li Ping had been trying to use Cat Treasure's special abilities to mass reproduce this bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The three major special abilities of Cat Treasure discovered so far were item duplication, creature simulation, and Yi Jing bone marrow tempering.</p><p></p><p>First, Li Ping had Cat Treasure simulate a Youzu person by any means necessary. </p><p></p><p>Then, the recorded creature data was infused into the body of another ordinary human through the Yi Jing bone marrow tempering method.</p><p></p><p>By taking a roundabout way, this infused human was then subjected to flesh and blood duplication.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because going through Cat Treasure's transfer broke some prohibitions, but these born duplicates actually possessed a portion of the Youzu bloodline's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Although the efficiency of praying to generate Source Power Essence was only about one-fifth that of an ordinary Youzu person, the advantage was there were no restrictions. Relying on the Holy Dynasty's current powerful flesh and blood factory technology, as long as there were enough resources, they could be produced in nearly unlimited quantities.</p><p></p><p>It could be said this temporarily solved the Holy Dynasty's and Dark Abyss' energy shortage problem.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Dark Abyss, the Gathering Spirit Ascension Formation continuously operated, accumulating energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping believed that in less than a hundred years, enough power could be accumulated to burst out and escape the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Li Ping's task was to first resolve the "orthodoxy" issue of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts returned to the present, and Li Ping subconsciously looked at his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Cat Treasure was still lying there.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that duplicating the first generation Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate's bloodline was also an extremely difficult matter for it.</p><p></p><p>In recent days, it had fallen into slumber most of the time.</p><p></p><p>Cat Treasure had also become a bit cold to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had a premonition in his heart that if their relationship continued to fade, perhaps Cat Treasure could leave at any time.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was no special master-servant imprint or the like between him and Cat Treasure.</p><p></p><p>It all relied on him enticing it with Source Power Essence.</p><p></p><p>Squeezing out a ball of golden light, he placed it on Cat Treasure's head.</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping ventured deep into the void, he began to comprehend the laws of the surrounding starry sea.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining catastrophes in the starry sea...</p><p></p><p>Cat Treasure's occasionally raised tail indicated a safe direction for Li Ping to proceed.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the previous experience of long-distance sailing, he didn't encounter any dangers along the way.</p><p></p><p>"If the decisive battle takes place outside the Xuanhuang Realm, the help from the world will inevitably be reduced by more than half," Li Ping thought. "The key to victory, besides Cat Treasure's many divine powers, may also lie in borrowing the power of the ubiquitous catastrophes in this starry sea."</p><p></p><p>Outside the void of the Great Enlightenment Small World, a relic of the First Ancestor Sect and the terrifying Annihilation Wind Disaster were sealed.</p><p></p><p>While sealing it, Li Ping was also studying this catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the various different catastrophe powers in the Darkest Star Sea, the Annihilation Wind Disaster was a pure power that obliterated everything.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping suspected that even the catastrophes in the starry sea would gradually turn to decay under the blow of the Annihilation Wind Disaster.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the so-called starry sea catastrophes are nothing more than the magical techniques of true immortals," Li Ping mused. "Although they are existences that we mortals cannot comprehend, since the Annihilation Wind Disaster can eliminate them without a trace, then in a sense, the power of these catastrophes can also be used for oneself."</p><p></p><p>"But we need to find the right method..."</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration came to Li Ping's mind. Ignoring Cat Treasure's warning, he took the initiative to fly towards the dangerous area not far away in the void.</p><p></p><p>Dense golden light of Source Power Essence spread out, making protective measures.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping quietly comprehended the profound changes imposed on the surface of the Source Power Essence.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous darkness in the Darkest Star Sea due to lack of light and deathly stillness, the darkness Li Ping felt now, due to being slowly deprived of his connection with the world and gradually moving away from everything in the starry sea, was bone-chilling.</p><p></p><p>Not only were the connections severed, even the ties within Li Ping's body that connected him to the Xuanhuang Realm and other mysterious unknown existences were slowly fading away.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor, who had always been concerned about Xuanhuang, suddenly felt a sense of indifference in his heart, as if the Xuanhuang Realm and the myriad beings within it were no longer that important to him.</p><p></p><p>The long-standing attachment was about to be completely let go.</p><p></p><p>However, the slight touch transmitted from his shoulder instantly pulled Li Ping out of that state.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Ping realize that even when encountering the True Immortal Seal Catastrophe and slowly losing all connections with the world, Cat Treasure still remained lying on his shoulder the entire time.</p><p></p><p>There was no sign of it leaving at all.</p><p></p><p>With the Source Power Essence protecting his body, Li Ping's figure flashed and he immediately escaped the area covered by the catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>"This True Immortal Seal seems to be particularly effective on me," Li Ping pondered silently as he gazed at that area. "Alone, or perhaps, solitary?"</p><p></p><p>He gathered another ball of golden light in his hand and placed it on Cat Treasure's head.</p><p></p><p>This time, Cat Treasure unscrupulously swallowed a mouthful and then lazily went back to sleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the underground chamber of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed that the connection with the Holy Emperor's avatar had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>"That last feeling transmitted, was it the power of the True Immortal Seal?" Li Fan wondered. "Solitary?"</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, by borrowing its power, he completely broke free from me."</p><p></p><p>With the Holy Emperor's current level of strength, it was unrealistic to control him in real-time like a chess piece.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had the help of Cat Treasure, that extremely mysterious creature...</p><p></p><p>If he still couldn't completely sever the ties with Li Fan's true body, then Li Fan would have to doubt whether the Holy Emperor could truly force out the true strength of the Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>As for the Holy Emperor's avatar...</p><p></p><p>Or rather, Li Ping's safety, Li Fan was not worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Holy Fetus did not perish in the "Solitary" Character Determination, so naturally the Holy Emperor Li Ping, who had greater strength and many fortuitous encounters, had even less reason to not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, the general path has been set. Let's watch his performance," Li Fan thought. "No matter what, the gains in this life have been more than enough."</p><p></p><p>"So much that I'm a bit dazzled."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering with his divine sense, a somewhat familiar voice suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, when can we go out and take a look? I'm really feeling a bit bored from being cooped up."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his gaze, his eyes deep.</p><p></p><p>It was the voice that originally belonged to Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>But now, whether it was his actions or expressions, they had reached a point where it was difficult to distinguish between true and false.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan's uninterrupted attempts, especially thanks to the Holy Fetus' gains in the Immortal Boat, he had finally created a fairly qualified simulated Sun Luyao personality.</p><p></p><p>This Sun Luyao himself was not even aware that he was a fictional existence.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness and memories had been restored to the point when Li Fan eliminated the wind disaster within his body and promised to take him out to travel while searching for other possible immortal tools.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Senior?" Sun Luyao seemed a little scared when he saw Li Fan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Li Fan showed a kind smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing. I just thought of something happy."</p><p></p><p>"Since you've said so, then let's go out today."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao was overjoyed and at a loss for words. "Great!"</p><p></p><p>Once again, after creating a fake Sun Luyao and the Infinite Mirror, Li Fan's divine sense took their "true bodies" and left the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, where should we go first?"</p><p></p><p>"To make some preparations." Li Fan answered simply.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly flying, they arrived at the entrance of a small world and leaped into the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? This small world is all plants?" Sun Luyao said with some curiosity as he looked at the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>Like a tropical rainforest, towering and lush vegetation of all kinds competed upwards, fighting for sunlight.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, some vines could be seen moving like pythons in the shadows. They then quietly coiled around other towering trees, and sharp wooden thorns pierced into the trees one by one.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the trees withered and fell with a crash.</p><p></p><p>A large area of overhead space was vacated.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the abundant sunlight attracted other trees to grow and fill in at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this small world seems to still be in a relatively primitive stage of life. There shouldn't be the immortal tools we're looking for," Sun Luyao said, engrossed in the sight, but still dutifully giving his suggestion.</p><p></p><p>"We're not looking for immortal tools. I will teach you a set of formations. After you learn it, the next task of arranging the formations will be handed over to you," Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao was shocked upon hearing this. "Thank you, Senior! I will definitely not let Senior down!"</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely. This formation is called..."</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Void!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew to the mid-air of this small world.</p><p></p><p>Rays of brilliance showered down, actually obscuring the sunlight above.</p><p></p><p>The primitive jungle small world, which already seemed a bit gloomy, now ushered in true darkness.</p><p></p><p>And in the eyes of the Infinite Mirror spirit Sun Luyao, the brilliance Li Fan showered down was a string of extremely profound formation units.</p><p></p><p>Even with his foundation as an immortal tool, it was extremely difficult for him to analyze.</p><p></p><p>As the formation gradually improved, a feeling that was somewhat familiar to Sun Luyao, yet inexplicably terrifying, welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's face turned pale. After a long while, he finally realized.</p><p></p><p>It was the feeling of his life hanging by a thread that he had every time he faced the Annihilation Wind Disaster before!</p><p></p><p>Instinct told him that if he continued to stay here until the great formation was completed, it would be the day of his great calamity!</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Mirror trembled slightly and quickly turned into a beam of light, flying to Li Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ignored it and continued to perfect the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, one is the lack of materials. Second, it's only a divine sense at work, unable to fully unleash the power of the Void Formation," Li Fan thought. "However, it is indeed enough to condense some protective layers."</p><p></p><p>More than ten days later, the Primordial Void Formation was completed.</p><p></p><p>With a world-destroying beam of light descending, this small world completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's divine sense had already returned to the Xuanhuang Realm with the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Did you learn the formation just now?"</p><p></p><p>The simulated personality Sun Luyao did not respond for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the structure maintaining the simulated personality's "true nature" had been destroyed after being affected by the Primordial Void Formation just now.</p><p></p><p>"What a useless piece of trash." Li Fan snorted coldly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 459</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, at this moment, those Pu Xianzhen leaves that had earned profits for them in the past had instead become their harbingers of doom.</p><p></p><p>Almost the instant when Pu Xianzhen leaves were being crazily snatched by the monks, Tan Tai-Can realized that if they did not take action soon, they would ultimately face a perilous situation!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Tan Tai-Can made a decisive decision and ordered to reclaim Pu Xianzhen leaves at all costs.</p><p></p><p>Stimulated by this, the price of Pu Xianzhen leaves rose rapidly to a point that even the monks could not understand.</p><p></p><p>In almost an instant, it soared from over three hundred points to four hundred points and seemingly had no limit to its increase.</p><p></p><p>This extremely abnormal scene left the witnessing monks dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Something is amiss!" This thought involuntarily emerged in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that these Pu Xianzhen leaves have some unknown uses as well?"</p><p></p><p>As thoughts raced through their minds, those who had previously bought in secretly rejoiced while watching its price continue to soar with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Even though some had doubted Li Fan's prophecy before, seeing those who took action around them suddenly become rich made them hesitant and eager to join the buying frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Tan Tai-Can and his group watched this madness unfold, and many of them had extremely unpleasant expressions. If this continued, all the profits they had earned over the years would likely be wiped out!</p><p></p><p>"Friend Tan Tai..." Tan Tai-Can raised a hand, "We can only accept this time! Continue with the purchases!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as we have land, we will not worry about firewood running out. As long as we can get through this challenge..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of ferocity flashed across his handsome face.</p><p></p><p>The others had no choice but to grit their teeth and continue to repurchase with the increasingly crazed monks.</p><p></p><p>As time passed slowly, their contributions flew out like flowing water, but the debt they owed was too massive, like a hole that could never be filled.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were all well-off, they slowly began to feel the pinch.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Tan Tai-Can still not speaking or changing his mind, they wiped the cold sweat from their foreheads and continued to repurchase nervously.</p><p></p><p>The tension in the air was so thick that it seemed to congeal.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Tan Tai-Can took out a constantly flashing communication symbol, checked it, and his expression slightly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>After a brief exchange, his demeanor became calm and composed again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others thought that something had changed, and they also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Qianli Hall of the Congyun Sea Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the previous large purchase, Li Fan and Jiao Xiuyuan, who had seized the initiative, had already bought a large amount of Pu Xianzhen leaves at a low price.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were smiling as they watched its price skyrocket.</p><p></p><p>Following the principle of "safety first," Li Fan cautiously sold off a portion of the Pu Xianzhen leaves at Li Fan's persuasion.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's advice, Jiao Xiuyuan also gradually sold off a small amount.</p><p></p><p>The two were discussing their next plan, when suddenly Jiao Xiuyuan's expression froze.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he smiled and said to Li Fan, "Tan Tai-Can has sent a message through someone, do you want to hear it?"</p><p></p><p>"It wouldn't hurt to listen." Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>*Cough cough...*</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's tone changed, and he imitated perfectly, "Brother Jiao, leave yourself a way out in your actions so we can meet again. How about giving me face this time?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled sardonically.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't make a rash decision, instead turning to Jiao Xiuyuan and asking, "Brother Jiao, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan grinned and said coldly, "He is just a junior from the Tan Tai family, what qualifications does he have to talk about 'giving face' in front of me? His family's ancestor might be worthy of that!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind stirred but he didn't inquire further, clapping his hands in approval, "Brother Jiao is truly imposing!"</p><p></p><p>Changing the subject, Li Fan suddenly said, "However, it's not a bad idea to agree to them!"</p><p></p><p>This statement caught Jiao Xiuyuan completely off guard.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan paused, looked at Li Fan, and said, "You don't seem like someone with a soft heart. Why suddenly be so kind?"</p><p></p><p>"Not really, not really," Li Fan shook his head, "Just for the sake of making another profit!"</p><p></p><p>Once the topic turned to business, Jiao Xiuyuan became interested and quickly asked, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"In the previous inferences, I didn't just see the abnormal surge in the price of Pu Xianzhen leaves. I also saw that this disturbance would have a significant impact. In the end, the official Wanxian Alliance would have to appear to quell the situation." Li Fan explained slowly.</p><p></p><p>"And we won't have to wait too long."</p><p></p><p>"But it's impossible to accurately grasp the specific timing, maybe even in the next moment. If we haven't sold off all the Pu Xianzhen leaves in our hands before Wanxian Alliance intervenes, and if the price crashes, the excess portion might end up being burdensome."</p><p></p><p>"Instead of waiting, let's negotiate with Tan Tai-Can and his group for a suitable price before that. Let's bundle all our stock and sell it to them."</p><p></p><p>"This reduces the risk, allows for another substantial profit, and also makes Tan Tai-Can owe us a favor."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes lit up, and he laughed heartily, "Friend Li Fan, you're truly a genius at doing business!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's do as you said!"</p><p></p><p>He then closed his eyes indicating his impatience to communicate the deal with Tan Tai-Can.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, stared at the constantly fluctuating prices of Pu Xianzhen leaves in the Tianxuan Mirror, contemplating how to deal with the impact of the upcoming turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Jiao Xiuyuan woke up from his trance-like state.</p><p></p><p>"It's done. Tan Tai-Can will accept all our Pu Xianzhen leaves at a contribution of 1300 points each."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, he promised that within the scope of his ability, he will fulfill three of our requests."</p><p></p><p>"I felt that they had reached their limit, so I took the initiative and signed the contract with them."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan explained.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's a minor matter," Li Fan casually responded, then handed over all the Pu Xianzhen leaves in his hand to Jiao Xiuyuan to complete the transaction.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at the current price of Pu Xianzhen leaves in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>930 points per plant, still on the rise, showing no signs of plummeting.</p><p></p><p>"Outwardly, it seems Tan Tai-Can and his group have made a profit. However...," Li Fan smirked inwardly, awaiting the definitive decision from the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Just a short while after Jiao Xiuyuan had completed the transaction and sent the message.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators in front of the Tianxuan Mirror of the Wanxian Alliance heard a familiar yet ruthless mechanical voice in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Just like the one Li Fan had heard in his past life.</p><p></p><p>"Due to the significant abnormal fluctuations in the price of Pu Xianzhen leaves in recent days, to ensure the stable and harmonious development of the Wanxian Alliance, the following announcement is made."</p>

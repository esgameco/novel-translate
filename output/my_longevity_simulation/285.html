        <h1>Chapter 285</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"I never thought that the once greatest sect in the world would have fallen to the point of associating with demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>A trace of disdain flashed across Zhang Qianmo's face: "It seems that the efforts of the immortal sects over these years have not been in vain."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained unchanged, his tone faint: "Senior Brother Zhang, some things in this world are not as simple as they appear on the surface."</p><p></p><p>"If I said that I have nothing to do with the Xuantian Sect, would you believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo looked at Li Fan as if he were an idiot, with a look of 'do you think I would believe that?', and snorted without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and didn't dwell on this question any further.</p><p></p><p>Sizing up Zhang Qianmo and flipping through the memories of Li Chen's possessed body, he discovered some interesting details that he hadn't noticed before.</p><p></p><p>After pondering in silence for a moment, he spoke probingly: "The Xuantian Sect, that was something from many years ago. Your immortal sects regard it as taboo. Since I joined the Zixiao Sect, for so many years, I have never heard any news about the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you're not much older than me. How do you know all these secrets so clearly?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's expression changed slightly, but he still didn't answer.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his guess was confirmed, Li Fan continued to raise the stakes: "I always felt that Master and the elders had a strange attitude towards you."</p><p></p><p>"Before, I thought it was because Senior Brother's talent was too good."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I think about it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo's face slowly darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, although we are fellow disciples, Senior Brother's techniques and divine powers are far superior to mine!"</p><p></p><p>"Especially your [Purple Elixir Nirvana Technique]..."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan said this, Zhang Qianmo's expression finally completely changed.</p><p></p><p>He looked deeply at Li Fan, as if to remember him forever.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his aura, which had already weakened to that of an ordinary person, was rapidly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a little surprised and hurriedly went to check, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>By the time he walked to Zhang Qianmo's side, Senior Brother Zhang had already completely lost his vital signs.</p><p></p><p>"Feigning death?"</p><p></p><p>"Nirvana?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't let his guard down and started to examine.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan got up and stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>The result was somewhat unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo was actually really dead.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't undergo nirvana rebirth from the purple elixir after death like before.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he had completely fallen.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the real world, there should be an omen descending above his head at this time.</p><p></p><p>"A secret technique that can end one's own life even with all the acupoints in the body sealed..."</p><p></p><p>"Knowing ancient secrets, his identity and status in the sect are implicitly different."</p><p></p><p>"Although only at the Foundation Establishment stage, he has a heaven-defying ambition. His perspective is frighteningly high..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered and sighed: "It seems this Senior Brother Zhang has another identity."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>To be cautious, he didn't remove the Immortal Severing Stone Needles, but directly searched Zhang Qianmo's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a storage ring, there was nothing else of value.</p><p></p><p>He tried to probe into the ring with his spiritual sense to see what was inside.</p><p></p><p>But he was blocked by a flash of purple lightning.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there are restrictions that can't be broken." After more than a dozen attempts without success, Li Fan felt a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I can't bring it back to reality anyway."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan simply gave up.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Qianmo is dealt with, next is Steward Song."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan dug a pit in the secret room and put Zhang Qianmo's corpse in it.</p><p></p><p>Then he covered it with that Immortal Severing Stone slab.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he headed straight for the Life-Extending Tree in the center of the city.</p><p></p><p>As he approached, he released his own aura.</p><p></p><p>"Which Senior Brother has come?!" Song Hesong's slightly surprised voice came.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Senior Brother Li!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't exchange pleasantries with him, but directly said in a cold voice: "Steward Song, you've managed this Ningyuan City well!"</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong was startled by Li Fan's attitude of immediately questioning him, thinking that his group's ambush had been exposed.</p><p></p><p>He subconsciously wanted to take action.</p><p></p><p>But he still held back and asked probingly: "Senior Brother, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted: "Senior Brother Zhang and I discovered some taboo objects in the city. If these things are exposed in the territory of our Zixiao Sect, let alone a small steward like you, I'm afraid even the sect will be implicated."</p><p></p><p>"Taboo objects?" Song Hesong couldn't help but feel a little confused.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a look of fearful ignorance, Song Hesong asked: "What exactly are they that violate such a great taboo? Please enlighten me, Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned and flew towards Mr. Bai's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me!"</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong looked at Li Fan's receding back, hesitating for a moment.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual sense, Chu Liang and the others were still lying in ambush at the planned location without any issues.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his Golden Core cultivation, Song Hesong still followed fearlessly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived at the entrance to the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's somewhat surprised voice came from below: "Huh? Where's Senior Brother Zhang?"</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong scanned the area with his spiritual sense, not detecting any ambush, and also squeezed in.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the dilapidated faceless stone statue standing in the secret room, he was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because this stone statue was completely outside the range of his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the taboo object Senior Brother spoke of is this stone statue?" Song Hesong couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and approached: "That's right, it's this [Xuantian Divine Statue]!"</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Divine Statue..." Steward Song frowned slightly, seeming to have heard this name a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, he seemed to remember something, his body trembling and pupils contracting.</p><p></p><p>He looked at that faceless stone statue again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment...</p><p></p><p>A stone needle pierced through his dantian from behind.</p><p></p><p>Extremely horrified, he was about to counterattack when the circulation of his internal energy stagnated.</p><p></p><p>What awaited him were the next thirty-five Immortal Severing Stone Needles.</p><p></p><p>With all his acupoints sealed, Song Hesong collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A wave of remorse surged in his mind, but he still had some luck, struggling to speak: "Senior Brother, what is the meaning of this? I really didn't know about this Xuantian Divine Statue hidden in the city."</p><p></p><p>"Although I am guilty of dereliction of duty, the crime doesn't warrant this..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words ruthlessly interrupted him, causing his heart to sink to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>"What if we add colluding with outsiders and harboring ill intentions? A Golden Core cultivator pretending to be a Qi Refining cultivator, you must feel so aggrieved!"</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong's face instantly turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>He still wanted to struggle one last time, but it was in vain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan approached step by step: "Let me see what exactly you know."</p><p></p><p>Having seen Song Hesong's subtle changes in expression just now, Li Fan revealed a somewhat chilling smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong watched as the other party took out tools like hammers, knives, and nails one by one from the wooden box and methodically placed them on the table.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat couldn't help but drip from his forehead.</p>

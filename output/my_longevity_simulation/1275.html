            <p>Chapter 1272: Simulating Yan Fa Jue</p><p></p><p>One by one, Sun Luyao was simulated and then destroyed. moɔ.xuʜꙅ9 </p><p></p><p>In this process, Li Fan gradually developed his own unique understanding of [Creation].</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." </p><p></p><p>Until the replicated remnant of Sun Luyao's divine sense was about to be completely exhausted, a timid yet slightly greedy voice once again rang out in the Sun family's underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>It was almost exactly the same as Sun Luyao's own words and actions.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, the creator, found it difficult to distinguish the difference.</p><p></p><p>But it was only superficial.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very clear.</p><p></p><p>The newly created Sun Luyao acted completely according to the response method set by Li Fan, and did not have an active thinking process.</p><p></p><p>It was too far from a real life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this created entity was not recognized by the immortal artifact, the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>In other words, in the cognition of the Infinite Mirror, they were completely different existences.</p><p></p><p>"Simulation and myriad living beings only create different natures of creatures."</p><p></p><p>"But to truly create life from nothing, other means are needed." After confirming this point, Li Fan shook his head with some regret.</p><p></p><p>However, this did not mean that Li Fan gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of consciousness of Li Fan's true body, inside the Ultimate Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>A consciousness, or a virtual personality created by the simulation formation, was slowly taking shape.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's setting for it was very singular. </p><p></p><p>To increase the efficiency of the formation's deduction and analysis, as the first priority. Tireless, never stopping.</p><p></p><p>Before this, although Li Fan had mastered this strange object, the Ultimate Dissociation Disc, to maximize its effectiveness, not only did it require the amplification of Huadao Stone, but Li Fan himself also had to devote a large part of his energy to personally preside over it.</p><p></p><p>If there was a mechanized simulated personality, it would definitely allow Li Fan to free up some of his energy.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, this is almost equivalent to the legendary spirit-endowment of immortal artifacts. It's just that a clever method was used to achieve a slightly weaker effect in performance."</p><p></p><p>"Looking at it from a longer-term perspective, not only the Dissociation Disc, but even any strange object or magic treasure can be operated in this way."</p><p></p><p>"With almost no cost consumption, the power of the artifacts can be greatly increased... It's hard to say about the power. It's definitely more handy to use. And it can also be customized and trained according to one's own needs."</p><p></p><p>"In a sense, this is another kind of [Formation Refinement] technique."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was pondering, the simulated personality of the Ultimate Dissociation Disc had officially manifested and taken shape.</p><p></p><p>Its appearance was that of the cultivator Li Fan found the most handy to use in his hundreds of reincarnations: Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had once been the acting island master of Wanxian Island, and Gao Yuan's ability to observe words and expressions, as well as his loyalty to his duties, had left a good impression on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It looked pleasing to the eye, so the simulated personality was set according to his appearance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is there anything I can serve you with." Gao Yuan said very respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Organize the existing data of immortal-level grand formations, deduce the connections between them and the common basic formation units."</p><p></p><p>"On this basis, carry out unified improvement and deduction of the formations in the Xuanhuang Realm. All results need to be recorded and preserved."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, try to find possible methods for self-advancement..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan issued a series of commands.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Dissociation Disc completely stopped for an instant, and then started to operate rapidly again.</p><p></p><p>Compared with before, it seemed more orderly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could see the feedback of the simulated personality, concretized in the data.</p><p></p><p>For example, the proportion of the Ultimate Dissociation Disc's computing power occupied by each task, and the estimated remaining time to complete it.</p><p></p><p>And when the task had results, the simulated personality would also automatically organize the results and wait for Li Fan's review.</p><p></p><p>"It's much more useful than before."</p><p></p><p>The pressure in his mind was emptied, but the deduction efficiency of the Dissociation Disc did not decrease but increased.</p><p></p><p>"This is the crushing power of methodology from the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"The previous me was like wielding a firearm but only knowing to use it to slash."</p><p></p><p>"And this is the gain from actually exploring the formations in the immortal realm and having some insights..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's thoughts paused slightly, and he looked at Yan Fa Jue, who was lying on the long table listlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, this little thing's situation is quite similar to mine before."</p><p></p><p>"But the defenses here are strict, and I can't find a way to contact her alone yet."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan imperceptibly glanced at Zhang Xu and Hua Yueye, the two Hedao guardians, thinking about plans in his mind.</p><p></p><p>When you're sleepy, someone will bring you a pillow. After a few days, Li Fan waited for an excellent opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Requesting Yan Fa Jue to deduce methods?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the benefit we get only after guarding for a full hundred years? How can it be arranged now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the elder of the Protector Hall in front of him, Zhao Shihuan, and asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"But don't worry, the corresponding benefits and merits will not be less."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan remember Sun Luyuan's promise when he came to visit before.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Xu Yuanxuan didn't deceive him this time."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shihuan continued to ask, "After all, it's a sudden matter. If Brother Sun feels that you're not ready yet, you can also save this audience opportunity for later use together."</p><p></p><p>"I came this time to notify you of this matter first."</p><p></p><p>Compared with the treatment of Zhang Xu and Hua Yueye, Zhao Shihuan's attitude towards Li Fan was obviously much more polite. After all, the chief elder had personally greeted him, so his future status in the Protector Hall would definitely not be low. Taking the initiative to build a good relationship was also human nature.</p><p></p><p>"Then thank you, Elder Zhao..." After pondering for a moment, Li Fan said in a deep voice, "I recently have some insights, so I plan to directly use this deduction opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shihuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Under the envious gaze of the other two guardians, Li Fan left the guardian's seat and floated to the little loli Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue stared at the big enemy in front of her who often squeezed and urged her, her cheeks puffed up with anger.</p><p></p><p>"I'm already working hard enough, how can you still..." Yan Fa Jue was about to complain, but met Li Fan's serious eyes, and the words retreated back to her mouth.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Li Fan's training of Yan Fa Jue during this period still had some effect.</p><p></p><p>However, Yan Fa Jue still looked defiant on the surface, staring at Li Fan with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the other existences in the deduction space couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the air was filled with a happy atmosphere. </p><p></p><p>After all, they were all on the same side, and there was no need for extra vigilance. The other guardians were watching with the mentality of enjoying the show.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, I'm afraid of you. Hurry up and tell me what you want."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue lay on the long table listlessly, as if she had accepted her fate.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan skillfully took over...</p><p></p><p>The white paper flew over, and characters quickly appeared on it one by one.</p><p></p><p>When the last character appeared, Li Fan didn't hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the white paper turned into a stream of light and flew in front of Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>The entire action was completed in one smooth motion, as if it had been practiced countless times.</p><p></p><p>At first, Yan Fa Jue still looked listless and dispirited. But soon, she seemed to discover something and was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Her chubby little hand slapped the table heavily, and she mumbled, "What nonsense, it's so difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment." Yan Fa Jue said to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Next, the huge character light ball on top of her head rotated rapidly, seeming to be trying its best to deduce.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan took the opportunity to chat with Zhang Xu and Hua Yue Ye, the two Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>"Although the time limit for guarding has been reduced by a hundred years, for some reason, I vaguely feel that this is not a good thing. Even when I think of leaving in the future, there is actually a sense of reluctance in my heart." Li Fan sighed with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu smiled and said, "I know why. In the past, when our Zhang family guarded the Dao, we also had a mentality of gain and loss when leaving. It's because after staying in the same place for a long time, it's inevitable to develop a sense of dependence. Even with our cultivation as Dao companions, we can't avoid it."</p><p></p><p>Hua Yue Ye also agreed, "Yes. After hundreds of years, what exactly has the outside world become? It really makes one a bit afraid to make contact..."</p><p></p><p>The three of them chatted happily, but from time to time they all glanced at Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>And this time, it indeed seemed to be as difficult as Yan Fa Jue complained, to deduce the target technique.</p><p></p><p>The time spent had already far exceeded what was normally required for a Dao companion technique.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Brother Sun has gained a lot this time." Zhang Xu said with some envy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also didn't deny it, "My beloved wife passed away, and I became a father. Too many things have happened recently..."</p><p></p><p>It took a full half more than the set time before Yan Fa Jue finally completed the deduction of the technique.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, take it."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of excessive consumption, Yan Fa Jue's attitude was much better, not as bad as before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, took the white paper, and firmly memorized the contents on it.</p><p></p><p>Then he cupped his hands and returned to the guardian's seat with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>"According to the rules, you can rest for two hours." Zhang Xu said.</p><p></p><p>"I see she's a bit tired, why not add another hour. After all, it was an additional deduction behavior decided for my sake at the last minute." Li Fan suggested.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu and Hua Yue Ye looked at each other and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Within the scope allowed by their authority, giving a colleague some face was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to be quite a good person." Yan Fa Jue said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Without even saying thanks, she plopped down on the long table and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were calm as he looked at the technique deduced by Yan Fa Jue in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Simulating the Masses Technique."</p><p></p><p>Its effect was even weakened a bit because it was transformed into a technique.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's purpose was not this technique.</p><p></p><p>He just took the opportunity to pass on the method of creating simulated personalities to Yan Fa Jue, under the supervision of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And Yan Fa Jue was not too foolish either.</p><p></p><p>After realizing that this method could very likely be of great use to her, she took the initiative to cover up Li Fan's sneaky behavior.</p><p></p><p>Three hours later, Zhang Xu appeared beside Yan Fa Jue on time and conjured up a gong to wake up the little loli.</p><p></p><p>Next, Yan Fa Jue seemed to be immersed in the endless work of deducing techniques again.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, some changes were happening quietly.</p><p></p><p>Inside Yan Fa Jue's light ball, a figure was slowly forming.</p><p></p><p>The little loli held her head with both hands, looking excited.</p><p></p><p>"Great, great, I didn't expect this method to really work."</p><p></p><p>"I tried before to split out another self to help me work. But it was useless."</p><p></p><p>"Now there's hope..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue's eyes were wide open, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the simulated personality officially appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue's scream spread throughout the entire light ball.</p><p></p><p>"Why is it you ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>The little loli instinctively stayed far away from the simulated personality.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>For some reason, even though it was created based on the most handsome face she could imagine in the world,</p><p></p><p>the initial product that appeared in front of her was actually the appearance of Li Fan, also known as Sun Ang!</p><p></p><p>"Master, is there anything I can do for you?"</p><p></p><p>The simulated personality, which looked exactly like Li Fan, didn't have any objection to Yan Fa Jue's exaggerated reaction, but asked mechanically and respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Yan Fa Jue pluck up the courage to approach and test it out.</p><p></p><p>After discovering that this simulated personality was very obedient and did whatever it was told to do, her courage instantly grew.</p><p></p><p>She ordered without any courtesy, "Help me deduce techniques!"</p><p></p><p>"Never stop!"</p><p></p><p>"Now I've accumulated almost ten years of stock, you have to accumulate at least fifty years for me!"</p><p></p><p>The little loli spoke while her eyes sparkled, as if she had already started imagining the wonderful life in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years of stock..."</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan's curious voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>It directly caused Yan Fa Jue's expression to freeze.</p><p></p><p>"You!" She pointed her chubby little finger at the simulated personality, her face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"How is it possible? How can you have intelligence? You're clearly just a mechanized other me..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a trivial backdoor." Li Fan made a very polite gesture and explained.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have to worry, the simulated personality indeed won't have its own detailed thoughts. The reason it's like this now is because I temporarily took over the personality to communicate with you." Li Fan said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do?" In Yan Fa Jue's big eyes, tears seemed to flicker, looking pitiful.</p><p></p><p>"I warn you, don't mess around! I'm going to call for help!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ignored Yan Fa Jue's clumsy acting.</p><p></p><p>He just brought the topic back to the "ten years of stock".</p><p></p><p>"Ah! I understand now. Actually, the time you need to complete each technique deduction is a little less than what you show."</p><p></p><p>"Every time you finish a deduction task, you save a little spare time. This is your stock."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's words continued, Yan Fa Jue's face gradually turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"I actually accumulated so much without realizing it."</p><p></p><p>"A total of fifty years is needed..."</p><p></p><p>"This is no longer in the realm of slacking off."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared straight at Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please move your fingers and share this website to Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

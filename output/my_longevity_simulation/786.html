        <h1>Chapter 786</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p>As these words came out, it seemed to have a huge impact on Chen Tianhai, or perhaps the members of the Taiyan Sect within the Huadao Stone Mother. In an instant, all the blue illusory figures hovering in the floating city stopped what they were doing and looked towards Xu Bai together. </p><p>It was as if the entire city had fallen into absolute stillness, with only that deep blue color silently flowing.</p><p>After a moment.</p><p>Chen Tianhai gently stamped his foot again. </p><p>The walls of the space they were in became opaque, blocking the view between the inside and outside.</p><p>Chen Tianhai also reverted back to his ordinary cultivator appearance.</p><p>"From the current situation, we indeed cannot rule out the possibility you mentioned," Chen Tianhai's tone became quite solemn. "In fact, as one of the few existences that could threaten us..."</p><p>"We have made many deductions about the possible situations within the Immortal Ruins."</p><p>"But firstly, there is too little known information. Secondly..."</p><p>"All attempts to probe the Immortal Ruins have been ineffective. Everyone who went never returned. So we also cannot verify the reliability of our deductions."</p><p>Chen Tianhai explained while looking at Xu Bai.</p><p>Xu Bai smiled: "But you don't have the Huadao Stone anymore, what can you use to trade with me?"</p><p>"Do I look like someone who would generously give away benefits for free?"</p><p>Chen Tianhai studied Xu Bai up and down seriously, then nodded: "From your appearance, indeed not."</p><p>"However, we will not pin our hopes on others."</p><p>"I think there is something you might be interested in."</p><p>Chen Tianhai stretched out his left hand and inserted it directly into his own head.</p><p>Fortunately, there was no gory scene of brain matter and blood gushing out. Upon touching his brain, his hand became an illusion.</p><p>At the same time, Chen Tianhai's head also seemed to be divided into countless small flickering blue squares.</p><p>This scene looked quite bizarre.</p><p>After rummaging for a moment, Chen Tianhai finally pulled his hand out.</p><p>He showed what was in his palm to Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji.</p><p>"What is this?" Xu Bai narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>A miniature version of the floating city was quietly hovering in his hand.</p><p>Unlike the deep blue of the Huadao Stone Mother, it was brilliant and crystalline, yet fragile like glass.</p><p>"A disposable sub-copy of the Huadao Stone Mother, inspired by the 'Heavenly Mystery Treasure Manual' of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. A relatively independent entity, yet possessing some abilities of the Stone Mother," Chen Tianhai explained without any emotion.</p><p>Yet he grasped at nothing.</p><p>Chen Tianhai and the stone sub-copy instantly became illusory, unable to be touched.</p><p>Fang Zaiji curled his lip.</p><p>"The sub-copy contains all the information of the main body, as well as the energy to drive a 'simulation'."</p><p>"Through this simulation, you can experience the future deduced by the Huadao Stone Mother."</p><p>As if responding to Chen Tianhai's words, the sub-copy in his hand suddenly erupted with a dazzling light.</p><p>Within the white light, it seemed that countless scenes flashed by rapidly.</p><p>"Simulation? Is it reliable?" Fang Zaiji had apparently never heard of such a thing and didn't seem to quite believe it.</p><p>While Xu Bai stared intently at</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text:</p><p></p><p>The Stone Mother copy, as if deep in thought.</p><p>The brightness of the white light gradually decreased, and the rapidly changing scenes within it also slowly came to a stop.</p><p>"Huh? How are there images of me and the Sect Master in here?" Fang Zaijing discovered the anomaly and asked with some surprise.</p><p>"Based on the results of this simulation, you should agree to our trade request." Chen Tianhai crushed the Stone Mother copy in his hand, and moments later, just as he had said, the scenes of Xu Bai trading with them appeared in the space.</p><p>Although upon closer inspection, some of the details were still slightly different from the real world.</p><p>But seeing one's own "future" with one's own eyes is still a bit unsettling.</p><p>"You're being a bit too confident. Sect Master, let's not be fooled by him." Fang Zaijing seemed quite irritated.</p><p>Xu Bai calmly looked at Fang Zaijing: "Mr. Fang, is your provocation aimed at the wrong target? I think you're just coveting this thing."</p><p>Exposed, Fang Zaijing laughed awkwardly.</p><p>"However..." Xu Bai gazed at the repeatedly changing scenes before him.</p><p>After a moment of silence, he suddenly asked, "The Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror can completely see through all the secrets of a cultivator's body. Does your Stone Mother copy have such abilities as well?"</p><p>Chen Tianhai smiled: "That depends on you."</p><p>"The closer the data is to the real situation, the more accurate the simulation results will be. We have been in seclusion in this Profound Heavenly Realm for thousands of years. Although we periodically correct the deduced results of the Dao Stone Mother, we can only achieve consistency on the surface."</p><p>"There are many secrets in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, and even the Transmission Dao Venerable may not dare to claim to know everything."</p><p>"The Stone Mother copy does not have the ability to know everything like the Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror. Instead, it requires the user to supplement their own data. If you want to deliberately conceal something, you can, but the deduced results may then deviate accordingly."</p><p>Chen Tianhai said calmly.</p><p>"But what about later on?" Fang Zaijing said with some disdain.</p><p>"We are different from the Taiyan Sect." Chen Tianhai's expression suddenly became very serious. "Here, lies are absolutely forbidden."</p><p>"The world within the Stone Mother is built on real deduction. Any false information could lead to the collapse of the deduced world."</p><p>Chen Tianhai briefly explained.</p><p>"You may not believe it, but this is the truth."</p><p>Hearing this, Fang Zaijing looked skeptical, but Xu Bai nodded and said, "I believe it."</p><p>"Then let's make the trade."</p><p>This decisiveness greatly surprised the two present.</p><p>"Sect Master..." Fang Zaijing hesitated to speak.</p><p>After a brief moment of shock, Chen Tianhai quickly took out another Stone Mother copy from his mind.</p><p>Xu Bai seemed to have already prepared, taking out a projection stone from his storage ring.</p><p>In an instant, the trade was completed.</p><p>Chen Tianhai directly played the image recorded in the projection stone, showing the Pill King's escape from the Mysterious Yellow Realm and encountering the attraction of the Immortal Void.</p><p>He repeated it three times.</p><p>The light and shadow then disappeared, and Chen Tianhai's expression became solemn: "It seems you were right."</p><p>"If the data you provided is true."</p>

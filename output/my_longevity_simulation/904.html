        <h1>Chapter 904</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Secret Art of Slaying the Mysterious, as a secret technique created by the Ten Immortal Sects in the past to hunt down the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Sect, naturally has its own profound wonders.</p><p></p><p>After activating the "Slaying the Mysterious" technique, as long as there are people or objects related to the Mysterious Heaven Sect nearby, a melodious bell sound will be heard.</p><p></p><p>The higher the rank within the Mysterious Heaven Sect, the more bell sounds will be triggered.</p><p></p><p>Three sounds are the maximum.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, after Li Fan eagerly walked around this ring-shaped mountain with the "Slaying the Mysterious" secret technique, he did not hear any bell sounds.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Stone Tablet doesn't seem like someone who would joke around..."</p><p></p><p>Although somewhat surprised, Li Fan did not doubt that Senior Stone Tablet was playing tricks on him.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, with such a peculiar terrain here, the Myriad Immortals Alliance must have searched it thoroughly early on. If the Slaying the Mysterious secret technique was effective, the hidden secrets here would have probably been discovered long ago."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan suddenly realized. His heart became even more expectant.</p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, Li Fan removed the protection of the Seven-Colored Divine Light and once again strolled in this ring-shaped mountain filled with blooming flowers.</p><p></p><p>The ring-shaped mountain of Dongyong Prefecture, the Spiritual Power Flowers. People say they can be admired from afar but not frivolously played with.</p><p></p><p>Although these special flowers formed from the dissipation of spiritual power cannot be absorbed by cultivators, when approaching too closely, this strange spiritual power will synchronously cause the spiritual power within the cultivators' bodies to vibrate and assimilate.</p><p></p><p>If not protected against or cleansed in time, it may very likely lead to the tragic situation of various colored flowers growing inside the body.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these flowers are practically all-pervasive.</p><p></p><p>Once they take root in the body, not only the physical body is affected. Even the Foundation Establishment strange objects and even the Dharma Principle Golden Core will be eroded by the Spiritual Power Flowers.</p><p></p><p>So while beautiful, they are extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Li Fan could boldly walk into the midst of the flowers, allowing these flowers to bloom inside his body.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, what he relied on was the "Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light".</p><p></p><p>As long as the Seven-Colored Divine Light is used to seal one's own Grotto-Heaven, even if the physical body is destroyed thousands of times, it will not cause any actual harm to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>These Spiritual Power Flowers, when touched, feel no different from ordinary flowers.</p><p></p><p>They have a real texture and one can even smell the fragrance emanating from them.</p><p></p><p>And the more contact, flashes of illusions suddenly appeared before the eyes.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Spiritual Power Flowers appeared inside Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Not only was there not the slightest discomfort, Li Fan even felt his spirit shaken.</p><p></p><p>The circulation speed of spiritual energy accelerated, and even his thoughts became much swifter.</p><p></p><p>And from Li Fan's perspective, these flowers before his eyes became even more dazzlingly beautiful and endearing.</p><p></p><p>Even more reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>The flowers bloomed along Li Fan's meridians one by one, forming a flowery path directly to the dantian and the glabella.</p><p></p><p>And even though he could clearly see the situation inside his body, Li Fan's heart did not generate any sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly watched the Spiritual Power Flowers' performance, coldly snorting in his heart: "So strange, bewitching the mind. Indeed somewhat similar to the techniques of the Mysterious Heaven Sect."</p><p></p><p>In just the time to drink a cup of tea, Li Fan's dantian was completely occupied by these flowers.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, beautiful yet eerie.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for the glabella.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, these Spiritual Power Flowers finally revealed their true colors.</p><p></p><p>The body became stiff, and the mind seemed to be on the verge of freezing.</p><p></p><p>Outside the sea of consciousness, these flowers even released roots, wanting to take root and settle in.</p><p></p><p>However, no</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They were waiting for their chance to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body suddenly exploded without any warning.</p><p></p><p>There was no blood and flesh flying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Instead, countless flowers generated inside Li Fan's body instantly scattered all over the sky, like fireworks.</p><p></p><p>It was quite a beautiful sight.</p><p></p><p>These newly born flowers, carried by the gentle breeze, gradually blended with the flowers that had always existed in the circular mountain.</p><p></p><p>They became indistinguishable from each other.</p><p></p><p>Amidst this beautiful scenery, a figure slowly reappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Strange..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at the flowers floating all over the sky and frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had detonated his own body in advance to avoid further devouring by the spiritual flowers, Li Fan keenly noticed that his soul and cultivation had inevitably lost a portion in this process.</p><p></p><p>For the current Li Fan, even if it was just a small part, he, who was very sensitive to this, noticed it immediately.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the sea of flowers floating in the circular mountain, seemingly moving in a random pattern, and his expression became somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>If the devouring of the soul could still be barely explained by the peculiarity of the spiritual flowers, then the disappearance of his own cultivation undoubtedly pointed to one thing: this sea of flowers was most likely transformed from cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Born but not born, dead but not dead. Formless, transformed into flowers..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to Senior Stone's indication that clues about the Mysterious Heaven Sect could be found here, Li Fan was now almost certain that the anomaly here was inseparable from the Dharma King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gasped, "As expected of the legacy from the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Now that the secret's location had been determined.</p><p></p><p>What needed to be done next was to unravel it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered on the spot for a long time, until the second and third bodies were successively detonated.</p><p></p><p>In the process of constantly feeling the erosion of the spiritual flowers, he finally found a possible solution.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concentrated and condensed a fourth body.</p><p></p><p>Then he flew into the air, embracing the sea of flowers to the greatest extent.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan didn't pay attention to the changes inside his body.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he focused all his attention on the images flashing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>These fragmented images were all very short clips that disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they seemed to have no connection with each other, recording separate events.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Hua Dao Stone was operating at its peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, recorded all these fleeting, fragmented images.</p><p></p><p>When a certain number of recordings were reached, his body couldn't withstand it and exploded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan unhurriedly created a new body and repeated this process.</p><p></p><p>Such unusual behavior naturally attracted the attention of other cultivators in this place.</p><p></p><p>Originally wanting to come forward to chat and inquire about it, after feeling the oppressive aura released by Li Fan, these busybodies all changed their expressions and left with their heads lowered.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>The flashback images collected by Li Fan became more and more.</p><p></p><p>Like a broken puzzle, while collecting the puzzle pieces, Li Fan relied on the powerful computing power of the Hua Dao Stone to try to restore the original complete picture.</p><p></p><p>In the circular mountain here, there were countless wandering flowers.</p><p></p><p>The fragmented images contained within them were even more innumerable.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Hua Dao Stone to sort them out, Li Fan would have no possibility of piecing them together and restoring them.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, with the blue light flashing constantly, complete video clips also appeared in Li Fan's mind one after another.</p>

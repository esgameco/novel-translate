        <h1>Chapter 875</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"If no outsider breaks this cycle, it may have to wait until the power of nurturing souls in the Yellow River is completely dissipated before this phenomenon will completely stop."</p><p></p><p>"However, I observe that the aura here is still very strong. If I didn't have the protection of the seven-colored divine light, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to stay in it for long either."</p><p></p><p>"This level of power..."</p><p></p><p>"It can't possibly only last for twenty or thirty years, right?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt arose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"What broke the peace of the Yin Soul Realm and released the billions of souls from the Yellow Springs?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless it's a cultivator who entered this place by mistake, like me."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>The skull that Li Fan had suppressed not long ago suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that person is not dead yet?"</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly surged.</p><p></p><p>It was not a groundless statement that Li Fan was frightened by the bizarre scene here.</p><p></p><p>But the Yin Soul Realm was extremely remote. Even at his current speed, it would take more than a month of continuous flight.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of entering this place by mistake was really slim, unless one had a definite goal.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, although only the skull remained of that skull.</p><p></p><p>However, the black and gold patterns on the skull still existed under the erosion of gray mold.</p><p></p><p>"The black and gold patterns are immortal on the front, and the gray mold grows inside the skull."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it shows that the power of the two is evenly matched, and neither can do anything to the other."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the appearance of the mysterious skull, Li Fan increasingly felt that his guess had a certain possibility of being true.</p><p></p><p>"If it was completely eroded, it should have been completely turned into ashes like many things in the Yin Soul Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Since the skull is still there, it also means that it has not really died."</p><p></p><p>There are countless secret methods in the cultivation world, and the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm can achieve immortal cave heavens and eternal life.</p><p></p><p>If this mysterious skull can be resurrected with the help of the black and gold patterns, it is not something difficult to accept.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed very dangerous. But it is also an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to understand what exactly happened in other cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed, and he instantly thought of dozens of ways to use it.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not forget the main purpose of coming here.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, this Void Whale can open up space in the void. These spiritual bodies they love so much must be of great benefit to them. Do you want to try it too?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang hurriedly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"They are not human souls. They just look like it."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Tian Yang feel better.</p><p></p><p>He absorbed an old soul that had been soaked in the Yellow Springs water for who knows how long and whose original appearance could no longer be seen.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang circulated his spiritual power and absorbed it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, I know why those big whales like to eat them." Tian Yang said with some excitement.</p><p></p><p>"This small world was originally derived from the Yellow Springs here. It's like a fruit growing on a tree."</p><p></p><p>"In the Yellow Springs water, there are many rare powers of laws. The most abundant of them is the authority to create and open up space."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is only at the level of a small world, it is indeed useful to me."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang said a lot in one breath, and took another spiritual body crystal to absorb while transmitting his voice.</p><p></p><p>This time, he frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it seems to have been affected by the gray mold and has become a bit chaotic."</p><p></p><p>"Taking one is enough, more is of no benefit."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"This place." Tianyang concluded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense swept over and found a spiritual crystal that had some age to it.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing it, some scenes instantly emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The waters of the Yellow Springs, circling and flowing.</p><p></p><p>Every time it reached a few fixed nodes, it would leave behind a few remnants of power.</p><p></p><p>As the months and years passed, these powers accumulated more and more.</p><p></p><p>Then they blossomed and bore fruit, forming a circle of nine "worlds".</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, life was born in these worlds.</p><p></p><p>Civilization began to appear.</p><p></p><p>The lives in the worlds, after death, would return to the Yellow Springs again. After flowing through the river, they would go to other worlds to experience new lives.</p><p></p><p>The peaceful days continued until this day...</p><p></p><p>A golden chain, tearing through the sky, came from the distant void.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Under the huge pulling force, the Yellow Springs world kept rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Mountains and rivers collapsed, as if it was the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>But the chain showed no signs of loosening.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, sacred golden energy kept surging from it.</p><p></p><p>Sharply severing the connection between the Yellow Springs world and space itself, as if wanting to pull it somewhere.</p><p></p><p>This was a majestic force far beyond the Yellow Springs world.</p><p></p><p>There was no room for resistance at all. It was dragged in the void for an unknown distance before it could barely stabilize.</p><p></p><p>The end result was that the Yellow Springs world, under this extreme pulling, shattered into pieces. Only one of the nine worlds remained, and together with the Yellow Springs, it came to this unfamiliar starry space.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scenes in his mind slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes erupted with an unusual light.</p><p></p><p>He had known long ago that in ancient times, the Xuanhuang Realm had an ingenious formation.</p><p></p><p>It could capture cave heavens and small worlds from distant voids.</p><p></p><p>It could even open up spatial passages and directly wage wars between realms.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the countless cave heavens and small worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm today came in this way.</p><p></p><p>But since after the Xuantian Sect and before the Ten Immortal Sects took power, this formation seemed to have been damaged already.</p><p></p><p>Its reputation faded, as if it had disappeared in the long river of history.</p><p></p><p>Now, he actually had the fortune to witness the might of this ancient formation when it was activated, through the memories of the remnant Dao in this Yin Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Spanning across the void, the golden chain seeks enemies..."</p><p></p><p>"How formidable is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could now be considered a grandmaster of formations.</p><p></p><p>With the Endgleave Disk in hand, there might not be anyone in the entire Xuanhuang Realm who could surpass his level in formations.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he found it hard to imagine how such a magnificent formation could be constructed.</p><p></p><p>"Plucking the stars and grasping the moon, this is already the means of a True Immortal, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the fleeting glimpse of the Yellow Springs' remnant memories, the golden chain Li Fan saw.</p><p></p><p>seemed to have some similarities with the one he saw in the Immortal Ruins, used to lock up the remains of a True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there is any connection between them?"</p><p></p><p>"That True Immortal happened to be trapped at the passage between the mortal and immortal realms in the Xuanhuang Realm. It shouldn't be a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"When the immortal path was unbroken, there were still interconnections between the cultivation world and the immortal world."</p><p></p><p>"Since there could be support from immortal tools, assistance in constructing formations should also exist."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang saw that his senior brother remained motionless for a long time and thought something had happened.</p><p></p><p>He inquired via telepathy, only then startling Li Fan awake.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, did you see the scene of the golden chain breaking through the void?"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1017: Tenfold Dissociation Disc</p><p></p><p>"It's imaginable. After all, the cultivators' new cultivation methods completely integrate the resources of heaven and earth with themselves, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. If they are extracted again, it's almost the same as being shattered and separated," Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"This preacher Zheng is indeed a rare talent. If there's a chance, I really want to meet him properly," Li Fan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin shook his head, "Because his suggestion was rejected, Zheng angrily returned to his own small world and won't see anyone. In the short term, there probably won't be any opportunities. Perhaps later, before we leave, we can plan one last time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Having finished talking about this interesting matter, Li Fan took the nine dissociation discs and returned to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the underground secret room, Li Fan solemnly laid out another layer of array protection around him.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he take out the nine newly born dissociation discs and place them in front of him.</p><p></p><p>No longer suppressing the urge to devour them coming from his sea of consciousness, the Ultimate Dissociation Disc flew out directly, like a starved fierce beast, eyes glowing red, staring intently at "itself" in this world.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Li Fan's control, the Ultimate Dissociation Disc would have probably been unable to restrain its instincts and quickly devoured the nine discs.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still maintained a sober mind.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could see clearly, it hid inside and disappeared from view. </p><p></p><p>It also seemed to hear the unwilling and angry wails of the newborn dissociation discs.</p><p></p><p>As the newborn dissociation discs absorbed more and more arrays, their appearance visibly became brighter.</p><p></p><p>But how could they compare to the lucky one who reaped the benefits?</p><p></p><p>This is the so-called forcing growth by pulling up seedlings.</p><p></p><p>What's even more terrifying is that Li Fan also keenly realized that this wasn't even the state of the brand-new Ultimate Dissociation Disc operating at full power!</p><p></p><p>It still had strength to spare!</p><p></p><p>However, what he didn't quite expect was...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the world turned upside down.</p><p></p><p>And the various changes happening to the Ultimate Dissociation Disc also completely subsided.</p><p></p><p>Should he let the Ultimate Dissociation Disc devour the nine discs that haven't been integrated one by one now? Or wait for the nine discs to unite and form a complete dissociation disc before devouring it?</p><p></p><p>It even analyzed itself while speculating.</p><p></p><p>On the stone disc-like surface, profound patterns spontaneously formed one after another.</p><p></p><p>And then it began to manipulate and drive the fusion of the nine discs.</p><p></p><p>When everything was ready, he finally stopped suppressing the Ultimate Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't impatiently devour it immediately, but like a patient gourmet, he tempered this newborn complete form with source power in the same way.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were all rudely stuffed into this newborn dissociation disc by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the severance of the immortal path also affects pure artifacts."</p><p></p><p>The changes continued.</p><p></p><p>"Something is missing."</p><p></p><p>Very similar to the scene when the Lingmu Realm was upgraded, the entire world was trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>The speed of accepting the indoctrination also accelerated accordingly.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the nine discs, in the end, is the weak perishing and the strong surviving.</p><p></p><p>But imperceptibly, it seemed as if something was obstructing it. It also seemed like there was an invisible barrier in front of it.</p><p></p><p>As if returning to simplicity and shedding all pretenses, the originally somewhat shiny Ultimate Dissociation Disc slowly retracted its brilliance in the process of continuously absorbing the newborn entity.</p><p></p><p>Randomly selecting nine discs...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the lucky one, it was held in the palm of the hand. Then, with a light tap, the Ultimate Dissociation Disc floating in the air emitted a white light.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Ultimate Dissociation Disc continued to rise, but ultimately failed to complete the ultimate metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>In the sky of the Lingmu Realm, a hole even opened up out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But the fusion of the two was already destined.</p><p></p><p>The complete Dissociation Disc of this world now exists.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan restricted the Ultimate Dissociation Disc with great determination.</p><p></p><p>Although it did not complete the metamorphosis to the level of an immortal tool, the efficiency of the deduced formation was already incomparable to before!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to hear a faint chewing sound.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up, with anticipation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>At its peak, it declined.</p><p></p><p>After about half a day, the final winner appeared.</p><p></p><p>After appeasing the unwillingness that occasionally came from the Ultimate Dissociation Disc, and when it finally accepted this helpless reality, Li Fan began to try to operate this sublimated Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>The creatures living in the Lingmu Realm all sensed that something extraordinary was happening.</p><p></p><p>The hole lasted for a while, but the desired change never came.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Dissociation Disc needed to spend a lot of time learning and constantly deducing to understand the formations.</p><p></p><p>But under Li Fan's deliberate concealment, the source of the anomaly could not be located.</p><p></p><p>With the enhancement of this innate pattern, the aura faintly revealed by the Ultimate Dissociation Disc became more and more extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It became like a model that had existed for a long time, made of stone.</p><p></p><p>The remaining eight Dissociation Discs seemed to sense the crisis.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, who had personally experienced the nine-disc fusion and now mastered formation knowledge far beyond this era, it was just a matter of capturing them with ease.</p><p></p><p>The constantly changing information in the white light represented countless formations that had not yet been recorded by the Dissociation Discs at this point in time.</p><p></p><p>Although the process of deducing formations was interrupted by the fusion, as the owner of the Ultimate Dissociation Disc, Li Fan also clearly felt the unimaginable metamorphosis happening to it.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that outside the hole, something was descending.</p><p></p><p>The most notable thing was that not only did the speed of analyzing the "Wanling Guishu" grand formation increase by several times.</p><p></p><p>The central hole in the sky of the Lingmu Realm gradually decreased with the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>After devouring its companions, the lucky one became more and more powerful.</p><p></p><p>The answer was obvious.</p><p></p><p>The pace of devouring other newborn Dissociation Discs also kept accelerating.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held the brand-new Ultimate Dissociation Disc in his hand, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>So, the "lucky one" who finally won the life-and-death struggle among its siblings instantly fell into the mouth of the black hand behind it.</p><p></p><p>In just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the first Dissociation Disc was eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Forced to push its own deduction speed to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was still strength left to carry out the previous task of deducing and breaking the seal of the Dharma Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan estimated that after devouring another self, the overall deduction efficiency of the Ultimate Dissociation Disc had expanded by more than tenfold!</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Although it did not ascend to the level of an immortal tool, Li Fan believed that at this moment, the Ultimate Dissociation Disc had definitely reached the pinnacle of mortal objects.</p><p></p><p>Even in terms of pure formation deduction ability, it might already be no weaker than some immortal tools!</p><p></p><p>The effect was so good that it truly exceeded Li Fan's expectations!</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of the self brought an effect far greater than one plus one..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately fell into deep thought.</p>

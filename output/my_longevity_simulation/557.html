        <h1>Chapter 557</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Gazing into the distance, the sight seemed to cross over thousands of miles, reaching a deep underwater trench.</p><p></p><p>That was the location where Han Yi appeared after escaping from the small world since childhood.</p><p></p><p>"There aren't any ordinary people here, only a world full of 'Beast-kind'..." Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Based on Han Yi's memories, Li Fan believed that the creatures in that small world were somewhat similar to the 'Beast-kind' he had encountered several times before, which were beings that were half-human and half-beast.</p><p></p><p>However, there were subtle differences as well.</p><p></p><p>Although they were a mix of humans and demon beasts, in the 'Beast-kind,' the part that belonged to "humans" was slightly more dominant. </p><p></p><p>As for the creatures in the small world Han Li experienced, they leaned more towards being "demon beasts."</p><p></p><p>This could be deduced from whether their heads were that of a human or a beast, revealing some clues.</p><p></p><p>What was even more interesting was the legend that Han Yi had heard about that world. </p><p></p><p>In the beginning, most of the residents above the wilderness had the appearance of being half-beast and half-human. There were even quite a few who were purely "human."</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, there were occasional descendants among the residents who had a higher degree of beastification. </p><p></p><p>Initially, these mutants were considered heretics, abandoned, or even hunted down.</p><p></p><p>But when some of these mutants stubbornly survived and demonstrated great power, things began to change.</p><p></p><p>They slaughtered the original villages on the wilderness and migrated to the depths of the wilderness, establishing a new order.</p><p></p><p>There, the higher the degree of beastification, the more esteemed the status.</p><p></p><p>The stark difference in ideologies inevitably led to wars.</p><p></p><p>On the wilderness, the strong reigned supreme. The individual strength of the mutants who had devolved from their ancestors was evidently stronger than the common beast-kind.</p><p></p><p>Although initially, they were outnumbered, causing the battles to be evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, their numbers increased, and they began to display overwhelming combat prowess in the war.</p><p></p><p>After bloody massacres, the opposition naturally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Thus, on the wilderness, it became what Han Yi saw, where "beasts were respected, and humans were considered heretics."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's related to a route prepared by 'Emperor One' for the demon beast tribe. But it seems like His plan has failed," Li Fan contemplated.</p><p></p><p>"When the bloodline of the demon beasts is triggered, they are much stronger than ordinary humans," Li Fan thought of the deities in that world.</p><p></p><p>The celestial destiny Xuan Bird.</p><p></p><p>Although there were other beings in the Xuan Bird tribe, when Li Fan saw the statue of the deity, he suddenly felt a strange sensation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That celestial destiny Xuan Bird was the same one that Li Fan had possessed in the Meteor Immortal Realm and had once accompanied Xu Ke as "Xiao Hei."</p><p></p><p>There was no concrete evidence for this feeling; perhaps it was just due to Li Fan having possessed it, resulting in a mysterious connection.</p><p></p><p>"It actually fell?"</p><p></p><p>"Weird."</p><p></p><p>"Even a mere Green Phoenix bird is doing fine. It doesn't make sense that the Xuan Bird fused with a small world's celestial destiny would fall first," Li Fan furrowed his brows, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, he came to terms with it.</p><p></p><p>Among humans, strength often meant longevity. But in the demon beast community, this principle did not necessarily apply.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Even though he was very intrigued by that small world, Li Fan knew it wasn't the time to explore it yet.</p><p></p><p>Although Han Yi was only at the Qi-Refining stage and couldn't use spiritual power, managing to stir up storms there easily made it seem like there was no danger in that small world.</p><p></p><p>However, knowing that Han Yi manipulated the free celestial destinies with the 'Destiny Scriptures,' he was essentially half a child of destiny and would naturally turn unfavorable situations into favorable ones.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan rashly entered without using the method of controlling the destiny, he might encounter some misfortunes.</p><p></p><p>He might even accidentally run into the millennium great demon in the depths of the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>After all, when Li Fan attempted to follow Han Yi into the deep-sea cave back then, the sudden feeling of danger that arose in his heart was not a false alarm.</p><p></p><p>Before mastering the method of controlling celestial destinies, Li Fan would not venture into unknown risks.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, whatever happened back then, I will soon know once I reach the Meteor Immortal Realm," Li Fan withdrew his gaze and headed towards the nearest guarding island.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he arrived at the Chongwu Island.</p><p></p><p>As a nominal subordinate, Li Fan knew a bit about this person. He was meticulous in trivial matters and extremely muddled in significant matters, constantly making small mistakes and being excessively greedy.</p><p></p><p>He was the perfect candidate.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concealed his true cultivation level and only showed the aura of Foundation Establishment perfection when visiting.</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you, Daoist friend?" Huang Ranqi handed him a cup of tea, smiling amiably and asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan appeared as his original self, not in the appearance of the "Ancient Celestial Master." Therefore, Huang Ranqi did not recognize him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands: "I am Li Fan!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough..." Huang Ranqi, who was leisurely sipping tea, almost spurted out the water in his mouth upon hearing Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>After coughing a few times to relieve his embarrassment, Huang Ranqi lost his voice and asked, "You are also named Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, upon hearing this, looked strange and curiously asked, "Why does Daoist friend say so? What do you mean by 'also'?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Daoist friend also knows another cultivator named Li Fan?" He quickly seemed to react, looking extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, does Daoist friend lock himself up and not come out? Not even aware of the title of a senior envoy?" Huang Ranqi squinted his eyes, carefully examining Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly as Daoist friend guessed! I was originally a wandering cultivator in the Congyun Sea. In the past few years, I went out to seek opportunities to break through. Who knew I accidentally entered and got lost in a dangerous small world until I recently managed to escape back," Li Fan shook his head, looking deeply emotional.</p><p></p><p>He vividly described his experiences in the small world to Huang Ranqi.</p><p></p><p>"No spiritual energy, but beasts everywhere?" Huang Ranqi was indeed attracted by the strange scenes depicted by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"To survive in such a ferocious place and return alive, Daoist friend must have exceptional luck," he also sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement, "What Daoist friend said is true. Between life and death, it's the most likely to stir up emotions. That's why, having just returned, I successfully broke through the bottleneck and reached Foundation Establishment perfection."</p><p></p><p>"As I just said, I was just a wandering cultivator originally. For the sake of 'freedom,' I was unwilling to join the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and be exploited. But after this ordeal, I have come to understand. As long as one can live, what freedom, it's simply not worth mentioning!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan earnestly said, "So, I would like to ask Daoist friend for a recommendation!"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment and observing Li Fan up and down for a while, Huang Ranqi did not immediately agree.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that recently there have been tensions between the Five Elders Council and our Immortal Alliance, with frequent frictions. Could it be that Daoist friend is a spy sent by the Five Elders Council?" Huang Ranqi suddenly asked.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 316</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In a voice full of constant surprises, Li Fan swallowed all the broken eggshells into his stomach. </p><p></p><p>Scorching energy surged from his abdomen, circulating non-stop throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>This power was extremely refined. Li Fan, who originally walked with a bit of a stagger, was able to hop and jump around in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Wow... as expected of the divine bird's descendant, it's really amazing! It can walk on its own not long after being born! Doesn't that mean in no time, I'll be able to ride it and fly?" </p><p></p><p>Ignoring the muttering voice in his ears, Li Fan walked to the water's edge in a somewhat depressed manner and looked at his own reflection.</p><p></p><p>"It's so damn ugly!"</p><p></p><p>A strange bird with no feathers grown, and red exposed skin all over its body, appeared in Li Fan's field of vision.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhang, I actually miss you a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Hanging out with you, at least I was a true disciple of Zixiao Sect. Now opening a new map, I can't even be human anymore, and actually reincarnated into such a stupid bird."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was due to the influence of the possessed strange bird, Li Fan's thoughts at this time were somewhat lively and unrestrained, very different from his usual calm state.</p><p></p><p>"Good birdie, grow up quickly..." The chattering voice sounded again, making Li Fan even more irritated.</p><p></p><p>However, a red plant that looked like a worm or grass stretched out in front of Li Fan, instantly making him throw all his unhappiness to the back of his mind.</p><p></p><p>He snatched it with one bite and swallowed it into his stomach in a few gulps.</p><p></p><p>An indescribable sense of satisfaction instantly welled up in his heart, just like the refreshing feeling of occasionally obtaining a heavenly wonder during the Qi Refining stage or condensing pills with hundreds of methods during the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Almost in an instant, it made Li Fan lose his ability to think.</p><p></p><p>Only a blank consciousness remained, floating in an ocean of joy for a long time. After the transcendent pleasure gradually subsided, Li Fan slowly regained his ability to ponder.</p><p></p><p>However, the impact brought by that red insect grass from before still lingered in his mind, making it unforgettable. While reminiscing endlessly, greed inevitably surged. </p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this thing?" Li Fan was shocked in his heart, but couldn't help looking eagerly at the owner of that voice.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me like that, this [Jing Insect Grass] is something I painstakingly saved up. After eating it, there won't be any more for a short time!"</p><p></p><p>A young boy, who looked only twelve or thirteen years old, was scratching the back of his head and apologizing with an embarrassed face.</p><p></p><p>"No more?" Disappointment and anger suddenly arose.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, in a fit of anger, crawled onto the boy's head in a flash and stomped furiously.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the boy's originally neat hair became as messy as a bird's nest. The boy didn't get angry either, only tilting his head and grinning foolishly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became even more enraged, and simply took his head as a nest and settled down.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, little guy, don't be angry anymore. Although there's no more Jing Insect Grass, there are countless secret realm spirit mountains inside our Beast Taming Sect's mountain gate, with so many good things. We definitely won't let you starve! Come, I'll take you to find something to eat right now." After saying that, the boy threw out a feather.</p><p></p><p>The feather bloomed with white light. After a moment, an elegant and extraordinary red-crowned crane appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The boy skillfully straddled the red-crowned crane, hugged its neck tightly with both hands, and shouted loudly, "Little Red, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The immortal crane let out a loud cry, then flapped its wings and flew into the sky. The wind howled in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The boy didn't forget about Li Fan on his head, carefully protecting him with his hands to prevent him from being blown away.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, a familiar warm energy was transferred over to help resist the cold air at high altitudes.</p><p></p><p>With the help of this peaceful energy, Li Fan's agitated mood also gradually calmed down. He seized this rare opportunity to analyze the encounter in this Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The possessed target this time is a bit special."</p><p></p><p>"It's a strange bird that struggled out of an eggshell."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit novel."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike possessing a cultivator and being able to maintain self-thought, after possessing a strange beast, one's mood and personality will also be affected by the beast, making it almost impossible to control oneself and act according to instinct."</p><p></p><p>"It's not negative emotions, but the nature of the beast's own personality. So the previously invincible Xuanhuang Heart Refining Spell was ineffective for the first time."</p><p></p><p>"Unless the true form is revealed and the Blue Flame Method is activated, otherwise, with the current means, it seems impossible to break free."</p><p></p><p>"This place seems to be the ancient Beast Taming Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The boy under my feet should be a disciple of the Beast Taming Sect. When I was in the eggshell earlier, the gentle energy that sustained my life and helped me break out of the shell was released by him."</p><p></p><p>"The beast taming techniques of the Beast Taming Sect? While helping strange beasts grow..."</p><p></p><p>"It can also strengthen the bond between the two." Sensing slightly, Li Fan pondered inwardly. Although Li Fan would tease the boy under the drive of the angry nature, in fact, to the possessed strange bird, the boy was like a parent.</p><p></p><p>As someone experiencing it firsthand, Li Fan was very clear about where the strange bird's anger came from.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its own appetite not being satisfied, it was more about the dependence on humans that emerged from time to time in its heart, conflicting with the instinctive will of its bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Instinct told the strange bird that it shouldn't be so close to humans, but it couldn't control the emotions welling up in its heart. That's why it appeared so irritable.</p><p></p><p>"The Beast Taming Sect indeed has some tricks."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there are any other effects."</p><p></p><p>While thinking, Li Fan lay on top of the boy's head and looked down.</p><p></p><p>The strange bird's vision far surpassed that of humans. Even above the clouds, everything on the ground could be seen clearly.</p><p></p><p>In the continuous mountains, spirit fields were distributed in a stepped manner.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators, controlling ox-bodied and horse-faced strange beasts, were farming in the fields. Not far away on the mountaintop, many buildings stood sparsely.</p><p></p><p>Further away, a tall tower seemed to faintly sense a familiar and fearful aura emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>"Not far ahead is the fire-attributed spirit field."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone says you are a descendant of the divine bird, with a fiery nature. Eating more Scarlet Essence Leaves and Profound Fire Fruits will definitely be good for your body, no mistake."</p><p></p><p>The boy said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that my senior brothers have been busy lately for some reason. I'll bring you to secretly eat some, there shouldn't be any problem."</p><p></p><p>After flying for a long time, the newborn Li Fan became a bit sleepy again.</p><p></p><p>"If you say so, then so be it..."</p><p></p><p>Using his slightly hardened claws, he gently scratched the boy's hair, signaling him to transfer some more energy over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan yawned and was about to fall asleep again. At this moment, a tiger's roar resounded through the sky, startling Li Fan awake.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he saw a blue figure standing on a tiger-bodied, human-faced monster, coming from afar.</p><p></p><p>It whistled past Li Fan's head in an instant and disappeared into the distance, heading to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>The airflow and gale it brought up made even the red-crowned crane the boy was riding on a bit unsteady.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 543</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He said sternly, "This matter is extremely important. After our evaluation, the significance does not lie in the prophecy of Tianxuan Soul Lock and the unification of Xuanyuan and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Even..." Li Fan looked at the disturbed face of the stone man completely unsettled, with a faint smile in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Continuing his words, "If the Wanxian Alliance completes this matter without hindrance, it is likely to completely change the power balance between the Immortal Alliance and your Five Elders Council."</p><p></p><p>"The overall strength of the Five Elders Council and the Wanxian Alliance is evenly matched. Even because of the presence of the Transcendent Master of the Law, it has been subtly suppressed. If the power of the Wanxian Alliance is strengthened, it is feared that from now on, the Five Elders Council will always be unable to raise their heads, and will remain at a disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>"This is something we do not want to see," Li Fan spoke truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"This is also the reason why I am so anxious to find you. I also know that a spy contacting superiors so frequently will definitely arouse suspicion. But the situation arose suddenly, and I have no choice but to take this reluctant step," Li Fan sighed and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?" The man's tone became extremely serious. He believed that the other party would not deceive him on such a matter, and must have valid reasons.</p><p></p><p>But to be more important than the prophecy of the unification of Xuanyuan and earth...</p><p></p><p>This seemed a bit exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that since he last reported the prophecy to the organization, there have been many major movements within the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>His superiors have treated him in an unprecedentedly friendly manner. They even promised that as long as he achieves another equivalent merit, not only can he retire honorably without having to struggle on the front lines, but he can also redeem his soul contract, becoming the most enviable "free and easy layman" among the group of the Five Elders Council cultivators.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It can be seen from this that the prophecy of the unification of Xuanyuan and earth likely involves a great deal of secrecy.</p><p></p><p>But now, this mysterious cultivator in the disguise of Zhou Qing'ang's skin, says there is something even more important than it?</p><p></p><p>The man felt his heart pounding fiercely like never before.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his chance for a complete change in fate has arrived?</p><p></p><p>"What is it exactly?" he asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised a index finger, "The old rule. Ten million contribution points."</p><p></p><p>Before the man could speak, Li Fan explained, "The development of any organization cannot do without sufficient funds."</p><p></p><p>"Although we do not want the Wanxian Alliance to grow bigger, causing an imbalance of power between you, but all this must be based on ensuring our own existence and development first."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think it's expensive. Since you were willing to spend ten million contributions last time..."</p><p></p><p>"Trust me, this time will definitely not be a loss."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked earnestly at the stone-faced man, "Quickly go apply above, I'll be waiting here for your response."</p><p></p><p>The man hesitated for a moment, then quickly disappeared from the stone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood still, closing his eyes and waiting.</p><p></p><p>After about the time for an incense stick to burn, the man reappeared, "The upper echelons have agreed. How should we proceed with the transaction?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan opened his eyes abruptly, "Shortly after, the mysterious words from the Sea of Clouds, Li Fan, will start the contribution point collection again."</p><p></p><p>"You just need to transfer ten million contribution points to He Zhenghao, who is in charge of the collection, within three months."</p><p></p><p>"Alright... let's use the pseudonym Han Wuyou." Li Fan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Wuyou?"</p><p></p><p>The man was startled, quickly shaking his head, "We should change the pseudonym. This one is a bit taboo."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Then let it be Liu Yihang," he said again.</p><p></p><p>"No problem with that. What about the thing you mentioned just now..."</p><p></p><p>Before the man could finish his sentence, Li Fan interrupted, "The situation is urgent, we can't delay. Since you've agreed, I can tell you now."</p><p></p><p>"As for if you breach the contract just for the sake of ten million contribution points..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let out a deep laugh, "That can only mean we have misjudged you. The Five Elders Council simply does not qualify to contend with the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"This information, we'll give it to you for free."</p><p></p><p>"I believe you will make the right choice."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed his hands on the smooth stone, transmitting the information he had prepared to his heart using secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Wood Attribute Cave Heaven, are there four other major Cave Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"Forming a Five Elements Formation, with each Cave Heaven having abundant resources, like a fully developed new world?" After a moment, the man's exclamation came.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, within three months, ten million contribution points," Li Fan timely reminded, bringing the amazed man back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>[Seriously, I've been using the Change Source App to read and catch up on novels lately. Source-changing, multiple voice tones, available on both android and apple.]</p><p></p><p>Before the man had a chance to speak, Li Fan clapped his hands, shattering the stone into powder.</p><p></p><p>He then proceeded to completely destroy the remains of the underwater ruins, covering all traces, before returning to the City of Clouds in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Political Hall at this moment, the original Li Fan stood up.</p><p></p><p>"If things go as expected, the Five Elders Council, which has learned of the existence of the Five Elements Grand Cave Heavens, will definitely not remain indifferent."</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance should also rise up in defense, and a great battle will be imminent."</p><p></p><p>"I remember in the last life, after the situation became tense, the battle was extremely fierce. Cultivators above Yuan Infant stage from all the states were mobilized to the Tianling Prefecture battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, many cultivators perished. Even though in this life I only have the cultivation of the Golden Core stage on the surface, I have slaughtered several Yuan Infant stage cultivators in cooperation. With the actual combat power I have shown, there is still a high possibility that I will be enlisted."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianling Prefecture battlefield...it's better to stay away from it."</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan immediately called for Gao Yuan and He Zhenghao to come forward, announcing two matters.</p><p></p><p>The first matter is that he claimed to have sensed a rare and significant opportunity about to arrive. And now, as the actual ruler of the Sea of Clouds, in line with the principle of seeking benefits for the cultivators of the Sea of Clouds, he decided to restart the contribution point collection plan.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit for this collection this time is...</p><p></p><p>One hundred million.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan mentioned the word "one hundred million," He Zhenghao's eyes widened, and he stared blankly, unable to regain his senses for a while.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan, on the other hand, looked at Li Fan with enthusiasm in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Before they could recover, Li Fan announced the second matter.</p><p></p><p>This contribution point collection this time is of great importance and must not fail.</p><p></p><p>He needed to make thorough preparations.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, starting today, he would enter into a deep closed-door cultivation state.</p><p></p><p>And would cut off all means of contact to avoid any disturbances.</p><p></p><p>Only when everything is properly prepared, will he come out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Upon hearing that Li Fan would enter seclusion while also initiating contribution point collection, the seemingly contradictory orders, Gao Yuan and He Zhenghao furrowed their brows simultaneously, seeming a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, Gao Yuan reacted quickly and promptly said, "I obey the order of the Secret Envoy."</p><p></p><p></p>

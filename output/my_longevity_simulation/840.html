            <p>Time seemed to have stopped flowing.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present were in a state of inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, He Zhenghao was the first to make a decision. </p><p></p><p>He said solemnly, "I am willing to give it a try!"</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I'm just a small island guardian. There's not much to regret if I give it up!"</p><p></p><p>A long-lost glimmer flashed in He Zhenghao's eyes, "Now with the help of the mutual aid society, I've obtained the Nascent Soul cultivation method in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the Golden Core stage is just around the corner, and achieving Nascent Soul will be within grasp."</p><p></p><p>"If I can enter the central provinces of the Immortal Alliance at the Golden Core stage..."</p><p></p><p>"My future prospects will be vastly different from staying in the Congyun Sea!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was trying to convince himself, while also persuading the others present to join him.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's tone was firm, yet full of incitement.</p><p></p><p>With a trailblazer leading the way, three more cultivators made the same choice.</p><p></p><p>But that was the extent of it.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority were unwilling to give up their current comfortable positions and challenge themselves again with courage and confidence.</p><p></p><p>After all, even with the leaked exam content...</p><p></p><p>What was contained in the jade slip given by Ji Shaoli was truly too much.</p><p></p><p>Whether one could memorize it all was still questionable. </p><p></p><p>There was a big difference between rote memorization and truly mastering the material.</p><p></p><p>With the grand examination approaching, the remaining time was too tight.</p><p></p><p>It simply wasn't enough for them to adequately prepare.</p><p></p><p>Bluntly put, the chances of success were not high.</p><p></p><p>However, out of the eleven, four were willing to take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>This ratio somewhat exceeded Ji Shaoli's expectations.</p><p></p><p>He laughed as he looked at He Zhenghao and the other three, applauding and praising, "Rest assured, you will never regret today's decision."</p><p></p><p>"Before the grand examination arrives, you can prepare on the island. I will provide you with some necessary assistance."</p><p></p><p>The four couldn't help but be overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining few, seeing Ji Shaoli's confident manner, they couldn't help feeling a few traces of regret in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli then turned to comfort the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"The Congyun Sea still requires everyone's care after all. Deciding to stay and develop here is not wrong either."</p><p></p><p>Only then did everyone feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>Tianling Province.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's group of three had already returned near the entrance of the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The earth tremors in Qiling Province had attracted the attention of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they did not alert anyone.</p><p></p><p>The process of relocating the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven's passage entrance was also carried out silently.</p><p></p><p>After all, Harmonized Dao cultivators were already the pinnacle of cultivation among those who normally acted in the open.</p><p></p><p>With the combined efforts of Lin Ling and Tian Yang, plus Li Fan who was proficient in formations.</p><p></p><p>Concealing it from the detection of cultivators inside Tianling Province was truly too easy.</p><p></p><p>"It's just relocating the passage entrance, moving it into the Lingmu Realm. It's not truly changing the location of the grotto-heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, there is still some danger."</p><p></p><p>"If discovered, the Lingmu Realm would be exposed instead."</p><p></p><p>"However, once I truly devour the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, this hidden danger will naturally disappear."</p><p></p><p>The spatial record data on the Tianling Province side had been recorded.</p><p></p><p>Next, only one person needed to return to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Lingmu Realm, they just needed to complete the passage connection.</p><p></p><p>Having Lin Ling make a trip wouldn't take too long.</p><p></p><p>It's just...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at Lin Ling unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>From the moment they set foot in Tianling Province, she seemed a bit unsettled and absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling, what happened? Why do I feel...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your heart is very troubled?" Li Fan asked telepathically.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Lin Ling's tone was somewhat alarmed. After a moment of hesitation, she confessed everything: "There seems to be an ominous presence here."</p><p></p><p>"It's what the ancient tree elder of the ley lines had previously instructed us to avoid as much as possible - the Mother Tree..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p></p><p>"Ruomu?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this name appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Back in the 115th world, he had also encountered Ruomu's incarnation in this very Tianling Province.</p><p></p><p>The Decayed Wood Taoist.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Ling could sense Ruomu's presence here again, it was to be expected.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Li Fan's heart tremble was this:</p><p></p><p>If Lin Ling could sense Ruomu,</p><p></p><p>Could Ruomu also detect Lin Ling's existence?</p><p></p><p>A bone-chilling sense of dread suddenly rose from his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately ordered Tian Yang to accompany Lin Ling and quickly leave Tianling Province.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Ling was safely escorted back, they would return.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang promptly followed the order.</p><p></p><p>As the two departed, the fear in Li Fan's heart gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"The sense of crisis that emerged just now was not an illusion."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling must have indeed fallen into Ruomu's sight."</p><p></p><p>"However, whether it was Lin Ling's luck or for some other reason, she chose not to take action."</p><p></p><p>When Tian Yang reported their safe return to the Spirit Wood Realm,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally breathed a complete sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the danger posed by Ruomu was even greater than that of the Celestial Physician.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ruomu and Mr. White</p><p></p><p>were the only two beings he had encountered so far that could render even his Returning to Truth technique useless.</p><p></p><p>"Surviving the previous encounter was a stroke of luck."</p><p></p><p>"If there's a next time, the outcome is truly uncertain."</p><p></p><p>Without the assistance of Lin Ling's ley line power, Tian Yang's solo flight was much slower.</p><p></p><p>Having to prevent being discovered by cultivators along the way further reduced his flying speed.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan waited patiently, a flash of inspiration struck his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ruomu harbors extreme hatred towards cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"From time to time, she would deceive and capture cultivators to use as tools for producing golden cores."</p><p></p><p>"However, her incarnation as the Decayed Wood Taoist does not always appear in the world. At least in the 115th world, when Xi Men Yu sought her out under my guidance, he couldn't find any trace of her."</p><p></p><p>"Previously, Ruomu appeared because of the outbreak of the great war in Tianling Province, causing countless cultivators to perish."</p><p></p><p>"Could her appearance this time also be related to too many cultivators dying?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>With Ruomu's cultivation level, if she truly wanted to deceive cultivators, she wouldn't need to personally incarnate and expend some words.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's view, Ruomu was actually enjoying this process.</p><p></p><p>Watching cultivators gradually lose themselves in her words,</p><p></p><p>And finally, willingly hanging themselves on tree branches, becoming tools for nurturing golden cores for lifetime after lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu's hatred-filled heart must feel immense pleasure from this.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's just like how we humans would have a celebratory drink when encountering a joyous occasion," Li Fan silently speculated.</p><p></p><p>"Ruomu's reappearance now might indeed signify that another mass death of cultivators is about to occur."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it hasn't concretely happened yet, she has already detected some signs."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was lost in thought,</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang finally arrived after much delay.</p><p></p><p>After some effort, he finally changed the entrance to the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Only when the residual spatial fluctuations here dissipated did Li Fan depart.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1212</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Yishi Sect was once one of the ten great immortal sects of the past, alongside the Tianjian and Dadao Sects.</p><p></p><p>However, its presence was relatively much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Not only was there basically no contact with it in the Xunxian Realm, but it was also difficult to find relevant records in the current era.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have suddenly vanished from the world.</p><p></p><p>Apart from previously learning by chance from Senior Shiban that the Five Elements Great Cavern used to form his Nascent Soul was the handiwork of the Yishi Sect,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't know much more about it.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, today, three thousand zhang underground in this rift valley, he actually discovered traces of the Yishi Sect.</p><p></p><p>But it was only traces after all.</p><p></p><p>The entire ruins were empty.</p><p></p><p>Except for a collapsed building in the center of the ruins, where a stone tablet vaguely engraved with the two characters "Yishi" could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Nothing else could be found here that displayed the grandeur of the top ten immortal sects of ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this Yishi Sect didn't fare very well."</p><p></p><p>After inquiring with Sun Luyao, he learned that this was indeed the ruins where they had discovered the Infinite Mirror back then.</p><p></p><p>It's just that at that time, they had only broken into a small part of the area.</p><p></p><p>Now, for some unknown reason, the formations separating the different areas had disappeared, revealing the true appearance of the entire Yishi Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite vastness, visible in one direction!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chanted softly with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Silently, the Infinite Mirror once again emitted a faint light imperceptible to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it enveloped the entire Yishi Sect ruins.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the complete structural map of the ruins was immediately synchronized and displayed in the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It even included information such as which places still had spiritual energy fluctuations, which places had hidden chambers, the degree of danger in each area...</p><p></p><p>All this was accomplished by the Infinite Mirror right under Ji Hongdao's nose.</p><p></p><p>However, this person, who was already one of the top existence among the Wanxian Alliance's array masters, had no awareness of it whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but recall in his mind the scene from his 114th life, when he went to the Tianyuzhou at Congyun Sea to study arrays, and Ji Hongdao personally taught classes to more than a thousand array geniuses of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes at that time, let alone Ji Hongdao, even Huangfu Song's array attainment level was an existence he could not reach.</p><p></p><p>After just a dozen or so reincarnations, his array attainment had reached a level that Ji Hongdao couldn't even comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"In every life, I keep moving forward, while they remain in the same place..."</p><p></p><p>"The gap will only grow larger in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Sun Luyuan and the other two who were still cautiously exploring step by step, and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, be careful, the array aura here is the most complete..." Ji Hongdao reminded, leading the way in front.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao felt a little speechless in his heart, but he couldn't expose it.</p><p></p><p>The two proceeded with extreme caution, passing through the wall concealed by the array and entering a secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>At the very back of the secret room stood two statues, one large and one small.</p><p></p><p>The large one sat cross-legged on a futon, holding a duster in its hand.</p><p></p><p>The small one stood behind it, a smile on its face.</p><p></p><p>These strange statues instantly attracted the attention of the two.</p><p></p><p>They observed carefully without making any rash moves.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be just simple stone statues, nothing mysterious." After a long time, Ji Hongdao made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan heard this and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at the scene scanned and drawn by the previous Vastness Revealing Array, then looked at the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>His heart sank.</p><p></p><p>"Can you see those two..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The statues?" Li Fan asked Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>"Statues? What statues?" Sun Luyao was stunned and a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Tell your brother not to touch them," Li Fan commanded directly without explanation.</p><p></p><p>Having been alerted by Sun Luyao, Sun Luyuan, out of trust in his younger brother, stopped Ji Hongdao's attempt to investigate further.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what exactly is the danger with these things?"</p><p></p><p>However, after repeatedly examining the stone statues for a long time, he couldn't see anything unusual about them.</p><p></p><p>"I once came across records in ancient books that were somewhat similar to these two statues. They seem to be the source of the Ten Sect's inheritance, the Great Master Tiandu..." Sun Luyao relayed Li Fan's judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Great Master Tiandu?" Sun Luyuan and Ji Hongdao both took a step back.</p><p></p><p>They had heard of this legendary figure.</p><p></p><p>It is said that he was at the level of a half-step True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Anything that could be associated with a True Immortal was bound to inspire awe.</p><p></p><p>In the Wuliang Mirror, Li Fan's thoughts were racing.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had been badly deceived by the faceless True Immortal's stone statue.</p><p></p><p>It took him six reincarnations to eliminate the faceless True Immortal's influence on him.</p><p></p><p>Although Great Master Tiandu and the faceless True Immortal were not on the same level, the former had also left a mark on him.</p><p></p><p>He had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense for the Yishi Sect's inheritance to come from Great Master Tiandu and for the sect to have the Great Master's stone statues."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"The other Immortal Dao sects don't seem to have the Great Master's stone statues."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if they wanted to worship, they should have placed them in the solemn central hall. How could they put them in a dark underground chamber?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's intuition told him that there was something strange about this.</p><p></p><p>"The Yishi Sect doesn't seem to be the kind of people who respect their teachers. According to the description of the Stone Tablet Predecessor, they had already made plans to cultivate the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven and directly devour the Xuanhuang Realm to create a brand new cultivation world when the great calamity of the Xuanhuang Realm first appeared. It's just that they were stopped later."</p><p></p><p>"The one who stopped the Yishi Sect must have been Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>"Before the Xuanhuang Realm completely opposed the cultivators, the cultivators still revered the Dao of Heaven. Born from Heaven and nurtured by Earth, like the parents of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"But the Yishi Sect didn't hesitate to cut off the essence of Heaven and Earth. No different from the new method cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Great Master Tiandu..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used the Hongmeng Jianfang Formation to scan the stone statues of Great Master Tiandu again.</p><p></p><p>There were two statues, one large and one small.</p><p></p><p>According to legend, it was the one sitting who imparted countless techniques and secret arts to the Ten Sects.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's instinct told him that the standing boy statue might be even more extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>So the Hongmeng Jianfang Formation focused on the smiling boy statue.</p><p></p><p>The boundless dim light swept over the area where the stone statues were located again and again.</p><p></p><p>With each scan, the image displayed in the Wuliang Mirror slowly revealed some lines.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, these lines were slowly disappearing as time passed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and increased the scanning speed of the Wuliang Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The lines were able to slowly accumulate again.</p><p></p><p>"Brother. Help me."</p><p></p><p>Unable to bear the overloaded use, Sun Luyao asked his brother for help.</p><p></p><p>Only after receiving the support of Sun Luyuan's essence blood did the Wuliang Mirror finally reveal the true face of the stone statues in the chamber.</p><p></p><p>They were two bones.</p>

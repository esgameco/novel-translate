            <p>Chapter 1264: Peering into the Boundless Rift</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the cultivation world, the strong are ultimately respected. </p><p></p><p>The key still lies in the final battle with the Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "He who knows himself is wise." The Sage Emperor was very clear about his current strength, which was certainly still significantly inferior to the Dharma Transmitter's.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party had dominated the Xuanhuang realm for thousands of years and had gained insights in the depths of the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>He could truly be called unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sage Emperor had now barely reached the limit of the Xuanhuang realm and had the fortuitous encounter of gaining the Starry Sea's Origin Dao Intent,</p><p></p><p>He had not yet truly transformed this fortuitous encounter into strength.</p><p></p><p>"I need more time."</p><p></p><p>In the Sage Emperor's heart, a deep sense of urgency involuntarily arose.</p><p></p><p>"Time waits for no one."</p><p></p><p>Before going to the Starry Sea this time, he did not have this feeling. But ever since returning from the Starry Sea, a subtle premonition told him that the time left for him might not be much.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Sun Family.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan circulated his spiritual power to resist the bone-chilling cold surrounding his body and slowly walked into the room.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Sun Tianci sitting cross-legged on the bed, not crying or making a fuss, just quietly spacing out, a sense of helplessness welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Every family has difficulties.</p><p></p><p>Outsiders only knew that Sun Tianci was born in accordance with the Dao and had an imposing manner, but they did not know that this kid, perhaps because he had witnessed his own biological mother's death with his own eyes from the moment he was born, had become very cold to outsiders.</p><p></p><p>His body naturally released an aura that resisted extreme cold, making it difficult for outsiders to approach.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been born with the cultivation of being in accordance with the Dao, he probably would have starved to death in a few days due to lack of care.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how extraordinary, he was still just a newborn baby who needed to be taken care of.</p><p></p><p>The few members of the Sun family who were in accordance with the Dao could only take turns.</p><p></p><p>"Ci'er..." Sun Luyuan showed a kind smile and took out the top-grade spiritual liquid he had concocted.</p><p></p><p>"Would you like to eat something?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci just shook his head slightly, refusing.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan felt a burst of helplessness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Then he suddenly remembered something and said softly again, "When I went to visit your father this time, he learned of your birth and personally created a dharma door for you. Take a look..."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Sun Luyuan transmitted the "Prospering of the Orthodox Dharma" that Li Fan had created to Sun Tianci via divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that it was created by his father whom he had not yet met for his sake, the icy intent around Sun Tianci loosened a little.</p><p></p><p>Slowly looking over the text of "Prospering of the Orthodox Dharma" one by one, he seemed to have some realization and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the seemingly innate sorrow that Sun Tianci felt was also slowly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"What a great 'Prospering of the Orthodox Dharma'!"</p><p></p><p>"Lu'er really has a way!"</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the other party was currently in a state of gaining insight, Sun Luyuan did not dare to disturb him. He just gently placed the spiritual liquid aside and quietly retreated.</p><p></p><p>After sealing the room with a restriction to prevent outsiders from disturbing, he felt a little more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that Tianci has such a temperament. Staying at home and disappearing from the public eye, people will forget about his existence in a few years."</p><p></p><p>"In this period of great change, our Sun family should still take lying low and preserving our strength as the main goal."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Sun Luyuan couldn't help but recall the task the Holy Dynasty had assigned to him this time.</p><p></p><p>Since joining the Holy Dynasty, he could be said to have lived very leisurely. The Holy Dynasty had never issued any mandatory tasks.</p><p></p><p>The previous plan to abduct Fairy Kong You to the Holy Dynasty to be a Dao companion for the Sage Emperor's disciples was interrupted due to Xu Yuanxian's sudden commission, and now he could no longer contact the other party and could only put it aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>This made Sun Luyuan, who had always wanted to establish merit and increase his own capital, a little depressed.</p><p></p><p>This time, he finally waited for a task from the Holy Dynasty, but it was really a bit troublesome and he couldn't find an opportunity to start.</p><p></p><p>"Youyu..."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it just a place to imprison felons? What does the Holy Dynasty want to do by getting involved?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan muttered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't difficult to enter Youyu.</p><p></p><p>But to infiltrate Youyu and be able to maintain contact with the outside world at all times, that was truly a bit challenging.</p><p></p><p>"Youyu is an independent system within the Immortal Alliance, alternately under the jurisdiction of the Dharma Transmitters. To intervene..."</p><p></p><p>Although the task assigned by the Holy Dynasty this time did not mention the consequences of failing to complete it, Sun Luyuan knew that this was definitely a test from the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>In Sun Luyuan's mind, faces appeared one by one as he began to consider the list of people who could help him in this matter.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, there was still no result.</p><p></p><p>He habitually came to the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>His younger brother Sun Luyao, who was also the Boundless Mirror Spirit, asked about the reason after seeing his expression.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I found some information that might be useful."</p><p></p><p>"It might work."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go try."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave in a hurry, he suddenly heard Sun Luyao ask, "By the way, brother, you promised to take me out for some fresh air. When can we set off?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's footsteps paused, and he responded somewhat evasively, "Wait a bit longer. The Sun family is still being watched by those people. If I take you out now, I'm afraid something similar to being surrounded and attacked by the Chen family of the Medicine Hall when searching for fragments last time will happen again."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for things to blow over."</p><p></p><p>With that said, without waiting for Sun Luyao to speak, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand, brother..."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he heard his younger brother say that.</p><p></p><p>But the tone seemed a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Luyuan didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>The information Sun Luyao had glimpsed from the Heavenly Profound Mirror showed that a felonious criminal of the Immortal Alliance was about to be thrown into Youyu.</p><p></p><p>However, this person had a special identity, being a direct disciple of the Dharma Transmitter [Sun].</p><p></p><p>With such a background, he shouldn't have been thrown into a place like Youyu.</p><p></p><p>But the crime he had openly committed this time was really a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knew, the Immortal Alliance was organizing the second Traversing the World Rainbow Light to fly into the depths of the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>And the Empty Bright Flowing Crystal was the key material needed to achieve this goal.</p><p></p><p>After the previous explicit push and implicit compromise, agreeing to equally distribute the slots for participating in this Rainbow Light to the Immortal Alliance's accordance with the Dao regardless of background, the Immortal Alliance also took this opportunity to reaffirm the scarcity of the Empty Bright Flowing Crystal with righteousness.</p><p></p><p>They began to use means including but not limited to entrapment to recover the flowing crystals privately stored by various major families.</p><p></p><p>And that direct disciple of Dharma Transmitter Sun named Sun Wanyun was caught red-handed for privately purchasing a large amount of Empty Bright Flowing Crystals.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in charge of this arrest operation naturally knew Sun Wanyun's identity. But under the eyes of the public, they had to put on a show. So they had no choice but to arrest him.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought they would quietly release him afterwards, but someone unknown pushed things along behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day, the news of Sun Wanyun being arrested by the Myriad Immortal Alliance with an iron face and no favoritism had already quietly spread.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter Sun upheld the laws and regulations of the Immortal Alliance for the masses, with the principle of putting righteousness above family ties.</p><p></p><p>With things having developed to this point, the Immortal Alliance couldn't go back on its word. Moreover, the Flowing Crystal of Emptiness and Clarity was indeed too important. Therefore, Sun Wanyun was imprisoned according to the law.</p><p></p><p>"This person should be a suitable breakthrough point."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we visit him under the pretext of seeing him, we can give him the item bestowed by the Holy Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan thought this way as he arrived at the temporary detention place for Sun Wanyun at the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>With one glance, he was instantly a bit dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>It turned out there were quite a few "smart people" who knew to send charcoal in snowy weather.</p><p></p><p>The entrance was crowded with cultivators who came to visit, making it very lively. It didn't look at all like the treatment of an Immortal Alliance felony prisoner who was about to be thrown into the abyss prison. This scene was truly a bit ironic.</p><p></p><p>Although they shared the surname Sun, Sun Luyuan had no blood relation with Dharma Transmitter Sun or this Sun Wanyun. They merely had a few encounters.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan, the head of the Sun family who was extremely illustrious in the eyes of outsiders with their Five Harmonious Dao, could only line up honestly in front of the door.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the underground secret room of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense was mercilessly mocking Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>"I told you long ago, your brother wouldn't possibly let you out. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Previously taking you out was because you would go crazy from time to time, constantly facing the risk of the mirror going out of control upon your death."</p><p></p><p>"Now with this old man's help and conditioning, the source of the Boundless Mirror's unrest, that Grinding Wind Disaster, is slowly being dispelled, and you are becoming more and more stable."</p><p></p><p>"You little brat are now a divine tool, and also relate to the hope of the Sun family's rise. How could your brother easily let you out? If something unexpected happens and you get captured, what then?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's sarcasm, Sun Luyao remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Only the image in the mirror distorted from time to time, showing his inner discontent.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, he very wisely opened his mouth to seek help from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao knew that the mysterious existence before him definitely wouldn't say so much just to mock him a few times.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe. You little brat have become smarter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cackled.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he transformed into a pair of large hands, grabbing towards Sun Luyao's head.</p><p></p><p>The dark giant hands enveloped, and the Boundless Mirror shook violently inside.</p><p></p><p>A phantom was grabbed by Li Fan from inside Sun Luyao's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved lightly, and this phantom floated out of the Boundless Mirror, starting to fuse with a pile of materials that appeared out of thin air in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Before long, another "Boundless Mirror" that looked exactly the same appeared in front of Sun Luyao.</p><p></p><p>As the spirit of the Boundless Mirror, Sun Luyao was naturally extremely familiar with this divine tool.</p><p></p><p>But even he couldn't distinguish the difference between the object in front of him and the divine tool he was attached to!</p><p></p><p>With doubt and surprise in his heart, Sun Luyao flew into this counterfeit item, but after discovering it was only an empty shell inside, he returned excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior's methods are truly unfathomable! To be able to even replicate a divine tool, and so realistically!" Sun Luyao flattered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's just an empty facade."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said very coldly: "You split out another divine sense and hide it in this mirror. With this old man's craftsmanship as the foundation, plus your enhancement, it will definitely be enough to fool your brother."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that regaining freedom was within reach, Sun Luyao didn't hesitate at all, enduring the pain of his soul being split and dividing out a divine sense.</p><p></p><p>When Sun Luyao's divine sense entered the counterfeit Boundless Mirror, this forged divine tool became flawless.</p><p></p><p>Because in a sense, it could already be considered a clone of the real Boundless Mirror. Although it was just an empty shell, as long as the Boundless Mirror existed, it could synchronize the information probed by the original at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, so can we sneak out now?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the counterfeit Boundless Mirror that took its place, floating quietly in the air, Sun Luyao asked a bit impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Fool! What do you mean sneak out?"</p><p></p><p>"This is called the sea is vast for fish to leap, the sky is high for birds to fly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense cackled with laughter, wrapping the Boundless Mirror and transforming into a black line, ignoring the layers of restrictive formations and protections personally set up by Sun Luyuan, instantly leaving the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blue sky overhead again, Sun Luyao was invigorated.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, where are we going?"</p><p></p><p>"As mentioned before, to search for the lost divine tools of the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had no physical body, Sun Luyao still took a deep breath of free air, then cautiously asked Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Divine tools... no hurry." But Li Fan only said this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party not answering, Sun Luyao didn't dare to ask further.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, sensing the surging energy fluctuations ahead, Sun Luyao suddenly perked up.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>In the endless ocean, the turbulent currents converged towards a central point.</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds howled and crackled.</p><p></p><p>The violent storms even tore open space, startling bursts of lightning.</p><p></p><p>Beside the huge whirlpool that seemed to gather all the water in the world, there was an extremely eye-catching island chain that resembled a long flood dragon.</p><p></p><p>This very distinctive scene instantly let Sun Luyao know where he was at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Rift Boundary Great Whirlpool!"</p><p></p><p>He blurted out.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already learned about this natural wonder from the countless information glimpsed through the Tianxuan Mirror before.</p><p></p><p>But personally being here was truly vastly different from that.</p><p></p><p>"Such turbulent and surging water currents, such crazy and violent gales..."</p><p></p><p>"How can mere information and images represent even a fraction of it?"</p><p></p><p>Since his youth, he had been trapped in a small, sunless mirror, unable to see the magnificent sights of the world.</p><p></p><p>The grand scene of heaven and earth before him made Sun Luyao's heart stir, as if he had become that passionate youth from back then again.</p><p></p><p>"Making a big fuss over nothing, you really have no experience."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tsk-tsk strange voice pulled Sun Luyao out from his continuous exclamations.</p><p></p><p>"If you're done marveling, let's get to business."</p><p></p><p>Lightly pointing at the Boundless Mirror, Sun Luyao's phantom was instantly sucked into it.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the mirror surface uncontrollably released a beam of faint light.</p><p></p><p>It was aimed at the Rift Boundary Great Whirlpool not far away.</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Mirror's body lightly vibrated, countless images flashing inside it like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just squinted his eyes, quietly waiting for the changes within.</p><p></p><p>"Boundless, Primordial Observation."</p><p></p><p>"With this great formation as the core, the Boundless Mirror should be able to decipher all the secrets in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's already damaged now, using it to peek into the secrets of this [Rift Boundary] shouldn't be difficult."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the might of the Rift Boundary back then was truly too immense. Even after so long, the wounds left on the Xuanhuang Realm still haven't healed."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered, the Boundless Mirror seemed to have already reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>Cracks actually began to appear on the mirror surface.</p>

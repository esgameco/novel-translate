            <p>Chapter 1036: The Spirit of Mountains and Rivers Enters the Spiritual Wood</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed behind Gongsun Qixuan for a while, spying on him, but ultimately did not alert the other party and quietly slipped away. </p><p></p><p>As he passed by the Myriad Immortals Island, Li Fan glanced down at the deep and secluded area below.</p><p></p><p>The Jinzhan of Heaven and Earth's Soul, which he had previously ordered away with a fake heavenly decree, had somehow reappeared at some unknown time, suppressing the entrance to the underworld tunnel.</p><p></p><p>All the strangeness, big and small, had been dealt with and resolved, and the source had also been sealed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Congyun Sea had returned to its previous days of peace and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>But from the perspective of heaven and earth, Li Fan could see the consequences brought about by the outbreak of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan of Heaven and Earth's Soul, which had accepted the order to burn the sea, had evidently become even more powerful than before.</p><p></p><p>The scorching heat that came from it even made Li Fan secretly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>A sudden realization arose in Li Fan's heart: "Severe illnesses require strong medicine. It seems that the Dao of Heaven in the Xuanhuang Realm has gotten serious this time. Perhaps in not too long, the Congyun Sea will completely disappear."</p><p></p><p>It was as if the scene of the sea water being evaporated and the exposed seabed continuously appearing in a hellish landscape flashed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and did not linger any longer in the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The divine ability to deceive the Dao of Heaven has been tested. When the time is ripe, I can instantly extract a large amount of the changes that will be born from heaven and earth and transform them into my own nourishment."</p><p></p><p>"What I want to do next is to promote the struggle between these two great gods."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but glance at the invisible location of the Immortal Ruins in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Using the mortal to calculate the immortal was naturally an extremely dangerous matter.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention immortals, even Li Fan would have a vague premonition about the enemy's secret schemes.</p><p></p><p>"All the arrangements need to erupt at the same time. After the two immortals cast their gaze, the first thing they see should be each other."</p><p></p><p>"They should then ignore me. Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment: "They might allocate a bit of power to casually crush me, this insect, just in case."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>No matter how he thought about it, he couldn't exclude this kind of speculation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart couldn't help but feel a few more points of heaviness.</p><p></p><p>After all, true immortals were existences that could destroy the Xuanhuang Realm with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, it was still too difficult to resist the might of a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to accumulate more."</p><p></p><p>"Being involved in this world is truly a helpless move."</p><p></p><p>"To survive the residual might of a true immortal, perhaps the only way is to borrow force to strike force."</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, Li Fan had unknowingly returned to the Spiritual Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Sweeping with his divine sense, he instantly knew that Shang Tianci and Yan Fangzhou had finally brought the companions of Shanhe Xuan to visit after arduous persuasion.</p><p></p><p>These people were basically all under the age of fifty. But their cultivation levels were at least at the Nascent Soul stage, truly worthy of being called the proud children of heaven.</p><p></p><p>They basically came from prestigious and wealthy families, with extraordinary vision.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the scenery inside the Spiritual Wood Realm, although curiosity flashed in their eyes, there wasn't much shock.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shang, Brother Yan. This is the unparalleled scenery of myriad realms that you spoke of? Hehe, isn't that a bit of an exaggeration?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, although my family's grotto-heaven can't compare to the grandeur here, in terms of scenic beauty alone, it definitely won't lose to this place."</p><p></p><p>A total of thirteen young cultivators spoke out one after another in jest.</p><p></p><p>With smiles on their faces, it was just normal discussion, without any intention of ridicule.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was about to explain, but suddenly heard Li Fan's voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Bring them to the true immortal statues</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before them." </p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci's expression changed slightly, and the words that were about to come out of his mouth changed immediately: "Hehe, actually there is another sight in the Lingmu Realm that you all have not seen yet. If the wonders of the Lingmu Realm were a stone, this realm alone would occupy nine dou (a large portion)."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone's interest was immediately piqued. </p><p></p><p>"Brother Shang, don't hide it anymore, hurry up and take us there!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes! Since we're here, how can we miss it?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone clamored, and Shang Tianci revealed a slight smile: "Alright, everyone just follow me."</p><p></p><p>Before long, the group arrived at the circular grand hall at the entrance of the Lingmu Realm. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Shang Tianci stop here, everyone looked at him suspiciously: "Brother Shang, what are you up to? What's so great about this broken circular hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, isn't this the first building we saw when we came here before?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that inside... there's another world?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone discussed and speculated.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci then cupped his hands: "Everyone will know once they enter and take a look."</p><p></p><p>With that said, he took the lead and strode into the circular hall.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other, but with great artistic courage, they followed him in without much hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The bright sunlight instantly disappeared after entering the grand hall. </p><p></p><p>But in the darkness, a stone statue was so clear.</p><p></p><p>As if possessing some kind of magic power, it firmly attracted their gazes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>The group of twelve slowly walked out of the circular hall.</p><p></p><p>They seemed no different from before entering, but they were now devout believers of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the backs of these young people and slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Although their talent isn't much different from those who left the realm, fortunately their strength has taken shape and I don't need to put in effort to cultivate them anymore."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arranged for them the first and only task of joining the sect.</p><p></p><p>To extrapolate the method of [Primordial Golden Core] after his foundation establishment. </p><p></p><p>As a possibility to completely break free from the Chuanfa Tianzun's cultivation system, Li Fan did not forget about it.</p><p></p><p>Even though there would only be very small gains in each lifetime, accumulating bit by bit, one day he would ultimately find a way to solve it.</p><p></p><p>"Or, if I can see the Xuantian King in this lifetime, it might greatly advance the extrapolation progress."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Peacefully, another month passed.</p><p></p><p>The fluctuations transmitted from the Terminal Detachment Disc made Li Fan's eyes sharpen: "Finally there are results?"</p><p></p><p>It was the breakthrough in extrapolating Chuanfa Tianzun's restrictions.</p><p></p><p>The time it took far exceeded Li Fan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, sensing the solutions constantly emitted by the Detachment Disc.</p><p></p><p>In summary, Chuanfa Tianzun's restrictions on the Tianxuan Mirror were "entangled roots, deep in the bones and marrow. Rooted in the Xuanhuang heaven and earth, fused as one."</p><p></p><p>So the solution given by the Detachment Disc was to scrape the flesh from the bones and drain the blood from the tendons.</p><p></p><p>Although it sounded a bit scary, in fact it was to follow the veins left by the Tianxuan Mirror in heaven and earth, tracing them all the way to remove all the restrictions one by one.</p><p></p><p>It was not using ingenuity, but brutally and directly breaking the restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed that in the extrapolation of the Terminal Detachment Disc, to break Chuanfa Tianzun's restrictions, this was the only method.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why even with the current ability of the Detachment Disc, it took such a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid when Chuanfa laid down these restrictions back then, he never thought someone would use this method to break them."</p><p></p><p>"Because those capable of doing it would likely possess near-immortal power. They could directly destroy the restrictions rather than using this simplest and most direct method."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 627</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The representative from the Five Elderly Alliance was not someone easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>It was not the young man in a blue shirt that had been seen before, but a middle-aged cultivator with a stern face and endless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless silver lights kept falling around him, but they were all resolved easily by a gray-white breath.</p><p></p><p>"Ice!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice came from the thin cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Before the words had even finished, Li Fan saw the space around the thin cultivator as if it was frozen.</p><p></p><p>An endless chill, originating from the cultivator, continuously spread outward.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like even time could be frozen, as when a silver light came to the left and right sides of the thin cultivator, it solidified in the air.</p><p></p><p>Then, as the ice sealed more area, more and more silver lights were trapped.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally saw clearly that the silver snakes dancing in the sky were actually different weapons.</p><p></p><p>Swords, spears, axes, halberds, hooks, and tridents!</p><p></p><p>Seeing his moves being countered, there was not much anger on "Wu's" face.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he laughed, clapped his hands happily, then gently pointed towards the direction of the thin cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he withdrew the smile and looked grim.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed like an invisible electric light kept penetrating the ice-sealed area, spreading cracks towards the thin cultivator. </p><p></p><p>When it was about to hit his body, the gray-white breath turned around and blocked the invisible electric light.</p><p></p><p>In the gray, black suddenly emerged, then slowly disappeared, turning back into a pale gray light.</p><p></p><p>"Wu" pointed repeatedly, and each killing move followed.</p><p></p><p>But the thin cultivator remained unchanged, muttering, "Wind!"</p><p></p><p>Like a sudden disturbance on a calm sea, Li Fan saw that the invisible electric lights that had already penetrated the ice-sealed area were blown back by a strong wind, attacking "Wu" instead.</p><p></p><p>"Wu" raised his eyebrows, summoning silver lights to shield himself.</p><p></p><p>Crackling sounds echoed continuously around "Wu" in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this is the way..." Even though the scene was somewhat hazy, Li Fan could sense the excitement in the battle between the two.</p><p></p><p>Not wanting to miss any details, he concentrated, carefully observing, recording every trace of breath fluctuations in the battle.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Immortal Hongxi was doing the same. However, her gaze occasionally fell on Li Fan, showing a contemplative expression.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan immersed himself in the scene of the battle between the true geniuses in the Xuanhuang realm, unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the topic of the "friendly exchange meeting" gradually died down.</p><p></p><p>Life returned to normal, and more and more cultivators chose to strengthen their comprehension in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>At this time, "Zhou Qing'ang," who dealt with all the political affairs of the Cloud Sea, received an interesting report.</p><p></p><p>From the town guardian of Liuli Island, Zhao Changli.</p><p></p><p>This person was the successor to He Zhenhao, whom Li Fan met briefly when explaining the fundraising plan to the cultivators in the Cloud Sea. </p><p></p><p>He was meticulous and detail-oriented in his work. However, his cultivation talent was not exceptional, and being of mortal origin, his resources were limited. Thus, he could only reach a basic level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"In recent times, the production of Liuli Dan, a specialty product of Liuli Island, has greatly decreased. After careful investigation, it was found that the Liuli fish near the island have almost disappeared, and their whereabouts are unknown."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, after communicating with the guardians of other islands, it was found that this is not exclusive to Liuli Island."</p><p></p><p>"In the Cloud Sea, there may be some changes happening. However, due to the limited strength of this individual, he cannot fully comprehend the situation. Worried, he reported this and hopes for attention from the higher authorities."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at this somewhat familiar report in front of him and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This person is good, a talent. Although his cultivation talent is not outstanding, being able to notice the impending catastrophe in the Cloud Sea and report it is already rare in this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subtly glanced at the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally coming..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Li Fan opened the long-lost "Sitting and Discussing the Dao" section in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Using the Cloud Sea Sword and Overturning Palm as templates, he virtually created a character.</p>

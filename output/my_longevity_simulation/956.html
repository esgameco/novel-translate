        <h1>Chapter 956</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Facing Hanhai's tearful questioning, that "Heavenly Supreme" finally turned his "gaze" over. </p><p></p><p>His eyes remained closed, and his voice was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Intermittent and fluctuating in volume.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>"...You guess?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he forcefully clenched his left hand.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Water Heavenly Palace, which had already fallen into complete silence with no other survivors besides Hanhai and Taiyi, suddenly resounded with the painful wails of the disciples in their final moments before death.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai, who was nailed in mid-air and unable to move, even saw transparent figures rising from the disciples' corpses.</p><p></p><p>As if still lingering in the instant before death, their faces were filled with terror and despair.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhhhhh..."</p><p></p><p>What this "Heavenly Supreme" did was not simply "killing"!</p><p></p><p>But to make the disciples of Cloud Water Heavenly Palace live eternally in the painful torment of that instant before death!</p><p></p><p>What kind of hatred would drive someone to commit such a vicious act?</p><p></p><p>His heart filled with extreme grief and indignation, Hanhai erupted with all his strength, trying to break free from the control.</p><p></p><p>But he was completely unable to shake the black rays piercing his body. Instead, the recoil caused him to bleed from all seven orifices, leaving him in utter misery!</p><p></p><p>Hanhai could only watch helplessly as this person transformed the already deceased disciples into pitiful existences, neither truly alive nor dead!</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Supreme, master of the way of killing."</p><p></p><p>"Such methods are definitely beyond her capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"No, no..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai muttered in a daze, his eyes losing focus.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, as if realizing something, Hanhai's body trembled slightly: "Heavenly Physician? You are the Heavenly Physician!?"</p><p></p><p>As Hanhai shouted this out, the figure tormenting the disciples of Cloud Water Heavenly Palace also paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then a sinister smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Physician..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, that's right. I am the Heavenly Physician!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, the world in Hanhai's eyes was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The perpetrator who originally had the appearance of the "Heavenly Supreme" instantly transformed into the Heavenly Physician!</p><p></p><p>Eyes full of compassion, a sanctimonious appearance. Yet committing such horrifying acts!</p><p></p><p>And the black sword lights trapping Hanhai turned into black needles!</p><p></p><p>"So it is like this!"</p><p></p><p>Hanhai, thinking he had seen through the truth, let out an earth-shattering roar of fury.</p><p></p><p>"Why! Why!"</p><p></p><p>He kept questioning.</p><p></p><p>But the Heavenly Physician paid no heed, his expression remaining unchanged from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Only his turbid eyes held a hint of appreciation as he gazed at the "resurrected" disciples of Cloud Water Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>As if admiring his own masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>The reborn disciples were at first completely disoriented, looking at their somewhat transparent bodies, then glancing around.</p><p></p><p>But gradually, they also slowly realized what had happened to them.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai's roar made it even clearer to them who was the culprit behind all this.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Physician!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Physician!"</p><p></p><p>Resentful shouts rang out one after another, reverberating throughout Cloud Water Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>It sent chills down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>Yet that Heavenly Physician, as if listening to some exquisite musical piece, actually revealed an enraptured expression.</p><p></p><p>This made it even harder for the people of Cloud Water Heavenly Palace to control their emotions, wishing they could devour the Heavenly Physician's flesh.</p><p></p><p>But they were still under the Heavenly Physician's control</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Amidst it all, they could only let out helpless roars.</p><p></p><p>Unable to make any moves of resistance.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the Heavenly Doctor seemed to have heard enough and his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>With his cold snort, endless darkness engulfed the people of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>When light appeared again, it returned to not long ago, when Hanhai and Taiyi were conversing in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this nightmarish memory is the source tormenting Hanhai."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>But what Li Fan didn't expect was that he couldn't find a way out!</p><p></p><p>The scenes here, in the endless repetitive cycles, had already become extremely close to real space-time.</p><p></p><p>If one could still wake up from illusions and memories,</p><p></p><p>Then how could one return to reality from reality?</p><p></p><p>The connection with the outside world had been severed. Li Fan tried many methods to leave but they all ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was not flustered.</p><p></p><p>After all, what came here was just a wisp of his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>For his true self, the injury from losing this wisp of divine sense could be healed in less than a breath's time.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, since escape was hopeless and it wouldn't harm his true self,</p><p></p><p>This wisp of Li Fan's divine sense could directly self-destruct to end things.</p><p></p><p>But driven by the instinct to survive, this wisp of divine sense split from Li Fan still wanted to try again.</p><p></p><p>To see if a way to break the situation could be found.</p><p></p><p>"Even I, an outsider, cannot escape from this eternal nightmare. Let alone the owner here, Hanhai."</p><p></p><p>"But the reasons leading to the current situation are worth pondering. Is it because the stimulation Hanhai himself received was too great and he can't free himself? Or is it..."</p><p></p><p>Though surprised, Li Fan remained calm and continued experiencing the nightmare from Hanhai's perspective.</p><p></p><p>After going through the hellish scenes again, at the moment of the Heavenly Doctor's cold snort and the incoming darkness,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concentrated and gazed into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The darkness only lasted for a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it seemed to be pure darkness caused by a lack of memory.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan keenly sensed that the time the darkness shrouded was divided into two different parts.</p><p></p><p>The first part was Hanhai's perception of the outside world being forcibly obscured by someone.</p><p></p><p>Only then followed the interlude of the nightmare cycle.</p><p></p><p>However, both manifested as dead silence and pitch-black, so Hanhai in his crazed state could not distinguish between the two.</p><p></p><p>Only an outsider like Li Fan could vaguely detect the subtle difference between them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if Li Fan wasn't so accustomed to the world's tragedies, his heart like rock, and wasn't shaken much by the miserable events that occurred in Yunshui Heavenly Palace, still able to maintain absolute calmness,</p><p></p><p>He would also find it very difficult to notice the stark difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>With this entry point, Li Fan's wisp of divine sense continuously waited in the nightmare cycles after that.</p><p></p><p>Trying to pierce through the darkness and witness what happened in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that 【Heavenly Doctor】 didn't stop because he got tired of listening. That sudden subtle change in his expression..."</p><p></p><p>"Someone came."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realized.</p><p></p><p>After patiently going through hundreds more cycles, bit by bit from the subtle light and shadows captured each time,</p><p></p><p>Like piecing together a puzzle, Li Fan finally pieced together what happened in that instant obscured by the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the "Heavenly Doctor" suppressed all the people of Yunshui Heavenly Palace, a figure swiftly flew over from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>The "Heavenly Doctor" revealed a mocking expression, his form blurred, and he disappeared from sight.</p>

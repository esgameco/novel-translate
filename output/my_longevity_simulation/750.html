        <h1>Chapter 750</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The rulers of imperial dynasties throughout history, from the moment they were born, had to undergo learning within. Only after mastering the countless knowledge preserved inside could they officially inherit the throne."</p><p></p><p>"And the imperial treasury can only be entered by those with the imperial bloodline," Little Qing explained. </p><p></p><p>"But I still can't enter it now, right?" Xu Bai shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Use your heart to perceive it, and this invisible barrier will not exist," the princess said softly at that moment. </p><p></p><p>After speaking, she demonstrated herself. Taking a step forward, she passed through the barrier and entered the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Bai closed his eyes.</p><p>Sure enough, a strange feeling welled up in his heart.</p><p>In the boundless darkness, it seemed like there were sounds of a heartbeat.</p><p>Coming from all directions.</p><p>Associating it with what he had seen before, the entire imperial palace seemed to be transformed from the body of some huge strange beast.</p><p>Xu Bai suddenly realized.</p><p>The imperial treasury might be the heart of this strange beast.</p><p>The various strange beasts of the empire were all cultivated from Xu Ke's secret methods.</p><p>Carrying Xu Ke's bloodline, this place naturally could not stop him either.</p><p>With understanding coming to his heart, Xu Bai stepped forward. As if passing through some transparent membrane, in the next moment, he arrived inside the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>Without looking at the various objects placed here, he looked towards the princess and Little Qing: "Indeed, I've entered. But this doesn't prove anything."</p><p></p><p>"Only those with the imperial bloodline can enter..."</p><p>"This kind of rhetoric." Xu Bai shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The princess smiled: "You don't need to be so suspicious. Take a walk around this treasury, and you'll understand yourself."</p><p></p><p>"There are so many imperial treasures here, aren't you afraid I'll secretly take a few away?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p></p><p>"If you want, you can take everything here. But in fact, what's truly precious here are the memories of the emperors of imperial dynasties," Little Qing said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The princess then gestured for Xu Bai to go ahead.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai snorted coldly, then flew over to a strange beast that was a two-winged tortoise.</p><p></p><p>"The Silent Flying Tortoise: Can live up to three hundred years. Its meat can treat hyperactivity disorder, mania, and other illnesses. But be careful, the tortoise's blood is harmful and consuming it will shorten one's lifespan."</p><p></p><p>A voice, accompanied by a picture, suddenly appeared in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p>The person in the picture looked very similar to Xu Ke.</p><p>He was sitting in front of an experiment table, dissecting a silent flying tortoise while constantly taking notes.</p><p>At the same time, all kinds of information about the silent flying tortoise flooded into Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>Before Xu Bai could digest it, shortly after, a new picture appeared.</p><p>This time, the one recording the data was a woman, whose appearance was also a bit similar to Xu Ke's.</p><p>...</p><p>The pictures kept flashing and changing.</p><p>The main characters switched more than ten times, and the research on the silent flying tortoise kept progressing.</p><p>In the end, techniques appeared that could mass produce silent flying tortoises in large quantities, allowing them to complete an entire life cycle in just three years, greatly reducing the cultivation time.</p><p></p><p>The images disappeared, and Xu Bai savored the countless new information in his mind, looking towards the princess.</p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>"The first ruler of the empire was cultivated from a holy embryo by the Holy Emperor Xu Ke using his holy blood."</p><p>"And the second emperor was the same."</p><p>"Passed down from generation to generation."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Fundamentally speaking, the imperial royal families throughout the dynasties and the Holy Emperor Xu Ke are actually the same person," the Imperial Princess replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, who already knew this fact, still pretended to be greatly shocked: "What kind of sorcery is this?"</p><p></p><p>"How can you label it as righteous or evil?" the Imperial Princess shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Although we share the same bloodline, we each have our own consciousness. You can also treat us as different individuals."</p><p></p><p>"However, due to the connection of the 'Holy Blood Incarnation Technique', we can achieve synchronous resonance of thoughts."</p><p></p><p>"What you just experienced was the research results of the Silent Tortoise, accumulated by the successive emperors."</p><p></p><p>"Before their deaths, every ruler of the Empire not only had to undergo the 'Holy Blood Incarnation', but also had to leave their own thoughts in the Imperial Treasury."</p><p></p><p>"The new successor will then inherit the vast majority of wisdom and experience from the previous emperors."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the ruler of the Empire will become increasingly powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Only in this way can a sustainable empire be established," the Imperial Princess said calmly, with a hint of heroic spirit in her tone.</p><p></p><p>"A sustainable empire..." Xu Bai snorted, not giving the other party any face. "Not to mention the Immortal Celestial Venerable, even Dao Cultivators like us may not be able to resist you."</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess paused, her face flushing red.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then swept his gaze across the Imperial Treasury and asked, "Although there are many strange and exotic materials here, there are only a few truly valuable ones."</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a hurry to report back. Tell me, what are the most powerful technologies of the Empire?"</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess looked at the unseen barrier outside, and only after a slight nod from Xiaoquing did she ponder and say, "Our understanding of 'valuable' may not be the same."</p><p></p><p>"From the strategic goals of the Empire, the highest technologies are, first, the methods of cultivating and manipulating the Rift Whales."</p><p></p><p>"The second is the positioning of the void coordinates."</p><p></p><p>"With these two technologies, the Empire can continuously open up void channels and move as far away from the Xuanhuang Realm as possible," the Imperial Princess said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai sneered, "I've also heard this ridiculous plan from my sacrificed colleagues."</p><p></p><p>"The idea is not bad, but..."</p><p></p><p>"If it were really that easy to leave the Xuanhuang Realm, wouldn't someone have done it long ago, thousands of years ago? Why would it be your turn now?"</p><p></p><p>"Those Cultivators who had already retreated to small worlds when the great calamity descended, why are they still yearning to return to the Xuanhuang Realm, instead of escaping from the small worlds?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that they don't want to, but that they can't do it."</p><p></p><p>"I advise you to abandon this unrealistic fantasy and join our Multirealm Alliance instead..."</p><p></p><p>In the face of Xu Bai's mockery, the Imperial Princess showed no change in her expression.</p><p></p><p>Instead, she was exceptionally resolute and interrupted Xu Bai's words: "What if our goal from the beginning was not to escape the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>This time, Xu Bai was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Not to escape the Xuanhuang Realm? Then what is the purpose of all your efforts?"</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess smiled slightly: "It's to buy time."</p><p></p><p>"To move as far away from the Xuanhuang Realm as possible, reducing the probability of being affected when calamities occur in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"And to wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>"Sooner or later, there will be a savior-like figure who will rescue the Xuanhuang Realm from the calamity of destruction."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

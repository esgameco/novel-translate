        <h1>Chapter 666</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>In a daze, just as Fang Zaiji entered this small world, he saw dozens of green-winged flying snakes baring their fangs and coming at him to bite.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you beasts try to bully me!" Fang Zaiji's expression changed suddenly, and with a wave of his sleeve, the space in front of him trembled, and the ferocious beasts instantly turned into powder, leaving no trace of their corpses.</p><p></p><p>The entrance was at the bottom of a deep gorge. Amidst the swirling clouds and mist, one could vaguely sense the scattered spiritual energy. The commotion caused by Li Fan and the others entering attracted countless exotic beasts above.</p><p></p><p>Like waves in the tide, they continued to rush in fearlessly.</p><p></p><p>"I ask for your protection, sir." Despite the large number of exotic beasts, the strongest among them had only a foundational cultivation. In front of Fang Zaiji, who was in the realm of harmonizing the Dao, they posed no threat whatsoever. Li Fan smiled at Fang Zaiji and then took out a piece of the "Easy Star Stealing" parchment, covering it at the entrance of the passage.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan completed the transcription of the spatial node here and passed the Easy Star Stealing parchment to Liu San, who was preparing in the Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the construction of the spatial channel will take about thirty days. Will you return first, or..." Liu San's voice faintly came from the door.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, Mr. Fang and I will explore here first and then decide. With him around, Mr. Liu, you don't have to worry about my safety." Li Fan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's because you are with him that I can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say!" Fang Zaiji, who was cleaning up the exotic beasts, turned abruptly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to argue with Liu San, he found that the latter had already cut off the connection. Frustrated, Fang Zaiji had no choice but to vent his anger on these ignorant exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the exotic beasts that had been reproducing in the depths of the gorge for who knows how long were already dead or injured.</p><p></p><p>They flew out from the bottom of the gorge to the desolate plain. Li Fan took a deep breath and closed his eyes to feel the surroundings. The dark feathers inside his body emitted a dark glow, and in a moment, Li Fan sensed the ubiquitous floating celestial luck in this small world.</p><p></p><p>Like a whale sucking in water or a falling leaf returning to its roots, almost effortlessly, the floating celestial luck within a radius of several hundred miles rushed into Li Fan's body one after another.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it returned to the feathers of the dark bird within.</p><p></p><p>The more celestial luck he absorbed, the more Li Fan also felt something in his heart. With a gentle gesture forward, as his thoughts flickered, the earth cracked open with a loud noise.</p><p></p><p>Countless vegetation and exotic beasts were swallowed by the earth's rupture, and those lucky enough to survive let out fearful low growls, no longer caring about the stranger Li Fan who had rashly intruded, desperately trying to escape this place.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched the distant figures of the exotic beasts fleeing, and as his thoughts shifted, a sudden demonic wind stirred up between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Sand and stones flew, lifting the exotic beasts into the air. Then, he dropped them back to their original positions.</p><p></p><p>The exotic beasts, originally not very intelligent, were frightened by this turn of events, trembling and collapsing on the spot.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan retracted his supernatural powers.</p><p></p><p>"My fortune is my celestial luck, my destiny is my celestial destiny. Every word and action carries the power of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!" Li Fan admired in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zhai, was that your doing just now?" Fang Zaiji looked at Li Fan with some astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Even with his cultivation in harmonizing the Dao, it was difficult for him to easily split the earth and create a gale like that.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just smiled and did not answer.</p><p></p><p>In the following period of time, escorted by Fang Zaiji, Li Fan collected the floating celestial luck in this small world while advancing towards the deepest part of the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>From the faint guidance of the dark bird's feathers in his body, it seemed that Little Black's corpse should be there.</p><p></p><p>During this process, Li Fan discovered an interesting phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>The closer they got to Little Black's corpse, the fewer external physical characteristics related to humans were found in the exotic beasts appearing. Their strength also became more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"The species of exotic beasts in this small world belong to a branch of 'beast races' that are a fusion of humans and exotic beasts. However, after thousands of years and countless generations of reproduction, the bloodline of the exotic beasts has not been weakened but rather exhibits a phenomenon similar to atavism."</p><p></p><p>"Intriguing."</p><p></p><p>As Fang Zaiji cleared the way forward, Li Fan also noticed that some exotic beasts had already mastered various "spells" to utilize the floating celestial luck for battle.</p><p></p><p>This hindered Li Fan's absorption speed, but it was only a minor inconvenience. Regardless of the supernatural abilities these exotic beasts had, in the face of an absolute gap in strength, they were all useless and easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji pushed forward, with Li Fan following leisurely collecting the spoils.</p><p></p><p>"Please be more lenient, Mr. Zhai, and leave some alive. This place will serve as a ranch for our Medicine King Sect in the future, which is not bad." Li Fan held a blue crystal nucleus in his hand, carefully observing it and giving instructions.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your word is law." The long period of slaughter had made Fang Zaiji somewhat impatient. Now, with Li Fan's orders, he could openly slack off more, readily agreeing with all the instructions.</p><p></p><p>This blue crystal nucleus was found by Li Fan in the corpse of an exotic beast that had reached the foundational stage of the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same as the exotic beast crystal nuclei that Li Chenfeng had described to be the core used by the imperial cultivators for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan crushed the nucleus, and like boiling water, scorching energy gushed out. After inhaling it, Li Fan found that the scorching unknown energy part of it turned into spiritual energy, traveling through his meridians. The remaining part turned into scattered starlight, spreading throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>Strengthening the toughness of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, it's a good thing." Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Zaiji also detected Li Fan's actions, and casually slaughtered an exotic beast, extracting its nucleus to absorb.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, these demonic nuclei that we cultivators couldn't absorb in the past. I never thought that after thousands of years, such things can be used by us!" After a while, Fang Zaiji marveled.</p><p></p><p>"The world has changed over these thousands of years!" Li Fan laughed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is because of the fusion of bloodlines between demonic beasts and humans over thousands of years." Li Fan recalled those beast races that closely resembled humans, whispering to himself.</p><p></p><p>Continuing forward, in the distance on the vast land stood a black three-legged tower. At the top of the tower seemed to be a enormous black bird spreading its wings to stand alone.</p><p></p><p>"It really is." A gleam of light flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and the appearance of this black bird was exactly the same as what he had seen in the Immortal Meteor Realm - Little Black.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly realizing the unstoppable strength of Fang Zaiji, there were no more exotic beasts to stop them upon reaching this place.</p>

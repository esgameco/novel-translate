            <p>Han Wuyou touched his goatee and said with satisfaction, "My methods far exceed what the daoist friend imagines. How exactly I achieved this is not convenient to explain in detail. But you don't need to doubt its authenticity."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Baili Chen and Sikong Yi still looking skeptical, Han Wuyou sneered, "Alright, I know you won't easily believe."</p><p></p><p>With that, he threw a communication token over, saying, "This item is the communication token of Senior He Zhenghao. You can try it yourselves to see if I'm just talking big."</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi held the token with a serious expression and sensed it slightly.</p><p></p><p>As expected, it displayed He Zhenghao's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Trying to send a greeting message, unfortunately, Senior He Zhenghao seemed busy at the moment and only sent an automatic reply.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it indeed proved that the current Han Wuyou's words were not false.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou retrieved the communication token and continued to tantalize, "Changing the contribution level to 100,000, in your hands, you will only end up with empty hands. How much will be left after a year? Two years, three years?"</p><p></p><p>But when handed over to Master Li Fan by Senior He Zhenghao, it's a whole different story. You might not be aware, but the contributions invested with Master Li Fan yield at least a 5% return annually.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sikong Yi's breath paused. </p><p></p><p>Baili Chen couldn't help but exclaim, "A 50% return each year? How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>Calculating quickly in his mind, not doing anything for a year would still yield at least fifty thousand points.</p><p></p><p>If the returns were further invested with Master Li, in just six years, 100,000 contribution points would become a million contribution points...</p><p></p><p>A million contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this vast number, Sikong Yi felt a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>Once he thought that a hundred thousand contribution points were the ultimate goal of his life. Who would have thought that he might still have the chance to control a million assets?</p><p></p><p>Once desire sparks in the heart, it becomes hard to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Although reason told him that such an exponential profit curve was highly unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>But with Li Fan's widespread reputation in the cultivation world and his various deeds being true, it was a level Sikong Yi couldn't reach at the moment. Maybe there really were such unbelievable skills?</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi was stirred.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expression on Sikong Yi's face, Han Wuyou knew things had fallen into place.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Han, please come inside and explain in detail." Sikong Yi invited Han Wuyou into his own cave, questioning him about the investment details.</p><p></p><p>Listening to Han Wuyou's explanation, Sikong Yi was overwhelmed with excitement, regretting not having met Han Daoist earlier and missing out on many opportunities to make a fortune.</p><p></p><p>Although he also wanted to immediately hand over the hundred thousand contribution points to Master Li for investment, the actual situation was still up in the air.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Baili Chen sighed softly and said, "The ruins hidden in the clouds and water must be extremely dangerous after lying sealed for thousands of years. I don't have full confidence in successfully obtaining the Cloud and Water Map."</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, Baili Chen decided to confess frankly, "In this world, there might still be descendants of the Cloud and Water Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou's expression changed slightly upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>Baili Chen then explained the situation he had noticed during his cultivation of the "Ocean-Crossing Divine Sword."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Han Wuyou slowly spoke, "In my opinion, the other party might not necessarily be a descendant of the Cloud and Water Palace. It's very likely they accidentally obtained this technique from some ruins."</p><p></p><p>Baili Chen smiled bitterly, "Even if that's true, it's impossible to verify. I won't hide it from you, I dare not even go near that island."</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou paced back and forth, seemingly pondering something.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he spoke, "If you trust me, you can point out the location of that island. I will handle this for you! But, if successful, I'll take forty percent of the hundred thousand contribution points!"</p><p></p><p>Both Sikong Yi and Baili Chen raised their heads, staring firmly at Han Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Baili Chen spoke in a deep voice, "If you can truly deal with the cultivator practicing the Ocean-Crossing Divine Sword, then giving you forty percent is not a problem!"</p><p></p><p>With that agreement, Sikong Yi led Han Wuyou near to the Body Transformation Island.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, dangerous auras were hidden on the island. Observing from a distance, Han Wuyou furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>However, with a turn in his tone, Han Wuyou said, "No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>But hearing Han Wuyou's cold words, "The lives of cultivators in the world today are perhaps not as precious as imagined."</p><p></p><p>"Friends, please return to your abodes and await my good news!" Saying so, Han Wuyou nodded, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Watching his departing figure, Sikong Yi showed an inexplicable expression.</p><p></p><p>Instead of returning to his abode, Sikong Yi lurked near the island.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a cultivator flew out from the island.</p><p></p><p>After a brief confrontation between the two, a big battle erupted.</p><p></p><p>The imposing aura was astounding, leaving the secretly observing Sikong Yi shocked.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Han Wuyou had some tricks up his sleeve, judging by the momentum and spectacle, he was at least a Yuan Ying-stage cultivator! Sikong Yi's heart was immediately filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>After watching for a while, fearing being discovered or implicated innocently by the powerful practitioners, Sikong Yi discreetly left and returned to his cave.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Han Wuyou visited again.</p><p></p><p>"Baili friend, you can try to cultivate the 'Ocean-Crossing Divine Sword' again!" Han Wuyou said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I've spent a lot to seek senior's help. For the trip to the Cloud and Water Palace, don't disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Baili Chen, happy upon hearing this, immediately tried to cultivate it again.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation from the "Primordial True Scripture" was still preserved in his lower abdomen. After just a short while, he successfully recovered his previous state before the setback.</p><p></p><p>After a quick detection, the fellow cultivator who initially practiced the same technique was nowhere to be found!</p><p></p><p>"Han Daoist is indeed skilled!" Sikong Yi rejoiced, feeling slightly more trusting of Han Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou proudly stroked his beard, saying, "In today's cultivation world, relying solely on being fierce is useless. You need background and connections!"</p><p></p><p>Sikong Yi couldn't help but nod.</p><p></p><p>The three carefully discussed the details of their upcoming actions. With everything prepared, the day to open the Cloud and Water Palace was getting closer.</p><p></p><p>And thus, they set off together, heading towards the center of the Sea of Clouds.</p>

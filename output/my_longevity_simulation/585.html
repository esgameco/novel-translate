        <h1>Chapter 585</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"After all, peeking into the secrets of heaven and earth, there is no quick way to directly plunder ready-made golden elixirs."</p><p></p><p>"But if it can be considered a big business..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind: "What are they planning to do by purchasing a large number of cultivator corpses?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not intend to dig deep into the other party's motives.</p><p></p><p>However, their actions were so mysterious, and Zhang Debiao had not returned for a long time. It was feared that the situation was already dire.</p><p></p><p>Although it might be difficult to silently kill a cultivator in the Xuanhuang Realm due to the existence of omens of falling, making them vanish into thin air with no trace was quite doable.</p><p></p><p>For example, Zhou Qing'ao was a living example, he was still lying at the bottom of the Cloud Sea!</p><p></p><p>Just when Li Fan was hesitating whether to spend some contributions to continue investigating the news about Zhang Debiao through someone else...</p><p></p><p>A stranger cultivator came uninvited and took the initiative to come to him.</p><p></p><p>During his actions in Tianlingzhou these days, Li Fan used a new identity to avoid drawing attention, going by the pseudonym Yu Ji.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, Li Fan immediately knew the purpose of the other party approaching him must be related to the missing Zhang Debiao.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, I will meet him."</p><p></p><p>In the alternate courtyard of the Lun Dao Tower, Li Fan met the visitor.</p><p></p><p>He was a cultivator in a gray robe.</p><p></p><p>Short and frail, with deep wrinkles on his face, walking with a limp, he looked extremely weak, as if a gust of wind could blow him over.</p><p></p><p>As the other person approached, Li Fan even faintly smelled a scent of decay and foulness emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>"Jie jie jie..."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Yu, I heard you are looking for Zhang Debiao? Does he have something you need in his possession?"</p><p></p><p>The gray-robed cultivator cut to the chase, asking in a strange tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, assessing the other party.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party seemed to only have Golden Core cultivation, Li Fan could almost certainly tell that it was just a disguise, a camouflage.</p><p></p><p>The intermittent sense of danger in his mind reminded Li Fan that this gray-robed cultivator before him was not simple.</p><p></p><p>"What is your name, Daoist?" Li Fan didn't answer directly but instead arched his hand and inquired about the other party's name.</p><p></p><p>"Xiumu Daoist." The gray-robed cultivator was also very straightforward, with a concise reply.</p><p></p><p>After scanning his mind, Li Fan had not heard of this person before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, lowered his voice, and admitted, "Yes, I need some cultivator's golden elixirs."</p><p></p><p>"The more intact, the better. The higher the stage of the hidden laws within the Golden Core, the better."</p><p></p><p>"Price is not an issue." After saying that, Li Fan added.</p><p></p><p>A gleam flashed in Xiumu Daoist's eyes as he reached out and produced a green and red crisscrossed golden elixir from somewhere and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Yu, please have a look at the quality of this elixir."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved as he took the golden elixir and carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as though it had just been excavated from a cultivator's body, and he could still see faint bloodstains on it.</p><p></p><p>Upon perceiving it, he found that the elixir contained insights related to wood and fire laws.</p><p></p><p>Using the skill 'Identify,' he received a prompt that absorption was possible.</p><p></p><p>"What's the price?" Li Fan then asked.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty thousand contribution points." Xiumu said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps afraid that Li Fan would find it expensive, he continued, "I also have some single law Golden Cores over there, at a cheaper price of fifteen thousand contribution points. Of course, if you need a larger quantity, we can discuss the price further."</p><p></p><p>"Also, I only accept equivalent spirit stone transactions. I do not accept direct transfer of contribution points." While Li Fan was contemplating and not answering, Xiumu added.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's concern was not the price, but rather the suspicious appearance of Xiumu Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, selling cultivator's golden elixirs, which was a taboo, without any cover-up, was quite unorthodox.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as though they were trading not prohibited items but rather common goods.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Li Fan was currently using an identity of an unknown origin, a cultivator without any background.</p><p></p><p>He had no idea of Li Fan's background.</p><p></p><p>Yet Xiumu Daoist remained so brazen...</p><p></p><p>Was he not afraid that Li Fan came to investigate under the guise of fishing for law enforcement personnel related to the Wanxian Alliance?</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-eight thousand is also acceptable." Seeing Li Fan hesitating, Xiumu Daoist proactively offered a discount.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then pretended to hesitate and nodded, "Deal."</p><p></p><p>On the 'Identify' interface, the progress of the unlocking of the anchor increased by 5%.</p><p></p><p>"When calculated this way, I need two hundred intact Golden Cores. This was after considering that the one I just absorbed was a dual law Golden Core. If it were just ordinary single law Golden Cores, I would probably need a larger quantity."</p><p></p><p>"Conventional means are no longer feasible for collection."</p><p></p><p>"Unless I dare to brazenly defy the world, transform into a demon, and rampageously slaughter cultivators for their Golden Cores..."</p><p></p><p>This thought only flashed through his mind for a moment before Li Fan discarded it.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Xiumu." Li Fan cleared his throat and did not directly request another transaction but instead asked him about his doubts.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Xiumu Daoist didn't seem to mind: "Daoist, rest assured, we are not like that insignificant kid Zhang Debiao."</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Cores we provide have a safe and guaranteed source, absolutely no worries."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Immortal Alliance investigates, it won't be a problem. Please trust me!"</p><p></p><p>He assured emphatically, to the extent that Li Fan suspected he might directly disperse himself with his force.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, right?"</p><p></p><p>However, the answer he received was beyond Li Fan's expectations. He immediately showed an expression of disbelief: "This Golden Core obtained just now was clearly dug out from a cultivator recently..."</p><p></p><p>"Such inhumane behavior, not to mention our Wanxian Alliance, even the Five Elders' Council wouldn't turn a blind eye to it, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for my special reasons and urgent needs, I wouldn't have done this morally questionable thing!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke firmly.</p><p></p><p>Xiumu Daoist sneered but did not argue with Li Fan's gibberish.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he suddenly asked, "If these Golden Core cultivators were all willing?"</p><p></p><p>"Even willing..." Li Fan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>"Willing? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by Xiumu Daoist indeed shocked Li Fan. He put on a look of amazement, staring at the other party with widened eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Where there's demand, there will naturally be a market."</p><p></p><p>"It's not something new that since the reconstruction of order in the Xuanhuang Realm all these years, people like us have emerged. It's not surprising."</p><p></p><p>Xiumu Daoist shook his head, explaining to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Like Zhang Debiao, extracting Golden Cores from cultivator corpses is just too inefficient."</p>

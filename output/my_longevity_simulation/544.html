        <h1>Chapter 544</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan did not comment, but took out two small metal figurines from his storage ring that looked somewhat similar to him, and handed them to the two.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Split God Jade Token, containing a strand of my divine will, similar to half of a clone," he said lightly. "During my seclusion, all contact with the outside world will be cut off. If there is an urgent situation, you can contact me through this method."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan and He Zhenghao carefully put away the metal figurines, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the favor.</p><p></p><p>The Split God Jade Token was not unfamiliar to them. Typically, cultivators only give it to close and trusted juniors as a tool for personal guidance.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Master Li entrusted such an important thing to us shows his absolute trust in us!</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan and He Zhenghao were moved and expressed their thanks again.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave now," Li Fan nodded expressionlessly and then issued a dismissal order.</p><p></p><p>In the discussion hall of the Buzheng Hall, He Zhenghao was organizing the list of related cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time Li Fan suddenly announced the temporary suspension of the contribution plan, many cultivators who had hesitated and chosen to wait were now filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Fan's fundraising plan had been carried out for several phases. Each contribution was returned with interest as promised, sometimes even ahead of schedule. The feared scenario of Li Fan taking the money and running away never happened.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, those cultivators who had initially waited and observed gradually began to trust Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>They were eagerly looking forward to participating in the next round of fundraising.</p><p></p><p>Little did they know, Li Fan had changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like we underestimated Master Li. After all, he is Master Li," they sighed at the time.</p><p></p><p>Later, when they heard that Li Fan had been appointed as the acting island master of Wanxian Island, all their worries disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>They knew that He Zhenghao was in charge of Li Fan's fundraising plan.</p><p></p><p>So, these cultivators displayed their skills and approached He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>They also showed their appreciation and instructed He Zhenghao to consider them first when Li Fan's fundraising plan resumed.</p><p></p><p>Observers acted in a similar manner, especially those who had tasted success in the previous fundraising phases.</p><p></p><p>They had already greeted He Zhenghao early on.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I was worried I couldn't handle so many people. Now, with a contribution of one billion, everyone gets a share," He Zhenhao happily listed one name after another and started sending out messages.</p><p></p><p>"The matter you asked me to investigate earlier has some progress! I got some exact information..."</p><p></p><p>In contrast to He Zhenghao's excitement, Gao Yuan looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He kept tapping his fingers lightly on the table, squinted his eyes, seemingly contemplating something.</p><p></p><p>After a while, He Zhenghao, who had been busy, stretched and noticed Gao Yuan's unusual behavior.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask in surprise, "Brother Gao, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm thinking about the profound meaning behind the two tasks Master Li gave us this time," Gao Yuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Profound meaning? Wasn't it clear? Thisâ€¦" He Zhenghao first smiled, dismissing Gao Yuan's concerns.</p><p></p><p>But then, he was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>After scanning around, he leaned in and asked in a low voice, "Brother, do you have any insights?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan said in a serious tone, "Master Li always plans before acting, never doing anything meaningless."</p><p></p><p>"But this time, the two tasks he entrusted to us are a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>"Strange? How so? Why bring this up?" He Zhenghao was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think, a contribution of one billion is a lot?" Gao Yuan didn't answer directly but asked back.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, of course, it's a lot," He Zhenghao replied, feeling a bit confused and stating the obvious.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan smiled lightly, "A one-billion contribution, I also think it's a number that is difficult to achieve in a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, recall when Master Li mentioned the number [one billion], did his tone or expression change in any way?" Gao Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was puzzled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After furrowing his brows and pondering for a while, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"That's it. Master Li casually mentioned it, just as ordinary as eating and drinking. He didn't elaborate much," Gao Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, he repeatedly emphasized that he needed to seclude deeply and cut off all contact with the outside world."</p><p></p><p>"For just a one-billion contribution, does it deserve such serious treatment from Master Li?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was about to refute, but after careful consideration and recalling Li Fan's disdain for wealth during their interactions, he became somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"In less than seven days, the contribution doubled. With such means, perhaps to Master, one billion is just a slightly larger number," Gao Yuan nodded heavily. "Exactly. When Master was a solitary casual cultivator, he wouldn't have attached such importance to one billion contributions."</p><p></p><p>"Let alone now, when he is practically the ruler of the Cloud Mist Region."</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of a chief of any state who would deeply seclude just for a one-billion contribution."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'this matter is important and needs thorough preparation' is just an excuse!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan's eyes flashed with determination as he spoke pointedly.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, He Zhenghao slowly nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"But what does Master mean by this? Now that Cloud Mist City has just been completed and there are many tasks pending, why did he choose to seclude himself at this time?" He asked with a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan remained confident and proud, saying, "In my opinion, this is a test from Master Li."</p><p></p><p>"A test?" He Zhenghao was somewhat puzzled by his words.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Gao Yuan affirmed.</p><p></p><p>"You know, I have always been good at judging people. By spending some time with someone, I can understand them quite well."</p><p></p><p>"Master Li..."</p><p></p><p>"I dare not claim complete understanding, but there is no doubt about one thing."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan lowered his voice, "Master is inherently free and would never willingly be tied down by trivial political matters."</p><p></p><p>(() - incomplete text)</p>

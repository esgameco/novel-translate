        <h1>Chapter 300</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The chubby boy twisted his neck, and his entire body's bones made a series of cracking noises.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xiao, what do you think of my technique?" Ye Feipeng asked smugly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng wasn't discouraged by his defeat in battle, but curiously looked at Ye Feipeng, then flew over and randomly groped and pinched his body: "Fatty, what method did you use to form your golden core? As a human, how can you transform to be like a real exotic beast? Originally I thought the previous wings growing from your back was already the limit, I didn't expect you could progress even further!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng didn't stop Xiao Heng's groping hands, lifting his head with a condescending expression. </p><p></p><p>He didn't directly answer Xiao Heng's question, but tilted his head and said: "The power of the divine beast Kun Peng is naturally extraordinary. How about it? Envious?"</p><p></p><p>"This time I awakened a portion of my bloodline power again, and from ancient memories, I comprehended another divine ability."</p><p></p><p>"[Blood Lineage Transmission], I can separate out a portion of the vigorous Kun Peng essence blood within my body and transmit it to others. After the other party absorbs it, they can also inherit some of Kun Peng's divine powers. And my own strength won't be affected."</p><p></p><p>"Just like what that Kun Peng did for my Ye family ancestor back then."</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to try it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng said enticingly: "With your current fourth-stage golden core realm, if you obtain the Kun Peng essence blood, I'm afraid in a short time, your strength will far surpass mine. Truly not considering it?"</p><p></p><p>"Divine beast Kun Peng?" Xiao Heng's eyes flashed a hint of hesitation. Before, Ye Feipeng always referred to it as "demon beast" or "exotic beast", how come after not seeing him for a while, he changed to calling it a divine beast?</p><p></p><p>Sizing up Ye Feipeng, Xiao Heng calmly refused: "Haha, forget it, forget it. Your combat style is too fierce, my Wind Law is more handsome and suits me better."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Feipeng stared at Xiao Heng for a long time but ultimately didn't force it.</p><p></p><p>"Right, what do you think of Senior Skull's warning?" After a moment of silence, Xiao Heng suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Senior Skull who had been slumbering for a long time suddenly woke up. But after leaving a warning message of "Escape, leave the Congealing Cloud Sea!", it entered deep sleep again.</p><p></p><p>This left Xiao Heng somewhat perplexed. </p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what Senior Skull predicted, out of trust for it, Xiao Heng still planned to lead everyone to flee the Congealing Cloud Sea and take refuge in the nearby Shilin Province.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng's eyes flickered as he inwardly thought: "Looks like this old thing really has some skills, actually able to sense the Scorching Flame Burning Sea that's coming. However..."</p><p></p><p>After only hesitating for a moment, Fatty's gaze became incomparably resolute again.</p><p></p><p>"The descent of Scorching Flame is a catastrophe for ordinary people; but for me, it's a heaven-sent fortune."</p><p></p><p>"I've painstakingly waited so many years just for the arrival of this moment. How could I easily give up."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he calmly said: "Although Senior Skull has unfathomable divine powers, he's suffered heavy injuries after all and his strength has greatly diminished. There's no need to fully believe what he says. I think he's just being paranoid."</p><p></p><p>"We've stayed in the Congealing Cloud Sea for so many years and have always been fine. What big deal could happen!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng looked at Ye Feipeng's carefree appearance and grew even more suspicious. </p><p></p><p>Based on Xiao Heng's understanding of Fatty, if there was some uncertain danger before, he would definitely rather be safe than sorry and his first reaction would be to flee.</p><p></p><p>He absolutely wouldn't ignore potential crises in such a casual manner like now.</p><p></p><p>Is it because his strength grew and he became arrogant? Or is it the influence of this Kun Peng essence blood?</p><p></p><p>Vaguely feeling something was off, Xiao Heng didn't directly refute or advise, but showed an expression of "What you said makes a lot of sense, let me think it over carefully."</p><p></p><p>The two chatted idly for a bit more before Xiao Heng hurriedly took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng watched Xiao Heng's retreating figure, his gaze dark.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, it's just some mundane ties. Severing them early is good, saves me from being accused of not cherishing old feelings after I unite with the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Fatty snorted coldly, raised his head to look at the sky, a hint of blood flashing through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Mandate of Heaven is mine, I will definitely succeed in uniting with the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Jet-black wings unfurled from his back. With a light flap, Ye Feipeng's figure instantly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>On the desolate island, Xiao Heng who was talking with Su Changyu sensed Ye Feipeng's departure and gave a distant look, his expression indiscernible. </p><p></p><p>"Since Senior Skull has already given instructions, it must not be unfounded. To be cautious, we should still withdraw from the Congealing Cloud Sea." Su Changyu nodded, agreeing with Xiao Heng's decision.</p><p></p><p>Back then, besides Xiao Heng and the others, there were seven more people who came from the Separated Realm to this cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had randomly selected them just to put on appearances.</p><p></p><p>Eighteen years passed. Some of them unfortunately died from illness.</p><p></p><p>Some were unable to purge the miasma in their bodies and simply gave up on the idea of cultivation; unable to endure the hardships on the desolate island, they pleaded incessantly until Xiao Heng sent them to the surrounding mortal islands to live out the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Among the seven, only one man and woman ultimately stayed behind and struggled to enter the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>These two spent time together day and night, secretly developing feelings and became husband and wife.</p><p></p><p>They recently gave birth to a son named Han Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Adding on the Yin sisters, that was the entirety of the people currently on the desolate island.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat on the island could still be used and relocating was quite convenient.</p><p></p><p>It's just...</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Yueting, Yuzhen, these two girls, who knows what they've been busy with recently, all secretive. Even when I message them, their replies are very perfunctory."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go check on them first and bring them over."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the sisters knew priorities and gave their location in advance, so it wasn't hard to find.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't too far from the desolate island. Seven days later, Xiao Heng arrived before the sisters.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Xiao Heng a bit was that besides the sisters, there was also a Foundation Establishment cultivator with them.</p><p></p><p>Head bowed and waist bent, a pair of shifty-looking eyes, appearing to not be a good person at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Yin Yueting was currently frowning, looking displeased: "Zhao Erbao, how much more needs to be collected before that so-called Dao Resonance you spoke of can be reproduced?"</p><p></p><p>"My sister and I went through a lot of trouble this time to find a bunch of antiques. You only picked out so few usable ones? You better not be playing me!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Erbao hurriedly gave a bitter smile: "Young Miss, how would I dare. These Dao Resonant ancient objects are inherently hard to find. For you two to find so many in such a short time already shows your vast divine powers!"</p><p></p><p>"Even with ten times the guts, I wouldn't dare deceive you!"</p><p></p><p>"Dao Resonant ancient objects?" Xiao Heng listened to their conversation, eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>It was the elder sister Yin Yuzhen who transmitted her voice to explain the whole story to Xiao Heng.</p>

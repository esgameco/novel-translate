        <h1>Chapter 669</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Purple gold fortune, one in tens of millions. Wherever he went, he could almost always turn bad luck into good, turning danger into fortune, easily obtaining many treasures, with opportunities continuously coming his way.</p><p></p><p>For a person like him, how could he die so easily?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, fortune is not all-powerful. Bearing a great fortune does not mean immortality. When encountering calamities that one's destiny cannot bear, there is still a risk of falling.</p><p></p><p>But aside from relying on his own fortune, Xu Ke also had Mr. Bai's red thread protection. Even just a thin thread on the red thread could seriously injure the top elite of the monster clan, "Crimson Nine-headed." Mr. Bai's strength was truly unimaginably strong. Little Black learned from Xu Ke's last communication that there were still traces of the red thread on his wrist. Little Black firmly believed that no matter what danger Xu Ke encountered in this mysterious yellow world, the remaining red thread should be able to help him survive.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for Xu Ke's inexplicable death, Little Black could not understand and accept it. It swore to uncover the cause of Xu Ke's death.</p><p></p><p>After the restriction imposed by Emperor San Gu loosened, disregarding the restrictions of this world on itself, Little Black forcibly left the beast realm. It tried to trace the secrets of Xu Ke's death along his life path.</p><p></p><p>There were countless small worlds attached to the mysterious yellow, and with just a few words from that year, it was naturally extremely difficult to find the truth. However, guided by destiny and the fact that the Celestial Phoenix and Xu Ke had master-servant relations, after spending thousands of years, Little Black accidentally entered a vast small world. Seeing the floating crimson Nine-headed corpse in the sky made Little Black realize that it had finally found the right place.</p><p></p><p>After meeting with old friend Qing Luan, Little Black also understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>When the escaping Imperial Beast Sect settled in a small world called "Ling Xu Realm," it went through a relatively stable period of development. Although the spiritual energy density in the Ling Xu Realm was weaker than in the mysterious yellow world, it could still barely meet the needs of the disciples. Due to the continued restriction of incompatible practices, the Imperial Beast Sect formulated two simultaneous future plans. One was to gather the disciples with the most talent, for the headmaster and the elders to teach them all they knew in hopes that this group could develop new techniques for the Imperial Beast Sect disciples to cultivate. The second plan aimed to research a method where one could communicate with the minds of monster beasts even without practicing the "Imperial Beast True Secret."</p><p></p><p>One was "Divine Arts," and the other was "Imperial Beast." Employing both methods simultaneously, if given sufficient time, the Imperial Beast Sect might regain its former glory.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Ke lacked aptitude for enlightenment, he had a natural affinity for various monster beasts. At the suggestion of the headmaster, he became a member of the organization researching new Imperial Beast techniques. He spent his days observing the precious treasure of the Imperial Beast Sect, "Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts," dedicating himself to study, unaware of the passing years.</p><p></p><p>However, one day, Xu Ke received news that his senior brother, Lu Ya, was severely injured and comatose. Extremely shocked, despite everyone's opposition, he quietly returned to the mysterious yellow world alone.</p><p></p><p>At that time, terrifying miasma emerged from his body, filling the entire cultivation world. After Xu Ke returned to the mysterious yellow world, he inevitably contracted the disease. Fortunately, his luck was good, and he inexplicably recovered after seven days.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Ya, who was on the verge of death, seemed to sense Xu Ke's arrival and suddenly woke up. His complexion became rosy, completely devoid of any signs of severe injury. However, Xu Ke knew that this was just a temporary recovery, and Lu Ya didn't have much time left, causing grief to overwhelm him.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle expression, Lu Ya sent everyone away and called Xu Ke to his bedside alone.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what the two of them talked about that night.</p><p></p><p>From that day, Xu Ke stayed at the original site of the Imperial Beast Sect in the mysterious yellow world. Until the initiation of the large migration plan, he served as the sole remaining representative of the Imperial Beast Sect, relocating countless mortals to the secluded Ling Spirit small world.</p><p></p><p>Centuries passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The last group of mortals to depart was from the small world where Xu Ke encountered Crimson Nine-headed.</p><p></p><p>After assisting all mortals in their final migration, for some reason, Xu Ke never returned to the Imperial Beast Sect in the Ling Xu Realm. He even voluntarily cut off all ties and remained hidden, living as a mortal in obscurity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it wasn't simply living as a mortal.</p><p></p><p>Unnoticed by those around him, he used the six heads of the Crimson Nine-headed that had fallen off in this world as a breeding vessel. He used some mild-mannered monsters brought from the Imperial Beast Sect as seeds to nurture and breed various types of mutated monsters.</p><p></p><p>Little Blue and Little Red, two lucky flying birds who had always been by Xu Ke's side, although they did not understand his purpose, had been helping Xu Ke meticulously record all research findings.</p><p></p><p>After several generations of cultivation, the variety and quantity of mutated monsters continued to increase.</p><p></p><p>Although the strength of these mutated monsters was considerably weaker than the original monsters, the malice in their bloodline had correspondingly decreased. At the very least, they would not recklessly attack humans without reason.</p><p></p><p>After many years passed, the number of newly born exotic creature species in this world had reached an extremely prosperous state.</p><p></p><p>One day, for some unknown reason, the Crimson Nine-headed returned once again.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly somewhat fearful, it watched for a long time on the vast sky. When it saw no threats, it finally relaxed. Accompanying it was a large brown eagle. Both of them appeared somewhat disheveled, with many scorched black marks on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"If only I had left with Emperor Yi. No need to endure this bird's air in the mysterious yellow world!"</p><p></p><p>"Without the great leadership of Emperor Yi, we monsters have indeed deteriorated year by year. Originally, it was thought that after the great calamity, humans would soon be destroyed. But I never expected such formidable guys kept emerging! It's really unfair!"</p><p></p><p>"That guy from the Zi Xiao Sect is fine; it's not too outrageous. When it comes to true strong individuals, I was here years agoâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, these few scars on my head still ache slightly every now and then!"</p><p></p><p>The two terrifying monsters conversed uninhibitedly in the sky, treating the numerous mortals in this world as mere blood supplements.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, big brother, don't worry. After we devour this world and restore our strength, we'll settle scores with those guys!" The big brown eagle stared intently at the trembling mortals below, saliva almost dripping out.</p><p></p><p>But among monsters, there was a strict hierarchy.</p><p></p><p>"After you, big brother!" The big brown eagle suppressed its hunger, trying to please.</p><p></p><p>Crimson Nine-headed snorted coldly, and in an instant, its body swelled once again. With only three heads left, it opened its huge bloody mouths to devour this world.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, it saw the familiar red color.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible...?"</p><p></p><p>This time, the Crimson Nine-headed was not as lucky as before.</p><p></p><p>A thread pierced through its body, pulling it down from beyond the world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing its elder brother beside it being killed in an instant, the big brown eagle was instantly terrified.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring any sense of kinship, it turned into a black light and fled in a panic.</p><p></p><p>To the human eye, it was hard to see the whole picture. They only felt that the two ferocious monsters in the sky, about to cause havoc, were slain by an immortal.</p><p></p><p>Grateful for still being alive, they cheered and praised the benevolence and might of the immortal.</p>

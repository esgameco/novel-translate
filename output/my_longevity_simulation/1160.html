            <p>Chapter 1158: Secret Technique of Devouring Heavenly Mystery</p><p></p><p>Li Fan focused his attention solely on the bizarre mirror not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Not only is the appearance similar, but even the aura..."</p><p></p><p>With the essence of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror by his side, Li Fan was extremely familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the feeling he got from that strange little mirror was like it was the twin brother of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was shaken, his thoughts rapidly turning.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mystery Mirror was once called the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror. It was obtained by the Mysterious Heavenly King from the ascension passage during the Mysterious Heavenly Sect era and is a relic from the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the one before my eyes?"</p><p></p><p>At this instant, Li Fan couldn't help but have the thought of going forward to investigate.</p><p></p><p>But after pondering for a moment, he ultimately stopped himself.</p><p></p><p>This black Heavenly Mystery Mirror always gave him an inexplicable sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to first observe the situation quietly.</p><p></p><p>Drip, drip, the blood falling on the mirror surface didn't stop. Sun Luyuan's face had already turned somewhat pale, but he still showed no intention of stopping.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even saw fear in his eyes, as well as slightly trembling arms trying to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Yet for some reason, he was unable to control his own actions.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the mirror surface erupted with a strange fluctuation and the black light converged that Sun Luyuan collapsed to the ground as if exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Taking out several medicinal pills and swallowing them, after a round of breath regulation, his complexion finally returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked at the small mirror emitting wisps of faint light in front of him, a trace of greed and a hint of fear flashing through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>After a good while, his stiff body finally began to move again.</p><p></p><p>From his bosom, he took out another small mirror.</p><p></p><p>Adjusting the angle of the mirror's surface to face the black small mirror.</p><p></p><p>This newly taken out mirror was naturally the Heavenly Mystery Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clearly saw wisps of green light being absorbed from the surface of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror and then surging into the black small mirror.</p><p></p><p>And after absorbing the Heavenly Mystery Small Mirror, that black mirror also seemed to become more like the Heavenly Mystery Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan appeared to be calculating the time.</p><p></p><p>After a while, when the black mirror was still devouring, his expression slightly changed and he hurriedly made a hand seal to put away the Heavenly Mystery Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But how could the black mirror, which was in the midst of feasting, let it go?</p><p></p><p>A black mist suddenly surged from the mirror's surface, transforming into a human figure, roaring angrily at Sun Luyuan: "It's not enough!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to eat more!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan gritted his teeth while insisting on putting away the Heavenly Mystery Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he said to the black mirror figure, "Little brother, control your inner heart! Devouring too quickly at once will alert the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, and then all our efforts will be in vain!"</p><p></p><p>After hearing Sun Luyuan's words, the black mirror figure seemed to regain a bit of reason.</p><p></p><p>Its form kept swaying, as if resisting itself.</p><p></p><p>After struggling for some time, it finally suppressed its inner desire.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I'm in so much pain..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I can't hold on anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, quickly let me out!"</p><p></p><p>Crying, pleading, hatred...</p><p></p><p>Various emotions appeared in succession on the black mirror figure.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what attitude it had, the beginning of each sentence always started with the word "Brother".</p><p></p><p>And Sun Luyuan also seemed to be tormented by this series of calls.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he could only close his eyes and once again use his own essence blood to irrigate and appease the black mirror figure's resentment.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the essence blood, the black mirror became calm again.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was relieved, collapsing weakly on the ground, not showing any bearing of a Harmonious Dao expert at all.</p><p></p><p>A full half a day later, he finally recovered.</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the black mirror again, he silently chanted.</p><p></p><p>As Sun Luyuan manipulated, from the black mirror bloomed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Within it, countless symbols and images flashed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan watched intently, as if hungry and thirsty, afraid of missing any single detail.</p><p></p><p>Until finally, the brightness of the images grew dimmer and dimmer, eventually disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Sun Luyuan reluctantly withdraw his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"The gains from this time are enough for our Sun family to get through this difficult period."</p><p></p><p>"Wait until Lu'er comes out from the Protector Hall and takes up an important position in the Immortal Alliance. With one family in four Harmonious Daos, only then can our Sun family be considered to have truly gained a firm footing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had been watching the entire process from the side, saw through some things.</p><p></p><p>"Not a same-grade Immortal Artifact? But using a human divine soul as the foundation, using some secret method to erode the Heavenly Profound Mirror? Thereby obtaining a large amount of information that cannot be obtained through ordinary means?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not an Immortal Artifact, being able to invade the Heavenly Profound Mirror is extremely remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Sun Luyuan, who seemed to have suffered a great loss of vitality. </p><p></p><p>While recuperating, the other party seemed to be digesting with eyes closed the information he had just obtained from the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>"With my one Dao Avatar, wanting to control him..."</p><p></p><p>"There's no absolute certainty. Especially with that strange black mirror by his side."</p><p></p><p>After much deliberation, Li Fan's Avatar did not choose to take action immediately.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he decided to lurk first.</p><p></p><p>Wait until Sun Luyuan separates from the black mirror, then slowly plot.</p><p></p><p>Another seven days passed.</p><p></p><p>When Sun Luyuan opened his eyes, the first thing he did was to continuously make hand seals to temporarily seal the black mirror in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Sensing what Sun Luyuan was doing, the misty figure in the black mirror struggled to emerge again.</p><p></p><p>But it was tightly sealed within the mirror surface, unable to come out.</p><p></p><p>After all the disturbances disappeared, Sun Luyuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He opened the layers of restrictions and left the secret room.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's Avatar quietly flew to the side of the black mirror. </p><p></p><p>"The material of this mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't seem to be something made in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like the guess that it's an Immortal Artifact is not entirely wrong."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the original power of the Immortal Path has gone to who knows where, leaving only an empty shell, occupied by that misty figure."</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current knowledge, after careful observation, he indeed made a discovery.</p><p></p><p>To verify his speculation, the Avatar began to study the seal left by Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>The Main Body used the Doomsday Separation Disk to provide support. Before long, he had already cracked it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan's Avatar did not directly destroy this seal, but slowly modified it based on its foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, how come you're back so quickly this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you encounter some difficult problem again? Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>The somewhat crazed voice of the black shadow came out from the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't answer at all, but continued to modify the formation seal.</p><p></p><p>The black shadow talked to itself for a while, and finally noticed something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"You're not my brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was filled with anger and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"Disgusting thing, get away from me!"</p><p></p><p>The black shadow screamed, and the black mirror also shook incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"Noisy!" Li Fan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>A silver thunderbolt was produced from the void, then fiercely struck the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>That mirror body forged from unknown materials actually produced a hint of charring.</p><p></p><p>The screaming voice of the black shadow was also cut off by a miserable howl.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the black shadow seemed to recover.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>About to act up again, what greeted it was another thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>Recommending a fourth-generation farming flow novel "The Fourth Calamity".

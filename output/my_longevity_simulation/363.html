            <p>"Are you crazy?"</p><p></p><p>When the elderly Li Fan, who was about to pass away, suddenly appeared in front of Haohui, he was startled. </p><p></p><p>And when he heard Li Fan's request, Haohui couldn't believe it at first, thinking he must have misheard. </p><p></p><p>After confirming it repeatedly, he couldn't help but smile in disbelief and firmly refuse. </p><p></p><p>"Friend Li, you've already done enough. Let the other array masters take care of the rest. Your current condition is not suitable for continuing the construction of arrays."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Haohui suggested, "Friend, you have been trapped in the devouring white mist for too long, and your lifespan is depleting. The best strategy now is to seize every moment and focus on cultivating. See if you can break through to the Yuanying realm before your end approaches. With your talents, I see a chance to defy fate."</p><p></p><p>Although Haohui's words resonated with Li Fan, he shook his head against his true feelings. "Friend, I appreciate your kind intentions, but I am well aware of my limitations. With my remaining lifespan, it is impossible for me to reach the Yuanying realm through cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I would rather contribute my last bit of strength to building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array while I can still move. Witnessing the array enveloping the entire land of Wanxian Alliance during my lifetime, even if I die, I will have no regrets."</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, Li Fan spoke firmly. "If my remaining life can only be dull and waiting for death, I will not close my eyes in peace. I hope you understand!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the determined Li Fan, Haohui was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Although his instinct was to refuse, the sincere look in the other's eyes made him feel indescribable emotions.</p><p></p><p>"...Alright, friend, wait for me a moment. I will seek instructions." Haohui seemed afraid to face Li Fan again, so he left in a hurry. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan, composed and patient, waited. </p><p></p><p>After a while, Haohui returned with a complex expression. </p><p></p><p>"Friend Li, your request has been approved. After the current crisis of the Moony Sound Tide subsides, our Qingxuan Army will send someone to escort you back to the front line."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Haohui." Li Fan sighed in relief and nodded in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li Fan..." Haohui couldn't help but ask as he saw the relieved expression on Li Fan's aged face after receiving the mission. "Why is this happening? Your actions have surpassed my understanding."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled without answering, bowed, and left.</p><p></p><p>Left behind was Haohui, standing dumbfounded and uncertain, pondering deeply without a word.</p><p></p><p>Not surprisingly, the news of Li Fan, who was almost at the end of his life, returning to the frontline to build arrays spread quickly. </p><p></p><p>In a moment, the news spread throughout the Broken Palm Immortal City. </p><p></p><p>Among the buzz and questioning, doubts inevitably surfaced. </p><p></p><p>However, half a month later, when Li Fan left the Eternal Immortal Stronghold again under the escort of dozens of Qingxuan troops, heading towards the Jiuxu Base, all doubts were shattered. </p><p></p><p>Shocked by Li Fan's choice, the cultivators felt ashamed of their previous thoughts and selfishness. </p><p></p><p>In the Qingxuan Army, a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm rose. </p><p></p><p>Instead of complaining about hardship, they started comparing the length of service in the Abyssal Roar. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan, unaware of all this, successfully requested reinforcements for the base before the supplies were exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Preventing a tragedy. </p><p></p><p>Although his solo venture into the white mist led to some punishment for surviving cultivators, their lives were more important.</p><p></p><p>Also, under Li Fan's plea, He Chen, Kong Yu, and others returned to the Jiuxu Base, aiding Li Fan in constructing arrays. </p><p></p><p>To ensure Li Fan's safety, the stronghold increased the number of escort troops threefold. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan never rested but worked tirelessly on array construction. </p><p></p><p>Having saved He Chen and others, the Qingxuan troops obeyed Li Fan's every word. </p><p></p><p>Within the Jiuxu Base, Li Fan gained absolute authority. </p><p></p><p>With full compliance, all commands were executed perfectly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan's mindset turned from resting to becoming an obsessed workaholic, doubling the speed of array construction compared to before. </p><p></p><p>The construction was paused due to the Abyssal Roar; Li Fan's rank on the leaderboard had dropped to the bottom, around six hundredth place. </p><p></p><p>As they resumed, his rank steadily climbed, attracting attention. </p><p></p><p>In the rankings, Guo Yezhong, with zero points, still stood out. </p><p></p><p>He seemed indifferent to the competition. </p><p></p><p>Although cultivators discussed it, the Wanxian Alliance took no special action. </p><p></p><p>Rumors circulated that Guo Yezhong remained within their territory, not fleeing and still vying for victory. </p><p></p><p>Asked about it, he only responded, "Who emerges victorious remains unknown."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan immersed himself in array construction, his tale of facing tremendous changes, his impending death, and his dedication to building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array spread swiftly with the hint of an interested party. </p><p></p><p>Especially his moving story of using his last strength to build the array even as his life dwindled was greatly admired.</p><p></p><p>As the news spread, most cultivators outside closed cultivation knew about Li Fan's actions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's communication charm was the first to be overwhelmed. </p><p></p><p>He received messages from He Zhenghao, Shen Yuzi, and acquaintances from the former Universal Academy, all inquiring. </p><p></p><p>Unable to respond to all, Li Fan set up an automatic reply, briefly explaining the situation. </p><p></p><p>His friends lamented and admired him greatly. </p><p></p><p>Some even promised to find life-extending treasures for him, all of which Li Fan gratefully acknowledged. </p><p></p><p>He then continued tirelessly with array construction. </p><p></p><p>Two years passed like this.</p><p></p><p>One day, a rainbow light pierced the white mist and headed straight for the Broken Palm Immortal City.</p>

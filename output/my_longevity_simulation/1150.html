            <p>Chapter 1148: Singlehandedly Destroying the Demon Tide</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to go with me?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice resounded like thunder, penetrating the white fog and even temporarily suppressing the wailing sounds from the Chizha Abyss, echoing endlessly within the Eternal Immortal Fortress.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the countless gazes of the Qingxuan Army converging on him, Shang Shaojun's fluctuating figure calmed down, revealing his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a green robe with sleeves fluttering, his figure was tall and straight. A sharp light flashed in his eyes as Shang Shaojun stared at Li Fan, "Fellow Daoist, you are probably a bit arrogant. Although your sword is sharp, it may not necessarily be able to block that terrifying demonic sound tide. Yet you still vainly hope to eternally suppress the abyss..."</p><p></p><p>"How do you know without trying? I see that you, Shaojun, have been guarding outside the abyss for years, and your courage has been worn away!" The Holy Fetus Li Fan did not give in at all, arguing against him.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, just showing off your eloquence."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it seemed as if there were myriad shadows appearing on Shang Shaojun's body. He himself was like hiding within this dark tide, secretly spying on Li Fan, ready to launch a fatal strike at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for the Holy Fetus Li Fan, he felt as if he was surrounded by thousands of troops and horses, even having the illusion of facing the Chizha Abyss alone.</p><p></p><p>"There are rumors within the Immortal Alliance that the demonic sound from the abyss is beneficial to Shang Shaojun's cultivation, so he is willing to guard here and not leave for a hundred years. Now it seems that it is indeed true."</p><p></p><p>When he was still at the Foundation Establishment stage, Li Fan had already experienced the terror of the abyss demonic sound at close range.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Shang Shaojun was like an abyss that could walk freely, ready to erupt with a demonic sound tide at any time!</p><p></p><p>Above the head of the Holy Fetus Li Fan, a plain and unadorned pitch-black long sword suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The sword tip pointed straight at Shang Shaojun.</p><p></p><p>Although he had millions of demonic sounds on his body, the moment he was locked onto by the sword edge, Shang Shaojun's heart also showed a trace of crisis.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see that behind the black sword, countless swords filled the sky like rain, all pointing at him together!</p><p></p><p>"Where did this expert come from..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun felt a bit heavy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The two confronted each other in the void, and a great battle was about to break out.</p><p></p><p>At this critical moment, a strange fluctuation came from not far away from them.</p><p></p><p>At first, it was a few sharp tearing sounds, as if the autumn wind was drizzling.</p><p></p><p>Then it suddenly erupted like the urgent trampling of horse hooves, like a fierce wind and heavy rain.</p><p></p><p>As if it was the wailing of ten thousand ghosts in hell. It was also like the desperate howling sound reverberating in the world before the end of days arrived.</p><p></p><p>The white fog was stirred and kept rolling.</p><p></p><p>And that Broken Palm Immortal City was even more like a small boat on the sea, shaking incessantly and in imminent danger!</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Sound Tide!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be due to the suppression of Li Fan's sword light just now, which caused the power of the Chizha Abyss to rebound.</p><p></p><p>This time, the intensity and scale of the demonic sound tide far exceeded the usual.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Immortal Fortress, which was directly impacted by the tide, seemed like leaves on a branch, and could be blown away at any time!</p><p></p><p>With Shang Shaojun's presence, green light circled around, and the Eternal Immortal Fortress slowly stabilized in the demonic sound tide.</p><p></p><p>Just when the Qingxuan Army was still in shock, they were horrified to find that Li Fan, who they thought had disappeared in the demonic sound tide, was still standing quietly in the void at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Even though the demonic sounds were raging around him and the white fog was surging,</p><p></p><p>He always remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>And then, Li Fan did something even more unexpected to everyone.</p><p></p><p>He was seen strolling leisurely and came to the outside of the Broken Palm Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Facing the endless Chizha Abyss, Li Fan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>A pitch-black long sword appeared just in time under him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's right hand bent his fingers...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He gently tapped on the sword.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>The crisp sound was so prominent, even amidst the raging demonic noise!</p><p></p><p>As the sword's ringing echoed, countless different sword shadows suddenly appeared behind Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The sword shadows were continuous, like a Great Wall, blocking the Broken Palm Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand swords, like a forest, all pointing towards the abyss!</p><p></p><p>"Demonic noise penetrates the mind, yet he remains completely unaffected! How did he manage to do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Sitting in front of the city, what is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>This shocking scene left the million Qingxuan soldiers utterly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Even Shao Jun abruptly stood up in surprise, gazing at Li Fan's back outside the city from afar.</p><p></p><p>If the demonic noise surge was like an endless, turbulent, and overwhelming giant wave,</p><p></p><p>Then at this moment, Li Fan was like a huge rock standing by the sea,</p><p></p><p>Firm and unshakable, unmoved from all directions.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the demonic noise raged, it could not harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's performance had only just begun.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>From the Great Wall formed by the myriad sword shadows behind him, one sword suddenly flew out.</p><p></p><p>Just like the world-shocking sword light Li Fan had unleashed before, it rushed towards the demonic noise surge head-on.</p><p></p><p>In front of the surging demonic noise, the sword light gradually dimmed.</p><p></p><p>But the Qingxuan soldiers in the Broken Palm Immortal City clearly felt that the power of the demonic noise surge had been reduced by a few degrees because of that sword light!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>A thought couldn't help but surface in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the Immortal City couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, a scene that would be forever unforgettable to them appeared.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of flying swords, one after another, charged fearlessly towards the roaring abyss.</p><p></p><p>Countless sword lights flashed in succession, completely illuminating the Eternal Immortal Fortress.</p><p></p><p>With each attack, the demonic noise surge weakened a little.</p><p></p><p>The horrifying wailing sounds that had appeared in everyone's ears also slowly became feeble.</p><p></p><p>The vast Immortal City was utterly silent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was quietly watching Li Fan's back.</p><p></p><p>There was simply no room for any other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As the heavy rain finally ceased, the sky cleared after the rain.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Immortal City, the demonic noise no longer resounded.</p><p></p><p>Yet the sword lights behind Li Fan still remained so numerous.</p><p></p><p>Endless and inexhaustible, forever unceasing.</p><p></p><p>"That great man..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps what he said before about eternally suppressing the abyss is not impossible to achieve."</p><p></p><p>This thought simultaneously surfaced in the minds of the Qingxuan soldiers.</p><p></p><p>With his back to the Broken Palm Immortal City, Li Fan did not stand up.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan soldiers also seemed to be frozen, not daring to make the slightest movement.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was actually comprehending the changes happening to himself.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, the Xuanhuang Dao is instinctively rejecting these [foreign objects]. If one can follow the will of Heaven, they will receive the corresponding favor from the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan slowly stood up, turned his head, and looked at the countless cultivators inside the Eternal Immortal Fortress.</p><p></p><p>Smiling, he asked, "Does Shao Jun still think I am arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City was dead silent.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Shao Jun's figure appeared in front of Li Fan once again.</p><p></p><p>He bowed slightly, sighing in admiration, "I was wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Your talent, fellow Daoist, is rarely seen in this world."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to say something, Li Fan waved his hand, interrupting him.</p><p></p><p>"So, is Shao Jun willing to accompany me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shao Jun gritted his teeth and responded helplessly, "Since it's like this, I will risk my life to accompany you!"</p><p></p><p>With Shao Jun's words, the Broken Palm Immortal City instantly erupted in earth-shattering cheers.</p><p></p><p>That's all for today.</p>

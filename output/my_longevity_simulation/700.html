        <h1>Chapter 700</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The fortunate voices of Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao sounded in Li Fan's ear. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned around to size up the two of them and found that they looked quite disheveled compared to himself. In just a short while, they seemed to have aged significantly. Some streaks of gray had appeared in their hair, and there were many wrinkles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"If Brother Li hadn't rushed ahead and attracted most of the death qi, Huangfu and I might have perished here!" Dongfang Yao exclaimed with lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"You two should take some more longevity pills first. I still have some left." Li Fan, with a pained expression on his face yet without hesitation, took out a jade bottle. Flipping the bottle, he poured out the last three pills remaining inside.</p><p></p><p>"If I had known earlier, I would have bought more from that person." Li Fan sighed and handed two pills to Huangfu and Dongfang. </p><p></p><p>Seeing all this, Huangfu and Dongfang couldn't help but show a touch of emotion on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"I was right about you! Brother Li is truly righteous!" Dongfang Yao sighed as he solemnly swallowed the last longevity pill. "At the critical moment of life and death, unwavering. People like you, my brother, are rare in the Xuanyellow realm!"</p><p></p><p>"It is our fortune to have Brother Li accompanying us this time." Huangfu Song spoke after neutralizing the negative effects brought by the death qi. </p><p></p><p>"By the way, where did Brother Li get these longevity pills? Their effects are truly extraordinary. I have swallowed six consecutively and can still feel the surging vitality within." After a moment, he inquired about the source of the longevity pills from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I am ashamed to say that I bought them from a cultivator I happened to encounter in the Tianyu City. At that time, I was skeptical of their effects, so I didn't prepare much. Moreover, in haste, I even forgot to take down the contact information of the seller," Li Fan regretfully shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song looked disappointed upon hearing this, "It's a pity. Such divine pills will surely cause a frenzy among the cultivators within the alliance once the official command is issued. If only we had stocked up in advance..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's focus on how to leave this place for now. We have only escaped from that silent sea of death and haven't successfully left this maze yet," Dongfang Yao interrupted Huangfu Song's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>With that said, the three carefully examined the vibrant blue sea before them, which was drastically different from the black sea of death they had just escaped. It was not only different but also two opposing extremes.</p><p></p><p>One was filled with death qi so thick that even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't easily resist or dissolve it, while here, although the vitality was not as abundant, it was vibrant like the sun, youth, and spring.</p><p></p><p>Everything was lively and full of vigor, resembling a newly born world, brimming with vitality.</p><p></p><p>Impacted by this change, Li Fan and his companions felt as if they had become "younger" both mentally and physically.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, Brother Li?" Dongfang Yao asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, not giving an immediate answer.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song offered his speculation, "This sea of vitality here might be part of the same maze as the sea of death we encountered before. Two sides of the same coin."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, there must be a corresponding 'eye of the formation' here. Given the difference between life and death, the positions of the two 'eyes' in their respective worlds are likely different. If we can find the 'eye' of the sea of vitality, pass through it, we might be able to escape this maze," Huangfu Song elaborated.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Dongfang Yao scratched his head, "Why not go back to the sea of death?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and answered on behalf of Huangfu Song, "Because the formation here is the 'Reverse Life and Death Array.' Moreover, judging by the dense death qi in the sea of death we traversed, if there were a place filled with such strong vitality linked to that side, it would be extremely conspicuous. Yet, we roamed through the sea of death without encountering even a hint of vitality, indicating that the exit of this vivid sea of life is not there."</p><p></p><p>"Honestly, the way you all put it aligns with my thoughts!" Huangfu Song exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you all agree, let's quickly set out to find the 'eye' of the formation." The two brothers unanimously decided, prompting Huangfu Song to acknowledge and urge for immediate action.</p><p></p><p>The sea of vitality appeared just like a regular ocean, except for having a slightly greater variety of marine life, there was nothing extraordinary about it.</p><p></p><p>They encountered no danger on their journey; it was smooth sailing.</p><p></p><p>To Huangfu Song's surprise, the exploration here still counted within the scope of expanding the unknown territories of the Qingxuan. The continuously increasing Qingxuan points filled him with excitement, almost making him forget the life and death crisis he had just faced.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face also showed signs of joy, but this was a pretense to blend in.</p><p></p><p>His mind was actually contemplating a question.</p><p></p><p>Was this sea of vitality the trial ground set by the Longevity Celestial who could reverse life and death?</p><p></p><p>"From the world of annihilation to creating a brand-new world of vitality?"</p><p></p><p>"From the life and death of all creatures to the life and death of the world. It is indeed a step forward."</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly is this powerful being?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt there might be other hidden secrets within this, but at present, he couldn't guess further.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, then the 'Law of Reversing Life and Death' in the world has already been occupied by someone. At this time, the Blue Feather Immortal, who also wishes to prove himself through this, has not yet faked his death and risked it all."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can benefit from this."</p><p></p><p>"However, be cautious when dealing with a tiger. Blue Feather surviving in the ancient cultivation world to date indicates he is no simple character."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered secretly, the three of them finished exploring the sea of vitality.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they did find the location of the 'eye' of the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Li Brother led the way last time, so let me go first this time." Sensing the faint vortex ahead, Dongfang Yao patted his chest and offered to go first.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no objections.</p><p></p><p>And Huangfu Song nodded but followed behind Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan brought up the rear as the three entered the vortex in succession.</p><p></p><p>The familiar white mist surged from all directions. This terrifying presence that could have devoured their lifespan now brought a wave of joy to the three.</p><p></p><p>"We have finally come out alive!"</p><p></p><p>"This time, we've earned more than thirty thousand Qingxuan points, probably more than anyone in the whole Immortal Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song eagerly raised the Sky Measurement Mirror, wanting to synchronize the recorded data with the Celestial Mirror. However, at the next moment, his face turned pale, and he let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? How did our Qingxuan points reset to zero?"</p>

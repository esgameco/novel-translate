            <p>"In our alliance, there are countless outstanding young talents. Finding a suitable successor is definitely not a difficult task," Li Fan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"The safety of all cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm is at stake, and the alliance will naturally not stand idly by. Since it's inconvenient for you to leave, I will arrange for them to come over after I return. You can personally assess them."</p><p></p><p>"I believe with your discerning eye, you will surely be able to find a candidate to your liking," Li Fan said with an air of righteousness.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Xu Ke seemed somewhat in disbelief. </p><p></p><p>After a good while, he hurriedly said in a somewhat bewildered manner, "If that's the case, then let me thank you in advance, my friend."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Xiao Qing, Xiao Hong, as well as your descendant, the Imperial Princess, all miss you very much. Would you be willing to see them?" Instead of making the decision on his own, Li Fan took the initiative to ask.</p><p></p><p>A trace of melancholy flashed across Xu Ke's face.</p><p></p><p>However, he still nodded after a moment.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving this desolate small world, through his conversation with Xu Ke, Li Fan gained an even more detailed understanding of what happened back then.</p><p></p><p>Long before deciding to go against the natural order and create the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, Mr. Bai had traveled to various major sects in the Xuanhuang Realm and made ample preparations. </p><p></p><p>For example, in almost every sect, he had found influential figures in pivotal positions.</p><p></p><p>This was to ensure that once the plan to unleash the Immortal-Mortal Miasma and relocate mortals to small cave heavens was proposed, it would be quickly accepted by the major sects.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Immortal Severing Grand Formation that sealed off the mortals' small worlds, and even the Rift Whales outside the formation...</p><p></p><p>The ultimate realization of all this bore traces of Mr. Bai's advance arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Xu Ke didn't know too much about this either.</p><p></p><p>Back then, upon suddenly hearing the tragic news about Lu Ya, he had rushed over in a hurry. The last mission he received from Lu Ya before his passing was to guard the stripped Xuanhuang Heavenly Favor.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The world's Dao has its own operating mechanism."</p><p></p><p>"Just like when a small world beyond the realm faced an apocalyptic crisis, the Dao consciousness naturally sought out a candidate who could potentially break free from the predicament and descended upon Su Yujing."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm also chose Mr. Bai. Unfortunately, between the Dao and the mortals of Xuanhuang, Mr. Bai still chose the latter."</p><p></p><p>"He turned around and sealed the Dao consciousness that had attached to him..."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the performance of the Xuanhuang Realm's Dao after this, it was almost always at a disadvantage in the battles against the cultivators. There were no longer any countermeasures like [Techniques Cannot Be Cultivated Together]. The remaining strength of the Dao must have been affected to a certain extent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of Ruo Mu again.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, she was brutally hurt by humans, transforming from a divine tree that nurtured all living beings in the world into a terrifying existence that captured cultivators' Nascent Souls.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Having suffered betrayal from the most favored person and being sealed for nearly 10,000 years, one could imagine what state the Xuanhuang Dao sealed in the coffin behind Xu Ke would become.</p><p></p><p>"Another killing move. It's just not suitable to be used in this world. It would only add many variables."</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of the Xuanhuang Realm's Dao, I can still deceive and command. If the Dao goes mad, I'm afraid my divine powers will lose their effect."</p><p></p><p>Pondering along the way, Li Fan returned to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>After conveying Xu Ke's message to Imperial Concubine Xiao Qing and the others, they were naturally overjoyed. Afterwards, they expressed their gratitude to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Gratitude and Appreciation.</p><p></p><p>Along with them, there were also aspiring youths selected from various small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only did a rough screening, and let Xu Ke make the specific decisions.</p><p></p><p>After being busy, Li Fan came to the location of [Seeking Seclusion].</p><p></p><p>After more than a year, more than ten steles had been erected.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were unimportant contents from the sealed history.</p><p></p><p>However, the latest discovery from the Blood-Colored River aroused Li Fan's interest.</p><p></p><p>The time point should be after countless years of fighting, when the chaos gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>It was a period of cultivation wasteland when civilization was slowly reviving.</p><p></p><p>In the picture, a man in tattered clothes, but emitting a strong murderous aura, was looking at the old man who suddenly appeared in front of him with vigilance.</p><p></p><p>The man in the picture naturally did not know this old man.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who was outside the picture, was very familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>It was Tian Yi!</p><p></p><p>Without any nonsense, Tian Yi made a move instantly and subdued the man with murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed that he was reading the memories of the man with murderous aura over the years.</p><p></p><p>"It has been so long this time?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I should try to stay away from the Immortal Ruins next time."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi sighed and muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Then he slapped the man with murderous aura to death, and his figure disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The picture ended abruptly.</p><p></p><p>But the amount of information contained in it was quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it confirmed one point. Thousands of years ago, Tian Yi already had the ability to resist the suction of the Immortal Ruins and traverse the void.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had traveled back and forth more than once.</p><p></p><p>During this period, it was inevitable to be affected by the Immortal Ruins. When he reappeared, a very long time had passed in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"In that case..."</p><p></p><p>The guess that he planned to verify in the next life suddenly reappeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression became even more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmission, Tian Yi, they used to be active in the Xuanhuang Realm frequently. The information contained in the Blood-Colored River is very valuable."</p><p></p><p>He once again issued generous rewards to motivate the morale of his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Li Fan suddenly received news about Mo Rubin from Dharma Transmitter Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"He has appeared?"</p><p></p><p>"And he hasn't been promoted to Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a ruse? With his cautious way of doing things, even if the plan fails, he can't reveal his whereabouts so easily."</p><p></p><p>However, Dharma Transmitter Zhou was very confident: "The place where he appeared is one of the secret locations of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that there are no other cultivators present, but in fact, we have already implemented secret monitoring of it."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Mo Rubin did not appear in his original form. We tracked him down and located him based on the changing marks he left on Dharma Transmitter Chen, by reverse-tracking the fluctuations."</p><p></p><p>"So I'm more inclined to think that he miscalculated this time."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou had already hated this Profound Heaven Sect Dharma King, who had repeatedly played the Immortal Alliance people like puppets, so much that his teeth itched.</p><p></p><p>He said solemnly, "This time, our Myriad Immortal Alliance will go all out to capture him. I wonder if you are interested in cooperating with us again, my friend?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately agreed, "I will go and ask for instructions, and give you a reply right away."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan took the initiative to send a message, "The elders of the Joint Council have already agreed."</p>

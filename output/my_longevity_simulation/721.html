            <p>Immediately they advised each other.</p><p></p><p>After all, without Li Fan, their efficiency in exploring the mysterious realm with Dongfang would definitely not be as high as before. The hope of exchanging limited treasures on the Azure Profound List seemed even more uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the Blue Feather Immortal's announcement of a reward this time is a good thing for us. With the announcement, a considerable number of cultivators are attracted back. The competition pressure on this side of the White Mist will decrease..." Huangfu Song continued with his well-reasoned analysis.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, waved his hand to interrupt him, and said, "Brother Huangfu, you don't need to worry. I have no intention of going back. And maybe I will stay in the White Mist longer than you guys."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao immediately became curious, "Why, Brother Li, have you set your eyes on something on the Azure Profound List?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't hide it either, paused, and said, "The Endstone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang and Huangfu looked at each other, "A hundred thousand Azure Profound Points to gamble on a secondary body whose effects are still unclear..."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao couldn't help but advise, "Brother Li, think twice! The risk is too great. If that thing sounds grand but turns out to be of little actual use, won't it be a total loss? It's better to look at other things. Even exchanging for a martial art technique might be better! Even if you can't use it yourself, you can trade it with others..."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao prattled on, and Huangfu Song, lost in thought, gave his opinion, "The Endstone Tablet..."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that after this secondary body was born, for a full ten years, there haven't been any other Tianxuan secondary bodies born. The headquarters of the 69book->69shu.com were on edge, thinking that there would be no more secondary bodies coming. This is probably why it was put on the Azure Profound List by the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it is a Tianxuan secondary body. Maybe there are practical uses that the Immortal Alliance has not discovered yet. Although the price of a hundred thousand Azure Profound Points is high, if you bet correctly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, then said, "Risk and reward go hand in hand! I am willing to try!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao exclaimed, "Brother Li, you have a big appetite for gambling. If it turns out that thing is just a worthless rock in the end..."</p><p></p><p>"Then at the very least, it has some collecting value, so it won't be a total loss!" Li Fan smiled casually, extremely carefree.</p><p></p><p>"The only thing I'm worried about now is whether there are others who want to compete with me. Among the Immortal Alliance cultivators, there are definitely more than just me with a penchant for gambling."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song clapped his hands, "It seems we need to speed up our progress. We still have a long way to go before reaching a hundred thousand Azure Profound Points!"</p><p></p><p>After this discussion, the three of them united their goal and continued to explore the realm with all their efforts. 69book->69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Time passed hurriedly in this process.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu and Dongfang had already exchanged for the Dissolving Disc and the Devouring Element Sacred Body, redirecting their goals towards other treasures.</p><p></p><p>And the accumulation of Azure Profound Points was getting closer to a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>Considering all the realms they had explored, including the initial Life-and-Death Realm, they had reached the number thirteen.</p><p></p><p>As they became more skillful in exploration, Li Fan also summarized some rules about the existence of the "realms."</p><p></p><p>Based on the conclusion that "the current Xuanhuang Realm is a fusion of many ancient Xuanhuang Realms with other worlds," Li Fan discovered that the so-called realms might be "fragments" that fell off from the original worlds as they merged and collided during the evolution of the worlds.</p><p></p><p>The realms were extremely mysterious, often possessing their own unique rules, which was very similar to the "strangeness" in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the attire and architectural styles of the dead cultivators in the realms, Li Fan found that these realms evidently had different origins.</p><p></p><p>"The world-level evolution is happening in the collision, and the White Mist is its buffer zone..."</p><p></p><p>After exploring another realm, Li Fan had a realization.</p><p></p><p>This might also explain why there was such vast space in the White Mist, as it originally represented the distance between worlds.</p><p></p><p>"D*mn it, it's getting harder to find undiscovered realms now."</p><p></p><p>For several days, Puxian Zhenzhou had been flying in the White Mist, passing through several realms, but the Tianjian Mirror had already recorded tips that were on file. Dongfang Yao couldn't help cursing.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song absentmindedly played with the Dissolving Disc in his hand and said, "It's normal. It's been almost a year since the Immortal Alliance issued the exploration order. With the number of Immortal Alliance cultivators, the surface part of the White Mist should have been explored quite thoroughly by now. If we want to make more discoveries, we must continue to delve deeper..."</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" Before Huangfu Song finished speaking, a loud bang was suddenly heard.</p><p></p><p>As if something had fallen from above and violently shook Puxian Zhenzhou for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously putting away the Dissolving Disc in his hand, Huangfu Song scanned with his divine sense and showed a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Because what collided with Puxian Zhenzhou in flight was the corpse of a cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from the clothes the body was wearing, it didn't come from a realm but from the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance!</p><p></p><p>The three on the ship instantly looked serious, thinking that perhaps there had been an accident resulting in the death of an Immortal Alliance cultivator. They immediately became vigilant.</p><p></p><p>But what happened next made Li Fan and the others couldn't help but show shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>First it was one or two sounds, then it became more and more frequent.</p><p></p><p>The continuous collision sounds were heard, and Puxian Zhenzhou was constantly shaking, and its protective light barrier seemed to become precarious in an instant.</p><p></p><p>While Huangfu Song reinforced it with spells, he looked at the scene outside with a pale face.</p><p></p><p>Overhead, the sky was densely covered with countless dead cultivation bodies falling like raindrops.</p><p></p><p>Some bodies were relatively intact, while others were already fragmented, with only limbs remaining.</p><p></p><p>However, without exception, there seemed to be a twisted, squirming black thread trace around the edges of their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally glimpsing their faces, they were not as hideous and terrifying as those seen in the realms, but instead had closed eyes and calm expressions.</p><p></p><p>The rain of bodies continued endlessly, as if it would never stop.</p><p></p><p>If they forcefully rushed out of the range covered by the rain of bodies, Puxian Zhenzhou might be damaged.</p><p></p><p>The three stopped the flying boat and used their hands to intercept the falling bodies attacking from above.</p><p></p><p>Although they were lifeless beings and not very threatening, this eerie scene still sent a shiver down their spines.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1040: The Secret of the Calamity Transcendence Book</p><p></p><p>In the gloomy hall, several thin lines crisscrossed overhead. </p><p></p><p>Numerous paper figures, seemingly identical at first glance but with subtle differences in facial expressions upon closer inspection, hung neatly on these thin lines.</p><p></p><p>The passage of time had caused these paper figures to appear faded, presenting a ghastly pale yellow hue.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's abrupt intrusion, countless paper figures swayed eerily without any wind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt that in an instant, the gazes of all these paper figures had gathered upon him.</p><p></p><p>As if bound by chains, Li Fan's soul suddenly lost its ability to move freely.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, slowly, these swaying paper figures became still once again.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on Li Fan gradually diminished as well.</p><p></p><p>When things returned to normal, Li Fan chose not to act recklessly. Because he vaguely sensed that there was still a gaze in the hall watching him that had not shifted away.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked in the direction of his intuition, only to see that something seemed to be hidden in the shadows ahead.</p><p></p><p>Like a venomous snake staring intently at its prey, ready to launch an attack at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Slowly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still chose not to act rashly, but quietly waited for that shadowy mass to continue approaching.</p><p></p><p>Responding to all changes with no change.</p><p></p><p>The approach of the shadow also brought increasing pressure to Li Fan with each passing moment.</p><p></p><p>The faint whispers in his ears also seemed to urge Li Fan to take action quickly.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who had discerned all the subtle changes around him, sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>During this period of still observation, he had already glimpsed the secret within.</p><p></p><p>The approaching shadow and the life-and-death pressure it brought were completely illusory.</p><p></p><p>It was meant to compel the one who entered the hall to attack the shadow.</p><p></p><p>And the true face of that shadowy mass was...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's field of vision suddenly changed, and the shadow receded. Revealing its true form: a rope full of countless holes and scars.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from it was all too familiar to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the prohibition left by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate!</p><p></p><p>"The Calamity Transcendence Sect is indeed not simple. Even the prohibition left by Dharma Transmission has been eroded to this extent."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I encountered the Calamity Transcendence Sect's testing methods on the mountain path and in the courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze over the countless paper figures in the hall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the paper figures all seemed to reveal eerie smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>And then they even transformed to show innocent expressions.</p><p></p><p>"But there are a bit too many paper figures."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself and released a wisp of spiritual power, trying to take down the paper figures hanging on the thin lines.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the spiritual power touched nothing.</p><p></p><p>The paper figures in the hall seemed to be completely illusory existences, as if they had no physical form.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan divided another thread of divine sense, wanting to make contact with the paper figures. But still could not reach them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Calamity Transcendence Sect's secret methods are needed to manipulate these paper figures."</p><p></p><p>"Destroy the prohibition here..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, and in a moment he had already changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>"No, I won't destroy it. On the contrary, I want to repair the prohibition here!"</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Transcendence Sect's style of doing things made Li Fan truly disgusted. Like a turtle hiding its head, choosing to merge with the Profound Yellow world to avoid calamities.</p><p></p><p>Relying entirely on a possible savior.</p><p></p><p>Although effective, it truly did not match the magnanimity that one of the Ten Immortal Sects should have.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Li...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Being inside the Crossing Calamity Sect, one always felt uncomfortable. It was as if there was a natural conflict, making it difficult to stand still and causing unease in the heart.</p><p></p><p>The soul fragment stood silently in the main hall, while the true self was outside the Crossing Calamity Sect, using the Dissociation Disk to reverse-deduce and break the formation.</p><p></p><p>With the previous experience as a lesson, it only took seven days to successfully deduce the formation used to repair the prohibition of the Dharma Transmission Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, in the gloomy main hall, suddenly made a move.</p><p></p><p>"Creation and destruction, different paths leading to the same destination. If I can successfully repair the Dharma Transmission prohibition, it means that there is no problem with the deduction of the Dharma Transmission prohibition. It can also be destroyed in the same way."</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if a seven-colored brush appeared in his hand, drawing in the air.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, the originally somewhat decayed rope in the center of the main hall slowly became lively again.</p><p></p><p>Light once again enveloped this gloomy hall.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's action seemed to enrage the countless paper figures hanging.</p><p></p><p>They shook violently again, their expressions turning to anger.</p><p></p><p>They stared intently at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a sound like ghosts wailing and gods howling echoed in Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let out a loud shout, not budging at all. Instead, he accelerated the restoration process.</p><p></p><p>The angry roars of the paper figures could not stop Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The rope representing the prohibition reappeared from the center of the main hall, extending all the way to the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>After a violent tremor, Li Fan was back outside the main hall.</p><p></p><p>It was still a spacious courtyard, but the main hall had shrunk to the size of a toy.</p><p></p><p>It was fixed in the center of the courtyard by the prohibition rope.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan could see the traces of the destroyed prohibition hidden in the dark.</p><p></p><p>The main hall kept shaking and tried to struggle.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were cold as he continued the restoration work.</p><p></p><p>After the prohibition in the small courtyard was restored, the scene changed, and Li Fan was back in front of the stone steps leading up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The prohibition here was the most complex.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately, the vast majority of it was still relatively intact. The only path up the mountain was the one that was damaged by the erosion of the Crossing Calamity Sect's power.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan filled in the gaps in the prohibition, the mountain path naturally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of him shrank again.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Crossing Calamity Sect finally revealed its original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Under layers of sealed prohibitions, a book unfolded from the middle.</p><p></p><p>The book had no words, only reliefs of mountains and cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As the book naturally flipped, the appearance inside also changed.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all in the form of silhouettes, looking ridiculous and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the book in front of him, Li Fan observed carefully for a long time, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The Crossing Calamity Sect was indeed exterminated by the Dharma Transmission back then."</p><p></p><p>"But this was exactly what they sought. Seeking life in death, the entire sect changed to another form of existence."</p><p></p><p>"This book..."</p><p></p><p>"It has a bit of the flavor of the Creation Stone Tablet. However, the Creation Stone Tablet records everything in the Xuanhuang Realm, while the Crossing Calamity Book in front of me only records the affairs within the Crossing Calamity Sect."</p><p></p><p>"That was originally the case. However, the people of the Crossing Calamity Sect have turned into paper figures, scattered throughout the Xuanhuang Realm. So they can also use the eyes of the paper figures to glimpse everything in the Xuanhuang Realm through this Crossing Calamity Book."</p><p></p><p>In the constantly flipping pages of fleeting images, Li Fan occasionally saw some familiar Xuanhuang scenes and pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan had actually achieved the purpose of his trip.</p><p></p><p>He had verified that there was no problem with the formation against the Dharma Transmission prohibition.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the Crossing Calamity Book in front of him, which was suppressed again by the power of the Dharma Transmission prohibition, Li Fan's thoughts couldn't help but become active again.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 428</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In every domain, there are distinctive characteristics that are completely different from other places.</p><p></p><p>His hometown is called the "Country of the Righteous."</p><p></p><p>It got its name because everyone inside is unable to tell lies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that is the self-proclaimed name of the people in the "Country of the Righteous".</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders and other cultivators from different regions prefer to call it the "Country of Truth".</p><p></p><p>However it is called, it does not affect its beautiful nature.</p><p></p><p>There, people always treat each other openly, always showing their true selves.</p><p></p><p>Although occasional conflicts are unavoidable, compared to the outside world filled with lies.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang loved his hometown very much.</p><p></p><p>To the north of the "Country of Truth" is the dreamland of countless cultivators, the "Land of No Worries".</p><p></p><p>As for the other three domains, when Zhou Qing'ang was selected to receive spy training, he was still young and didn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The derivative dream is about to collapse, Li Fan is repeating the dream again.</p><p></p><p>To ensure the accuracy of the information.</p><p></p><p>Repeated this three times.</p><p></p><p>Taking some physiological materials from Zhou Qing'ang's body, Li Fan began to use him as a template to refine a clone.</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p></p><p>A body exactly like Zhou Qing'ang appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, then replicated the process, activated a mysterious spirit technique, and turned himself into the appearance of Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>An eerie scene unfolded in this small underwater secret room with three identical bodies, each with a different expression.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful!" Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the still unconscious Zhou Qing'ang with a smile on his lips, a hint of strangeness flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, I won't kill you, so as not to expose any flaws."</p><p></p><p>"Forever indulging in the illusion, for you, may not be a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Using materials locally, Li Fan made a stone coffin for Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>After putting him in, he sprinkled a pile of spirit stones to maintain his vitality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then used the "Cloud and Water Mirage Dream" as the core and arranged a formation.</p><p></p><p>A illusion that could be maintained for at least twenty years.</p><p></p><p>He then sealed the stone coffin with a huge rock and buried it deep under the sea.</p><p></p><p>"This way, except for me, there should be no one else in the world who will find out that you have disappeared."</p><p></p><p>After finishing all the preparations, the clone returned to Tai'an Island to continue serving as the guardian of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The main body headed towards the memory of Zhou Qing'ang and the rendezvous point.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Zhou Qing'ang knew very little about his superior.</p><p></p><p>They had always communicated unidirectionally.</p><p></p><p>And after each rendezvous, the next meeting place would change.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arrived at a deserted island and searched around, finally finding an ordinary-looking stone.</p><p></p><p>But in a specific position, there were a few inconspicuous small holes.</p><p></p><p>These small holes represented the coordinates from the cloud sea.</p><p></p><p>Based on the coordinates, Li Fan calculated the location of this rendezvous.</p><p></p><p>After smashing the stone, he flew straight towards it.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>A seemingly ordinary broken stone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan covered it with his hands and activated a secret technique, causing his palms to emit a yellow light.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a faint yellow light emerged from the broken stone, swiftly scanning Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>After verification, the light returned to the broken stone.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the surface of the broken stone became as smooth as a mirror.</p><p></p><p>A blurry image of a person's face appeared in it.</p><p></p><p>"What's this? Didn't I tell you to stay hidden and not contact me recently?" The voice on the other side was cold, reprimanding.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then imitated Zhou Qing'ang's tone, saying, "Boss! This time I have important information to report, that's why I contacted you!"</p><p></p><p>"Important information?" The other party was obviously skeptical and in a bad mood, "Tell me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lowered his voice, leaning closer and said, "I made friends with a fellow Daoist who claims he can get the test questions for the upcoming Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance recruitment exam."</p><p></p><p>Initially skeptical, the person's face immediately criticised, "Another scam artist? Do you really believe such outrageous things? And you specifically reported to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang, oh Zhou Qing'ang, have you been in the Cloud Sea for too long that your brain is waterlogged?" Li Fan immediately put on a very aggrieved expression, "Boss, this time it's really true! I can guarantee it!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's earnest expression, the other party also began to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"How so?" They asked.</p><p></p><p>"My fellow Daoist has connections!" Li Fan said, "Have I not reported to you before? I met the guardian of the Lulijimaon Island, He Zhenghao. This person, like me, is only at the foundation-building stage. He complained to me not long ago that it's difficult to earn contribution points and he wants to change his cultivation method, but doesn't know how long it will take."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that in just a few days, he switched to the Yuan Infant cultivation method!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Such an unusual occurrence naturally caught my attention. It took me a lot of effort to inquire about it..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the person on the other end of the communication was intrigued by what Li Fan was saying.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their interest, Li Fan continued, "He Zhenghao has a daughter named He Xin Xin. Huh, actually, she should be called Heng Xin Xin!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Heng family of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance Tianyu Prefecture?" Li Fan asked, "The pride of the Heng family, Heng Ruoshui, is already a Yuan Infant weaving artist even though she is still very young. And she turned out to be He Zhenghao's lover!"</p><p></p><p>"Who would believe this?! But it's true!"</p><p></p><p>"Before, it seemed that because He Zhenghao's cultivation was too poor, he had to cut ties with the Heng family, so he was struggling."</p><p></p><p>"But recently, it seems that things have taken a turn."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused, then looked at the person's face and continued, "He Xin Xin is now an adult, and she is deeply saddened to see her old father in such a pitiful state, but she is afraid to help overtly in case her family finds out."</p><p></p><p>"So she had to find another way and quietly pass on the information she had overheard to He Zhenghao."</p><p></p><p>"With the help of his daughter, He Zhenghao has completely turned his situation around!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was excited and envious, "He got wind of the 'Wuguyao Stone' about to skyrocket in value, so he went all in and purchased it."</p><p></p><p>"After the price doubled, he immediately sold it."</p><p></p><p>"In just one transaction, he made tens of thousands of contribution points!"</p><p></p><p>"Tens of thousands! Boss! How many years of funding is that for me!"</p><p></p><p>"Fearing any rumors leaking out that could harm his daughter, He Zhenghao fabricated a lie claiming that he received guidance from an ancient Tianji Sect cultivator and spread it around."</p><p></p><p>"Heh! Treating us like idiots!"</p><p></p><p>"Boss, fortunately, I was astute. I pestered him in every possible way and finally squeezed the truth out of him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan proudly recounted his achievements.</p><p></p><p>"The source of the leaked test questions for the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance recruitment exam this time also came from He Xin Xin."</p><p></p><p>"Boss, do you think it's reliable?"</p><p></p><p>The figure on the broken stone did not get angry this time but remained silent, seeming to be searching for something.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the voice on the other end came through.</p><p></p><p>"Heng Ruoshui indeed has a daughter, but the father's identity has always been a mystery."</p><p></p><p>"However, many years ago, she returned home with a young man. But soon after, this young man disappeared without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see his face..."</p><p></p><p>The person on the other end was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"There's also this..."</p><p></p><p>"Before the 'Wuguyao Stone' skyrocketed, there were unusual trade records. Someone was heavily buying, then selling at a high point."</p><p></p><p>"The timing was just too perfect, making it hard to believe they didn't know the inside information in advance."</p><p></p><p>"The buyer was... He Zhenghao!"</p><p></p><p>A loud noise similar to a table being slapped came from the other side.</p><p></p><p>"So, it's likely that the leaked test questions for the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance recruitment exam are real?"</p><p></p><p>The other party's breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded continuously, "That's why I rushed to find you, Boss! The recruitment exam is just around the corner."</p><p></p><p>"If we can get the test questions before that..."</p><p></p><p>"We can secure more key positions in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>The other party clearly understood the seriousness of the matter and quickly asked, "What did he say?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan seemed to be hesitating.</p><p></p><p>Stammering, he said, "Boss, this time, He Zhenghao is asking for quite a high price..."</p><p></p><p>Angry, the other party scolded, "Just say it! It's just a few spirit stones, how can that compare to the recruitment exam questions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gestured with his hands, "How much does he want?"</p><p></p><p>"Fifty thousand contribution points? That's not unreasonable..." the other party began.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly shook his head, interrupting, "No, it's five million."</p><p></p><p>The other party froze.</p><p></p><p>"Five million? Is he out of his mind?!" his voice trembled.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the other party realized something.</p><p></p><p>Their face darkened, and a hint of killing intent appeared in their voice, "Have you been exposed?!"</p><p></p><p>"Facing a mere individual, just a foundation-building cultivator, he definitely wouldn't offer such an outrageous price."</p><p></p><p>The image on the broken stone fluctuated, as if it could disappear at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The other party stared at Li Fan, waiting for his response.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was somewhat speechless, saying, "Boss, do you really think I'm so unprofessional in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>"I just told him that I also have people behind me."</p><p></p><p>"Who in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance isn't there due to connections?"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Boss, even if He Zhenghao suspects something, he won't connect it to me being a spy."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, He Zhenghao is just casting a wide net. He knows the risks of selling test questions, so he's only doing it with one party."</p><p></p><p>"He limits it to less than ten people who know the questions and will participate in the recruitment exam."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Listening to Li Fan's explanation, the other party gradually eased up.</p><p></p><p>The image on the broken stone became clear again, and after a careful analysis, the other party said, "Fifty thousand per person is a bit high in cost, but still acceptable."</p><p></p><p>"However, the amount is huge. If the test questions He Zhenghao provides turn out to be fake..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was unconcerned, "He said that before the recruitment exam, there are seven days. He can give us the first day's question for free. After confirming its accuracy, we can proceed with the final transaction."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other party couldn't help but be stirred with excitement.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 567</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The specific appearance of the Taixiu beast, whether it is truly like a turtle as rumored, has become unverifiable. With a specific name, it became much easier to search for related information.</p><p></p><p>Although mostly fragmented, it can be confirmed that in the distant ancient times, the Taixiu beast existed as a kind of "totem," seemingly closely related to some kind of belief.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself, "The Taixiu beast should belong to the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"In the war during the downfall of the Xuantian Sect by the ten major sects of the Immortal Dao, the Taixiu beast fell and turned into the Nine Mountains."</p><p></p><p>"Sister Zhao once said that the Xuantian Sect stole the power of the heavens, being able to bestow 'imprints' upon ordinary people, granting them various abilities possessed by cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"If it can bestow, it can naturally also take away."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps on the battlefield of Tianlingzhou, those cultivators targeted by the green light lost their ability to fly due to this reason, causing them to fall from the sky."</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, the Xuan Network in my memory hardly displayed this ability of 'deprivation.' Often, the extermination of resisting cultivators required the intervention of the black-robed 'Celestial Artificers.'"</p><p></p><p>"More powerful in monitoring, granting, and so on."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Li Fan furrowed his brow again in deep thought, "Tianxuan Locking Spirit, Xuantian Sealing Spirit; perhaps they are just two sides of the same coin representing the power of the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'bestowing' and 'deprivation,' in fact, both involve taking the power of the heavens and using the authority granted by the heavens."</p><p></p><p>Thinking up to this point, Li Fan took out a blank encrypted jade slip, his mind slightly channeling the Dao Stone.</p><p></p><p>The array structure diagram of the "Heavenly Xuan Locking Spirit Formation" that he was familiar with in the previous life was all inscribed on the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan made some slight modifications, deliberately omitting the intricate structure of the central core formation.</p><p></p><p>It took almost half a day to complete the transcription of the formation diagram.</p><p></p><p>Holding the jade slip in his hand, his expression fluctuating, Li Fan muttered to himself, "The victory at Tianlingzhou seems to be in favor of the Wanxian Alliance. However, all the apparent advantages are actually false."</p><p></p><p>"The immortals from the Five Elders Council refrained from acting only because of the initial agreement made for the transmission of knowledge."</p><p></p><p>"In truth, the transmission Celestial Masters have already..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought that the transmission Celestial Masters had left the Xuanhuang Realm. Once this fact was exposed, it would be almost impossible for the Wanxian Alliance to resist with the strength of the five immortal elders. Disclosing the Locking Spirit Formation array diagram to the Five Elders Council might lead to a rapid collapse of the Wanxian Alliance, exposing the truth of his external strength.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly realized the fallacy in his understanding.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, it was after anchoring for 41 years, and after Sister Zhao's probing, that it was ultimately confirmed that the transmission Celestial Masters had already departed.</p><p></p><p>But no one knew exactly when the transmission had left.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some clues could be glimpsed from the plan of the Wanxian Alliance's full-scale popularization of the Heavenly Xuan Locking Spirit Formation set in the anchoring of 24 years.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Li Fan, when they, as various array masters, were undergoing training, the Wanxian Alliance was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the Wanxian Alliance itself had not realized the departure of the transmission, or perhaps...</p><p></p><p>The departure of the transmission Celestial Masters had truly not yet occurred at that time.</p><p></p><p>"Should I stir up some waves and probe a bit?" </p><p></p><p>For a moment, Li Fan couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, he ultimately abandoned the decision for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The main goal of this life was still centered around building the Yuanying Stage.</p><p></p><p>Only after the Wanxian Alliance's victory at Tianlingzhou, the migration of the Five Elements Grand Cavern to another location, would Li Fan have the chance to explore the mysterious void constantly nurturing the Five Elements Grand Caverns.</p><p></p><p>If the Wanxian Alliance was defeated and annihilated, leaving no survivors, Li Fan would have no space for free movement.</p><p></p><p>"But we cannot entirely relieve the pressure on the Wanxian Alliance. Otherwise, if the Five Elders Council continues to lose in battles, the Wanxian Alliance might feel invincible against the opposition, not even needing to relocate the Five Elements Grand Cavern. That would be somewhat embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Li Fan crushed the encrypted jade slip in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He took out another blank one and started transcribing again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he omitted the central part of the formation diagram, retaining only the structure of the peripheral formation area.</p><p></p><p>"As they say, seeing the micro-differences leads to understanding. The Five Elders Council surely lacks array talents, and by revealing only part of the formation to them, completely deciphering the Locking Spirit Formation may not be achievable."</p><p></p><p>"However, countering it should not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>After painstakingly completing his masterpiece, Li Fan, with a shimmer in his eyes, stored the encrypted jade slip in a solitary storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan met with the spy from the Five Elders Council again.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhou, what's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Fan appeared, he couldn't wait to ask.</p><p></p><p>"We managed to obtain the diagram." Li Fan directly stated.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Five Elders Council was momentarily stunned, then his face lit up with disbelief and joy.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan quickly poured cold water on his enthusiasm, "But we only have the external structure diagram of the formation..."</p><p></p><p>"It can only serve as a reference for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council cultivator seemed a bit disappointed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly regained his spirit.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining the original external structure diagram of the formation was already a great achievement.</p><p></p><p>This was a more reasonable and expected outcome.</p><p></p><p>After all, the high level of confidentiality surrounding the "Xuantian Sealing Spirit Formation" placed it among the top secrets of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council suffered losses as several deeply hidden spies failed to gather any relevant information.</p><p></p><p>Facing a person who could provide comprehensive information and readily agree to it, suspicions naturally arose, hinting at the possibility of a trap or even the person being the transmission Celestial Masters themselves.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, having the original diagram is also great."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Five Elders Council, full of anticipation, looked at Li Fan, "What conditions do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone turned serious, "The value of the formation diagram, I believe you are well aware of. I won't say more, as it's simply immeasurable in terms of contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"However, our request is straightforward."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze was deep and unpredictable, showing a mysterious expression, "You, the Five Elders Council, need to cooperate with us in certain necessary situations."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council spy was startled for a moment, then frowned, "What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer directly, continuing, "With the power of the 'contract,' I trust you won't renege."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we won't make any particularly excessive demands."</p><p></p><p>"At crucial moments, in at most a state's territory, we might need the support of the Five Elders Council."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council spy fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Just a moment."</p><p></p><p>He turned away, closed his eyes, seemingly seeking counsel from a higher authority.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he turned back, already sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>"We agree to this deal."</p><p></p><p>There will also be another chapter updated tomorrow before noon. It's a bit busy in these last days of the year.</p><p></p><p>Just past it.</p>

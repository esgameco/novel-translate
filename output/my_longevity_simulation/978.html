        <h1>Chapter 978</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The "Thread Pulling" divine ability was comprehended by Li Fan when he was transformed into a thread-like tiny person within the "Root of Heaven and Earth". Tracing back to the origin, returning to the primordial state of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's vision, the horizontal and vertical threads weaving the Creation Stone Tablet became increasingly dense.</p><p></p><p>This also signified that this supreme treasure of heaven and earth was about to be fully formed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan guided the threads extracted from Sima Changkong, attempting to connect them with the Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan wasn't entirely confident about this matter, as it was his first time seeing the real Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>However, it would be a true pity to just watch it disappear right before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Might as well give it a try!</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan a little was that when Sima Changkong's transformed threads were about to approach, without deliberate manipulation, the stone tablet seemed to exert a pulling force.</p><p></p><p>The threads rapidly tightened and were continuously drawn into the threads weaving the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Just like a ball of thread being unraveled in an instant, Sima Changkong's body completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>And the flickering stone tablet also seemed to be tainted with a bit of dust.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan retreated slightly to a safe position with vigilant mind, carefully observing.</p><p></p><p>Fallen leaves return to their roots, ripe fruits fall to the ground. When the stone tablet was recreated by heaven and earth once again, there were no unusual phenomena appearing in the surroundings. The rustic, grayish-green stone tablet showed no traces of being an extraordinary treasure. It floated quietly in the air.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the guidance of Sima Changkong's transformed threads, the Creation Stone Tablet did not go to other places.</p><p></p><p>It still remained here in the small mountain temple, seemingly indicating that Li Fan's attempt had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>But what Li Fan found a bit strange was that Sima Changkong did not appear.</p><p></p><p>He just disappeared like that, or perhaps...</p><p></p><p>"Merged with the Creation Stone Tablet?" Li Fan speculated.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was still secretly observing, new changes occurred on the Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed blood-red symbols suddenly emerged on the stone tablet, and then these symbols flowed like fresh blood, turning into thin streams.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the blood characters increased, and the thin streams gradually turned into surging rivers.</p><p></p><p>Covering the entire stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling red light burst out in an instant. When Li Fan looked again, he found that the whole stone tablet was actually flipped up like a book page, hovering outside the stone tablet!</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>The changes on the stone tablet continued.</p><p></p><p>Page after page of stone tablets filled with blood-colored symbols flipped like paper, faster and faster. The stone tablet itself also became thinner and thinner. Finally, when the complete transformation was finished.</p><p></p><p>A stone book emitting a faint blood-golden light appeared before Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous Creation Stone Tablet, this stone book had a bit more of a sacred and ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>The anomalies gradually subsided, and the light emitted by the stone book slowly internalized.</p><p></p><p>Calmly suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that from now on, there will no longer be the existence of the Sima family's 'Blood Lineage Book' in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, it is the 'Creation History Book' before our eyes."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a long time, Li Fan had a subtle feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that with Sima Changkong's strength, it is not enough to become a qualified vessel like Senior Stone Tablet. But by a twist of fate, the Blood Lineage Book within his body had a quite peculiar impact on the Creation Stone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, perhaps, this is still intentionally facilitated by the Dao of Heaven in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the Creation History Book for a long time, Li Fan secretly</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>With the birth of the Book of Genesis, the space filled with nothingness was replenished. The originally pitch-black area of desolation was restored to normal.</p><p></p><p>However, just like the previous fishing pool, under normal circumstances, cultivators simply could not see this Book of Genesis.</p><p></p><p>Except for existences like Li Fan who personally witnessed its birth, one would need a certain opportunity to have the fortune of catching a glimpse of it.</p><p></p><p>Walking slowly to the front of the Book of Genesis, the scene before Li Fan's eyes suddenly became clear.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored long river descended from the sky like a waterfall, occupying Li Fan's entire field of vision.</p><p></p><p>In that long river, Li Fan vaguely saw countless rapidly changing scenes.</p><p></p><p>Just a slight glance caused Li Fan to feel a bit of dizziness and he was forced to look away.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Book of Genesis itself has a protective existence, preventing the peeping of external living beings."</p><p></p><p>After resting for a moment, Li Fan looked towards the blood-colored long river again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he only took a macro overview without focusing on the details in the long river.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the accumulation of dizziness that followed was much weaker. In this exploration, Li Fan made new discoveries.</p><p></p><p>This blood-colored long river was constantly being generated and endlessly lengthening.</p><p></p><p>Those were the things that were happening in the Xuanhuang Realm at this very moment.</p><p></p><p>From a visual perception, Li Fan only felt that he was being washed by the blood-colored long river, getting farther and farther away from the source of the long river.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to see the surrounding things clearly, he could still manage by opening his eyes wide.</p><p></p><p>But if he wanted to gaze into the distance and peek at the end of the long river, he would have to withstand the strong pressure that accumulated all the way upstream.</p><p></p><p>Being in the blood-colored long river, it didn't take long for Li Fan to feel a moment of mental fatigue.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had experienced a reincarnation in a short period of time, and he inexplicably felt an urge to take a short rest.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately became vigilant and temporarily withdrew from the blood-colored long river.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Only then did he discover that, unknowingly, a strand of white hair had appeared on his head.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously looked at the [Haozhen] panel.</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p></p><p>Realm: Mid-stage Yuan Ying</p><p></p><p>Physiological Age: 63/599</p><p></p><p>Psychological Age: 1379/9999</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Now that it's only anchored for 13 years, the physiological age should be 32. It's actually already 63..."</p><p></p><p>"The psychological age hasn't changed, it seems that the protection of the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra has taken effect."</p><p></p><p>"It looks like the Book of Genesis is indeed not something that mortals can peek at."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, "It's not just the issue of accelerating aging."</p><p></p><p>"Since the opening of heaven and earth in the Xuanhuang Realm, all the information has been stored in it. That blood-colored long river is really too vast and rapid. If one really wants to find the required information from it, how to locate the key time nodes is an even more difficult problem."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I'm afraid one would die of old age before finding the desired target."</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"Those with longevity equal to heaven and earth, or a sufficiently large group that does not fear life and death, could launch an exploration of different nodes of the blood-colored long river. Each time bringing back some useful information, it could slowly complete the history like a jigsaw puzzle."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed slightly, "It seems that it's still a bit of a fantasy. An extraordinary object that can create longevity, how could it be so easily grasped?"</p><p></p><p>"However, now that the Book of Genesis is fixed here, it is a huge opportunity for me."</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>There are still about two chapters left to complete the update.</p>

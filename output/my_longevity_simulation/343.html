        <h1>Chapter 343</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan felt as if he had forgotten something extremely important.</p><p></p><p>His brows furrowed tightly as his mind raced with thoughts.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard he tried, he simply could not recall any memories related to it.</p><p></p><p>Even searching through the storage in the Huadao stone crystal in his mind was to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this cultivation technique of mine..." Li Fan suddenly realized something, and his expression couldn't help but turn a bit unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Extreme Immortal Venerable offered a reward of longevity treasures, with the opportunity to use the Yan Fa Jue as the prize. The 'Marvelous True Spirit Transformation' should have been derived from the Yan Fa Jue."</p><p></p><p>"I have always been cautious in my actions, so it's impossible for me to personally take such risks. Therefore, I must have created a clone at that time to handle this matter."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"How could I have completely no recollection of it?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this another trick of that Venerable who makes people forget calamities?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes in deep thought and tried to recall once more, but still to no effect.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Li Fan opened his eyes, a pensive expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than saying I forgot, it's more like the experiences of the clone have been completely erased."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, there would be no traces left of something that never happened in the first place."</p><p></p><p>"Just what could it be?"</p><p></p><p>The fear of the unknown almost made Li Fan want to immediately "return to truth" to rid himself of this influence and investigate thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>But he forcibly restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, I should first record this matter. Perhaps after this world ends, I can recall at the Jielishan Peak just what disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"However, this method of making things vanish from memory without notice is truly difficult to guard against. To avoid forgetting about this in the future, I need to record it in advance." With this thought, Li Fan prepared to find a blank jade slip from his storage ring to record the matter of his forgetting.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What's this?" But suddenly, he discovered three jade slips placed separately in the corner of his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"When did I put these there? How come I have no impression of it at all?" Li Fan was slightly stunned, then his heart stirred and he took out the jade slips to examine them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, one of the jade slips was completely blank with nothing recorded on it.</p><p></p><p>Of the other two jade slips, one only had the character "Dao" written on it.</p><p></p><p>The other jade slip only had the character "Yuan" written.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yuan? Yuan Dao? What does it mean?" Li Fan felt this term seemed very familiar, but he couldn't recall where he had seen it before.</p><p></p><p>As if shrouded by a layer of dark clouds, Li Fan's mood couldn't help but turn a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>"There's no use overthinking it at this time." After more than half a day, Li Fan finally shook off the infection of this powerful negative emotion.</p><p></p><p>He recorded in detail on that blank jade slip the situation of his clone clearly existing yet being unable to perceive it and even forgetting certain things.</p><p></p><p>Then he carefully placed the three jade slips back in their original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Although I can't recall what exactly happened for now, judging from these three jade slips I prepared as hints, I was aware of this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I just incorrectly estimated the impact when it truly occurred, causing all these preparations to lose effect."</p><p></p><p>"If we use 'it' to refer to that unknown event, then could it be deduced that..."</p><p></p><p>"After it happened, not only the memories involving it, but even all records related to it, would be unable to be retained."</p><p></p><p>After calming down, Li Fan carefully pondered and vaguely deduced some clues.</p><p></p><p>"Since I made preparations, it means its influence didn't exist from the start of the anchor year. Then, at least after I return to truth, I should be able to understand what happened."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan felt slightly more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Although it seems quite incredible upon first discovery, I've grown used to the dangers of this realm, so I actually find it a bit natural." Li Fan shook his head and mocked himself.</p><p></p><p>Despite the unexpected situation, Li Fan didn't forget the purpose of leaving the city this time.</p><p></p><p>To test the effects of the "Marvelous True Spirit Transformation" technique.</p><p></p><p>He settled his thoughts and gradually expelled the distracting notions from his mind, activating the True Spirit Transformation.</p><p></p><p>A power that was completely different from spiritual energy, yet seemed to take it as a foundation, instantly surged forth from his meridians, spreading throughout his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of this profound and immeasurable power, Li Fan felt as if countless ants were drilling all over his body, an unbearable pain and itch.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the discomfort in his heart, Li Fan continued to circulate the technique, wanting to achieve his first random transformation after mastering it.</p><p></p><p>The pain and itch kept accumulating.</p><p></p><p>Every part of his body also grew increasingly scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan felt like every bone in his body was about to melt, he suddenly felt a relaxation throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>All the discomfort vanished in an instant, as if he had changed into a completely new body...</p><p></p><p>No, he had indeed changed into a new body.</p><p></p><p>It was a face he had never seen before, and the height, bearing, and the ineffable feeling it gave at first glance were all vastly different from Li Fan's original self.</p><p></p><p>If not for the fact that every move of the person in the mirror corresponded with Li Fan's own...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan would have found it hard to believe that was himself.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he circulated the technique again.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, another face appeared in the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept transforming as if he had obtained a beloved toy that he couldn't put down.</p><p></p><p>As he grew more and more familiar, the time needed for each transformation also decreased.</p><p></p><p>Later on, he could complete the transformation in just a single breath.</p><p></p><p>"The True Spirit Hundred Transformations is indeed profoundly marvelous. In my view, it's already approaching a divine ability!" Li Fan couldn't help but sigh after finishing his test.</p><p></p><p>He had only just begun cultivating this marvelous technique.</p><p></p><p>So the transformed identities only had the cultivation of the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>However, he had already grasped all of its essence, and what remained was only an accumulation of practice over time.</p><p></p><p>With the Huadao Divine One's skill of dividing the mind for multiple purposes, he believed he could quickly raise the True Spirit Transformation to match his own Golden Core stage cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the secret chamber that had been turned into a complete mess, Li Fan used the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword to erase all traces.</p><p></p><p>Then he quietly returned to Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>With the thought of giving it a try, Li Fan searched for information related to the terms "Dao Yuan" and "Yuan Dao" in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>As expected...</p><p></p><p>After browsing for a long time, he didn't find any targets worth suspecting, only some ordinary snippets.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I can only put this matter aside for now."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt helpless in his heart and could only give up.</p><p></p><p>"It's already the middle of the 29th anchor year. The one-year preparation period for the widespread Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation plan is up. I'm sure before long, I will receive a summons from Ji Hongdao."</p><p></p><p>"Following him to set up the soul-locking formation for the grotto-heaven, I'm afraid I won't have much freedom for a long time to come."</p><p></p><p>"However, I have a hidden piece - the daughter of the Wanxian Alliance's chief formation master. Perhaps at a critical moment, she can play a wondrous effect."</p>

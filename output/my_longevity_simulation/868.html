            <p>The words of the Stone Plate Fisherman frightened Liuli and Lin Ling, their faces turning pale. (New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also had a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Every moment, being forced to accept countless information. Seeking death but unable to attain it...</p><p></p><p>This was indeed an extremely painful thing.</p><p></p><p>"If we really find a way to sever the connection between the Stone Plate and the senior from this fishing pond, will the senior die?" After a moment of silence in the small temple, Li Fan mustered up the courage to ask.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman chuckled lightly, still facing the pond water, his tone ethereal: "I'm living too tiredly, I want to live more easily. It's not that I don't want to live anymore."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan understood.</p><p></p><p>After the Stone Plate Fisherman finished speaking, he closed his eyes, looking like he didn't want to be disturbed. So Li Fan brought Zhong Shentong and Liuli into the small temple.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, that person is..." Zhong Shentong asked uneasily.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing too much is not good for you. Just be careful in serving by his side. If that person can casually give a few pointers, it would be a great fortune for you," Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then looked at Lin Ling: "In the future, the things the senior fishes up will be kept by you. I will come to collect them regularly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Li Fan's gaze fell on little Liuli. </p><p></p><p>This little Liuli had a mysterious background. She was fished up by Zhong Shentong from the fishing pond, formed from a transparent fruit. A Golden Light level creation, at least above the Unifying Dao level, absolutely not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>However, the details were still unclear at present. (New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com) But a little Daoist child with no schemes, Li Fan had plenty of ways to control her.</p><p></p><p>Showing a kind face, Li Fan gently instructed Liuli that the Stone Plate Fisherman senior was a very good person and there was no need to fear him. </p><p></p><p>She could accompany him to fish when there was nothing to do.</p><p></p><p>Little Liuli didn't dare to reply, only nodding dully.</p><p></p><p>"With Stone Plate senior stationed here, the fishing pond will be worry-free. It can be considered a blessing in disguise," Li Fan secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>As for the leaking of the secret of the fishing pond, Li Fan appeared very helpless on the surface.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, deep in his heart, he didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>For him, the only secret that could not be coveted by outsiders...</p><p></p><p>Was only [Huan Zhen].</p><p></p><p>If the existence of [Huan Zhen] was ever exposed, then even if the situation before him seemed peaceful...</p><p></p><p>He would have to immediately use Huan Zhen.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's bottom line.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman sat upright by the small pond, fishing all night.</p><p></p><p>Motionless, like a withered statue.</p><p></p><p>Making Li Fan a little surprised. </p><p></p><p>"As long as they take the bait, they are all good fish. In my eyes, there is no distinction."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the quality of what can help me sever the shackles of the Creation Stone Plate may not necessarily be high."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman lazily explained a few sentences. (New 69 Book Bar 87shux.com)</p><p></p><p>But it was better than not explaining.</p><p></p><p>It involved the other party's deepest secret, so Li Fan didn't ask more.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he turned to ask the other party about methods to conceal the seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>After all, the seven-colored Jade Void Flowing Light was too extraordinary. The trinity of offense, defense and escape, if it couldn't be used at will, it would really be a bit of a waste of heavenly gifts.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Plate Fisherman was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>As if pondering.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that there's no way."</p><p></p><p>After a while, he gave the answer: "The reason the seven-colored divine light was seen through by me at a glance is precisely because its unique fluctuations are too conspicuous. Just like black</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Like the only beam of light in the darkness."</p><p></p><p>"But if the wielder of the Seven-Colored Divine Light, which is you, can emit fluctuations no weaker than the Seven-Colored Divine Light, you can suppress its traces. Just like a beam of light naturally blends into the environment during the day."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan felt a sense of speechlessness.</p><p></p><p>To be on the same level as the Seven-Colored Divine Light, which was refined using the Heavenly Light Origin of a cultivation world as raw material, one would need to be at least above the Harmonious Dao realm, right?</p><p></p><p>If he had this level of strength, why would he need to hide it?</p><p></p><p>As if he had seen through Li Fan's thoughts, Shi Ban Yufu turned his head and glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>"Others might not be able to do it. But you're different."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart tightened once again.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you break through to the Nascent Soul stage after swallowing the [Five Elements Primordial Grotto-Heaven]?"</p><p></p><p>"That thing can actually be considered half a cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban Yufu's words caused Li Fan to be slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't think that every cultivation world is like the Xuanhuang World. In ancient times, among the many lower realms, Xuanhuang was definitely considered one of the larger ones."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention now."</p><p></p><p>Although he had long anticipated this in his heart, Li Fan still appeared overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the secret methods of the [First Origin Sect], who would have thought that thousands of years later, a Golden Core junior would pluck the peach." Shi Ban Yufu seemed to recall something and let out a series of low laughs.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked on with curiosity, and Shi Ban Yufu explained without minding.</p><p></p><p>"When the great calamity first arrived, each sect had their own countermeasures. This First Origin Sect found the root of the Xuanhuang world, and forcibly nurtured the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven using secret techniques."</p><p></p><p>"According to them, the Dao of the Xuanhuang world had already been eroded and reversed, and it was beyond saving. Rather than directly abandoning it, it was better to extract its essence and use the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven as an embryonic form to derive a new world within it!"</p><p></p><p>"Just like a mother giving birth to a child."</p><p></p><p>"The idea was good, but unfortunately, people were still struggling to survive. Let alone the Dao of Heaven?" Shi Ban Yufu laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>"As soon as the action began, someone came knocking on their door, forcing them to stop."</p><p></p><p>Although he was very curious about who exactly stopped the First Origin Sect's plan, Li Fan saw that the other party had no intention of saying and could only suppress his curiosity.</p><p></p><p>After saying so much, Shi Ban Yufu seemed a little tired.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was good at reading the situation, decisively retreated.</p><p></p><p>On the third day.</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban Yufu fished up a purple light sphere.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Instead of directly throwing it to Lin Ling, he examined it carefully with interest.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter, Senior?" Li Fan hurriedly stepped forward and asked.</p><p></p><p>Shi Ban Yufu did not answer, but as if he had discovered something extremely interesting.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the pond in front of him in a trance.</p><p></p><p>Motionless.</p><p></p><p>As if petrified, it lasted for a full seven days.</p><p></p><p>During these seven days, Li Fan never left.</p><p></p><p>Following Shi Ban Yufu's line of sight, he also looked over, trying to learn.</p><p></p><p>He attempted to comprehend the reason why the other party's mind was suddenly attracted.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious.</p><p></p><p>But even though he couldn't see anything, Li Fan still put on a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>"You saw it too?"</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, one evening, Shi Ban Yufu suddenly woke up from his silence.</p><p></p><p>"This junior is slow-witted and couldn't see anything profound." Li Fan spoke truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"I only feel that this fishing pond is full of mysteries and may greatly benefit me."</p>

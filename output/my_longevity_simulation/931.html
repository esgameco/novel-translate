        <h1>Chapter 931</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The mighty spiritual power was continuously being transmitted into the body of Li Qing's avatar. </p><p></p><p>However, the body that should have healed quickly was instead becoming more and more broken during the rebirth process.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the pain was extracting the bones and sucking out the soul.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the pain coming from the avatar, even Li Fan couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that there was an extremely strange force lurking around the wound, preventing it from healing.</p><p></p><p>This force would not disappear with the destruction of the flesh, but instead, like a maggot in the bone, it penetrated towards the foundation of the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a premonition in his heart that if left unchecked, it was even very likely that the avatar's "Heavenly Wonder" cave would be eroded.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Patrolling Heaven Arrow wasn't this powerful before, as if it was specially designed to target the cultivators of the new method."</p><p></p><p>"Not only has the quantity expanded many times, but the lethality has also been enhanced..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the increasing number of Patrolling Heaven Arrows in the sky of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, Li Fan's heart rarely surged with waves of uneasiness.</p><p></p><p>Because in his view, although these Patrolling Heaven Arrows were individual entities, they might not be unable to form a huge array covering the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Using points to cover the surface, weaving a huge net that covers the sky.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Profound Net that Li Fan had encountered before.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Fan started to use the ability of the Ultimate Dissociation Disc to make deductions.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, the calculation results of the Dissociation Disc confirmed the feasibility of Li Fan's speculation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also thought of the brand new protective array encountered by the avatar when it returned.</p><p></p><p>It could almost be certain that the Myriad Immortals Alliance had been brewing a big event recently. It was just a matter of when it would suddenly be revealed, giving the Five Elders Association a surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has something to do with that Mo Rubin who took over as the inheritor."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly, and countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he still decided to put it aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The most pressing matter at present was to heal the avatar first.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wonder had formed the foundation, and it was not easy to come by. If it was destroyed so easily, it would be a bit of a pity.</p><p></p><p>During the period when the avatar went to the Five Elders Association, Li Fan had been in seclusion in the secret room of the Spirit Wood Realm, working hard to study the "Patching Heaven Record".</p><p></p><p>Combined with the "Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture" and the various materials collected during multiple reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>At this point, it could be said that Li Fan had initially gained insight into the Dao of "Medicine".</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the level of initial insight was compared to that of a Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Compared with the common healers in the Profound Yellow Realm, Li Fan's level was far superior, almost completely crushing them.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the lifelong experience of the Heavenly Doctor as the theoretical foundation, it would be a difficult task to become a mediocre doctor instead.</p><p></p><p>"The defeat of a deity requires first weakening their soul and supplementing it with injuries..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the contents of the Patching Heaven Record, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>Then with a light wave, all these silver needles pierced into the broken body of Li Qing's avatar and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The avatar, which was still resisting the pain and twitching, fell into a deep sleep in an instant.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much pain there was, it could no longer be felt, as if it had already died.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a moment with bated breath, Li Fan's mind moved: "Swiftly!"</p><p></p><p>In a flash, all these silver needles returned.</p><p></p><p>They lined up in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The originally silver-white needle bodies had turned completely gray in this short period of time.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some kind of poison had been absorbed along the tip of the array.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the divine soul power within these silver needles, his own power.</p><p></p><p>After discovering that it was tainted by this dark poison, the divine soul power quickly subsided as if directly transformed.</p><p></p><p>"The potency is impressive."</p><p></p><p>"However, compared to the [Disease] I saw in Han Zhong before, it's still more than a notch weaker."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this dark power only dissipates the divine soul. With my Infinite Void-Filling Technique, even if the divine soul is consumed, it can be quickly replenished."</p><p></p><p>"Whereas that otherworldly disease directly affects the upper limit of the divine soul."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan's hands did not stop moving.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the silver needles continuously flew into Li Qing's body, then brought out the incessantly eroding dark power.</p><p></p><p>As the culprit disappeared, Li Qing's complexion also slowly improved.</p><p></p><p>As for this drawn-out dark power, Li Fan temporarily sealed and preserved it all using seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>Researching it in the future might bring some surprises.</p><p></p><p>The treatment took a full incense stick of time.</p><p></p><p>When he was certain that even the last bit of dark power had been eliminated, Li Fan finally let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The Patching Heaven Record is indeed extraordinary. With a small test, it solved the killing weapon that the Myriad Immortals Alliance is still experimenting with."</p><p></p><p>The principle of this treatment is also simple.</p><p></p><p>It suppresses the divine soul activity of the avatar Li Qing, and then the silver needles inject their own divine soul power into it as bait.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to complete the treatment without causing divine soul damage to the patient requires the healer to have extremely high divine soul attainments.</p><p></p><p>If the one being treated wasn't his own avatar, whom Li Fan was familiar with to the utmost, and if he didn't have the Infinite Void-Filling Technique to endlessly replenish the divine soul, the treatment wouldn't be so easy.</p><p></p><p>Some time later, Li Qing slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>The first sentence she said was: "The Patrolling Heaven Arrow's lock-on wasn't bad luck. There must have been some mark left on me when I broke through the protective formation."</p><p></p><p>"That's why I was attacked by the Patrolling Heaven Arrow."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly: "I thought of this point too."</p><p></p><p>"That new formation indeed has some tricks. Although it looks not particularly difficult to crack on the surface, thinking about it now, it deliberately exposed the flaws."</p><p></p><p>"It's like bait. When a formation master follows the exposed flaws and seemingly breaks the formation, a mark has already been quietly triggered."</p><p></p><p>"Using this mark, combined with the ubiquitous Patrolling Heaven Arrows now in the Myriad Immortals Alliance's territory, is enough to carry out a post-attack kill."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Lu Xichuan's return is still somewhat useful. Without some skill, one really can't think of this kind of formation that appears to be protective but is actually a trap," Li Fan said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing also sighed: "Fortunately, I have the Heaven's Unique Dao foundation, my flesh and blood integrated with the Sword Dao Law. So even if bloodstains are left behind, I don't fear being tracked. If it were an ordinary cultivator, even if they didn't die under the Patrolling Heaven Arrow, the Myriad Immortals Alliance could still pursue them from a thousand miles away based on the cultivator's blood stained on the arrow."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, let's lie low for a while. The Myriad Immortals Alliance has prepared so many hidden cards, it seems they are going to make a big move. We'll just wait and see." Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Then with a point between her brows, the silvery light containing the Mysterious Heaven Sect's techniques flew out from her mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very cautious and did not directly observe it with his true body.</p><p></p><p>Instead, as the avatar was reading, through cognitive synchronization, he recorded the contents of the techniques one by one in the true body's mind.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1073: The Great Celestial Venerable of Xuanhuang</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, Feng Rui and the others were indeed possessed by someone before. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"However, this possession technique is quite peculiar. It can actually return the body to its original owner."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang frowned as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also pondered: "But where there is existence, there must be traces left behind. After all, during the time of possession, it still had an irreversible impact on their souls and bodies."</p><p></p><p>"Some of the spiritual characteristics of that Xuantian Sect's Dharma King still remained within them."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang narrowed his eyes: "That Dharma King is called Mo Rubin? He is truly a remarkable and admirable person."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just nodded, without making too much comment.</p><p></p><p>"They still retain the memories from when they were possessed. It's just that from their perspective, these things were jointly accomplished by them after discussing with Mo Rubin."</p><p></p><p>"As for Mo Rubin's current whereabouts..."</p><p></p><p>"As early as a year ago, he had already bid farewell and left, his whereabouts unknown. To express gratitude for their time together, he even left behind several of the ancient Xuantian Sect's techniques as a reward." Dharma Transmitter Jiang continued to explain.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it was still a means to disrupt our sight. But it was indeed effective. At the very least, I wasted so much time again." Li Fan said somewhat self-deprecatingly. </p><p></p><p>"However, where exactly did he go? Is the Tianxuan Mirror in the Wanxian Alliance now still the original Tianxuan Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>"I will go and find out about this. New 69 Book Bar 89shux.com" Dharma Transmitter Jiang said with a solemn expression, "As for this body of yours..."</p><p></p><p>"We still need to give them an explanation."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang's jet-black eyes instantly locked onto the Immortal Puppet Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As if being pulled into a world of void, the Immortal Puppet Li Fan's body was slowly engulfed by the void.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, it completely disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm, sensing the final images transmitted from the Immortal Puppet's body, Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He was not surprised by Dharma Transmitter Jiang's sudden action.</p><p></p><p>After all, the accusation, or rather slander, of the Dharma Transmitter's failure was definitely an unforgivable major crime.</p><p></p><p>Someone had to take responsibility for it.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Before Dharma Transmitter Jiang destroyed his Immortal Puppet body, he had sent a voice transmission telling him that the investigation into Xuantian King Mo Rubin had gone underground.</p><p></p><p>If there were any findings, they would still be communicated through Dharma Transmitter Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang is probably the only reliable one among the Dharma Transmitters."</p><p></p><p>"To find out Mo Rubin's whereabouts, we still have to wait for the results of his investigation."</p><p></p><p>After being led by the nose by Mo Rubin several times, Li Fan couldn't help feeling a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more worried was that Mo Rubin had already disappeared for nearly a year.</p><p></p><p>For such a long time, he had not reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had already found the missing Xuantian King? Or perhaps, he didn't go looking for any Xuantian King at all, but used the means left behind by the former Xuantian Sect to escape from this Dark Star Sea?</p><p></p><p>In a rare moment of mental disturbance, Li Fan finally waited for the results of Dharma Transmitter Jiang's investigation.</p><p></p><p>In Dharma Transmitter Zhou's private small world, it was still the newly created Immortal Puppet that took action.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror is still the same Tianxuan Mirror. It's just that it used too much computing power, actually damaging the mirror's essence."</p><p></p><p>"Many functions of the Tianxuan Mirror may have to be suspended for a long time to come."</p><p></p><p>"It's about Mo Rubin..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"However, he chose to remain silent about the whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"But Jiang visited the Mirror Holder and the Illusion Sage lineage, gathering the power of the three authorities, and forcibly retrieved the previous deduction records from the Heavenly Profound Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, he found the possible whereabouts of that Mysterious Heaven Sect's Dharma King." However, Dharma Transmitter Zhou's tone was unusually solemn, contrary to his usual manner.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a serious expression and quietly awaited further explanation.</p><p></p><p>Even a divine artifact would have to damage its origin to deduce such a result, which was obviously no trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Dharma Transmitter Zhou lowered his voice and spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that corresponding to the physical Mysterious Yellow Realm, there is also an illusory world?" Zhou asked a seemingly unrelated question first.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat, and he nodded, "I do know this. You cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance call it the [Fallen Immortal Realm]."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Fallen Immortal." </p><p></p><p>"When this immortal fell, he took one last look at the Mysterious Yellow Realm. Then, everything in the world, from mountains, rivers, and seas to ants and tiny insects, was completely reflected in this illusory world! What kind of divine power is this!" Dharma Transmitter Zhou sighed with a tone of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Then, have you ever wondered who exactly this immortal with unimaginable divine powers is? And why did he fall?"</p><p></p><p>"I have indeed been curious. Could it be that you know?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I didn't know before this either. But based on the deduction results from the Heavenly Profound Mirror, perhaps we can make some guesses." Zhou admitted frankly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you still remember the method to enter the Fallen Immortal Realm?" </p><p></p><p>"Method?" Li Fan immediately recalled that rather strange ritual.</p><p></p><p>Four things were needed.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary hemp robe.</p><p></p><p>A plump rice ear.</p><p></p><p>A lifelike miniature donkey cart.</p><p></p><p>The four items were placed in the four corners of the space respectively.</p><p></p><p>Then, the first step was to face the direction of the hemp robe and chant in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"Blessed birth, Mysterious Yellow Immortal Venerable."</p><p></p><p>For the second step, one needed to turn to the plump rice ear and sincerely recite:</p><p></p><p>"Blessed birth, Mysterious Yellow Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>For the third step, one needed to look at the exquisite house and whisper while holding one's breath:</p><p></p><p>"Blessed birth, Mysterious Yellow Supreme Emperor."</p><p></p><p>For the fourth step, one needed to gaze at the cart full of goods.</p><p></p><p>Finally, silently recite: "Blessed birth, Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the answer is often on the riddle itself." Zhou's expression was solemn, "This Fallen Immortal is the [Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerable]!"</p><p></p><p>"Hemp robe, rice ear, house, and donkey cart. They correspond to clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, the four basic necessities that humans cannot lack to maintain survival. This is exactly the responsibility of the Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerable?!" Li Fan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Yellow corresponds to the Mysterious Yellow Realm. Celestial Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>"Does it refer to the Longevity Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"But putting these together, I'm a bit confused."</p><p></p><p>"Can a Longevity Realm powerhouse have such immortal-like mighty powers?" Li Fan frowned, very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, an ordinary Longevity Realm powerhouse cannot possibly achieve such seemingly incredible feats. But the [Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerable] absolutely can." Zhou explained to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerable is not referring to a specific person. It is a title."</p><p></p><p>"Imagine if in a world, there is a cultivator who can achieve unity of body and mind with the world's Dao."</p><p></p><p>"To the extent of [My heart is the heart of heaven, my will is the will of heaven], naturally, nothing in the world can escape his eyes."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Yellow Great Celestial Venerable is such a figure."</p><p></p><p>As Zhou explained, Li Fan suddenly thought of himself in relation to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p>

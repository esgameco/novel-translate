            <p>After the battle, Yan Hang and the others looked at the fallen wood burnt to ashes in the blazing fire, showing no excitement in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, these monsters seem to have become a bit stronger again." Yan Hang looked at the dried yellow wound on his arm, his face grim, cursing angrily.</p><p></p><p>The other four also had varying degrees of injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly report the situation of this battle, hopefully higher-ups can come up with a solution soon. Otherwise, I'm afraid we won't be able to hold on much longer." A cultivator named Li Shifeng among the four sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>Yan Hang snorted coldly, not retorting.</p><p></p><p>He opened the Sudden Record and reported with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also checking the Sudden Record.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when they first entered the Five Elements Daoist Realm, the information recorded there was much richer now.</p><p></p><p>"The completion progress of the grand formation is at 78%."</p><p></p><p>"It is progressing according to plan, even faster than initially expected."</p><p></p><p>"However, it is apparent that things happening here have gotten a bit out of control."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what measures the Wanxian Alliance will take next."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered slightly, his hands busy.</p><p></p><p>Could the Wanxian Alliance really complete the construction of the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation on schedule?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was almost certain they could.</p><p></p><p>At this time in the Five Elements Daoist Realm, the majority of the main force in action were just Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the Wanxian Alliance did not lack in Deity Transformation cultivators. (Availablùüîùüóe at shuxs.com)</p><p></p><p>It was clear they had not fully exerted their strength.</p><p></p><p>If they found that their current strength was not enough to complete the mission, the Wanxian Alliance would naturally increase their investment.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the cultivators in the Five Elements Daoist Realm at this moment could hold on until the reinforcements arrived, that was another matter altogether.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan had expected, the steadily increasing strength of the daoist realm monsters left everyone on edge.</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi quickly came out to reassure everyone.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, she explained to everyone that due to the principle of mutual restraint between the Five Elements, everyone believed that the fusion of creatures with all five attributes would not occur.</p><p></p><p>In the most extreme case, there would only be creatures with a fusion of four attributes.</p><p></p><p>But this situation was only likely to occur in the final stages of the "Five Elements Reunite" process.</p><p></p><p>What everyone mainly needed to face were creatures with a fusion of two or three attributes.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance was already aware of the current situation in the Five Elements Daoist Realm.</p><p></p><p>Reinforcements would arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the size of the reinforcements was very large, with a total number of people exceeding all the cultivators currently working in the daoist realm.</p><p></p><p>Everyone need not worry.</p><p></p><p>Although everyone was still somewhat skeptical of Qi Buyi's words, they were relieved to receive a definite assurance.</p><p></p><p>With slightly relieved emotions, they worked nervously, waiting for the arrival of the reinforcements. (Availableùüºùüø at 69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>Time continued to pass in this tense atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two years had passed since entering the Five Elements Daoist Realm.</p><p></p><p>During this time, there were indeed cultivators who came to support gradually.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that it was far from the large-scale reinforcements promised by Qi Buyi.</p><p></p><p>Whenever inquired, Qi Buyi always made various excuses.</p><p></p><p>However, two new Divine Daoist cultivators arrived to provide support, which eased the worries of the others significantly.</p><p></p><p>With more supporting cultivators arriving, through them, the others also learned why reinforcements had been delayed.</p><p></p><p>In the external world over these two years, many significant events had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, there were external threats.</p><p></p><p>The Wulao Association had stationed troops at the border again, repeatedly showing signs of probing and provocation.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, the other side did not seem to have the intention of starting a large-scale conflict.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they concentrated all their forces on the Wind and Thunder Island separated from the Heavenly Spirit State.</p><p></p><p>According to folk news, it seemed that the Wulao Association coveted the mystery of the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation and wanted to seize the entire state territory from the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>For a comprehensive detailed analysis of the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that this was just a superficial excuse.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the situation was eventually exposed. Indeed, over the two years, the changes that the Wanxian Alliance had made in the Heavenly Spirit State were enough to alert the other party," Li Fan silently pondered.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the pressure brought by the Wulao Association.</p><p></p><p>There was also unrest within the Wanxian Alliance territory.</p><p></p><p>During this period, there emerged many voices opposing the widespread promotion of the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the voices of opposition did not come from unknown entities.</p><p></p><p>Most were cultivators with Deity Transformation or higher cultivation bases who held important positions in various states.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what had happened, but these cultivators who had unanimously declared their staunch support for the formation building plan not long ago suddenly changed their tune, strongly expressing their opposition.</p><p></p><p>And their opposition was not baseless; they had ample arguments and reasons.</p><p></p><p>Their viewpoint was as follows:</p><p></p><p>It was well known that no matter how exquisite a formation was, there would always be a day when it could be deciphered and broken.</p><p></p><p>In the past, there had been instances where defense formations leaked, catching the Wanxian Alliance unawares, and in turn, being taken off guard by the enemy.</p><p></p><p>That was why, later on, defense formations had to be replaced entirely at regular intervals.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Wanxian Alliance laboring and spending without regard to build the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation enveloping all their territory, could they guarantee that the formation would remain effective forever? If the formation was newly built and soon analyzed and deciphered by the Wulao Association, wouldn't that be a huge joke?</p><p></p><p>Besides, these individuals also doubted whether the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation could achieve the effectiveness as promoted.</p><p></p><p>Because the "Thousand-Faced Demon Lord," who had always been haunting the Wanxian Alliance's territory, had recently become even more rampant.</p><p></p><p>Many high-ranking cultivators within the states had not been able to escape his clutches.</p><p></p><p>Even in states where the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation had been constructed, it only slightly slowed down his killing spree.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, they still failed to contain him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he was captured, so what?</p><p></p><p>Since the Wulao Association could cultivate one Thousand-Faced Demon Lord, then they could undoubtedly cultivate two or three.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the promotion, the greatest significance of the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation was to expose all the Wulao Association cultivators within the territory.</p><p></p><p>And now?</p><p></p><p>He openly ravaged your territory, and you were powerless to stop him.</p><p></p><p>What use was this Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit Formation?</p><p></p><p>It had to be admitted that these people's viewpoints were very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Thus, when they raised their doubts to the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, it resonated with quite a few more people.</p><p></p><p>As the opposition grew stronger, the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, contrary to their usual practice, did not punish these dissenters but fell into a strange silence.</p><p></p><p>In this background, the Thousand-Faced Demon Lord's whereabouts became even more elusive, and his rampage grew increasingly ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Besides internal and external problems, Li Fan also heard an interesting story.</p><p></p><p>As the situation became increasingly tense, the Nine Mountain State at the border between the Wanxian Alliance and the Wulao Association, an organization called the Spirit Yuan Sect, was unexpectedly thriving.</p><p></p><p>It certainly attracted the attention of many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>All because the Spirit Yuan Sect had a unique cultivation technique.</p>

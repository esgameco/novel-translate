            <p>Chapter 1115: Defeating the Immortal Alliance with Laughter</p><p></p><p>Whether one looked with their eyes or observed with their spiritual sense, these golden phantoms seemed no different from real cultivators. It was difficult to distinguish the real from the fake.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment, the entire sky of the Spirit Wood Realm was filled with the figures of those golden-armored cultivators. Their task seemed to be not just simply attacking, but providing detailed intelligence about the Spirit Wood Realm for the main army that followed.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think of this golden armor?" Li Fan asked Fang Zaiji casually.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji narrowed his eyes and observed carefully for a while, then said somewhat arrogantly, "It's just a more advanced form of illusion. I thought their Immortal Alliance had really developed battle armor that could infinitely split itself!"</p><p></p><p>"Just by probing a few times, the illusion can be dispelled and the real one's location can be found!" Fang Zaiji said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that with the technological boost from the Heavenly Machine Realm, the Spirit Wood Realm has somewhat surpassed the Immortal Alliance in artifact refinement." Having gotten a satisfactory answer, Li Fan waved his hand, indicating that Fang Zaiji need not probe.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a huge arc-shaped light sphere appeared in the Spirit Wood Realm, enveloping the entire world. The surface of the light sphere had dense metal stripes that kept changing.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's direction, they instantly formed numerous black cannon muzzles.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The muzzles locked onto those golden-armored cultivators flying all over the sky. Then, countless black light beams fiercely sprayed out from them!</p><p></p><p>In the face of this black light emanating destructive aura, the golden-armored cultivators couldn't resist in the slightest. They were torn to shreds in an instant and completely vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>With just one round of simultaneous firing, more than half of the countless golden phantoms were eliminated. </p><p></p><p>This terrifying scene made the movements of the remaining golden-armored cultivators freeze for a moment. </p><p></p><p>In the time they were stunned, another round of bombardment arrived in a flash.</p><p></p><p>In front of the black deathly light, the golden armor was as fragile as paper. All the golden phantoms in the Spirit Wood Realm were completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Machine Fortress, plus the Sky-Splitting Cannon imitated from the Immortal Alliance. There's no need to care about your fancy illusions. No matter how many there are, they just need to be completely destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"This is the so-called overwhelming power." Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He incidentally checked the energy stored in the Heavenly Machine Fortress. The fortress had merged with the Spirit Wood Realm. The countless corpses on the square that continuously operated to gather the spiritual energy of living beings, as well as the vast number of cultivators in the various small worlds, were providing it with power at all times. After accumulating for this period of time, it had reached an extremely astonishing value.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan estimated that the level of simultaneous cannon fire just now could be sustained continuously for seven days and seven nights without running out.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever other tricks you have, bring them on." Li Fan looked at the constantly pulsating entrance gap with eyes full of coldness.</p><p></p><p>After losing two vanguard forces in a row, the Immortal Alliance side also seemed to become much more cautious.</p><p></p><p>This time, without much deliberation, they finally dispatched their true elite force.</p><p></p><p>The gap was suddenly pried open much wider. Li Fan's heart jumped and he directly activated the defensive function of the Heavenly Machine Fortress.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the arc-shaped light screen shook violently, with rippling patterns flowing through it. It took a long time to resolve this inexplicable impact.</p><p></p><p>After checking, Li Fan's eyelids started twitching.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, he thought that...</p><p></p><p>(The excerpt ends here without a complete sentence at the end.)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One-sixth of the ample stored energy in the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress was directly depleted in just a brief moment!</p><p></p><p>Yet, the attacking forces from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals had not even shown themselves!</p><p></p><p>"What is this!?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>The subordinates of the Lingmu Realm also sensed something and their expressions became somewhat tense and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, be careful. I'm afraid the enemy has already arrived," Liu Ruchen suddenly warned in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Before his words faded, the light screen of the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress began to shake violently again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the amplitude was even more intense than before, and the light screen dimmed considerably as a result. It was evident that it had once again blocked the attack from this unknown enemy for the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that if it weren't for the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress, the Lingmu Realm would probably be riddled with holes by now.</p><p></p><p>However, the other party had already launched two attacks, yet the people on the Lingmu Realm's side still hadn't figured out what type of existence the other party was.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the vast organization that has ruled half of the lands in the Xuanhuang Realm. They indeed possess hidden cards that I have not discovered even after reincarnating through many lifetimes." Faced with this thorny enemy, Li Fan was not alarmed but rather delighted.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that with this discovery, even if the entire Lingmu Realm were to be destroyed now, it would be considered somewhat worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>However, the present Lingmu Realm had gathered the remnant forces of many ancient immortal realms after all. It was not truly so easy to perish.</p><p></p><p>When everyone was at a loss and unable to make sense of the situation, Baihua Daoren made a discovery after careful observation.</p><p></p><p>"This method of attack seems to be something I once heard from a certain friend."</p><p></p><p>"Hidden within the void are ferocious beasts that feed on the continents of immortal realms. Ordinary people cannot see their bodies clearly, and each claw and strike possesses the power to destroy worlds..."</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, it should be the void giant beast known as [Yin]."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, it is not a true living being. Rather, it is a spontaneous mode of operation after certain rules in the starry sea have manifested." Baihua Daoren explained to everyone very quickly.</p><p></p><p>"The world of that friend of mine had also encountered attacks from such terrifying existences when the great calamity descended and it was drifting in the void."</p><p></p><p>"The method to deal with it is also very simple. Yin is only interested in immortal realms with living beings. As for those desolate lands without life, they do not fall into its observation at all."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I never thought the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals would actually be able to control and use such a ferocious beast that only acts according to rules to confront their enemies."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren, who had previously shown a hint of contempt for the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals due to their two easy failures before, now had an extremely solemn look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>They then looked at Li Fan in unison.</p><p></p><p>Concealing the life aura of the entire world was not a particularly difficult matter for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, under the continuous attacks of the Yin beast, the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress, whose energy reserves had already been reduced to one-third, emitted strands of silvery soft light.</p><p></p><p>With the double superimposition of the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress and the Lingmu Realm's grand formation, the life aura of the entire world was finally faded before the defensive measures were completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath and waited.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was truly difficult to deal with a monster like Yin, whose normal form could not be seen yet possessed formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Baihua Daoren's guess was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Having lost its sense of life aura, that terrifying giant beast also seemed to have lost its target of attack.</p><p></p><p>It thus ceased its offensive.</p><p></p><p>In the third confrontation, the Lingmu Realm emerged victorious, albeit at a heavy cost.</p>

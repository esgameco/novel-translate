            <p>Liánlián waved his hand repeatedly, saying, "Why are you friends saying this? Are you trying to make fun of me?"</p><p></p><p>"We are all cultivators at the Yuanying stage, you can just call us peers."</p><p></p><p>He said to Zhang Haobo and Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators at the Yuanying stage?"</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, Xiao Heng and the others finally realized that the cultivator who had been sleeping for thousands of years in front of them indeed only had the cultivation level of the Yuanying stage.</p><p></p><p>However, the feeling he gave was quite different from the current Yuanying stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This led to their initial failure to recognize him.</p><p></p><p>In any case, a Yuanying stage cultivator from ancient times surviving until now was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and the others were still cautious in their hearts, thinking about how to continue the conversation and gather some information.</p><p></p><p>But they heard the other party speaking incessantly like a chatterbox.</p><p></p><p>"I am Linghu Chang, a disciple of the Yàowáng Sect's Inner Sect."</p><p></p><p>"When I fell into the Xuanhuang Realm, I remember the Sect Master had already sealed the entire Medicinal King Cauldron and issued a call for help to the outside world."</p><p></p><p>"If you all can come into the Medicinal King Cauldron, I presume the rescue cultivators from the Ten Immortal Sects have arrived, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the other senior brothers are doing now? Has the Sect Master awakened?"</p><p></p><p>As Linghu Chang spoke, he was about to head towards the door with excitement.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the strange expressions on Xiao Heng and the others' faces, he couldn't help but be shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Could something have happened?"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he hurriedly came outside the room.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and the others, upon seeing this, quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's going on? Why is the 'Great Dream of Spring and Autumn' formation still active?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I the only one who has awakened early?"</p><p></p><p>"Where are the rescue cultivators from the Ten Immortal Sects?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang's voice full of suspicion echoed in the empty Medicinal King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Has the passage to life and death been opened? What's happening with the Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>His voice carried an uncontainable panic, and after looking around, he flew back in front of Xiao Heng and the others.</p><p></p><p>Staring at them, he asked, "Who are you guys, and how did you enter my Sect's Medicinal King Cauldron?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng pondered for a moment and slowly said, "This matter is quite complicated. Please be prepared, friend."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang squinted his eyes and listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, friend, you have been sleeping for thousands of years. The shattering of the Medicinal King Cauldron and your awakening are ancient events..."</p><p></p><p>Before Xiao Heng could finish, Linghu Chang waved his hand to interrupt him.</p><p></p><p>In frustration, he laughed, "Such nonsense! Do you really think the 'Great Dream of Spring and Autumn' formation in our Yàowáng Sect is just for show? You even got the number of years wrong, turning twenty-four into thousands. If you want to deceive someone, at least come up with a more believable lie."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang's face turned grim, and with a gentle tap, a gourd appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I felt something odd about you when I first saw you. Turns out you are disciples of evil ways, trying to deceive me."</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to die!"</p><p></p><p>With Linghu Chang's words, dozens of green-colored fine rays burst forth from the gourd.</p><p></p><p>Sharp as blades, fast as lightning.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they arrived in front of Xiao Heng and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Heng, be careful!" Zhang Haobo, surprised by Linghu Chang's immediate attack, turned pale.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red sea hole suddenly appeared above his head, and amidst swirling blood waves, a crimson light flew out, colliding head-on with the green fine blades.</p><p></p><p>*Boom!*</p><p></p><p>In the midst of a violent explosion, Linghu Chang glanced at the boundless blood sea above with an expression of astonishment in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, this only made him more certain of his judgment.</p><p></p><p>He stood upright, his voice filled with anger, "You are indeed from demonic ways, trying to deceive me."</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to die!"</p><p></p><p>Following Linghu Chang's words, several voices echoed simultaneously from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"You are really annoying. Since a while ago, you have been speaking inexplicable words that make no sense."</p><p></p><p>"Are you still half asleep, not fully awake?"</p><p></p><p>"No worries, let us help you wake up."</p><p></p><p>Many faceless blood-faced beings twisted their heads, emitting eerie laughter.</p><p></p><p>Then, their figures disappeared on the spot and all rushed towards Linghu Chang.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a tightening in his heart, Linghu Chang remained calm.</p><p></p><p>He spat out a miniature Medicinal King Cauldron, hanging above his head.</p><p></p><p>A cascade of light formed a defensive barrier.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he patted the gourd gently.</p><p></p><p>The green gourd spun continuously in the air, and fine blade-like rays poured out as if in a torrential rain.</p><p></p><p>Heading towards Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that with his current strength, Xiao Heng couldn't interfere in a battle at the Yuanying stage.</p><p></p><p>Forcing himself in would only be a burden.</p><p></p><p>So he quietly retreated, intending to stay away from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he suddenly smelled an unfamiliar fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the other party's identity as a disciple of the Yàowáng Sect, he couldn't help but feel surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, there is something strange about this fragrance."</p><p></p><p>He quickly transmitted a warning, closing his breath and attempting to resist the fragrance.</p><p></p><p>However, the fragrance seemed to penetrate in a way that Xiao Heng couldn't resist.</p><p></p><p>The scent grew stronger, making Xiao Heng dizzy and weak, even his body felt limp and powerless.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Zhang Haobo and Su Xiaomei, only had a slight pause in their movements before returning to normal.</p><p></p><p>The green rays from the gourd seemed endless, and the protection of the miniature Medicinal King Cauldron was flawless.</p><p></p><p>The attacks of Su and Zhang only caused ripples on the defense of the mini-cauldron, unable to break through it for the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Haobo, don't hold back!" Su Xiaomei seemed angry.</p><p></p><p>A round of red sun rose, leaping over the blood sea.</p><p></p><p>The countless blood-faced beings torn apart by the green gourd's fine rays suddenly reassembled into a furious face.</p><p></p><p>Emitting eerie laughter, it rushed towards Linghu Chang sheltered under the miniature Medicinal King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The boundless sea of blood also split apart, revealing a decaying gigantic hand reaching out from the depths.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing towards Linghu Chang.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the double attack, this Yàowáng Sect disciple stood firm, not showing any signs of panic.</p><p></p><p>With a light wave of his right hand, twenty-four golden needles unfolded in succession.</p><p></p><p>Speaking incantations, the golden needles acted like swords, crossing shining intersecting lines in the air.</p><p></p><p>Avoiding the burning blood-faced beings and the decaying giant hand, the golden needles flew straight towards Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo.</p><p></p><p>The speed of these golden needles was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, before the two could react, they were severely pierced.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies had many holes now, oddly with no blood gushing out.</p><p></p><p>Their attacks didn't seem to be affected either.</p><p></p><p>*Boom!*</p><p></p><p>The miniature Medicinal King Cauldron shook violently, and Linghu Chang spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>His face turned somewhat pale, but soon he took out a pill and swallowed it in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Linghu Chang's complexion returned to a healthy red.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sorcery..."</p><p></p><p>He stared at Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo, still recovering even after being pierced continuously by the 'Reincarnation Golden Needles', feeling a tinge of fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Hesitating for a moment, a hint of pain flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Once again, Linghu Chang took out a round mirror.</p><p></p><p>Holding the mirror in his hand, a white light shot out, illuminating Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>The round mirror gradually turned into powder, while a phantom figure appeared behind Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly resembling Su Xiaomei by eighty percent.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several faceless blood-faced beings split off and launched an attack on Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>They were able to replicate Su Xiaomei's innate mystic abilities and martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the blood sea under Zhang Haobo sent another decaying gigantic hand reaching out.</p><p></p><p>From the deep sea floor, there seemed to be a line of sight peeking from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Linghu Chang pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out a wooden talisman sword.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sword flew above the blood sea, summoning a green thunderbolt that struck down.</p><p></p><p>The decaying giant hands blocked the attack, but were struck by thunderous blasts.</p><p></p><p>Threads of lightning surrounded the wooden talisman sword.</p><p></p><p>The green lightning continued, and although the decaying giant hands seemed immensely damaged, they had no means to strike back.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how severe the injuries, they quickly returned to their original state.</p><p></p><p>A stalemate was reached in the battle.</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang, with the aid of various mystical treasures and endless elixirs, stood invincible.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo, relying on the abilities of their new technique ‘Unbreakable Realm, Eternal Cultivator’, though somewhat distressed, were not in any actual danger.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, both sides felt powerless against each other.</p><p></p><p>Each side was filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of background do these people have, with such strange techniques? Their powers are incredible. I cannot imagine how powerful they could be beyond the Yàowáng Sect's internal disciples." Zhang Haobo pondered.</p><p></p><p>As the three engaged in battle, Xiao Heng, affected by the bewildering scent, gradually recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Don't fight anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"I can swear to the heavens that every word I say is true!"</p><p></p><p>"From your era, thousands of years have indeed passed. The world has changed, and even the so-called Ten Immortal Sects have long disappeared into the dust of history!"</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, if we truly wanted to deceive you, why would we come up with such an implausible excuse?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng continued to appeal.</p><p></p><p>After a long period of silence, Linghu Chang, somewhat perplexed, spoke, "Actually, I am not entirely sure what happened."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, Master Liu used great divine powers to break free from the constraints of the Xuanhuang Realm, piloting the Medicinal King Cauldron into the depths of the void."</p><p></p><p>"Our plan was originally to search for the rumored other immortal realms, but..."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang paused, as if recalling the scene from the past.</p><p></p><p>"Not long after, the Cauldron began to alarm everywhere."</p><p></p><p>"It was said to be attracted by an unknown force, losing control of its direction."</p><p></p><p>"This caused us to return to our respective rooms. To prepare for entering the 'Great Dream of Spring and Autumn' formation for deep sleep."</p><p></p><p>"And then, the Cauldron started shaking more and more. Even the activation of the 'Great Dream of Spring and Autumn' formation was affected and failed."</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards..."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master communicated that the plan to break through the border had failed and we were forced to return to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The True Cauldron was severely damaged and uncontrollable."</p><p></p><p>"For preservation purposes, all remaining power was used in defense."</p><p></p><p>"Allowing the True Cauldron to freely plummet towards the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"After that, important functionalities inside the Cauldron were successively shut down, and the senior brothers were sequentially forced into a state of deep sleep."</p><p></p><p>"When I was cultivating pills in the alchemy room, by the time I rushed back to my room, I hadn't completely closed the door yet."</p><p></p><p>"The Cauldron started shaking more violently."</p><p></p><p>"In the intense tremors, I lost consciousness."</p><p></p><p>"When I woke up..."</p><p></p><p>"I saw you guys."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and Zhang Haobo exchanged a glance, puzzled by this bizarre event.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei, on the other hand, spoke up, "But according to your account, you basically had only taken a stroll outside the Xuanhuang Realm before being forced to return, right?"</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang nodded, "Yes, that's correct."</p><p></p><p>"You entered a state of deep sleep just before plummeting into the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Linghu Chang confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on here?" Su Xiaomei's voice grew louder.</p><p></p><p>"In our view, the True Cauldron has already been away from the Xuanhuang Realm for thousands of years and only returned recently."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, all cultivators in the world saw the True Cauldron transform into a meteor and fall from the sky."</p><p></p><p>"Right, that was about twenty-four years ago."</p>

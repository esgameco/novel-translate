        <h1>Chapter 660</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But unlike now, facing Su Xiaomei's uninterrupted attacks at that time, Shuofeng only defended passively without ever taking the initiative to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Each white light beam reflects back all of the enemy's attacks, even more powerful than the opponent's original moves."</p><p></p><p>"It is similar to the wood sword in nature. Just unable to launch attacks proactively..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to have understood the reason why Shuofeng could never fully control the sword.</p><p></p><p>Thinking for a moment, since the other party would eventually have to comprehend it on their own, might as well do a favor.</p><p></p><p>So he stared at the wooden sword in Shuofeng's hand, furrowing his brows slightly, "Based on common sense, fellow Daoist has outstanding talent, even if it's the legendary Tianzhi, it shouldn't exhibit phenomena that are difficult to control."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng nodded in agreement, saying, "I am also puzzled by this." -END-</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, seeming to suddenly realize, "I have a conjecture, not sure if it's correct."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Please share, there's no harm in hearing it." Though surprised by Li Fan's words, Shuofeng politely replied, not believing that Li Fan could offer any profound insights.</p><p></p><p>" The sword is a weapon of slaughter. Ancient swordsmen were adept at decapitating their enemies from a thousand miles away; a sword could break ten thousand laws. The essence of the sword in the world transforms into incarnations such as gold, jade, and stone, but why does it specifically manifest as a wooden sword?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan posed a question, causing Shuofeng to furrow his brow as his expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>"I have heard that in the ancient sword sects, disciples only use wooden swords for sparring without seeking victory or defeat. Therefore..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused and said in a deep voice, "I believe the sword represents the ultimate in swordsmanship, hence the principle of extremes necessitates a reversal. Therefore, all qualities of worldly swords are reversed in the Tianzhi sword."</p><p></p><p>"To not kill is to kill; seeking defeat results in victory. Winning lies in not attacking, invincibility lies in inaction!" -END-</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words were like an eye-opening revelation, causing Shuofeng to freeze on the spot.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of brilliance in his eyes, Shuofeng reexamined the wooden sword in his hand, seemingly immersed in a profound state.</p><p></p><p>Standing still like a statue, he murmured something incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he was just one step away from enlightenment, and now, being exposed by me, he has instantly understood." Li Fan quietly activated his profound bird technique and looked towards Shuofeng's head.</p><p></p><p>A purple smoke column rose into the sky, resembling a spiraling tornado that did not disperse. It was clearly a top-notch omen of luck, albeit slightly weaker than Xuke's.</p><p></p><p>The luck column was extremely resilient, unaffected by external forces. Even the luck domain transformed by Han Yi's statue had no impact on it.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, without great luck, how could one attain a good fate. What others strive for throughout their lives, he has lacked since birth." Observing Shuofeng's astonishing reversed luck, Li Fan couldn't help but feel astonished.</p><p></p><p>"In this Xuanhuang world, it is rare for two Transcendent Immortals to choose to have children together." Recalling the rumors about Shuofeng and his mother, Li Fan could only envy.</p><p></p><p>It was said that after realizing the impossibility of achieving eternal life, Feixue Immortal decided to place her hopes on her descendants. To cultivate the most exceptional offspring, she chose the traditional but effective method of martial arts competition.</p><p></p><p>For strong Transcendent beings, as long as they could defeat her, they could become her Dao companions. To become a Transcendent Immortal, one had to be an unparalleled genius. By combining the excellent bloodlines of both parties, and with resources from both parents, they might become another powerful Transcendent Immortal in the world.</p><p></p><p>The news shocked the world. Countless cultivators, eager to watch the drama unfold, wanted to witness the fierce battle among the Transcendent Immortals. However, the outcome left people disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Few responded, and it took almost a year for a Transcendent Immortal to challenge her. Yet, in the end, they failed.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators realized that Transcendent Immortals were so few in the Xuanhuang world. Those who successfully reached that realm were extremely proud. Without special circumstances, who would easily give up on the ultimate goal of achieving eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although Feixue Immortal's actual combat strength was only average among the Transcendent Immortals, she was exceptionally skilled in refining weapons. With a set of magical treasures to protect herself, defeating her was no easy task. Without a certain level of certainty, challenging her would only lead to humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Thus, due to these overlapping factors, Feixue Immortal's martial arts competition entered a very desolate situation.</p><p></p><p>Just when everyone thought this matter would gradually fade away and end in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Something that once again shocked everyone happened.</p><p></p><p>Feixue Immortal suddenly became pregnant! And besides herself, no one knew who the child's father was!</p><p></p><p>She avoided discussion on the matter and officially declared the end of the martial arts competition.</p><p></p><p>From then on, she focused solely on nurturing the child in her belly, who eventually grew up to be Shuofeng.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the one who could make Feixue Immortal silently pregnant must have been a terrifying Transcendent Immortal. This point seemed certain.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of his reasons for hiding his identity, that remains unknown. -END-</p><p></p><p>"Not only does he have a Transcendent Immortal mother, but also a father hidden in the shadows, yet to reveal his true identity."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is so confident, no matter how vast the world, he can explore it all."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was contemplating, Shuofeng was slowly awakening from his realization.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on his face, taking a deep breath, his expression gradually calmed.</p><p></p><p>With hands holding the wooden sword no longer trembling, a mysterious aura descended upon him and locked onto his body.</p><p></p><p>The Tianzhi sword transformed into a gentle white light, slowly merging into his body. -END-</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the sharpness on Shuofeng seemed to recede.</p><p></p><p>From being sharp and conspicuous, he became plain and ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even the purple luck column above his head slowly diminished under Li Fan's gaze, eventually turning into an inconspicuous white color that could easily be ignored if not closely observed.</p><p></p><p>Turning to face Li Fan, Shuofeng saw him retracting his profound bird technique and giving a polite gesture.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, fellow Daoist, on achieving mastery of the divine art!"</p><p></p><p>"What divine art mastery, I can't really claim that. But..." Shuofeng gestured politely to request a sword test.</p><p></p><p>Naturally understanding his intention, Li Fan flicked his finger, sending several blue water swords flying towards Shuofeng.</p><p></p><p>With hands behind his back, Shuofeng stood still, not dodging.</p><p></p><p>As the water swords were about to strike his body, a white light flashed.</p><p></p><p>The water swords all turned back.</p><p></p><p>()-END-</p>

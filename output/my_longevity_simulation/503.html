        <h1>Chapter 503</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As for the last place, for now, it is still unknown.</p><p></p><p>In the scholar's lectures, it had never been mentioned, appearing quite mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Currently, exploring the Land of Truth and the risks of One Heart Immortal Sect are the highest.</p><p></p><p>The Human Realm and the Carefree Land pose little threat.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan knew that going towards the tiger's den, naturally, because of his long-standing admiration for Senior Sister Zhao...</p><p></p><p>Well, the real reason is actually that Li Fan wanted to take advantage of the rare opportunity to manipulate puppets with a strand of consciousness and explore the territory of One Heart Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>From his experiences in the previous life, Li Fan learned that under Senior Sister Zhao's control, each individual that was absorbed or merged became part of a collective consciousness.</p><p></p><p>This is known as [All in One Mind].</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, when individual beings are absorbed, devoured, or integrated into Senior Sister Zhao, their past experiences and memories are shared by the entire group.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, who possessed a strand of true essence, this was definitely unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the original person, the danger of One Heart Immortal Sect is actually above that of the Land of Truth.</p><p></p><p>However, if he used the puppet body of Jiao Xiuyuan to explore, the risk would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>This was based on several factors: according to the scholar's account, not all cultivators in One Heart Immortal Sect have become part of Senior Sister Zhao. As one of the most formidable hunters in the world, Senior Sister Zhao is very selective. Only the most elite cultivators within the territory, after layers of selection, are qualified to enter the rumored "Immortal Sect" inside. Even ordinary cultivators are not easily accepted by this Immortal Lady, let alone a puppet body made of wood. Therefore, the possibility of Li Fan being targeted was very small.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, this puppet was one of Jiao Xiuyuan's avatars, with a self-destruct mechanism. Even if Senior Sister Zhao got tired of eating delicacies and wanted to occasionally savor something bland by devouring this puppet body, what she would ultimately obtain would probably be nothing more than a piece of withered wood. The strand of consciousness attached to it had long since dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one should not underestimate the terrifying power of the Longevity Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rushed northward, actively "trimming" his own consciousness along the way. He removed all past memories from his consciousness, retaining only the thought of "heading to One Heart Immortal Sect."</p><p></p><p>Certainly, the side effects were quite pronounced; originally, he could barely manipulate his body with just a strand of consciousness, and after continuous weakening, his consciousness became even more feeble and fragile. Control became less coordinated, resulting in this body of "Jiao Xiuyuan" appearing very dull and seemingly not too bright.</p><p></p><p>But as long as he could convey what he saw, heard, and felt to the original person, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan controlled the puppet body, continuously heading towards One Heart Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, wait for me." Before long, Lü Fan finally caught up, panting. "I've thought about it and decided to go with you after all."</p><p></p><p>"Although there are many rare things in the Carefree Land, it would be nice to see the peerless beauty, Senior Sister Zhao." A hint of yearning flashed in Lü Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned to look at him, asking indifferently, "Who are you, friend?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Fan couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan didn't look like he was joking, Lü Fan observed carefully, thinking that something was wrong with the puppet of Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>So he had to reintroduce himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't say anything, just nodded slightly and continued at the same pace.</p><p></p><p>Lü Fan couldn't help but feel a bit frustrated, but since he had already spoken up, it was also embarrassing to back out directly.</p><p></p><p>The two of them continued on silently, getting closer to the boundary of One Heart Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>Within the territory of the Five Elders' Meeting, there were naturally teleportation arrays present. However, these arrays were set up in towns within the regions, and as cultivators who had not yet joined, they did not have the qualification to use them.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, there was no central Immortal City in each region within the Five Elders' Meeting. Instead, there were large towns scattered everywhere, where mortals and cultivators coexisted.</p><p></p><p>The cities were divided into two areas: inner and outer. A circular high wall separated the two, with cultivators residing in the inner city and mortals in the outer city, without disturbing each other.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the cities, there were also various caves and mountain gates built by cultivators between mountains and wild areas.</p><p></p><p>The overall layout was very similar to the ancient cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>With different customs, the only similarity was the [White Mist Barrier], which stretched across the heavens and earth, serving as the boundary line between the regions.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Li Fan was located in the Human Realm within the Undetermined State. Passing through the white mist barrier ahead would lead to the adjacent Mysterious Yin State.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan was that along the White Mist Barrier, many people had gathered. Just like common market vendors, they were shouting and selling something.</p><p></p><p>"Pu Xian True Boat, three thousand [Soul Points] per boat, buy two get one free, quantity discount!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who want to pass through the White Mist Barrier, just take a look, only one hundred Soul Points to ride the [Pu Xian True Boat], save fifteen days of life essence! With one hundred Soul Points, you won't suffer losses, won't be deceived!"</p><p></p><p>"We offer a large number of Pu Xian boats for rent, interested parties please contact us quickly!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The shouting continued, bustling like a common market.</p><p></p><p>The words they spoke caught Lü Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, come and take a look! It's a flying boat entirely made of Pu Xian leaves!" Lü Fan approached and examined it for a while before exclaiming in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan, who had lost his memory, looking puzzled, he had to patiently explain, "After the Pu Xian Leaf incident before, news spread that artifacts made from this material could reduce the consumption of life essence by the White Mist. That's why the prices didn't plummet. However, it has only been hearsay; I have never seen a real effective artifact made from it. I didn't expect that everywhere in the Five Elders' Meeting, there would be..."</p><p></p><p>Hoping for some response from Li Fan, he was surprised that he still looked clueless.</p><p></p><p>With a sigh, Lü Fan didn't say much more and turned to inquire from the nearby merchant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Soul Points were the universal currency of the Five Elders' Meeting.</p><p></p><p>It actually meant the same as contribution points in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Upon joining the Five Elders' Meeting, one could obtain free cultivation techniques, but as a price, one had to sign a soul contract.</p><p></p><p>It was said that after accumulating a certain amount of Soul Points, one could dissolve the soul contract and redeem oneself.</p><p></p><p>However, very few cultivators could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators chose to exchange their Soul Points for higher-level cultivation techniques, enhance their abilities to earn more Soul Points, and trade for various aspects of life in the Five Elders' Meeting.</p><p></p><p>Not only in terms of selling oneself, but also all transactions in the Five Elders' Meeting, and even various aspects of life, were inseparable from contracts.</p>

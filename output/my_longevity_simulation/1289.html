            <p>Chapter 1284: The Great Enlightenment of Qiwu Dao (7K words)</p><p></p><p>However, considering that the Sun Luyao before his eyes was actually his own creation...</p><p></p><p>Scolding him as useless, wouldn't that be equivalent to scolding his own craftsmanship as shoddy? </p><p></p><p>So Li Fan swallowed back the words that were about to come out of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>With another cold snort, his thoughts turned rapidly, and the current failed "Sun Luyao" was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, a brand new simulated personality was born again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, that formation just now..." The new simulated personality had no awareness that it had just been created. Its memory was still stuck at the moment when the Lingxu Formation destroyed the world, its face pale.</p><p></p><p>"It's really too profound, this junior has not learned it yet." Sun Luyao's tone was bitter, afraid of angering Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt the crystalline sphere refined at the cost of the entire small world, and revealed a kind smile: "Don't worry. This Endless Lingxu Formation is indeed a bit complex. I'll demonstrate it a few more times and it'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>The plain words made Sun Luyao's heart turn cold. But he didn't dare to refute at all, and could only follow the other party in a daze to continue to the next target small world.</p><p></p><p>The ones Li Fan selected were all the smallest ones among the Xuanhuang subsidiary small worlds that had not yet been discovered by the Wanxian Alliance, in order to prevent attracting Xuanhuang to approach the Immortal Ruins and be noticed by outsiders.</p><p></p><p>However, he estimated that his actions of digging up the roots of the Xuanhuang world tree definitely could not continue for too long.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan weighed the mass of that crystalline sphere: "Two or three more, and it will far exceed the protection that my 119th life [Sentient Beings Refining God] can provide. There shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Great Enlightenment Small World.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist was at the border of the Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven, staring blankly at the void outside.</p><p></p><p>All along, she had always carried out the Holy Emperor's tasks very perfectly. The rewards of Source Power Essence had never fallen behind, and had even become more abundant recently. </p><p></p><p>But this Source Power Essence was actually just so-so.</p><p></p><p>Before obtaining it, it seemed extremely precious and had to be tasted no matter what. But after truly becoming wealthy, one gradually found it dull and tasteless.</p><p></p><p>After all, it couldn't be used to transcend mortal limits and ascend to the realm of true immortals. No matter how much more, it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist felt herself gradually slacking off.</p><p></p><p>After the Source Power Essence was freed, she gradually lost her goals and motivation. The thing she did the most every day was to take care of the many grotto heavens, making their spiritual energy circulate smoothly and full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>The second was spacing out.</p><p></p><p>Emptying her mind, thinking of nothing. Occasionally some fragmented scenes would flash by.</p><p></p><p>Some were what she experienced in this Holy Dynasty's Great Enlightenment after awakening.</p><p></p><p>Some were scenes with those survivors from various realms before being captured by the Fishing Pool.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this group of fellows really all died." Baihua couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>Just as Baihua was in a daze, the space in front of her fluctuated, attracting her attention.</p><p></p><p>After sensing that familiar aura, the nerves that had instantly tensed up relaxed again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Baihua."</p><p></p><p>"You're here to get beaten up again?" Seeing Sun Erlang's expression, Baihua knew his intention for coming, and couldn't help but feel a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang admitted frankly: "This time, after going back to cultivate for a while, this junior feels there has been some improvement, so I've come to seek guidance from senior again!"</p><p></p><p>Baihua smiled: "I said, don't listen to Qiaogong boasting to the skies, saying that puppets are comparable to immortals. In the end, they are just a pile of dead things, how can they truly be mentioned in the same breath as us cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Before Sun Erlang could speak, Qiaogong's voice had already rung out: "Whether it works or not isn't something to be boasted about. Let's show our true skills! Little Sun, beat her up properly!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang cupped his hands: "Senior, be careful... This time, it's really different from before."</p><p></p><p>Before his words fell, Sun Erlang's figure disappeared from Baihua's spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>A hint of solemnity flashed in Baihua's eyes, and she transformed into a golden light, flying towards the endless void opened up by the Rift Whale.</p><p></p><p>She vaguely felt that there seemed to be a large number of existences secretly following behind her.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the puppets controlled by that kid, but surprisingly even my spiritual sense can't lock onto them?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist finally became a little interested.</p><p></p><p>A liuli golden flower appeared floating in her hand with a slight movement of her mind.</p><p></p><p>Then in an instant, it suddenly bloomed.</p><p></p><p>Petals drifted down one by one, but the liuli flower itself showed no signs of damage. In no time, the void around Baihua Daoist was enveloped by billions of golden flower petals.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The flower petals flew about, constantly colliding with the puppets hidden in the dark and following her.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the dark gold-painted puppets also gradually revealed their true forms due to this.</p><p></p><p>There were five in total, and they had already quietly surrounded Baihua in the center.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist said playfully: "The little Sun knows he can't win, so he changed from a one-on-one to a group beating?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's responding voice came, but it didn't come from these puppets: "Senior has misunderstood, these puppets are all controlled by me alone. So it can be considered fair..."</p><p></p><p>In the void, five nearly identical voices rang out at the same time, accompanying Sun Erlang's words.</p><p></p><p>"Gold of Rending Space!"</p><p></p><p>"Wood of Entanglement!"</p><p></p><p>"Water of Life Extinguishing!"</p><p></p><p>"Earth of Nothingness!"</p><p></p><p>The bizarre five elements powers surged out from the five puppets respectively. They didn't rush to attack Baihua, but instantly formed a formation.</p><p></p><p>In the formation, Baihua seemed to have instantly left the void and returned to the Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the five elements grotto heaven here wasn't full of vitality, but rather had an air of killing.</p><p></p><p>Every strand of five elements energy in the grotto heaven was like a sharp sword. Sensing Baihua, this outsider, they madly launched an offensive.</p><p></p><p>The gold of rending space, soundless and traceless, its sharpness could tear apart space.</p><p></p><p>The wood of entanglement, seeking enemies in the void, once entangled, it was a fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>The water of life extinguishing, extinguishing all vitality. Even the liuli golden flowers released by Baihua quickly withered after being touched by it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The five elements gave birth to each other, the five powers interchanged with each other, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in the formation, Baihua seemed to have already experienced several days of siege, but the offensive still showed no signs of weakening.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Five Elements Killing Formation."</p><p></p><p>"The formation masters should be those five puppets. Not directly confronting the enemy, but transforming into the eyes of the formation..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Baihua was pondering, she didn't notice that a dark gold puppet had quietly appeared behind her at some point.</p><p></p><p>Hidden in the raging five elements energy, like a golden long sword, it decisively slashed down.</p><p></p><p>Ding!</p><p></p><p>A sound like gold and iron colliding resounded through the Five Elements Killing Formation, and Baihua Daoist's body instantly became transparent.</p><p></p><p>A liuli golden flower bloomed inside her body.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the light, even the long sword that had slashed into her body gradually became liuli and transparent.</p><p></p><p>The power of the gold of rending space exploded, breaking free from the liuli corrosion, and once again disappeared, hiding in the chaotic Five Elements Killing Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist showed her true appearance in front of Sun Erlang for the first time, and she praised lightly.</p><p></p><p>"If it was the me from before, I'm afraid I would have been heavily injured under your move."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Under the pure liuli radiance, the raging five elements powers were all assimilated into solid liuli crystals.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the liuli flower had already swept through everything around it, engulfing the entire formation space.</p><p></p><p>Ding!</p><p></p><p>A slender finger stretched out from the solid crystal.</p><p></p><p>Lightly tapping on the condensed flower.</p><p></p><p>A crack appeared, and then quickly spread to the entire flower body.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The flower exploded into countless pieces, and the originally raging Five Elements Killing Formation completely turned into void.</p><p></p><p>Baihua also transformed back into her original body, gazing all around.</p><p></p><p>But what made her expression change slightly was that this move [Pure Life Liuli], which could destroy a small world in an instant, seemed to have not broken the Five Elements Killing Formation?</p><p></p><p>In the empty void, disturbed energy began to surge again.</p><p></p><p>After distinguishing it, Baihua suddenly realized: "It's not the Five Elements Killing Formation, but the Yin-Yang Five Elements Grand Formation."</p><p></p><p>The two energies of yin and yang circulated with each other, and in the chaos, the energy of the five elements appeared again, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the void that had been calm for not long became lively again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Baihua couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>She could easily destroy the formation, but she couldn't stop this process of yin and yang giving birth to the five elements.</p><p></p><p>Even if she killed it again and again, the killing intent targeting her in the void always lingered on endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"After the power of the five elements yin and yang combined with the formation, although the killing power hasn't increased much, it has indeed become much more troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Although Baihua also knew a little about formations, she didn't sense any traces of formations from the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Baihua, you're out of options, right? Surrender obediently earlier!" Qiaogong's arrogant words resounded through the killing formation.</p><p></p><p>Baihua snorted coldly, and brilliant golden light lit up in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sun, be careful, you've finally forced out this move! Let's see how our prepared countermeasures are."</p><p></p><p>After being enhanced by the Source Power Essence, Baihua's liuli light seemed to become even purer.</p><p></p><p>It was as if even space itself was crystallized, and a crystal clear gem slowly formed around her.</p><p></p><p>The light from the outside world shone in, and the killing formation here was about to be broken by Baihua.</p><p></p><p>"You think you're the only one with Source Power Essence?!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qiaogong's somewhat smug voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>A finger made purely of golden light appeared in front of Baihua's eyes out of nowhere, ignoring the already solidified liuli crystal, and pressed down fiercely towards her brow without any warning.</p><p></p><p>The crystal shattered with a bang, turning into bits of flowing light. The golden finger was unstoppable, pressing down viciously towards her brow.</p><p></p><p>Baihua's expression changed slightly, and her body transformed back into a pure liuli form.</p><p></p><p>Under the same golden light, Baihua confronted that golden finger.</p><p></p><p>What surprised her was that this seemingly very frightening Source Power Essence golden finger in front of her eyes was actually an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>It collapsed upon touch, turning into countless golden threads, wrapping around her body up and down.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sun, close the net!" Qiaogong shouted excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The golden threads completed their spread in an instant, and in the crisscrossing, Baihua Daoist had already fallen into the net before she could react!</p><p></p><p>The liuli flower wanted to bloom with light, but it collided with the golden net and was obliterated.</p><p></p><p>A huge force came from within the golden net, and Baihua was dragged in a sorry state, rushing forward fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>This time Baihua was really angry.</p><p></p><p>"All beings are liuli!"</p><p></p><p>In the extremely cold light shout, Baihua's figure that looked like it had already been captured disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The liuli flower also displayed an unusual sight. The petals drifted down one by one, and this time they completely disappeared after falling. In an instant, the true contents inside were revealed.</p><p></p><p>In the floating light and shadow, it was surprisingly a liuli world!</p><p></p><p>Liuli froze, and countless living beings instantly opened their eyes!</p><p></p><p>Hiss...</p><p></p><p>The huge golden net entangling the outside of the world instantly showed cracks.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong's voice, both shocked and angry, rang out: "Didn't you say that you abandoned the realm and escaped back then?! I didn't expect you to have actually refined the entire Wansheng Realm into a liuli state!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a vicious woman!"</p><p></p><p>"Not only for myself, but also for the entire Tianlian Sect!"</p><p></p><p>In Baihua's furious shout, brilliant radiance burst out from the liuli world, completely breaking free from the golden giant net binding her body.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sun, retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please forgive me..."</p><p></p><p>She vaguely heard Qiaogong's somewhat sorry voice and Sun Erlang's voice full of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the void, their two figures were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>The liuli flower bloomed again, concealing the central liuli Wansheng Realm. Baihua Daoist returned to her original form.</p><p></p><p>She didn't go to chase, but returned to the Five Elements Great Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"After fighting just now, at least it's not so boring anymore. I wonder when I can truly fight against the Wanxian Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"War?"</p><p></p><p>"If we can truly escape from the Immortal Ruins and even the entire Dark Star Sea, perhaps the Heavenly Lotus Sect will have a chance to see the light of day again." Baihua Daoist's thoughts were turning.</p><p></p><p>She had a special confidence in the Great Enlightenment Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Baihua unconsciously looked out into the void.</p><p></p><p>There, where the Holy Emperor had once been, she vaguely sensed an energy that made the entire Liuli Wansheng Realm tremble and fear.</p><p></p><p>"What a madman..."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Great Enlightenment Holy Dynasty, a somewhat disheveled Qiaogong looked at the seven dark gold puppets in front of him with some heartache, while cursing.</p><p></p><p>"I should have realized earlier that anyone who could survive the world-ending calamity would not be simple. Seeing how she was so subservient in front of the Holy Emperor before, I was actually deceived..."</p><p></p><p>"Qiaogong ah Qiaogong, you've really muddled!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang remained silent.</p><p></p><p>This Senior Baihua, who always seemed gentle and amiable, suddenly erupted with a rather frightening strength.</p><p></p><p>However, the purpose of challenging her this time had been achieved.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at the seven dark gold puppets on the field.</p><p></p><p>With the help of these puppet bodies, he not only further familiarized himself with the power of the seven heavenly and earthly spirits in the puppet cores.</p><p></p><p>He also made further progress in his grasp of the essence of source power.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sun, come install these for the puppets!" Qiaogong said viciously.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at the square black object in Qiaogong's hand and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this is the [experience] we extracted from the Immortal Puppet [Ancestor] back in our Heavenly Machine Realm. It cannot be replicated. After the Heavenly Machine Realm was destroyed, using it once means one less. I was always reluctant to use it before, but now..." Qiaogong looked at it somewhat reluctantly, but finally gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, we can't be outdone by that woman!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "Immortal Puppet", Sun Erlang's heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take it, he suddenly thought of something and hesitated: "Such a precious item should be left for Senior Tianyang? Perhaps it will be more useful for him..."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong waved his hand: "I gave him a portion long ago. You think he's been gone for so long without being seen, where did he go? He's been in seclusion comprehending and hasn't come out yet!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop nagging, just do as I say! Hurry, in a moment I might regret it!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Erlang no longer acted reserved.</p><p></p><p>Connecting his mind to the seven dark gold puppets, he crushed the square black object in his hand at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Black liquid flowed out from the gaps in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Like a living thing, it climbed up Sun Erlang's arm all the way to his head. As if transforming into a hunting cobra, it raised its body high, then fiercely drilled straight into Sun Erlang's eye sockets.</p><p></p><p>Out of trust in Qiaogong, Sun Erlang did not block it.</p><p></p><p>The moment the black liquid covered his eyes, the environment Sun Erlang sensed himself in also changed.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of blurry images surged like a tide, accompanied by segments of discontinuous battle memories.</p><p></p><p>Or more precisely, memories of "being beaten".</p><p></p><p>Mysterious and unfathomable techniques bombarded the Immortal Puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Puppet could only rely on its own tough material to withstand it and had little chance to fight back.</p><p></p><p>But even with just passively taking a beating, all sorts of profound insights emerged in Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>After being beaten a lot, Sun Erlang seemed to form a kind of instinct.</p><p></p><p>When the image of an immortal technique attack appeared in his mind again, he instinctively generated a feeling of how to respond to this technique.</p><p></p><p>This feeling made Sun Erlang addicted.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, just as he seemed to be truly sensing something, all the images suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's forehead veins bulged, his fists clenched tightly, and he gasped heavily.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were bloodshot, staring intently at Qiaogong.</p><p></p><p>However, Qiaogong seemed to have been prepared long ago and was far away, saying coldly: "Little Sun, clear your head. Don't be blinded by illusions!"</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of being about to comprehend the Dao, is it really from you or the Immortal Puppet?!"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong's words were like a basin of ice water poured over his head, and Sun Erlang immediately sobered up a lot.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, it still took him nearly half a day to slowly suppress the thought of wanting to snatch the Immortal Puppet experience from Qiaogong to continue comprehending due to the sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, Senior." Sun Erlang said somewhat ashamedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. You don't need to blame yourself. Not to mention you, even that group of old fellows in our Heavenly Machine Realm couldn't resist this temptation." Qiaogong licked his lips, as if savoring the taste of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Now take another look and see what's different from before." Qiaogong instructed.</p><p></p><p>Turning his attention back to the five dark gold puppets, after a moment, a hint of pleasant surprise flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Those memories of being beaten keep surfacing again..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang closed his eyes and felt it.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong clapped his hands, and thousands of holy army puppets appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>Relying on mechanical instinct, they simultaneously launched attacks on the dark gold puppets controlled by Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>As if tempered a thousand times, all the different techniques and moves were easily dodged by Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Such a result left even Sun Erlang himself stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even understand why those bombardments clearly landed on these dark gold puppets he controlled, yet in the end no damage occurred at all.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because of the dark gold puppets' powerful defensive capabilities that negated this damage.</p><p></p><p>But indeed, through some extremely mysterious method, all the attacks of the holy army puppets were dodged.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be dazed, try to maintain this instinctive feeling as much as possible!"</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of the Immortal Puppet experience will quickly dissipate. As for how much you can ultimately retain, it depends on your own fortune!"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong's words immediately brought Sun Erlang back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>He discarded all distracting thoughts and concentrated on memorizing the Immortal Puppet's dodging instinct.</p><p></p><p>Even though Sun Erlang had already tried his best, as time slowly passed, the number of times the dark gold puppets he controlled were hit inevitably increased.</p><p></p><p>After persisting for seven days, the final dodging probability was maintained at a stable value.</p><p></p><p>"One-third."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pretty good result."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong comforted.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was obviously a bit unwilling.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with gradual comprehension in the future, the dodging ability will still have a certain degree of improvement. But to reach the level of the Immortal Puppet, moving according to thoughts and dodging the so-called divine technique attacks..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid only by breaking through the limit of mortals can it be done." Qiaogong spoke truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang let out a long breath, slowly suppressing the regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate this one-third, it will often have miraculous effects in life-and-death battles. Even if someone's strength far surpasses yours, their offensive will be unintentionally dodged by you."</p><p></p><p>"More crucially, you can control seven puppets at the same time. The actual combat performance will be slightly higher than this value due to the shared sensing of the seven puppet bodies..."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong began to summarize and analyze the gains from this time with Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"If you were to compete with Baihua again now, there would be a high probability of dodging that Liuli golden light of the Wansheng Realm. If the formation is not broken, she would just be a turtle in a jar..." Qiaogong was obviously still a bit unconvinced by Baihua, muttering.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were talking, they suddenly noticed that the surrounding space began to tremble faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang and Qiaogong were stunned at first, then simultaneously flew out of the testing ground.</p><p></p><p>Not only the location where they were, but the entire Holy Dynasty was plunged into intense shaking.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a vortex faintly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Thunderbolts roared inside it.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of pleasant surprise flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had experienced a similar scene before.</p><p></p><p>That was the anomaly that occurred in the world when the environment of the Holy Dynasty was comprehensively sublimated.</p><p></p><p>After the last anomaly, the spiritual energy density of the Holy Dynasty multiplied several times. And the number of talents descending into the world was also noticeably higher than before.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that put them far ahead of the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>Not only the Holy Emperor's disciples, but also the people of the Holy Dynasty all walked out of their houses at this moment, looking up at the sky with excitement.</p><p></p><p>As the most direct beneficiaries of the world's sublimation, the people of the Holy Dynasty, without any mobilization, all knelt down and piously prayed as the Holy Emperor's subjects.</p><p></p><p>If Li Ping were here, he would see that the destiny of the Holy Dynasty, which had already been refined to the extreme, was showing signs of breakthrough again at this moment.</p><p></p><p>However, taking this step was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Now it was just a beginning.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chanting of the Holy Dynasty's people, ethereal purple qi floated out from all over like substance and was absorbed by the vortex in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sound of wind and thunder intensified, and the thunderous sounds even made Sun Erlang's mind tremble faintly.</p><p></p><p>From overhead, he felt increasing pressure.</p><p></p><p>Causing him to unconsciously lower his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master has made another breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>A hint of realization surged in Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>From the expressions of the other disciples of the Holy Emperor such as Su Yuqing and Ou Shangtian, Sun Erlang saw that they had the same thought as him.</p><p></p><p>The vortex in the sky rotated faster and faster, and starlight occasionally ejected from it, sprinkling down on various corners of the world.</p><p></p><p>Vegetation touched by it grew at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>Creatures that came into contact with it seemed to be enlightened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, several condensed vast starlights flew out like meteors, accurately flying towards Sun Erlang and the others.</p><p></p><p>This also included cultivators summoned by the Holy Emperor such as Qiaogong and Baihua.</p><p></p><p>The moment the starlight entered their bodies, the scene in front of Sun Erlang's eyes changed with a bang.</p><p></p><p>As if truly arriving in the endless void outside the Xuanhuang Realm, Sun Erlang saw that in the deathly darkness, countless rampaging and terrifying calamitous forces were hidden.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang also saw that even in this terrifying and desolate star sea, countless star sea Daos were tenaciously reviving.</p><p></p><p>"Light is hidden under darkness..."</p><p></p><p>"Vitality is nurtured from deathly silence."</p><p></p><p>Like a pious disciple of enlightenment, Sun Erlang personally witnessed the vastness and tenacity of the star seas, and couldn't help but shed tears.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious energy fluctuations erupted from them, reaching straight to the sky.</p><p></p><p>The shared enlightenment caused the tremors of the small Great Enlightenment world to intensify again.</p><p></p><p>This fluctuation even spread outside the world, expanding into the void.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Grotto Heavens surrounding the Great Enlightenment, as well as other small worlds relocated here, were all affected by this and resonated at the same frequency.</p><p></p><p>Like the sound of a heartbeat, it seemed that something was gestating in this heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>All living beings in the small Great Enlightenment world, as if sensing something, looked up at the vortex in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the masses, a majestic figure passed through the wind, thunder and lightning, through the purple qi and the mysterious starlight.</p><p></p><p>Slowly descending to the world.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome the Holy Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of Great Enlightenment people knelt down and shouted like the roaring sea.</p><p></p><p>And the Holy Emperor's disciples, as well as Baihua, Qiaogong, Yin Shangren and others, were a little shocked to find that on the originally blank face of the faceless Holy Emperor they were familiar with, a countenance had actually grown!</p><p></p><p>After only a moment's hesitation, the aura on the Holy Emperor undoubtedly confirmed his true identity.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was above the nine heavens, looking down at the living beings below.</p><p></p><p>With a light wave of his hand, all the kneeling people stood up.</p>

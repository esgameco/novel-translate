        <h1>Chapter 861</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After returning to Haixuan Island, Ji Shaoli naturally received many invitations to banquets and requests for meetings. However, he simply ignored them all.</p><p></p><p>"With so many eyes and ears around, it's not suitable for this avatar to go out at the moment. It's better to honestly stay in seclusion for a while."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's really a bit unexpected that the Wanxian Alliance would actually release the eliminated cultivators from the Immortal Selection back. This is truly somewhat surprising." Ji Shaoli frowned slightly, a trace of puzzlement flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>If the Thirty-Three Immortal Candidates plan was truly very important, then at the very least, before the Immortal Candidates plan had achieved its intended effect, their identities should have been kept secret. </p><p></p><p>Naturally, they should not have released those eliminated candidates, but should have concealed the true identities of the thirty-three Immortal Candidates.</p><p></p><p>But the Wanxian Alliance had no intention of doing so at all...</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter who they are."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are thirty-three people who meet the conditions, that's enough."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Let me see what exactly the Wanxian Alliance is up to."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to give the Wanxian Alliance a little more pressure."</p><p></p><p>The avatar Ji Shaoli sat still on Haixuan Island without moving.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm, Lin Ling, who had received Li Fan's orders, once again went to Jiushan Prefecture to contact the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council questioned why there had been no response for so long.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling, following Li Fan's instructions given in advance, informed them about the matter of the Brilliant Orb absorbing the two strange forces of "Heart Ape" and "Mind Horse".</p><p></p><p>Although the representative of the Five Elders Council appeared calm on the surface, Lin Ling still keenly sensed the violent psychological fluctuations from the other party.</p><p></p><p>After sending another batch of supplies and expressing gratitude, the Five Elders Council inquired about the "Thirty-Three Immortal Candidates" plan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was vague and brushed them off.</p><p></p><p>Just as the other party was feeling a bit disappointed, she directly revealed the shocking news.</p><p></p><p>"In order to deal with the Five Elders Council's covetous gaze, in addition to the Immortal Candidates, the Wanxian Alliance has also developed many world-shocking divine weapons, including the [Sky-Splitting Cannon]. If you don't take action soon, I'm afraid it will be too late for regrets."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling repeated Li Fan's words verbatim.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a video footage was also transmitted.</p><p></p><p>A world-destroying black beam of light penetrated through layers of white fog, annihilating everything that obstructed its path.</p><p></p><p>The black beam gradually disappeared, but the void it created did not get filled and restored by the white fog for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Its residual power prevented any external objects from approaching.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a simulated image, one could see the power of this Sky-Splitting Cannon.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, she cupped her hands and said that there would definitely be a great reward in the future.</p><p></p><p>Then she hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling watched the other party's disappearing figure and pouted.</p><p></p><p>She returned through the earth veins to report back.</p><p></p><p>In the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the Wanxian Alliance in this world has actually created this world-shocking divine weapon. But whether it's real or fake doesn't affect anything."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, the Five Elders Council was already getting restless, but they were temporarily held back by the Immortal Alliance's strange tactics."</p><p></p><p>"Having resolved the Brilliant Orb matter, and with the pressure from the thirty-three Immortal Candidates and the Sky-Splitting Cannon and other superweapons, I believe they will choose to strike first to gain the upper hand."</p><p></p><p>"Just wait and see."</p><p></p><p>After receiving Lin Ling's message, Li Fan pondered for a moment, then shifted his attention.</p><p></p><p>In his dantian, the seven-colored orb emitted a sacred light that dazzled the eyes and bewitched the mind.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a supreme treasure refined from the heavenly light of an entire realm."</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to fully control it is not something that can be achieved overnight."</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power enveloped the seven-colored orb...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer, numerous scenes flashed quickly before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>There were cultivators soaring among the white clouds, and mortals dwelling upon the earth.</p><p></p><p>It was a scene from the extinct Chongyan cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the time and space of heaven and earth changed abruptly. The details are unclear," Li Fan thought with a bit of regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So far, apart from the Xuanhuang realm, he had already learned the names of three other cultivation realms: Xiaoyao, Taiyi, and Chongyan.</p><p></p><p>But that was the extent of it.</p><p></p><p>Besides the names, he knew very little about the specific circumstances within them.</p><p></p><p>"If I could break free from the shackles of the immortal ruins, I could explore and find out."</p><p></p><p>"However, Chongyan has been destroyed. As for whether the Xiaoyao and Taiyi realms still exist, it's hard to say."</p><p></p><p>As his physical strength and spiritual power surged, slowly refining the seven-colored pearl, Li Fan discovered a slight anomaly not long after.</p><p></p><p>The speed at which the roots of heaven and earth were proliferating was almost twice as fast as before!</p><p></p><p>If this momentum continued, it would completely devour this Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven in less than a year!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Fan had not gone out.</p><p></p><p>The only variable was the newly acquired seven-colored pearl.</p><p></p><p>While feeling a bit surprised in his heart, Li Fan secretly speculated and studied the specific reasons for the change.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he discovered a possible reason.</p><p></p><p>While his spiritual power was refining the seven-colored pearl, a mysterious force was also nourishing and transforming the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Under the blessing of this force, the roots of heaven and earth were frantically proliferating as if they had received some great nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as Li Fan's progress in refining the seven-colored pearl deepened, the speed of this proliferation continued to rise.</p><p></p><p>It even made Li Fan, the instigator, feel a bit apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Like dark clouds pressed by a fierce wind, Li Fan was invading the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven at a terrifyingly unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the many monsters in the Xuanhuang realm, I could even use this method to take over the Xuanhuang realm within just over a decade," Li Fan couldn't help but have this premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this mysterious force...?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>After a full seven days, he finally realized.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the world's origin?"</p><p></p><p>"The seven-colored heavenly light of the Chongyan realm is the evolution of the Heavenly Dao. It contains the origin of the world."</p><p></p><p>"After being refined into a magic treasure, it was thus preserved."</p><p></p><p>"When used for ordinary confrontation or flying, this special attribute will not manifest. However, when it comes into contact with the roots of heaven and earth, this new method specifically used to devour heaven and earth, it reacts!"</p><p></p><p>"Like a catalyst, it greatly enhances the power of the roots of heaven and earth, accelerating the speed of devouring the grotto-heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, the dissipation of the world's origin will have a certain impact on the power of the seven-colored pearl."</p><p></p><p>"It's just advancing the timeline, the gains do not make up for the losses."</p><p></p><p>"But for me..."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter at all!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He then further accelerated the process of refining and extracting the power of the world's origin.</p><p></p><p>"Since the power of the world's origin helps with advancement at the Nascent Soul stage,"</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the Deity Transformation, Dao Integration, and even Eternal Life stages?"</p><p></p><p>"Will it still provide assistance?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the increasingly flourishing countless tentacles, Li Fan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>Borrowing the power of other worlds to devour a world.</p><p></p><p>This matter, which should have been impossible to accomplish, became possible due to the appearance of the ultimate treasure - the Fishing Pool.</p>

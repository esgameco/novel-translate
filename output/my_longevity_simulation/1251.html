        <h1>Chapter 1251</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Reversing the principles, reversing the principles..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it really be like this?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren stood there in a daze for a long time, and then began to tremble uncontrollably on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's aged face was also extremely excited: "No wonder Mr. Bai always said back then, that I only needed to wait."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the descent of the Xuanhuang Dao to save itself, there are also countless mortals continuously embarking on the path of cultivation. The process of cultivation is the process of reversing the principles of the immortal miasma. Thousands of years have passed, accumulating day by day, month by month..."</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sacred Emperor spoke in a faint tone: "Counterintuitively, the seemingly simple task in the eyes of cultivators of eliminating the immortal miasma, the initial step and prerequisite of cultivation, is actually the same in essence as the ultimate goal of cultivation - attaining the Dao and eternal life."</p><p></p><p>"They are both about reversing the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, both Yin Shangren and Xu Ke's eyes revealed an extremely complex expression. </p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren said, "If the Reverend of Reversing Principles was still here, it would not be so easy for the mortals of the Xuanhuang Realm to reverse the principles of heaven and earth and embark on the path of cultivation. But precisely because Mr. Bai has already perished, the restrictions of the immortal miasma principles have been greatly weakened."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Ping chimed in, "Moreover, there is also the Eastern Pole Celestial Venerate, who has unraveled the mystery here. Using the so-called Pure Body Spirit Pool Formation, he further reduced the difficulty of reversing the principles."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's lips moved slightly, and after a long time, he managed to say with difficulty, "The last time I saw Mr. Bai, I could see the determination of death in his heart. I couldn't let go of it for many years, but now, I may understand a little."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren, on the other hand, fell into a state of muttering to himself again, "Everyone in the world is reversing the principles of heaven and earth, but when it comes down to it, this is still within the system of cultivation and teaching the Dao. Even if we know this, what's the use?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be something we haven't thought of..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said with certainty, "The answer should lie within the immortal miasma. When it comes to researching the immortal miasma, I'm afraid no one in the Xuanhuang Realm can compare to you. I'm afraid we'll have to trouble you to work a little harder, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"Although there are no longer any mortals with immortal miasma within the Great Enlightenment Realm, it's not difficult to find some from those conquered small worlds for research. I will have people fully cooperate with you," Li Ping said to Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Your Majesty." Yin Shangren suddenly became excited.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Myriad Immortals Alliance's Yan Fa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the Remnant Realm Great Wall in the Sacred Fetus, the calm heart of Li Fan's true body was once again stirred by ripples.</p><p></p><p>"Reversing the principles of heaven and earth? The immortal miasma..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly recalled his experience of eliminating the immortal miasma in the Pure Body Spirit Pool Formation on Liuli Island.</p><p></p><p>The pool water, hot as lava, ravaged his consciousness. Despite his determined will, he eventually fell into a state of ignorance and unconsciousness.</p><p></p><p>His mind was completely blank, acting only on instinct.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the spirit pool, Li Fan, who had been cultivating the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Chant day and night, instinctively operated this technique again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time as completely eliminating the miasma from his body, Li Fan also inexplicably comprehended the upgraded version of the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Chant.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Tempering Heart Chant.</p><p></p><p>Later, it evolved into the current Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Chant. This technique has been of great help to Li Fan along the way.</p><p></p><p>"The pain in the Pure Body Spirit Pool is unbearable for ordinary people. There is a high possibility of falling directly into a state of unconsciousness. Even if one can remain conscious, in this extreme pain, there is no room for any other distracting thoughts."</p><p></p><p>"Carrying the soul and embracing oneness, cleansing the profound insight, following the laws of nature..."</p><p></p><p>"Man unites with the Dao. Instinctive actions in a state of ignorance and unconsciousness happen to be the closest to the Dao. This may be the reason why so many mortals in the world can successfully eliminate the immortal miasma and reverse the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"However, in reality, this is not a complete reversal of principles in the full sense. The fact that there is no qualitative leap in strength after eliminating the immortal miasma proves this point."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Firstly, it's because the immortal miasma is not completely eliminated by one's own power. Secondly..."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the light of the Hua Dao Stone flickered. Li Fan took out the instantaneous enlightenment from back then and kept reflecting on it.</p><p></p><p>He mused, "When the immortal miasma was finally eliminated..."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if it disappeared on its own."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if it sensed the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Chant I was operating and spontaneously transformed into the Tempering Heart Chant."</p><p></p><p>"Did it trigger some kind of condition?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also recalled the image of the Eastern Pole Celestial Venerate before his death, transmitted by the True Celestial Venerate.</p><p></p><p>"The secret of reversing the principles of heaven and earth lies within the immortal miasma."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan's eyes, it seemed as if he saw countless mortals breaking free from the shackles of the immortal miasma and embarking on the path of cultivation over thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"The birth of every cultivator goes through a process similar to reversing the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they themselves are completely unaware, this is indeed truly happening."</p><p></p><p>"Reversing the principles of heaven and earth is tantamount to directly confronting the Dao transmission and completely overturning the cultivation system he personally created. Even heaven-defying talents like Mr. Bai and the Eastern Pole ended in failure. This shows how difficult it is. But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>He associated it with the simulation process of his own repeated reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>"The process of each mortal resisting the immortal miasma can be seen as a simulation of reversing the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"The power of one person may have its limits. The power of millions of people also has its limits."</p><p></p><p>"But the power of millions of people, over myriad times, is endless and inexhaustible."</p><p></p><p>"In the face of such a vast force, it's only a matter of time before the new law of the Dao transmission is broken."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled, "The myriad beings of heaven and earth, the tempering of the spirits of all living beings, is using pure quantity to shake the transcendent power of immortals."</p><p></p><p>"Endless living beings, eternally reversing the law, this is further amplifying the advantage of quantity on the scale of time, achieving a qualitative change from quantitative change..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are still existences in the Xuanhuang Realm unwilling to accept the fate of mortals, this Dharma door will continue."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the limits of lifespan, the methods remain effective even after perishing, spanning across the long river of time, influencing years later.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Li Fan who possesses the Huan Zhen treasure, this is already the limit of what ordinary mortal cultivators can do.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for Li Fan, there wasn't much worth learning from this.</p><p></p><p>What Mr. Bai needed to accomplish with the help of cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm over thousands of years, Li Fan could do simply by repeatedly using Huan Zhen.</p><p></p><p>But this did not prevent Li Fan from taking Mr. Bai's results.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, the so-called secret of reversing the principles of heaven and earth hidden within the immortal miasma is the insights of countless cultivators over countless years while eliminating the immortal miasma."</p><p></p><p>"They are all recorded and preserved."</p><p></p><p>"If one could absorb the experiences of repeated simulations similar to reversing the principles of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan claimed that he could now remain indifferent to the vast majority of treasures in the Xuanhuang Realm, even the cat treasure from beyond the high walls.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So it was. But he had to admit, after perceiving these countless paradoxical experiences at this moment, his heart was moved.</p><p></p><p>Unlike magic treasures, this experience gift pack was something that could directly enhance the essence of Li Fan's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to fiercely shorten the gap between him and Chuanfa and Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a one-time thing, it was of great significance to Li Fan, and the earlier it was discovered, the better.</p><p></p><p>"It can at least save me three lifetimes of reincarnation time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"So where exactly did Mr. Bai hide this big gift pack?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it in the Fallen Immortal Mirror, or is it in the mortal miasma? Does it require some special conditions to trigger?"</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he had already set the tone of sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight in this life, Li Fan would have wanted to personally take action and explore it right now.</p><p></p><p>However, years of experience still made him suppress this impulse.</p><p></p><p>"With Yin Shangren and Xu Ke working hard to study it, it will definitely be more efficient than me groping around blindly."</p><p></p><p>"If they know, it's equivalent to me knowing. Anyway, it will all be mine in the end, there's no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>"I can also see how powerful this big gift pack really is. After the Holy Emperor's avatar absorbs it, will it really be able to shake Chuanfa?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh heh, it really makes me somewhat expectant."</p><p></p><p>Having been in closed-door cultivation in the Yanfa Jue space for a long time, Li Fan inevitably felt bored, but at this moment, his heart was surging.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Unraveling the mystery of Mr. Bai's legacy was not something that could be completed in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Before this, the time Li Ping had agreed upon with Ruomu had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor once again came to the outside of the White Flower Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He did not let his guard down just because he had an absolute advantage. To prevent Ruomu from making a desperate move, he silently laid down a layer of protection around him with refined source power.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Ping step back into the Jianrenshou space.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of Li Ping's nourishment last time, or perhaps it was because Ruomu himself saw hope.</p><p></p><p>In the originally lifeless and desperate withered yellow space, this time Li Ping actually felt a hint of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Although it was extremely weak, the appearance of this vitality that shouldn't have existed in the first place already indicated certain issues.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also discovered something different from before.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators hanging on the branches of Ruomu...</p><p></p><p>They had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Holy Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist smiled and appeared in front of Li Ping at this time.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu noticed the direction of the other party's gaze. Before Li Ping could ask, he took the initiative to explain, "Since I have already decided to pledge allegiance to you, naturally I have to make some changes. It's good to get rid of the incompetent and furious behavior of the past."</p><p></p><p>"You know, after seeing too many of these human fruit, I'm actually a bit tired of them."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said indifferently, "Where are they now?"</p><p></p><p>Ruomu chuckled, "Naturally, I let them return to the heavens."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Ruomu handed over a leaf.</p><p></p><p>The leaf was a mixture of green and yellow. Looking closely, there was a universe within. It contained golden cores of all shapes and sizes piled up like small hills.</p><p></p><p>These golden cores looked as if they were dissolving, incomplete and broken.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping could vaguely see the appearance of the wondrous objects of heaven and earth within the cores of the golden cores.</p><p></p><p>"I am originally a spiritual being of heaven and earth, wielding the power of life and death in the mortal world. Although this power is gradually being taken back, my connection with heaven and earth has actually never been severed."</p><p></p><p>Ruomu glanced at Li Ping and continued, "Through my absorption and transformation, the power of heaven and earth that was devoured by the cultivators can also be returned to heaven and earth more quickly."</p><p></p><p>"You can see for yourself, I didn't embezzle any of it."</p><p></p><p>Ruomu nodded repeatedly in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Come here." Li Ping suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist hesitated for a moment, but eventually walked slowly to the front of the faceless Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Li Ping's huge body of thirty-three feet, the stooped Daoist appeared as small as a baby.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping gently placed his palm on Ruomu's head.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of Ruomu's eyes shattered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, he seemed to have left this Jianrenshou space.</p><p></p><p>He arrived in the endless dark starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The golden vortex, like the Milky Way, swirled vastly.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of the Milky Way, the majestic figure of the faceless Holy Emperor could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>That powerful and sacred aura seemed to be even more superior than the Xuanhuang Dao that Ruomu was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>As one of the oldest existences in the Xuanhuang Realm, Ruomu naturally knew the meaning represented by this kind of power.</p><p></p><p>The last bit of dissatisfaction in his heart slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu revealed his original form, no longer an ugly human Daoist, but a withered yellow sapling that looked malnourished.</p><p></p><p>In front of the vast golden vortex of the Milky Way, it was like an ant.</p><p></p><p>The branches and leaves swayed gently, which was Ruomu's way of showing submission.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the faceless Holy Emperor expanded rapidly, instantly filling Ruomu's entire field of vision.</p><p></p><p>The golden Milky Way also exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>Endless starlight engulfed Ruomu.</p><p></p><p>By the time Ruomu came to his senses from the illusion, Li Ping's figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>"When you are needed, you will be summoned."</p><p></p><p>Only Li Ping's voice kept echoing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu clearly felt that his bond with the Xuanhuang Realm was slowly recovering.</p><p></p><p>Although it was impossible to return to the peak of his prime.</p><p></p><p>But at least there was hope.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Ruomu looked at his palm.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the original green leaf, a small green bottle had appeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>It was obviously left by the faceless Holy Emperor before he left.</p><p></p><p>A segment of restriction manipulation technique naturally surfaced in his mind. Ruomu followed suit and opened the small green bottle.</p><p></p><p>A pure vitality emerged from the green bottle.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was incomparable to the personal nourishment of the Xuanhuang Dao, for Ruomu in his current state, it was definitely a great tonic.</p><p></p><p>Ruomu greedily swallowed all the vitality in the green bottle in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Until not a single drop could be poured out, only then did he reluctantly stop.</p><p></p><p>However, Ruomu noticed that the vitality in this small green bottle had not completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was slowly generating on its own.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Ruomu even more was that the generation of this vitality did not absorb any energy from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the vitality was completely derived by the green bottle itself.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly a great treasure."</p><p></p><p>Ruomu smacked his lips in a very unrefined manner.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem to be something from the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Ruomu pondered for a moment, then laughed disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"Why bother about so much, as long as there's something to eat and drink, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>"It can't be worse than before, right?"</p><p></p><p>Only after losing it did one realize the preciousness of what one once possessed.</p><p></p><p>If anyone wanted to take these things away again...</p><p></p><p>Then even if the other party was Chuanfa, he, Ruomu, dared to take a bite or two.</p>

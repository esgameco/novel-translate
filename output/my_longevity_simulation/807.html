        <h1>Chapter 807</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As the immortal master gently pointed, countless scenes suddenly appeared in Su Yuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>The scenes of countless flames raging in the fire world made Su Yuqing, who had never left the capital city, lose her composure.</p><p></p><p>However, she also thoroughly understood the origin of the crisis between the worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The weak are prey to the strong, this is the way of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"All things are like this, and so are the worlds."</p><p></p><p>"The fate of the destruction of the Separated World was already destined from the moment it unfortunately collided with the Fire World in the void."</p><p></p><p>The immortal master sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Flattening that volcano with a single move would be effortless for me."</p><p></p><p>"But it would only treat the symptoms, not the root cause. Instead, it would provoke a stronger resistance from the Fire World."</p><p></p><p>"In just a few years, an even larger volcano would surely rise from the ground again."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the immortal master's words, Su Yuqing couldn't help but show a look of despair on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no way?" she couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expression on the immortal master's face and thinking about his actions, Su Yuqing suddenly had a realization.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly kowtowed repeatedly, saying, "Please teach me, immortal master!"</p><p></p><p>After nine full kowtows, the immortal master finally waved his hand lightly to stop her worship.</p><p></p><p>He slowly said, "This is also the reason why I want you to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"The balance of power has no fixed rules since ancient times. The current crisis in the Separated World lies entirely in the fact that the enemy is strong and we are weak. If it were the other way around, and the Separated World was stronger than the Fire World, then not only could the danger of world destruction be avoided, but perhaps the Fire World could be devoured in turn."</p><p></p><p>"Achieving a world upgrade!"</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan said these words with a resounding voice, he sensed that the world's malice, which had been everywhere around him, vanished in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>When he began to act as an immortal master and even deceived the little girl Su Yuqing, the malice from the Separated World came rolling in from all directions.</p><p></p><p>It was even far greater than the malice of the Xuanhuang World towards cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not even afraid of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, let alone this small Separated World.</p><p></p><p>However, the feeling of being maliciously stared at all the time was really a bit annoying.</p><p></p><p>It took some effort, but he finally managed to reverse it.</p><p></p><p>After all, what he said to Su Yuqing was not a lie, but a practical and feasible plan.</p><p></p><p>"How can the Separated World be stronger than the Fire World?" Su Yuqing's face was a little confused.</p><p></p><p>The Fire World she saw in her dream was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It was not something that a purely mortal world could resist.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the somewhat confused Su Yuqing, Li Fan smiled slightly, "It's called 'man can conquer nature'!"</p><p></p><p>"To help the Separated World overcome the Fire World, it still requires the people of the Separated World themselves!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan stretched out his hand, and a small white jade tower appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the [Immortal Spirit Tower]. As long as there are enough raw materials, it can release an endless stream of spiritual energy day and night."</p><p></p><p>"With a mortal body, one naturally cannot help the Separated World. Only by becoming a cultivator can one have the qualifications to participate in and even dominate the struggle between worlds."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing looked at the [Immortal Spirit Tower] in Li Fan's hand and indeed felt bursts of spiritual energy gushing out from it.</p><p></p><p>But when she looked at the Immortal Spirit Tower, Su Yuqing also felt a faint bloody smell, which made her frown.</p><p>"This little girl, her perception is truly sharp." Li Fan saw through Su Yuqing's expression and couldn't help but nod secretly.</p><p></p><p>That's right. This so-called Immortal Spirit Tower was actually casually refined by Li Fan based on the empire's [Spiritual Qi Synthesis] technology.</p><p></p><p>The essence is to use a large amount of exotic beast flesh and blood to generate spiritual qi crystals. Then, it is further decomposed into spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>For this, Li Fan even made a special trip to the Beast Realm.</p><p></p><p>He collected a large batch of exotic beast flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>As for the Xuan Bird Feathers and Xu Ke's essence blood, they were deep in the Beast Realm.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current Golden Core stage cultivation, it was a bit difficult to forcibly obtain them. So, he put them aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Although the empire's spiritual qi synthesis technology has a very low energy conversion efficiency,</p><p></p><p>it has the advantage of low cost.</p><p></p><p>If it is possible to breed exotic beasts on a large scale and solve the problem of the source of exotic beast flesh and blood,</p><p></p><p>then it is almost possible to generate spiritual qi endlessly.</p><p></p><p>For small worlds without spiritual veins, it is indeed a good method.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not conceal how the Immortal Spirit Tower generates spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he displayed the scene of the flesh and blood factory inside it in vivid detail to Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing had never seen such a scene before. Her face turned pale, and she vomited on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, "Compared to the survival of the entire world, what do these few killings count for?"</p><p></p><p>"Pretentious!"</p><p></p><p>He scolded mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing opened her mouth, instinctively wanting to refute.</p><p></p><p>In the end, she fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand to remove the filth in the room, Li Fan told Su Yuqing the complete plan to save the world.</p><p></p><p>The first step is to select the group of people with the most outstanding talent for leaving the realm. Use the Immortal Spirit Tower to cultivate them into the first batch of immortal cultivators in Dali.</p><p></p><p>The second step is to send them deep into the Fire Realm to absorb and bring back the various flames that contain the world's source power.</p><p></p><p>The third step is for the cultivators who have fused with powerful flames to use their own strength to transform Dali.</p><p></p><p>As one side wanes and the other waxes, the Boundary Realm will inevitably become increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>And the Fire Realm will gradually fall into a disadvantageous position.</p><p></p><p>"This is only the result of extrapolation. The specifics still need to be taken step by step. After all, the struggle between worlds involves too high a level. It's not something that cultivators can fully predict," Li Fan sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing firmly remembered the Immortal Master's words in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Because she had a premonition that the Immortal Master in front of her would not stay in Dali for too long.</p><p></p><p>"The path of immortality is difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal techniques cannot be cultivated together either."</p><p></p><p>"I can only help you get started. If you want more, perhaps you still need to go to the Xuanhuang Realm and explore on your own!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan pointed a finger at Su Yuqing's glabella.</p><p></p><p>A total of twenty cultivation methods, including the "Thousand Mechanisms Jade Disc Golden Chapter," appeared in her mind.</p><p></p><p>However, only the Golden Chapter was a Nascent Soul stage cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The rest were only at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment levels.</p><p></p><p>They were ownerless cultivation methods that Li Fan had collected during his successive reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate the Thousand Mechanisms Jade Disc Golden Chapter yourself."</p><p></p><p>"As for the rest, you can give them to suitable people," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Master, are you leaving?" Su Yuqing couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, "I am originally a passerby. I came to this realm unintentionally. However, I couldn't bear to see living beings suffer, so I took action to save them. Now that I have done what I can, of course I will leave."</p><p></p><p>It was just the resources for cultivating the [Sitting Immortal Technique]. Li Fan naturally wouldn't waste too much time here.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"After all, it's hard to advise a stubborn ghost."</p><p></p><p>"The organization doesn't necessarily need your help."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the three of them were elites selected by the empire, with extraordinary determination.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the pale faces gradually relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng replied, "Senior, this matter is of great importance. We really can't make decisions on our own..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan straightforwardly said, "I'll give you two months."</p><p></p><p>"Two months later, I will come back here, and I need your clear answer."</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng forced himself to agree with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>"Involving organization secrets, as a precaution, we need to take some measures." Li Fan looked at the three of them and flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng felt a cool breeze entering his body, and in a blink of an eye, the hidden sensation disappeared, no longer detectable.</p><p></p><p>But they dared not say anything and just nodded to show their understanding.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Fan took out a hundred high-quality spiritual stones from his storage ring and handed them to the three from the empire.</p><p></p><p>"This is a rule of the organization. It's customary to show some care for the first meeting."</p><p></p><p>"However, even with ten thousand points of contribution, you may not be able to impress everyone."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked outside the secret chamber at several completed Qi refiners still asleep.</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Building Masters. The method is not bad. Although as Qi refiners, the amount they can scrape clean from each person is limited. But building up quantity, there is still a considerable gain."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Shaotang looked embarrassed, unsure of how to respond.</p><p></p><p>"But there are no forever unbreakable lies in the world. Once you join the organization in the future, you should stop. If you wish for contribution points, the organization will help you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came suddenly and left quickly.</p><p></p><p>After saying a few words, he rushed into the sky, disappearing from the view of the three.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind a deathly silence in the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>"What use is there for contribution points? Unable to break away from the Xuanhuang World, wanting to establish another tradition is simply impossible." After a long time, Xiao Jin said somewhat despondently.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Shaotang then looked at Li Chenfeng and asked, "Senior Li, what do you think? How much of what that person said was true, and how much was false?"</p><p></p><p>As infiltrators into the Xuanhuang World, they were highly cautious about everything.</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by the unexpected cultivator, they naturally couldn't fully believe.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Chenfeng answered, "It should be true."</p><p></p><p>"This person's cultivation is unfathomable. The beast deity armor within me theoretically can contend with Golden Core cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"But in front of this person, it was easily played with, completely powerless to resist."</p><p></p><p>"And the method that makes one fall into a dream."</p><p></p><p>A trace of fear flickered in Li Chenfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If he really has malicious intent, we..."</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng shook his head, falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to say, remained unspoken.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, we need to quickly relay the message back." Zhu Shaotang said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I will personally return to the empire to explain this matter. However, the final result will depend on the decisions of the think tank and the emperor's daughter."</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, sacrifices of generations for an impossible task. I'm afraid after this news spreads, the empire will face another purge." Zhu Shaotang sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng did not respond, but the gloom in his eyes was uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>Without delay, he activated the beast deity armor, swiftly flew in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng stopped in the airspace above a certain sea area, then suddenly dived down, disappearing into the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>Transforming the appearance of the beast deity armor, he seemed to morph into the form of a deep-sea monster.</p><p></p><p>Changing directions again.</p><p></p><p>Doing so several times, he finally emerged from the Misty Cloud Sea and entered the Stone Linger State.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins deep in the mountains' valleys, his figure ultimately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>â€¦</p><p></p><p>"Quite cautious, but all in vain."</p><p></p><p>Having learned of the entrance to the empire, Li Fan temporarily shifted his focus from there.</p><p></p><p>At this time, instead of returning to Wanxian Island, he came to the depths of the sea and excavated a hidden chamber.</p><p></p><p>Arranging rituals in the four corners, Li Fan was about to explore the Meteor Immortal Realm for the first time in this world.</p><p></p><p>"It's really interesting. I wonder if the scenes encountered in the Meteor Immortal Realm will be different from the previous life."</p><p></p><p>"Will it be returning to Ningyuan City, meeting Senior Brother Zhang, or appearing at the Imperial Beast Sect or some other place?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan muttered, "Fusheng Xuanhuang Tianzun," and his surroundings gradually blurred.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan opened his eyes, feeling a stir in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before him, appeared Senior Brother Zhang's concerned face.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Qianmo..."</p><p></p><p>Knowing about Zhang Qianmo's future achievements, Li Fan looked at this Senior Brother of his with a completely different gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I have become more handsome again? Why do I feel your gaze is strange, Junior Brother?" Zhang Qianmo touched his chin, smiling and asking.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan restrained his unusual emotions, and as he had done before, he chatted casually with Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>When Zhang Qianmo mentioned his three great wishes again.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the last life where he was shocked into silence, Li Fan clapped his hands and admired, "If you meet other cultivators who are merely Foundation Building cultivators and dare to boast so shamelessly, I will definitely summon a Purple Sky Divine Thunder and directly strike them dead."</p><p></p><p>"However, coming from Senior Brother Zhang's mouth, for some reason, I find it quite reasonable!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo laughed heartily, patting Li Fan's shoulder, "When did Junior Brother also learn to flatter? But I really like your words!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to chat with Senior Brother Zhang nonchalantly amidst the praise.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan casually asked, "Speaking of which, Senior Brother, if one day all your wishes really come true, what would happen?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo was suddenly stunned.</p><p></p><p>After thinking seriously for a moment, he replied, "Many things in the world have their ups and downs. Resurgence from the ashes is also common."</p><p></p><p>"Take the extermination of the demonic beings for example, even if I had truly done it at some point. I cannot guarantee that in the future, there won't be demonic beings reappearing on the land."</p><p></p><p>"With my temperament, I would probably leave behind a 'Grand Wish Dharma Body' to forever suppress them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but ask curiously, "Senior Brother, what is this Grand Wish Dharma Body?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo smiled, "It's just an unrealistic fantasy. You can think of it as a flesh body transformed into a law of heaven and earth, existing forever."</p><p></p><p>"If specific conditions trigger it, the Dharma Body will manifest in the world."</p><p></p><p>"For example, even after the extinction of demonic beings, if major demons resurface, the 'Demon-slaying' Grand Wish Dharma Body will appear to vanquish them."</p><p></p><p>"By doing so, we can ensure continuity for eternity, with the grand wish enduring."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, what do you think of my method?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you are truly a genius!" Li Fan praised wholeheartedly.</p>

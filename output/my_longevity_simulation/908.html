        <h1>Chapter 908</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Among them, the one with the strongest resonance and feedback was none other than Su Yuqing from the Boundary. Perhaps it was because she had truly gained benefits from cultivation, her faith in the "Red Dust Compassionate Immortal" was the purest and most fervent.</p><p></p><p>Compared to not long ago, Li Fan was now able to observe the situation around her. At this moment, he could even occasionally sense her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the grace bestowed by the True Immortal, I was able to lead everyone back safely from this conquest of the Fire World."</p><p></p><p>"This humble girl dares not violate her previous promise. From now on, I am willing to serve by your side for life, loyal until death."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing respectfully kowtowed several times to the faceless stone statue she had carved herself.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Fan noticed a mysterious power traversing the limitations of time and space, descending upon him. It was only a thin thread, almost negligible compared to his vast power, like a drop in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was somewhat similar to the feedback from the Sitting Immortal Technique, but the energy essence was not the same. When this power appeared within his body, it was distinct from his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Instead of surging towards his dantian, it lurked towards Li Fan's sea of consciousness. Li Fan, who had always been wary of the faceless immortal, how could he let it succeed?</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light surged, forming layers upon layers of a cocoon, encasing this foreign energy. After being sealed, the reaction of this energy was a bit unexpected to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>There was no intense resistance, it just quietly settled down. Unlike Li Fan's own spiritual power that emitted a glowing white light, although this energy was only an extremely weak thread, it could shine like gold.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that its grade was slightly higher than spiritual power. Li Fan carefully observed this golden energy, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this was due to the effect of the faceless immortal stone statue, transforming Su Yuqing's gratitude and faith into this form.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the legendary power of faith? Or the power of the wishes of all beings?"</p><p></p><p>"Or something else?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there's too little information. For now, let's call it the power of wishes."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was solemn. Even though he knew this golden power of wishes was a poisoned candy, at this moment, Li Fan had no choice but to swallow it.</p><p></p><p>The connection between the statue and him had been established. Unless he immediately returned to reality, no matter how far he was from the stone statue, this golden power of wishes would always appear within his body.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this golden power of wishes did not only appear once. As Su Yuqing continued to pray devoutly, after a while, another thread of golden power of wishes formed.</p><p></p><p>Following the same trajectory, it surged towards Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Those cultivators who have made vows before the stone statue have in fact all become machines generating the golden power of wishes."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they cannot do it like Su Yuqing now, as time passes, the subtle influence of the faceless stone statue on them will grow deeper and deeper."</p><p></p><p>"One day, they will also be like this."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, startled but calm, pondering countermeasures. At the same time, he still used the seven-colored divine light to accurately isolate these golden powers of wishes.</p><p></p><p>Gathering them together with the previous ones. As it turned out, Li Fan's reincarnation through many lifetimes and collecting various secrets everywhere was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, he thought of a countermeasure. After some experimentation, the effect was surprisingly excellent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan released the seven-colored divine light...</p><p></p><p>(The translation ends here as the excerpt is incomplete.)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Guang sealed off the golden power of wishes, then forcibly guided these foreign energies, slowly gathering them in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>When they were still not quite settled and wanted to move towards the sea of consciousness,</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly took shape in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>Like a vortex, it sucked in the golden power of wishes that was just about to leave.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed effective." Li Fan was delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This figure was the [Tribulation Body] that Li Fan used to store overflowing cultivation when he hit a bottleneck in his cultivation before.</p><p></p><p>He had not been stuck in a bottleneck for a long time, and there was no overflowing or wasted feedback cultivation, so naturally he had not used this Tribulation Body technique for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, when facing this troublesome golden power of wishes, it had a miraculous effect.</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Body secret technique came from the "Taishang Original True Scripture".</p><p></p><p>In the ancient cultivation world, there were occasionally cultivators whose cultivation speed was too fast, leading to an unstable foundation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the cultivators needed to actively suppress their own realm and consolidate their foundation.</p><p></p><p>Each sect had different methods.</p><p></p><p>The method adopted by the Taishang Sect was to form a figure in the dantian to accommodate the excess cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Because the Taishang Sect believed that an unstable foundation was one of the tribulations of cultivation, this figure used to deal with tribulations was also called the [Tribulation Body].</p><p></p><p>"The true teachings of the Taishang Sect originate from the Great Dharma Master of Tiandu."</p><p></p><p>"It's not surprising that it can deal with this golden power of wishes that clearly exceeds the spiritual power level."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>With the [Tribulation Body] to contain it, the golden power of wishes also seemed to have found its destination.</p><p></p><p>Next, without Li Fan's deliberate guidance, it would gather towards the golden Tribulation Body in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The crisis is temporarily resolved."</p><p></p><p>"This Tribulation Body is a separate entity and can be abandoned at any time without any impact on the true body."</p><p></p><p>"Even in the worst case, if the Tribulation Body forms a separate individual like Xu Bai in the 115th world without its own thoughts, it will be easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>"At present, it is just a simple energy crystal, and no other abnormalities have appeared."</p><p></p><p>After carefully observing and confirming again, Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that as more and more golden power of wishes was absorbed and contained, this Tribulation Body could even be directly detonated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not sure how powerful the explosion would be at that time.</p><p></p><p>But he understood that directly detonating it might only be the lowest level use of the golden power of wishes.</p><p></p><p>"Living on the edge of a blade..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan muttered in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He also knew the potential risks behind this golden power of wishes.</p><p></p><p>But with Huan Zhen backing him up, he didn't have to be so timid about everything.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering how to deal with this golden power of wishes in the future,</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt another abnormality in his body!</p><p></p><p>And the source of this abnormality...</p><p></p><p>It was the dark golden skull sealed by the seven-colored divine light in the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, and the gray mold residing within it!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the golden Tribulation Body had now accumulated a certain level of power of wishes.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was sealed in the Grotto-Heaven, the gray mold also sensed the existence of the golden power of wishes.</p><p></p><p>Like a starved beast suddenly smelling a strong scent of blood, the gray mold surged out of the skull for the first time, frantically attacking the surrounding walls of seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light was being consumed at a terrifying speed.</p>

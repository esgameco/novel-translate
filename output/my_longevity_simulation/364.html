            <p>In the vast white mist, Li Fan paused his work. Hearing He Chen's report, Li Fan slightly furrowed his brows, feeling somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He had only met He Chen briefly in a philosophical discussion; they had never formally met in the real world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's expression, He Chen lowered his voice and said, "According to Zhong Shentong, he has a method to extend Master Li's lifespan. However, he insists on meeting you in person."</p><p></p><p>"Although he only has foundational cultivation, his colorful divine light is truly extraordinary, able to resist even the devouring white mist. The elders in the Immortal Stronghold also speak highly of him."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Zhong Shentong has a wide social circle, and this time, he was introduced and guaranteed by a Nascent Soul cultivator before the Immortal Stronghold allowed him to come."</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, it wouldn't hurt to meet him," He Chen suggested.</p><p></p><p>Among the practitioners rescued by Li Fan at the Jiaxu Stronghold two years ago, He Chen was the most grateful towards him.</p><p></p><p>Even when Li Fan's life was about to end, he was determined to continue constructing the formations on the frontline.</p><p></p><p>He Chen held an immense admiration for Li Fan, almost to the point of fanaticism, eagerly following his instructions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly and said, "In that case, take me to meet this Zhong Shentong."</p><p></p><p>However, he thought to himself: "When you feel sleepy, you find a pillow. Leaving aside whether the lifespan extension method is real or fake, it's good to have an idea of the origin of his colorful divine light."</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Jiaxu Stronghold, in the meeting hall, an elderly man with white hair and a Daoist robe had been waiting for some time.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan stepped in, Zhong Shentong's gaze instantly focused on him.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a glance, Li Fan first greeted, "Friend Zhong, I've heard of your name for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong sighed, "There is no falsehood under a great reputation; the rumors about you are indeed true. Friend, your lifespan is rapidly declining, nearing its end."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, He Chen's expression turned somewhat hostile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, gestured for He Chen to leave.</p><p></p><p>After they were alone in the hall, Li Fan arched his hand and asked, "Friend, is there a deeper meaning in your words?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong nodded, "I've had similar experiences before, which is why I can be certain about you."</p><p></p><p>"Not to hide it from you, I was skeptical about your achievements when I heard about them in the outside world. However, my own experiences made me fully aware of how imminent death can bring a tremendous sense of fear and despair."</p><p></p><p>"While I once prided myself on resilience, I was on the verge of collapsing. It took me a long time to recover. But compared to you..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong shook his head, "Friend seems to be overseeing formation construction in the white mist, disregarding his own life... This level is beyond my reach!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "I know my life cannot be saved, so I try to do a bit more whenever possible. As for how noble that is..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't quite see it that way," Li Fan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's expression brightened, "Yes, it's this kind of detached and carefree attitude."</p><p></p><p>"How did you achieve it, friend? Please teach me!" He made a deep bow, sincerely asking for guidance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swiftly dodged the bow, saying, "Your actions are mysterious and your behavior is puzzling. If you have more to say, don't blame me for turning hostile! Your colorful divine light may be powerful, but I'm not afraid of you!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong sighed and apologized, "Forgive my rashness."</p><p></p><p>Straightening up, he pondered for a moment before slowly continuing, "What I mentioned earlier about a method to extend your lifespan is indeed true."</p><p></p><p>"And my desire to seek guidance from you is genuine."</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of my story, friend?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong asked Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "I've heard some. You are known for achieving greatness at a late age."</p><p></p><p>"In your sixties, as a mortal, you cultivated Qi. After decades of cultivation, you finally reached the foundational level."</p><p></p><p>"You never gave up hope of advancing until your death, and I admire you for that."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhong Shentong blushed.</p><p></p><p>Looking around and seeing no one nearby, he whispered, "Friend, you're too kind in your praise."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, there's another hidden reason behind all this."</p><p></p><p>"It's also related to my visit to you this time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was slightly strange, but he nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Clearing his throat, Zhong Shentong said, "Friend, have you ever heard of procrastination?"</p><p></p><p>"Procrastination?" Li Fan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my friend, I suffer from a very severe case of procrastination. It's incurable," Zhong Shentong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"When I was eighteen, I happened to obtain a profound technique. However, as I began my cultivation, I lacked the drive. Thinking I was still young and had plenty of time ahead, I became more and more lax in my practice."</p><p></p><p>"Three days fishing, two days sunbathing. I lived carefreely until my fifties, still unable to break through to the Qi refining stage."</p><p></p><p>"And I still wasn't worried at that time."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong squinted, as if lost in reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>"Proud of my physical condition at the time, I thought I could live to seventy or eighty years old, with thirty more years to enjoy life."</p><p></p><p>"Until one day, I accidentally consumed a poisonous fruit."</p><p></p><p>"Although I survived, my body was on the brink of collapse, nearing its end."</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly, death felt so close, and I was overwhelmed by an unprecedented fear."</p><p></p><p>"The terror between life and death was immense!"</p><p></p><p>"So, I thought that advancing to the Qi refining stage would greatly extend my lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"As if grasping at a lifeline, I abandoned all other thoughts and focused solely on cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Under the pressure of death, my cultivation speed exceeded my imagination. Within just one day and night, I successfully stepped into the Qi refining stage!"</p><p></p><p>"But afterward, with my extended lifespan, I lost all motivation again. Thinking I had many years left to live, I preferred to enjoy life first."</p><p></p><p>"And decades later, when I reached the limit of my lifespan once more..."</p><p></p><p>After Zhong Shentong finished speaking, Li Fan's expression became incredibly strange.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't lying, this person was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"So, what is this method to extend one's lifespan that you mentioned?" Li Fan tried to maintain a friendly demeanor as he patiently inquired.</p><p></p><p>Full of confidence, Zhong Shentong said, "I heard that your remaining lifespan is short and you've given up on advancing to the Yuan Infant stage. But in my opinion, that's unnecessary!"</p>

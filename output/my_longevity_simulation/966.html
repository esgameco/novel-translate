        <h1>Chapter 966</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, it's me, Mo Rubin. New 69 Bookstore 85 SHUX.COM" This time, before the person arrived, Mo Rubin hurriedly greeted first.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan only snorted coldly: "If you want to get close, at least recognize the right person!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he once again launched an attack on the newly formed Mo Rubin incarnation in his own consciousness sea.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't mobilize the spiritual power of other cultivators, just relying on the myriad spiritual demons of thoughts and intentions, this attack was also extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>But after all, there was a big gap compared to the previous blow that defeated Mo Rubin. In order to cover it up, Li Fan deliberately pretended to be a little hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, wait a moment!" Mo Rubin easily broke the offensive.</p><p></p><p>Noticing Li Fan's hesitation, he hurriedly continued: "I know your memory may be a bit lacking, but you should still have some impression of the Xuantian Sect back then, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect..." Li Fan's offensive seemed to gradually slow down as if in thought.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mo Rubin's face showed a happy expression.</p><p></p><p>"No! There is no such thing as the Xuantian Sect! There is only the supreme Red Dust Compassionate Immortal!" Suddenly, Li Fan's face changed and he stared coldly at Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>On this gloomy and ghostly sky curtain, the image of the faceless true immortal statue slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Like a great sun, it dispelled the darkness and illuminated the world.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Statue?!" Seeing this statue that had disappeared from the world for a long time, Mo Rubin was even more certain of his judgment. New 85 Bookstore → 85shux.com</p><p></p><p>"Bold heretic! How dare you misinterpret the supreme Red Dust Compassionate Immortal!" Li Fan's eyes showed a hint of madness, and his entire spiritual consciousness seemed to be touched by something, shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>The myriad spiritual demons also glared at Mo Rubin with ferocious looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, don't hurt your own people by mistake! This..."</p><p></p><p>"The supreme Red Dust Compassionate Immortal Statue is actually the Xuantian Statue!"</p><p></p><p>"You and I are originally one family!" Mo Rubin tried his best to appease Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"One family?" Upon hearing this, Li Fan's manic state eased a bit.</p><p></p><p>"So, you are also a believer of the supreme Red Dust Compassionate Immortal?" He looked at Mo Rubin and asked a little suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was at a loss for words for a moment, but seeing that Li Fan had a tendency to go mad again, he had no choice but to nod: "Uh, I guess so."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, why didn't you say so earlier!" Only then did Li Fan completely let down his guard.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the myriad demon gods and the blood moon in the sky all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>On a vast white land, only Mo Rubin and Li Fan were facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"How come I have never seen you before? Could it be that the True Immortal has left another lineage elsewhere?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? No, I seem to have gone to find you not long ago?"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? No, who am I?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was originally doing quite well, showed symptoms of madness again in an instant. New 69 Bookstore → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin frowned secretly: "These symptoms seem to be much more severe than back then. But this cultivation technique's aura is exactly the same. It can't be wrong..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, no matter what happened in the past, as long as our goals are consistent, it's fine." At that moment, Mo Rubin tried to wake Li Fan up.</p><p></p><p>And then he suddenly realized: "That's right! The Dao of Heaven is dim, and the True Immortal's lineage is nowhere to be seen in the world. I must set things right and make the name of the Compassionate Immortal shine upon the world once again!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the faceless statue in the sky seemed to respond to Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The words spoken were ordinary, but a faint golden light appeared above them.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the golden light, Mo Rubin's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He subconsciously distanced himself a little.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, whose expression seemed a bit dazed, he hesitated for a moment before speaking up to attract the other party's attention.</p><p></p><p>"With our great undertaking yet to be accomplished, how can we face the True Immortal? Brother Xingwang, it's better to wait until the day when the True Immortal's orthodox teachings are truly restored before requesting merit from her." Mo Rubin said in a deep voice, with a hint of implication.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately stood in solemn respect: "Little brother, your enlightenment is even higher than mine?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other party call him little brother, Mo Rubin did not refute it.</p><p></p><p>Back then in the sect, Sun Xingwang did indeed address him this way.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he hasn't completely gone crazy." Mo Rubin secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Mo Rubin with a serious expression: "But what you said makes some sense. Without achieving something, we indeed have no face to pay such frequent visits to the True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Mumbling to himself, the faceless stone statue's influence in the sky disappeared along with it.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Mo Rubin let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, do you have any impression of the other brothers and sisters in the sect?" Mo Rubin asked, seeing that Li Fan's emotions had stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Li Fan's brows immediately furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to fall into deep recollection.</p><p></p><p>"The others..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression kept changing, and he repeated a few words under his breath.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Jian, Old Cui, Big Brother Xuanyuan..."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan? Xuanyuan, Xuanyuan..."</p><p></p><p>After that, he just kept repeating the two characters "Xuanyuan", and the originally calm sea of consciousness stirred up waves again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he really couldn't get any answers, Mo Rubin had to give up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Brother Xingwang. Let's talk about the past later. Let me ask you, the 'Divine Possession' incidents in various states are your handiwork, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said proudly: "That's right! As of now, there are already 36,513 cultivators who have fallen under my control. Under the day and night influence of my divine thoughts, they will soon become loyal believers of the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"In such a short time, there are already more than 30,000 people! Unifying the world is just around the corner!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin shook his head slightly: "The Myriad Immortal Alliance has already paid great attention to this matter. I knew it might be you, Brother Xingwang, so I took the initiative to take on this matter, just to give you a heads up."</p><p></p><p>"Stop it, Brother Xingwang. 30,000 cultivators is almost enough. If the situation becomes more serious, it will definitely lead to the intervention of other Dharma transmitters. By then, you may even risk exposure." Mo Rubin persuaded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rejected it on the spot: "Stop? Why? I hide in the dark, no one can detect me. Divine Possession is like weeds, burning them will not exhaust them, and the spring breeze will blow them again. Under the heavens, who can do anything to me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was quite arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin sighed: "It's not that the Myriad Immortal Alliance is really powerless against this. It's just that the incident hasn't reached the corresponding level yet."</p><p></p><p>"If you continue..."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, since I can find your sea of consciousness through the bodies of those cultivators, other Dharma transmitters can naturally do the same."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was playing the role of a deranged cultivator, he was not stupid.</p><p></p><p>He did not refute on the spot and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Mo Rubin, as if remembering something, and suddenly said, "You have indeed occupied that Dharma transmitter's body."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was slightly startled: "Brother Xingwang, have you regained your memory?"</p>

            <p>Luckily, he reacted quickly. Otherwise, if hit by this sword light, not only would his body be destroyed, but he might also harm the foundation of his practice.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, he wasn't too unlucky and wasn't too close. Otherwise, being tainted by the immortal and mortal miasma, not only would his body be affected, but it might even damage his prospects further.</p><p></p><p>"Lishi is so far away, yet the impact of the transport has been so significant," Li Fan shivered and replenished his consumed luck from the feather of the Xuan Niao. He quietly activated the "Realm of Destiny" to prevent being influenced by luck depletion again.</p><p></p><p>The smoke dissipated below, revealing a large pit with a wooden sword stuck straight in the bottom.</p><p></p><p>It seemed familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Oops, my friend, I'm really sorry!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the owner of the wooden sword arrived slowly, looking embarrassed and guilty as he spoke to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of my inadequate skills, almost endangering my friend's life!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards the newcomer. Although he didn't recognize him, Li Fan was not unfamiliar with this person.</p><p></p><p>He was the well-known second generation of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, the obedient son of Feixue Xianzun, nicknamed "I Am Invincible" - Shuofeng!</p><p></p><p>However, not long ago when he appeared in the "friendly exchange competition" between the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association, he was still at the Nascent Divinity stage.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed, Shuofeng had only reached the Foundation Building realm!</p><p></p><p>"Not hiding cultivation, is this because of stimulation and re-cultivation?" Li Fan's gaze swept over Shuofeng, with a barely noticeable glint in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Shuofeng, my friend!" Li Fan bowed politely, "I thought it was just some hoodlums from the Five Elders Association causing trouble again!"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng blushed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not surprised that the other party recognized him, he explained quickly: "It's a misunderstanding. I was cultivating in the air originally, but somehow this wooden sword suddenly went out of control. Luckily, my friend reacted quickly, or else I would have caused unnecessary trouble again!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's fine. I could see that my friend didn't mean it. However, Shuo, how did you end up at this realm?" Li Fan examined him, intentionally showing a hint of confusion on his face, before asking.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng didn't hide it, admitting, "It's nothing. I just felt I took the wrong path before, so I decided to start over!"</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had known about it earlier, he still appeared shocked. After observing Shuofeng for a while, he shook his head slightly and sighed, "The Nascent Divinity realm is already the ultimate goal that the vast majority of cultivators dream of achieving. But my friend, you have such courage to restart your cultivation so easily..."</p><p></p><p>"Admire, admire!" Li Fan praised sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng smiled wryly, not taking it to heart: "I am not worthy of such high praise from my friend. I am only slightly above ordinary people because my mother has my back. Even if my cultivation restart fails, I would just be a Foundation Building cultivator for life. How many in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance would dare to look down on me? If an ordinary cultivator fails, their life would be irredeemably over."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled without agreeing or disagreeing.</p><p></p><p>He shifted his gaze to the wooden sword in the huge pit below, frowning, "Although you are restarting your cultivation, it seems you are not an ordinary cultivator. Judging by the speed and power of this wooden sword, it could easily kill even a Golden Core cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng also agreed, "My friend has sharp eyes, this wooden sword..."</p><p></p><p>He paused and continued, "To be honest, this sword is the mystical object I obtained when I restarted my cultivation this time. Although I successfully built my foundation using this, I still can't completely control it."</p><p></p><p>"Quite troublesome." Saying so, Shuofeng pointed downwards.</p><p></p><p>However, the sword in the pit just wobbled lightly for a moment, not responding to Shuofeng's call, remaining stuck in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Although Shuofeng was extraordinary, a hint of embarrassment appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Coughing lightly, Shuofeng tried thrice before finally calling back the sword.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully observed the wooden sword in front of him. It was no longer just "plain and ordinary."</p><p></p><p>There were no patterns on the sword, no mysterious aura emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>It could even be described as "crude," like a child's toy made simply out of wood.</p><p></p><p>But from its previous formidable strike, Li Fan knew this item was anything but ordinary.</p><p></p><p>With a sudden idea, Li Fan proposed: "This sword is quite interesting. Interestingly, I have a slight understanding of the way of the sword. However, I've been unable to find a suitable opponent to spar with. How about..."</p><p></p><p>Excitedly, Shuofeng clapped his hands in agreement, "I just broke through and was looking for a suitable opponent to practice with. My friend's words hit the mark!"</p><p></p><p>His expression serious, Shuofeng lightly grabbed the wooden sword, stepped back a distance, and pointed at Li Fan, "Let's begin!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Li Fan replied loudly.</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, ninety-nine blue water swords had already taken shape. They formed a sword array in the air and swiftly flew towards Shuofeng.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan using the power of the water attribute from his cave domain, centered around the secret technique of the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace's "Shifting Sea Divine Sword," mimicking and executing a deadly move. He didn't hold back despite Shuofeng being only a Foundation Building cultivator, calling upon the full strength of his cave domain.</p><p></p><p>"Water Dragon's Song!"</p><p></p><p>With a shout from Li Fan, the blue water swords instantly transformed into numerous water dragons and fiercely attacked various parts of Shuofeng's body.</p><p></p><p>Facing Li Fan's seemingly merciless attack, Shuofeng showed no signs of fear but rather excitement.</p><p></p><p>With closed eyes, as the eighty-one water swords were about to reach him, he slowly drew his sword.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly slow but actually extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The wooden sword clashed with each blue water sword, emitting crisp metallic sounds.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the wooden sword had moved and clashed with all the water swords.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng sheathed his sword.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly exhausted, his arms trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, the eighty-one blue water swords that should have been under Li Fan's control unexpectedly turned against him, attacking him instead.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a more intricate change, as the assembled azure water dragon seemed to come alive in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, a dragon's roar could be heard, as the sword aura roared and came rushing towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"What's this..."</p><p></p><p>While a flash of insight passed through Li Fan's eyes, his reaction was anything but slow.</p><p></p><p>The world was instantly illuminated by the blue light.</p><p></p><p>A sword light slashed out from Li Fan's body, powerful and unstoppable, tearing through the azure water dragon.</p><p></p><p>The momentum did not wane; in an instant, it reached Shuofeng's face.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

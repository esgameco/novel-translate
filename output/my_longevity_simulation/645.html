        <h1>Chapter 645</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Now, after Black Flame descended for less than half a day, it had already boiled the entire Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>The hazy water vapor continuously rose, forming thick mist resembling clouds, floating above the sea.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the situation, it was feared that in just a few days, the Cloud Sea would completely dry up!</p><p></p><p>The disparity between Red Flame and Black Flame could be seen from this.</p><p></p><p>"But compared to the terrifying power of Mo Kill that destroys everything, there is still some distance." Li Fan looked at the boiling and rolling sea below, silently contemplating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Grand Sun Immortal Lord had flown back.</p><p></p><p>"The earth veins!"</p><p></p><p>He hastily uttered a sentence, then continuously struck countless talismans in his hands, manipulating the Heavenly Yuan Formation.</p><p></p><p>The scenery on the light curtain changed. A glowing giant net appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw that the outer periphery of this net was already tainted black!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Black Flame was using the power of the earth veins that flowed incessantly throughout the Cloud Sea to rapidly conduct its heat to every corner of the sea.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder His presence has been unseen all this time. Not only has the strength evolved, even intelligence has improved?" Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Extract the earth veins, force Him to appear!" The Grand Sun Immortal Lord's face showed a hint of fierceness as he spoke with a stern tone.</p><p></p><p>The earth veins are the foundation of the earth, once damaged, not to mention the upheaval of the terrain within the province, various strange changes might occur. Perhaps it would no longer be suitable for cultivators to reside there.</p><p></p><p>Without a last resort, it would never be done. Even if one managed to survive a disaster, they would not escape the punishment of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the cultivators who had committed the act of "killing their companions" were not concerned about much else.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Yuan Formation, which was originally connected through various earth vein nodes, was now reversed and began to extract power from the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>Buzz...</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a strange sound echoed in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the earth was overturning, and mountains and rivers were splitting.</p><p></p><p>The already boiling sea water began to riot even more. Waves surged on the Cloud Sea once again. Even the sky had inexplicably gathered black clouds rolling towards it.</p><p></p><p>The roaring waves shook the sea.</p><p></p><p>In the face of this might of heaven and earth, all the cultivators in the Cloud City were ashen-faced and trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>However, after absorbing the earthy yellow earth vein energy, the defensive formation of Cloud City became thicker and more resilient. In this scene of destruction, it was like a safe house in a storm, immovable as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>This gave the cultivators a little bit of courage.</p><p></p><p>The storm grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>As the Cloud Sea surface continued to descend, shallow parts of the seabed started to be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Different from the usual scenes of sea floor mud, the seabed at this moment was covered entirely with a layer of black unknown substance.</p><p></p><p>It was like stones completely burnt by fire.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid even after this calamity passes, it will take decades or even hundreds of years for the Cloud Sea to return to its original state."</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators sighed as they witnessed this scene.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Black Flame had not yet appeared, the Grand Sun was determined.</p><p></p><p>"Continue, don't stop!"</p><p></p><p>As the thunderous sound of the fractured seabed reverberated, the Heavenly Yuan Formation continued to operate at maximum power.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if reaching a certain threshold, fiery lava erupted from the seabed.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if triggering a chain reaction, fire dragons appeared in various parts of the Cloud Sea, and magma jetted towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Millions of fire dragons stirred, scorching the sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the distorted air, a figure half-red and half-black quietly appeared below the Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>"It finally appeared!"</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Grand Sun Immortal Lord flashed with a hint of killing intent and greed as his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his figure transformed into a continuous mountain range, surrounding it at the center.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>"Red Flame! The soul of heaven and earth, Red Flame!"</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the evolved appearance of the Red Flame, the cultivators were all overwhelmed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had witnessed its terrifying power to incinerate the sea with a wave of its hand, they could not extinguish the desire in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"So it's not a meteor disaster, but the soul of heaven and earth has descended!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's fate! A great fate!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just a few breaths later, the cultivators were completely swallowed by greed. Some incited everyone to go hunt down the Red Flame together.</p><p></p><p>Many lost their minds and directly charged towards the Red Flame like moths to a flame, and were instantly incinerated by the scorching heat before they could get close.</p><p></p><p>"It's still Red Flame, not Black Flame." Li Fan did not care about the lives of these people, but instead focused on the mutated Red Flame, half-red and half-black, with a pensive look.</p><p></p><p>This clone also harbored the same greed in its heart.</p><p></p><p>However, at the same time, it did not lose its sanity as the previous incarnations had almost done when encountering the Red Flame.</p><p></p><p>The main body did not deliberately activate the Mystic Golden Heart Mantra, so the greed brought by the clone dissipated spontaneously.</p><p></p><p>Like ice melting in water, it only caused slight ripples, without any actual effect.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal cultivation techniques are truly extraordinary. Not only is the main mind clear now, even the clone thousands of miles away remains unchanged."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly sighed.</p><p></p><p>To avoid revealing any flaws, Li Fan continued to pretend to be deeply attracted by the soul of heaven and earth, looking as if he was struggling to resist.</p><p></p><p>Eyes red, veins bulging, he stiffened in place.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see where the Grand Sun Immortal Lord's courage to face Red Flame alone came from.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that even in the weakened state of the Red Flame in the previous life, the Grand Sun, along with several other Deva Gods, were not His match.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Black and Red intertwined Red Flame of this life.</p><p></p><p>Without any other options, the Grand Sun Immortal Lord was afraid he would be instantly killed by Him.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, the Grand Sun was not such a reckless person.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's gaze, the Grand Sun flew to the front of the Red Flame.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a range of mountains briefly trapped Him. At the same time, he raised a small mirror in his hand, pointing it towards the Red Flame!</p><p></p><p>"What is this..." Li Fan's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>"Mystic Heaven Sealing Spirit!" The Grand Sun Immortal Lord shouted.</p><p></p><p>A translucent blue light shot out from the square mirror, directly aimed at the Red Flame's body.</p><p></p><p>As if a strong wind was blowing, the Red Flame's half-transparent body kept flickering.</p><p></p><p>But against the various strengths He had just demonstrated, it was completely powerless against this blue light!</p><p></p><p>As if naturally suppressed, a look of bewilderment appeared on His face, and his body was momentarily immobile!</p><p></p><p>A look of ecstasy appeared on the Grand Sun's face.</p><p></p><p>"It's over!" Li Fan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this time, the Grand Sun easily succeeded in merging with this?"</p>

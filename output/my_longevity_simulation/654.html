        <h1>Chapter 654</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan's heart was suddenly filled with more doubts.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Ke had already dispersed his own "Beast Control Technique".</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei, look, it's so magical! The cultivation level is really still in the dantian!" Xu Ke exclaimed excitedly towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Xu Ke's words, Li Fan did not feel as close as before. Instead, a hint of crimson flashed in his eyes, and a sudden sense of hostility arose in his heart. Instinctively, he was about to tear the little thing in front of him, who was making a fuss, into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was not the Xuan Niao itself controlling this body, but Li Fan. So, just a moment later, Li Fan returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was completely unaware that he had just had a near-death experience, instead, he hurriedly came closer to Li Fan, patting him all over. He asked with great concern, "Xiao Hei, what’s wrong with you? You looked really scary just now!"</p><p></p><p>"You better stay away from me now. Otherwise, I can't guarantee that I won't lose control and harm you next time." Li Fan glanced at Xu Ke and threatened.</p><p></p><p>As if confirming Li Fan's words, within the Beast Control Sect, there were continuous sounds of demon beasts roaring and practitioners screaming. </p><p></p><p>"We have a savage nature and see humans as food. However, we were just controlled and suppressed by the Beast Control Technique before. Now that the restraints have suddenly been removed, the demon beasts who have spent a longer time with practitioners are fine, they have cultivated some emotions after all. But those demon beasts that have been in contact with ordinary disciples for a short period of time, once they regain their freedom, they will likely attack their original owners first." Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The cries of the disciples continued, and Xu Ke looked outside, seeming to see the bloody scene, his face turning pale. "It's really terrifying! The Sect Leader and the others didn’t foresee this?"</p><p></p><p>Then he put on a playful smile and approached again, "But I have been good to you, Xiao Hei, there shouldn't be any danger, right?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling that the murderous intent within him was temporarily suppressed but not dissipated, ready to erupt again at any moment, Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to understand why Xiao Hei would eventually be separated from Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>As he had explained to Xu Ke, demon beasts are naturally cruel and difficult to coexist peacefully with humans. Even initially, they could suppress their killing intent repeatedly through the emotions cultivated over years of cohabitation.</p><p></p><p>However, over time, the accumulated killing intent would reach a point where it could no longer be suppressed. Once it erupted completely, the so-called bond might just be as fragile as paper.</p><p></p><p>The huge power gap between demon beasts and practitioners in the Beast Control Sect also meant that if there were a loss of control, the practitioners would inevitably meet a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the obsession that maintains the 'Transformation of the Beast Control Sect'? Because the Heavenly Mandate Xuan Niao Xiao Hei cannot control its own murderous emotions, which ultimately leads to its separation from its owner Xu Ke. Will they never meet again?" </p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, perhaps there is a way to resolve this obsession this time." A thought inexplicably emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>With the "Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Spell" within him, Li Fan's self-control was far superior to that of demon beasts. Li Fan was confident that even if the killing intent surged like a raging wave, constantly rushing towards him, his willpower would remain like an indestructible dam, always firmly suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>During this contemplation, Li Fan did not directly answer Xu Ke's question.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he coldly said, "Emperor San Mao is known as the Beast of Wisdom. With him around, how could they not have considered the current situation?"</p><p></p><p>"Well..." Xu Ke widened his eyes at the words.</p><p></p><p>"Just as the calamity arises, one of the Ten Immortal Sects, the Beast Control Sect, is about to prepare to leave. Once this news spreads, it will be a huge blow to the cultivators of the world. Most likely, the other sects among the Ten Immortal Sects will not agree and will definitely try to stop it."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, they need to give an explanation to the Celestial World and the cultivation world. If disciples are killing each other and the sect suffers heavy losses due to the incompatibility of laws, how can they justify it? After all, this pervasive sense of bloodshed cannot be faked."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a perfect cover-up for the evacuation of the small world." Li Fan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke couldn't help but shiver, "The thoughts of these higher-ups are really terrifying."</p><p></p><p>He then stared at Li Fan, his face full of puzzlement, "But Xiao Hei, when did you become so smart? Did you eat some heavenly treasure recently? That shouldn't be possible, I have been watching you all along..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Xu Ke's words, a brutal murderous intent surged in Li Fan's heart once again. He viciously gave Xu Ke a scratch, releasing some of his pent-up anger, then slowly suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>The chaos within the Beast Control Sect lasted for three to four days.</p><p></p><p>Although many junior disciples were injured or killed, the rampaging demon beasts were soon recaptured and detained. The elite disciples and the core strength of the sect, including the elders, were not greatly affected.</p><p></p><p>The plan to evacuate the Celestial World was being carried out in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>During this process, from the few words exchanged among the sect's disciples, Li Fan learned another reason why the Beast Control Sect was in a hurry to evacuate.</p><p></p><p>It was to prevent the demon beasts' retaliatory madness.</p><p></p><p>If humans and demon beasts were two different species in conflict and competition for survival resources, the relationship between demon beasts and the Beast Control Sect was a never-ending battle.</p><p></p><p>Demon beasts were proud by nature, believing their status was above mere humans. Yet, the Beast Control Sect used despicable means to control and enslave the demon beasts. This was a great humiliation for all demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Beast Control Sect was located within human territory, with many powerful demon beasts being captured and controlled by practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even if some demon beasts wanted to seek revenge, they were basically powerless. On the contrary, they risked being captured and enslaved.</p><p></p><p>But now things were different, with the impending calamity of "incompatibility of laws," the news would surely reach the demon beasts soon. The demon beasts, who always sought retribution, would not let go of such an opportunity. They would definitely come knocking at the door.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention whether the Beast Control Sect could resist the demons' retaliation. When the time came for a real conflict between the two sides, these demon beasts who had lost their restraints in the Beast Control Sect, who they would stand by was really hard to say.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent this dreadful scenario, the evacuation to a safe place was becoming increasingly urgent.</p><p></p><p>"Beast Control Sect members, listen up. Only demon beasts who pass the 'Heartlink Ring' test can evacuate with us. Should any fail..."</p><p></p><p>"Just let them go!"</p>

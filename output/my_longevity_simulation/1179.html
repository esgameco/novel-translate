            <p>Chapter 1177: Crossing the Dust, Leaving the Primordial World</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not!" Before Shang Shaojun could answer, the Holy Fetus Li Fan coldly refuted.</p><p></p><p>"The source of this power is not within reach. It's in the depths of the starry sea!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's words, Shang Shaojun was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"I know you don't believe me, Shaojun. But it doesn't matter. Once I successfully break free from the shackles of the Immortal Ruins and fly out of the Primordial World, you'll know I'm right!"</p><p></p><p>"Please lend me a helping hand, Shaojun!" The Holy Fetus Li Fan bowed solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun didn't dare accept Li Fan's gesture and hurriedly stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, there's no need for this. It's just some supplies. With our friendship, it's just a matter of a word."</p><p></p><p>"Yan Huan!" Shang Shaojun called his trusted aide over and instructed him to handle the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry. At most, everything will be ready in three days."</p><p></p><p>"Too slow! Heaven-sent opportunities don't come twice. One day!" The Holy Fetus Li Fan said bluntly.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun pondered for a moment, then gritted his teeth. "Fine! One day it is!"</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be sending some secret messages.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, he stared at Li Fan, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"Shaojun, if you have something to say, just say it!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, do you really want to..." Shang Shaojun still seemed to find it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan smiled slightly and explained his judgment to him: "The powerful force causing this Primordial World tremor comes from the depths of space. It's completely different from the attractive force of the Immortal Ruins that has been pulling on the Primordial World."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, if we rashly flew out of the Primordial World without the protection of the world, let alone Dao-merging cultivators like you and me, even ordinary Eternal Life realm cultivators would probably only face the fate of perishing. Perhaps only beings with the strength of the Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable could barely resist. But now it's different..."</p><p></p><p>A pool of water suddenly appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the water, a huge vortex spun rapidly, devouring everything around it with turbulent currents.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan lightly pointed.</p><p></p><p>Outside this vortex, another vortex of the same scale appeared.</p><p></p><p>The forces of the two vortexes interfered with each other, and the direction of the water flow became unstable.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun instantly understood Li Fan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"However, these are all your speculations, Brother Li. If you guessed wrong..."</p><p></p><p>"Hearing the Dao in the morning, one can die content in the evening." The Holy Fetus Li Fan was calm, showing no fear.</p><p></p><p>"If I miss this rare opportunity, even if I'm still alive in the future, I will regret it for the rest of my life."</p><p></p><p>"So I must go." Li Fan's tone was resolute.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see what kind of existence can possess such great power." His eyes shone with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency of the Qingxuan Army was trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>In one day, they had already prepared all the supplies Li Fan needed.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the starry sea, dangers abound. Brother Li, aren't you going to make more preparations? You plan to cross the starry space with just these?" Shang Shaojun was muttering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"If there was ample time, naturally it would be best to build a sturdy flying ship. But time doesn't allow it, right? We can only use the Immortal Alliance's Dust-Crossing Boat as a makeshift substitute."</p><p></p><p>The Dust-Crossing Boat was currently the only designated flying magic treasure for the Immortal Alliance to travel in the White Mist Labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>In the 114th lifetime, Li Fan had followed Ji Hongdao on this boat to the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Dust-Crossing Boat was forged from numerous rare materials and had many inherent formation protections. The entire Eternal Immortal Stronghold only had two of them.</p><p></p><p>Being able to contribute one of them showed that Shang Shao</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>You are truly loyal enough.</p><p></p><p>"However, as long as we can survive past the most intense point of contention between the two forces outside the Xuanhuang Realm, there shouldn't be any danger," said the Holy Fetus Li Fan, seizing the last moments to modify the Duchen Boat.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was one more thing he didn't explicitly mention.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's greatest reliance for crossing the starry sky was not on any external object, but on his own foundation-building wonder, the Black Sword Tian Zhi Qi!</p><p></p><p>As a manifestation of the law, the Black Sword was far more indestructible than the vast majority of things in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, unlike ordinary protective materials that would gradually deteriorate, the Black Sword could instead use external forces to continuously "temper" its blade body, making it more adaptable.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the Dharma Heavenly Venerable's new method, even if I abandon my physical body, as long as the sword's law is not extinguished, I can continue to survive in the void."</p><p></p><p>While full of confidence, the Holy Fetus Li Fan also considered the various unexpected situations that might be encountered after flying out of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example...</p><p></p><p>The law of the Black Sword Tian Zhi Qi was a manifestation of the sword dao law of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>If it left the Xuanhuang Realm and lost the support of the world, would its power be greatly reduced? Would it become weak and feeble?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Doctor had previously mentioned that outside the Xuanhuang Realm, in the void, one needed to worry about a certain "illness".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had also seen this illness in Han Zhong's body.</p><p></p><p>Pitch-black decay, infecting the soul.</p><p></p><p>Even the Wuji Yingxu method of repairing the soul had no effect on it whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan did not expect himself to be immune to this illness, but only hoped to use a large amount of precious materials that nourished the soul to prolong the time he could endure in the void.</p><p></p><p>Another day passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm all had a look of relief after surviving the catastrophe. Many were still fearful, afraid that this terrible disaster would strike again.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Chizhe Abyss, the Holy Fetus Li Fan was fully prepared.</p><p></p><p>The Duchen Boat had undergone a complete transformation from its original appearance. Li Fan bid farewell to the people of the Qingxuan Army and slowly walked into the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan's back, Shao Jun wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p></p><p>He even felt an impulse in his heart to follow along, to break out of the Xuanhuang Realm and explore the secrets behind that mighty power.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator, how could he not be curious about that level of power?</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not alone. There were too many things he needed to consider.</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun suddenly felt a little envious of the figure on the Duchen Boat.</p><p></p><p>"Shao Jun, at this moment, do you want to come with me and put life and death aside?"</p><p></p><p>As if he could read minds, the other party asked telepathically before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Before Shao Jun could answer, the Holy Fetus Li Fan said with a smile, "That won't do."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Shao Jun, don't forget that there are still those with ulterior motives secretly hidden in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If both of us leave, wouldn't we be allowing those villains to succeed?"</p><p></p><p>"I thought you had already forgotten about this matter in the blink of an eye," Shao Jun muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Duchen Boat slowly rose into the air.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's voice echoed in Shao Jun's ears.</p><p></p><p>"The future of the Xuanhuang Realm and the Wanxian Alliance depends on you, Shao Jun."</p><p></p><p>"If I am fortunate enough to survive this great calamity, I will definitely rush back to lend you a helping hand!"</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun followed the Duchen Boat all the way, leaving the white mist, and watched it disappear into the horizon.</p><p></p><p>He felt a sense of loss in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not known Li Fan for long, the other party's strength and demeanor had deeply impressed him.</p><p></p><p>"Live well," Shao Jun said silently in his heart.</p>

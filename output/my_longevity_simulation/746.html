        <h1>Chapter 746</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With some anticipation, Xu Bai quickly approached the ruins of the mountain valley from his memories. When Li Chenfen returned to the empire, I had already learned of the entrance leading to the empire through the surveillance of the Formless Killing Opportunity. However, there was no chance to go there before, so I took this opportunity to make a trip.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of knowledge, the polygonal crystal emitted a seven-colored radiance again, enveloping the Celestial Profound Treasure Mirror below. Under Xu Bai's intentional control, a series of virtual scenes appeared within the radiance, twisting the perception of the Celestial Profound Treasure Mirror. He then flew rapidly and arrived at the entrance's location. </p><p></p><p>After a careful search, he indeed discovered a spatial passage hidden by some special means. Xu Bai looked at the Celestial Profound Treasure Mirror, but it did not give any warning. "It is indeed useful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded silently, not rushing to enter. He scanned with his divine consciousness to ensure no cultivators were nearby, then took out a Terminal Disc and set up an array to conceal the entrance. Only after that did he fly into the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>As far as he could see, there was boundless darkness. This scene was not unfamiliar to him, extremely similar to the void space opened up by countless Rift Whales when crossing the Supreme Martial Grand Formation. But this place seemed even more profound.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the Purifying Light Glazed Robe crafted by Fang Zaiji appeared on his body. With this extra layer of protection, Xu Bai then flew forward. He had crossed the Supreme Martial Grand Formation countless times and was very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>He passed through the formation smoothly without any alarms, but did not see any signs of the small world. What greeted him was still the boundless dark void.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have passed through the Rift Whales and moved far away from the original location," Xu Bai thought.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the void, he closed his eyes and focused on his perception. Just a moment later, he vaguely sensed a very familiar aura fluctuation in the distant darkness.</p><p></p><p>Following the aura, Xu Bai flew rapidly. As he was getting close, a resounding whale cry suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai abruptly stopped his form. It was as if triggering a chain reaction - one whale cry after another sounded from near and far in succession. They kept transmitting to the extreme distance without stopping.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to discern how many Rift Whales existed in the dark void. They called out to each other, echoing back and forth, as if performing a grand symphony.</p><p></p><p>But he could tell that these Rift Whales were only crying out in unison to vent their joy, as if welcoming Xu Bai's arrival.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Xu Bai's eyes flickered as he continued forward.</p><p></p><p>The groups of Rift Whales along the way sensed his aura and actively opened a path for him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xu Bai arrived outside the [Empire].</p><p></p><p>From the dark void, he saw it was an elliptical world. He could vaguely make out vast bodies of water, and...the floating corpse of the [Crimson Nine Heads] in the sky.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai was observing intently, a strange ripple suddenly occurred in the space ahead.</p><p></p><p>Seven cultivators wearing beast god armor, riding on a strange eel-like beast, abruptly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Who goes there!" Upon discovering Xu Bai, these cultivators' expressions changed slightly. They swiftly scattered and formed a formation, surrounding Xu Bai in the middle.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The seven of them were only wearing the beast-god armor of the Golden Elixir realm. How could they possibly be a match for Xu Bai?</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled slightly, waving his folding fan, and before they could react, he had subdued all seven of them in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Wuuu..." </p><p></p><p>They had looks of horror on their faces, but they could not speak.</p><p></p><p>And the next scene left them even more aghast.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai beckoned, and the "Void Roaming Dragon" that the seven had painstakingly cultivated and could only be subdued by their combined "Unison Technique", obediently swam towards the others.</p><p></p><p>It even rubbed against them affectionately, as if begging for attention. </p><p></p><p>This servile behavior made the seven almost think they were hallucinating! When had the ferocious "Void Roaming Dragon" become so docile?</p><p></p><p>Feeling the intimate approach of this eel-like beast, Xu Bai placed his hand on its head and gently stroked it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, blurry images appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Xu Bai also learned its name.</p><p></p><p>"It does have a certain heroic air. But being able to traverse space at close range, such an ability is already remarkable even in the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Lead the way forward," he commanded.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Bai did not forget to grab the seven subdued beast-god armor warriors.</p><p></p><p>After a spatial distortion, Xu Bai arrived in the "Empire" - the human domain established upon the corpse of the Nine-Headed Crimson Demon.</p><p></p><p>Riding the Void Roaming Dragon, with the seven beast-god armor warriors in tow, Xu Bai's appearance was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, he instantly captured the attention of everyone around.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of stupor, the area descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack!"</p><p>"It's a cultivator!"</p><p>"Where's the guard force?"</p><p>"Quickly, summon the Azure Saint Master!"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amid the clamor, hundreds of figures came swooshing from all directions in the city. </p><p></p><p>Some were clad in beast-god armor, others rode on various strange beasts, and there were even those who flew with their bare bodies, clearly cultivators like Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Although numerous, the strongest among them were only at the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, protected by his Luminous Glass Robe, was unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, who are you?" </p><p></p><p>Sensing Xu Bai's extraordinary nature, they cautiously refrained from directly attacking, and instead called out to inquire.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai did not answer, only sweeping his gaze around.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what is your purpose in coming here?" </p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Imperial Guard shouted again.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a azure light shot out from the center of the Imperial City, arriving before Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoquing landed, and the words were just about to leave her mouth when she caught sight of Xu Bai's appearance. She was struck dumb, as if by lightning.</p><p></p><p>"Mas..."</p><p></p><p>She did not finish the word "person", as she sensed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the shock in her heart, she stared at Xu Bai for a long time before asking, "You are..."</p><p></p><p>Her tone carried a heavy sense of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Azure Daoist friend, do you not know that your 'Empire' is about to face great calamity?" Xu Bai asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious villain! How dare you speak such blasphemy in front of the Azure Saint Master!" </p><p></p><p>"Daring to act so brazenly before the Azure Saint Master!"</p><p></p><p>These words immediately incited the surrounding cultivators to angrily denounce Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>And in Xiaoquing's eyes, there was even greater astonishment: "You know me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly and asked, "Daoist friend, do you still remember the Multiversal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1094</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"So it's not that Mr. Bai is inferior to the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, but only that Mr. Bai attained the Dao later than the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"Conversely, if Mr. Bai had changed the Xuanhuang Realm first, then perhaps even the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate would have been helpless at that time."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there are no ifs."</p><p></p><p>In Xu Ke's aged voice, there seemed to be a deep sense of regret.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent for a long time, and finally responded with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>"But..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned, "Is Mr. Bai's sacrificing his life for the Dao really that simple?"</p><p></p><p>"The birth of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma can naturally preserve the lives of mortals in the Xuanhuang Realm for a time. But fundamentally speaking, it's just a delaying tactic."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, mortals are still regarded as cattle and horses by cultivators; and the Xuanhuang Realm is still in imminent danger. Since Mr. Bai could extrapolate the situation thousands of years later, he naturally wouldn't fail to see this point."</p><p></p><p>"With his character, how could he have no preparations at all for this and leave so hastily?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan refused to give up and tried to extract more secrets from Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Because he always felt that there must be something hidden behind Mr. Bai's demise.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Xu Ke just smiled and shook his head, "You and I both thought Mr. Bai was an omnipotent sage. But in reality, in his own words..."</p><p></p><p>"He was just an ordinary person who couldn't bear to see others suffer."</p><p></p><p>"From his initial helplessness in the face of Miss Liu'er and the innocent people of Ningyuan City dying miserably, to the setbacks he suffered later when he tried to change fate. Mr. Bai spent his whole life in [powerlessness]. So he never thought that he had the ability to save everything. All he could do was to do his best."</p><p></p><p>"And he had indeed sacrificed too much already."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke fell silent again, "Do you know what's in the coffin behind me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked behind Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Only now upon closer inspection did he discover that this pale white coffin seemed to be vaguely connected to the towering stone mountain on his body.</p><p></p><p>Or to put it another way...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and observed for a long time, then suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the entire small world in his eyes instantly flipped.</p><p></p><p>The earth was above, the sky below.</p><p></p><p>The towering stone mountain on the coffin seemed to be supporting the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>Or, the weight of the entire world was pressing down on the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan felt an extremely familiar aura emanating from this coffin.</p><p></p><p>It was an aura that no Xuanhuang cultivator would find unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>He also recalled Xu Ke's self-introduction during their previous meeting, mentioning "the one who is against the world".</p><p></p><p>"This... could it be?" Li Fan was shocked and terrified. He abruptly raised his head and stared at Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai was favored by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, almost equivalent to the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Not only did he ascend to heaven in one step with a mortal body and directly become an Eternal Heavenly Venerate, but he also shouldered the mission of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao abandoning the realm and leaving."</p><p></p><p>"But in the end, Mr. Bai did not choose to leave. Later, he even directly became a member of the new law and participated in going against the principles of heaven and earth. To the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, this was tantamount to a complete betrayal."</p><p></p><p>"The deeper one is favored by the Heavenly Dao, the greater the backlash one suffers when betraying it. This is also the reason why Mr. Bai would be counter-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"One of the reasons why the Creator killed him. Because before this, he had already become very weak."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke patted the coffin behind him and said, "In fact, at that time, given Mr. Bai's level of heavenly favor, it was actually impossible for him to carry out the reversal of principles. I'm afraid that before the reversal could be completed, he himself would have fallen due to the backlash of the heavenly dao."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>"Before the reversal, Mr. Bai first stripped away the heavenly favor. Then he suppressed it."</p><p></p><p>As if sensing Xu Ke's words, the coffin behind him suddenly emitted a dull knocking sound.</p><p></p><p>A face that looked somewhat similar to Mr. Bai's, only appearing a bit pale, suddenly appeared before Li Fan's eyes, making his head feel dizzy.</p><p></p><p>In an extremely bewitching tone, it persuaded Li Fan to help open the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Once this was done, upon returning to the Xuanhuang Realm, he would surely receive a reward a thousand times over.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary cultivator, perhaps in this instant they would have been convinced by its words, falling into becoming its tool for breaking free and fighting against Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>But who was Li Fan?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the firmness of his own will, just that thread of wariness he always maintained towards Mr. Bai meant that he was destined not to be bewitched by this somewhat creepy-looking Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, the scene before his eyes completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan awoke from the illusion, only to find Xu Ke observing him coldly, seeming like he would take action at any disagreeable word.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing that Li Fan was not affected by the illusory realm, the killing intent in his eyes also faded away.</p><p></p><p>"The sealed heavenly favor? What exactly is that thing?" Li Fan put on a lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>"The self-awareness of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao attached to Mr. Bai was stripped away by him. After so many years of sealing and suppression, it has gradually become somewhat extreme. If it were released and allowed to return to the Xuanhuang Realm..." Xu Ke's expression was very solemn.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid a calamity ten times more terrifying than the 'Dharma Cannot Be Jointly Cultivated' would descend in an instant. This is also the reason why in these years, even when Little Black perished back then, I did not dare to leave here for a single step. This matter is of great importance and absolutely cannot be neglected."</p><p></p><p>"An extreme Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao?" In the depths of Li Fan's eyes, a trace of unusual brilliance flashed for an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. I can sense that in these sealed years, the heavenly dao consciousness inside has become more and more bizarre. I really worry that in the future, there will also come a day when I can no longer persist." A deep concern flashed through Xu Ke's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, in this recent period of time, I have also been secretly looking for a suitable successor. However, I have never found someone I can feel at ease with. Today, Fellow Daoist, by a coincidence of fate, you came knocking..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke suddenly changed the topic: "Could it be that there is a predestined arrangement in the mysteries?"</p><p></p><p>"I observe that Fellow Daoist's character and integrity are absolutely top-notch." He looked at Li Fan sincerely, speaking very earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered without responding.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the mission of suppressing the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao is too lonely and perilous. If Fellow Daoist is unwilling, I can also understand. But I have a request..." Xu Ke said.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Fellow Daoist." Li Fan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>"If one day, I am controlled by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao in this coffin and lose my self-awareness, I ask that Fellow Daoist take action and slay me." Xu Ke said very solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Ke's aged gaze, Li Fan nodded, "Alright, I promise you."</p><p></p><p>"Also, you don't need to worry about finding a successor."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's expression slightly froze.</p>

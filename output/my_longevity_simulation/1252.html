        <h1>Chapter 1252</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Geomantic Ancient Tree was also within the Faceless Sacred Emperor's web of refined source power. .•°¤*(¯`★´¯)*¤° ６９𝔰𝓗𝔲𝓧.¢𝐨ᗰ °¤*(¯´★`¯)*¤°•.</p><p></p><p>Thus, when Ruomu surrendered, the Geomantic Ancient Tree also had a vague premonition in its heart. However, it couldn't be certain, only that the sense of unease and dread in its heart grew day by day. </p><p></p><p>"Now that we are all subordinates of the Sacred Emperor, under His protection, surely He wouldn't dare do anything to me?" The Ancient Tree could only comfort itself like this.</p><p></p><p>The Geomantic Ancient Tree clearly knew that in this world, probably only the Sacred Emperor could protect its life.</p><p></p><p>And the more useful it was to the Sacred Dynasty, the safer it would be.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Geomantic Ancient Tree was eager to prove its value to the Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, ever since arriving in the Great Enlightenment of the Sacred Dynasty, it seemed to have been forgotten. No one had come to actively seek it out.</p><p></p><p>Even the previously assigned task of sorting out the geomantic veins of the Great Enlightenment small world had no one come to inspect it.</p><p></p><p>This left the Geomantic Ancient Tree quite depressed. </p><p></p><p>However, on this day, the opportunity the Ancient Tree had been waiting for to prove itself finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>The visitor was none other than the Sacred Emperor's fifth disciple, Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the schematic diagram of the geomantic vein flows in the Xuanhuang Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian pointed to the image in front and asked.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, like an underground web, extending to all parts of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just like the blood vessels in a human body, constantly contracting and pulsating. It looked quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>The Geomantic Ancient Tree nodded, "Young Venerable One is perceptive."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian seemed quite pleased with the Ancient Tree's flattery, and readily accepted this title of "Young Venerable One".</p><p></p><p>"I heard from Senior Sister Lin Ling that when traveling in the geomantic vein flows, the power of the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao spontaneously conceals it, making it difficult for ordinary people to detect. Is that true?" Ou Shangtian asked again.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." The Geomantic Ancient Tree handed over a withered branch, "Young Venerable One, please take a look."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian sensed the surging power of geomantic vein flows in the withered branch and frowned slightly, "I don't see what's so special about this. How can it block others' perception?"</p><p></p><p>The Geomantic Ancient Tree smiled slightly, "Young Venerable One should know, grains of sand can pile into a tall tower, and drops of water can converge into a great river. Although a bit of geomantic power may seem unremarkable, when all the geomantic vein flows of the entire Xuanhuang Realm gather together, it is truly vast and mighty, like the momentum of thunder."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the circulation of geomantic veins is also an important part of the normal operation of the Xuanhuang Realm. This old one is merely acting on behalf of its authority. Compared with the grand principles of the entire Xuanhuang Realm, ordinary cultivators are like ants, so it's only natural to be ignored."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian stared blankly at the schematic diagram of geomantic vein flows, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he came back to his senses and returned the geomantic withered branch, instructing, "It just so happens that I'm going out this time to carry out a task entrusted by my Master. I may need your help."</p><p></p><p>The Geomantic Ancient Tree had been waiting for this. Upon hearing this, it was overjoyed, "Young Venerable One, just give the order, and I will do my utmost to assist."</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Realm, there is a senior of immeasurable strength, carrying a stone tablet on his back... Do you know of him?" Ou Shangtian looked at the Geomantic Ancient Tree and asked.</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Geomantic Ancient Tree suddenly changed, and the previous eagerness disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It stared at Ou Shangtian in disbelief for a while before tentatively asking, "Young Venerable One, is the Sacred Dynasty going to make a move against the Stone Tablet Senior?"</p><p></p><p>"If I may be frank, the Stone Tablet is a true Longevity Realm expert who has attained the Dao for many years..."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian waved his hand impatiently, "Of course I know the strength of that Stone Tablet or whatever. Longevity Realm, huh!"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, I'm just responsible for luring him to a specific location, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ou Shangtian say this, the Geomantic Ancient Tree finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>That mysterious and unfathomable Faceless Sacred Emperor, since he could subdue its father, dealing with this Stone Tablet shouldn't be a big problem either.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Tree perked up, "Young Venerable One, may I ask how you need me to cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian explained the detailed plan, and the Ancient Tree nodded thoughtfully, indicating there was no major issue.</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence. After I see my Master, I will set off immediately."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Tree then stated, "My true body is still in Xuanhuang. As long as Young Venerable One summons me, I can appear at any time."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian hurriedly entered the Sacred Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>When he walked out, the anxiousness on his face had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"I have the Qiankun Bone Hands, and the Seven-Colored Jade Void Radiance protecting my body. This time I also received a treasure reward from Master. And I've studied formations for so long..."</p><p></p><p>"I just need to lure him to the Fishing Pond, and the mission will be considered complete. There shouldn't be any major issues."</p><p></p><p>"But isn't the Fishing Pond our Sacred Dynasty's precious land? Why would Master have me lure a great enemy there instead? Isn't he afraid of any accidents?"</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian pondered but couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, he couldn't be bothered to think too much. He left the Great Enlightenment small world and headed straight for the Nine Mountains Prefecture of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the surging geomantic vein flows, in just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, he had already arrived within the Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian tried it out and found that the spatial laws here were indeed somewhat chaotic and fragile.</p><p></p><p>If one were to rashly use teleportation techniques, it was very likely to directly tear the space and be sucked into the spatial turbulence, whereabouts unknown.</p><p></p><p>"But flying shouldn't be a problem. These nine mountain peaks may be difficult for ordinary cultivators, but not for me with the Seven-Colored Divine Light."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Ou Shangtian deliberately manipulated the Seven-Colored Jade Void Radiance to form a circle of protection around his body. Like the high heavens' great sun, it continuously radiated its own rhythm outward.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, a set of armor also emitting seven-colored radiance suddenly appeared on Ou Shangtian's body.</p><p></p><p>His Master's words simultaneously rang in Ou Shangtian's ears, "This item is called the [Flowing Light Armor], forged from the Nine Heavens Thunderbolt and the Aurora at Dawn's Breath. When worn, the speed of flight can rival that of lightning. It can also ignore the vast majority of attack methods..."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian tried it out.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the peak of the mountain range in the distance, in just a flash, the next moment he had arrived at the summit.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!?" Even Ou Shangtian, the perpetrator, couldn't help but be shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was flying in the sky in such a ostentatious manner, his entire body radiating seven-colored brilliance, due to the speed being too fast, surprisingly not a single cultivator in the entire Nine Mountains Prefecture could detect him.</p><p></p><p>Even the Myriad Immortals Alliance's Dao-Uniting Guardians were the same.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian was a bit cautious at first, but after finally confirming that no one could sense him, he gradually relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He even felt a sense of omnipotence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Exhilarating, truly exhilarating!"</p><p></p><p>In the vast Nine Mountains Prefecture, in just the time it takes to breathe, he had already flown back and forth several times. The feeling of moving like the wind and lightning made Ou Shangtian somewhat intoxicated.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he couldn't help but feel a bit puzzled in his heart, "Just flying around like this will be able to lure out that Stone Tablet?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this too mystical? I'm so fast, could it be that he won't be able to find me?"</p><p></p><p>"Should I try slowing down a bit?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Ou Shangtian's thoughts were wandering...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When it happened, a sense of unknown crisis suddenly arose in his heart. </p><p></p><p>An image suddenly welled up in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>As if bound by something invisible, no matter how he tried to fly and escape, he could not break out of the range covered by the darkness.</p><p></p><p>In despair, his body could only slowly slide towards the center of the darkness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"!"</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian's heart trembled violently. </p><p></p><p>He knew this was a spontaneous warning from the Book of Ten Thousand Deaths, one of his innate magical treasures besides the Kunqian Bone Hands.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is that thing? A stone tablet?"</p><p></p><p>The foreseen scene made Ou Shangtian's hair stand on end. He decisively detonated a battle crown he had prepared for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless formations were set up, protecting Ou Shangtian in the center.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the illusion from the Book of Ten Thousand Deaths slowly dissipate. </p><p></p><p>But the sense of crisis in Ou Shangtian's heart did not subside because of this. As the one who set up the formations, he could clearly feel that the hundreds of thousands of formations he personally arranged around him were disappearing at an unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>But from beginning to end, he never saw the person who broke the formations. It was as if something was silently devouring them.</p><p></p><p>As layers of formations were successively laid out, a faint figure slowly revealed its form.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian dared not look too much.</p><p></p><p>"Earth veins!"</p><p></p><p>Calling out inwardly, Ou Shangtian plunged straight from the sky into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, the myriad formations he left behind were bizarrely compressed into book page-like entities, all slowly floating to the abruptly appearing figure.</p><p></p><p>The figure gradually revealed its true appearance - a scholar with a conspicuous stone tablet on his back.</p><p></p><p>Every time he took a page and finished reading it, the page disappeared from his hand, flashing with fluorescent light, and then seemed to be imprinted on the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The scholar was in no hurry to chase after the fleeing Ou Shangtian. Instead, he leisurely read all the pages in his hands.</p><p></p><p>His originally calm face gradually furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"When did the formations in the Xuanhuang Realm develop to this extent?"</p><p></p><p>"That ray of world light..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be an outsider?"</p><p></p><p>All the pages in his hand disappeared. The scholar glanced at the location where he sensed Ou Shangtian was.</p><p></p><p>"Such a fast speed. There's even an ancient tree of the earth veins helping him..."</p><p></p><p>The scholar sorted through the recent records on the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>He did not find any relevant records.</p><p></p><p>"More and more foreign realms are coming. The stone tablet, which claims to be omniscient, is ultimately becoming less and less true to its name."</p><p></p><p>"Wuyou, you were right. There has never been anything eternal. Not immortals, nor the power we long-lived ones take pride in."</p><p></p><p>Although this matter very obviously exuded an air of conspiracy, looking like it wanted to lure him over,</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet had no fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Instead, more curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step, he arrived at Ou Shangtian's previous location in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>However, Ou Shangtian seemed to have prepared early, already taking a step ahead and drilling into the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>But the stone tablet was not in a hurry, knowing the other party would definitely appear again. So he just stayed in place and waited.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. It seems the mastermind behind this has some understanding of me."</p><p></p><p>Not angered by being toyed with, a faint smile appeared on the stone tablet's face instead.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, the stone tablet was gradually attracted to a peaceful mountain Daoist temple.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian no longer fled, but stood respectfully behind a majestic figure.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet's gaze also shifted from Ou Shangtian to this figure.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a moment, the smile on the stone tablet's lips finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Replaced by a hint of bewilderment and solemnity.</p><p></p><p>The person in front of him gave him a feeling that was both somewhat familiar and a sense of crisis warning.</p><p></p><p>"Can't feel the aura of unity of body and Dao, not at the Eternal Life Realm? Or, like me, achieved immortality through ancient methods?" The stone tablet secretly speculated.</p><p></p><p>"Just standing like that, aren't you tired? Come in and have a seat." Just after a moment of confrontation between the two sides, Li Ping took the initiative to speak.</p><p></p><p>With just one sentence, he broke the tense atmosphere of swords drawn and bows bent.</p><p></p><p>Unlike enemies meeting, it was more like greeting an old friend he hadn't seen in years in a familiar manner.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet immediately felt a few points of strangeness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he still lightly said, "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Following Li Ping, he entered the Daoist temple below.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the temple, Li Ping did not stop, but continued walking to a pond behind the temple.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, how long have you had this stone tablet on your back?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet was slightly startled, but did not conceal it and answered, "Thirty-six thousand nine hundred and forty-two years."</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-six thousand nine hundred and forty-two years." Li Ping repeated this number.</p><p></p><p>"It sounds like a long time. But it's only a little over thirty thousand years. Compared to the lifespan of the Xuanhuang Realm, it's insignificant. Not to mention the starry sea outside the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Ping sighed a little.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet also concurred, "Yes, thirty thousand years pass in the blink of an eye. For heaven and earth itself, it may not be worth mentioning. But for an ordinary person like me, it's quite long indeed."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary person..." Ou Shangtian couldn't help muttering at this time.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping smiled, "Shangtian, don't be rude. This senior is right, he is indeed just an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>But the stone tablet didn't bicker with him at all, instead staring straight at Li Ping, "You... seem to know me well?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not admit it, "Just feeling some resonance, that's all."</p><p></p><p>"I'm also just an ordinary person, but bearing a destined mission."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ou Shangtian buried his head even lower, afraid to reveal the slightest abnormality.</p><p></p><p>But the stone tablet was lost in thought, constantly sizing up Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>That tall stature was different from ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The few strange auras twining around his body also made the stone tablet not dare underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you lured me here, for what purpose? Don't tell me it's just to chat a little?" In the end, the stone tablet asked directly, putting an end to the verbal fencing between the two.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to help Fellow Daoist gain liberation." Li Ping said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>These blunt words made Ou Shangtian raise his head, a hint of excitement flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet's eyes narrowed, becoming vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Fellow Daoist has misunderstood me. I truly want to help you gain liberation." A hint of disappointment leaked from Li Ping's tone.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sacred Emperor pointed to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me Fellow Daoist hasn't noticed anything amiss here?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the stone tablet's attention finally shifted from the Faceless Sacred Emperor to the left and right.</p><p></p><p>Scanning around, his gaze finally fell on that tranquil little pond.</p>

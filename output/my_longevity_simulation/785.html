        <h1>Chapter 785</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai looked deeply at the other party. </p><p>Chen Tianhai's words were full of profound meaning.</p><p>It seemed he had discerned the origins of Xu Bai's separate body?</p><p>However, he did not expose it directly, maintaining an air of mystery that left Fang Zaiji feeling rather perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"However, what you said before was correct. Our Taixuan Sect is indeed very interested in scenes outside of the Immortal Wasteland."</p><p>"Or rather, any records from outside the Xuanhuang Realm are extremely important to us."</p><p>"What did you want to exchange for it?"</p><p>Chen Tianhai changed the topic and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat unexpected for Xu Bai.</p><p>"I want Huadao Stones, the higher quality the better." Without hesitation, he stated his demand.</p><p></p><p>"Huadao Stones..." Chen Tianhai pondered for a moment, but ultimately shook his head slightly.</p><p>"Our Taixuan Sect no longer has any individual Huadao Stones. You may try your luck in the Xuanhuang Origin Realm."</p><p>"Ask for something else."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Zaiji became displeased: "Old Chen, are you looking down on our young Sect Master? That person who led us in clearly stated that as long as we join your Taixuan Sect, you would gift us a mid-grade Huadao Stone for free."</p><p>"How can you say you don't have any now?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai glanced at Fang Zaiji and smiled: "Brother Fang, there's no need for you to keep probing."</p><p></p><p>"As you have guessed..."</p><p>"We now all exist by relying on the 'Huadao Stone Mother'."</p><p></p><p>Even though he had vaguely guessed it before, when Chen Tianhai admitted it directly, Fang Zaiji's body still trembled slightly.</p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Chen Tianhai's body turned blue and transparent again.</p><p>"In order to maximize the power of the Huadao Stone Mother, we gathered all the Huadao Stones we could find back then and concentrated them together. Since then, we have never separated them again. So your request is truly beyond our ability." He looked at Xu Bai and stated frankly.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on the Huadao Stone Mother to exist." Xu Bai did not seem too disappointed. </p><p>He just silently observed Chen Tianhai's body.</p><p>After the initial shock, Fang Zaiji boldly stepped forward and reached out to touch Chen Tianhai's body.</p><p>Just as expected, it was like a projected light, completely insubstantial. </p><p>His hand passed right through.</p><p></p><p>"As a cultivator, you can actually tolerate existing in this form?" He seemed to have difficulty accepting it at first.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that different, actually. It's more convenient in many ways. Do you want to try it?" Chen Tianhai asked nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was so startled that he immediately retracted his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Freely transforming between the real and illusory. In most cases, we exist in an illusory state. If necessary, we can also manifest a real body, no different from true cultivators," Chen Tianhai explained truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"However, doing so consumes a great deal of resources and computing power from the Huadao Stone Mother. Unless absolutely necessary, we won't do it."</p><p>"Normally, we only maintain the 'true' forms of about a dozen disciples."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji couldn't help but exclaim: "It can even be done like that?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the solution you came up with to deal with the great catastrophe back then?" Xu Bai asked curiously.</p><p>"Wasn't the price too heavy?"</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Trapped in a stone for eternity. And if that stone were to shatter, there would be a risk of collective destruction," Xu Bai asked bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity?" Chen Tian-hai's face broke into a cold smile once more.</p><p></p><p>"To safely weather the 'Dharma Unattainable' calamity, the Taiyan Sect has dozens of methods at our disposal," he said.</p><p></p><p>"But that is not what we seek," the transparent blue figure replied, hands clasped behind his back, a heroic tone in his voice.</p><p></p><p>"What the Taiyan Sect desires is true transcendence. To remain unperturbed even in the face of the calamity that would destroy the Immortal Realm and the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>His words shook Xu Bai and Fang Zaijing to their core.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaijing couldn't help but retort, "With just your Dao Stone Mother? You may not fully grasp the terrors of the Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>But Chen Tian-hai waved him off dismissively. </p><p></p><p>"I know, the Immortal Realm's gravitational pull is strong enough to distort space-time. But it has not yet reached the point of destroying space-time itself."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tian-hai stamped his right foot, and a ring of blue light radiated outward from beneath it. Moments later, the walls became transparent once more. The floating city, and everything in it, had taken on the same blue, translucent hue as Chen Tian-hai.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, countless flickering scenes could be seen within the blue, like the birth and death of worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Is this floating city the Dao Stone Mother?" Fang Zaijing realized, somewhat astonished.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tian-hai continued, "As long as space-time does not perish, information can exist eternally. And so the Taiyan Sect can endure forever."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Stone Mother? That no longer exists in this world," he said. "In that moment, we became one."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaijing was left speechless, once again stunned by the Taiyan Sect's audacious actions.</p><p></p><p>"Preserving space-time and eternal information - truly a remarkable idea. And you've actually achieved it," Xu Bai said, applauding. </p><p></p><p>"While ordinary means cannot destroy you, the Myriad Immortal Alliance does have a natural counter to you - the Heavenly Mirror. Perhaps it cannot easily erase you, but it may be able to trap you within it forever."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai mused, "No wonder you surrendered so readily."</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of survival, it's no disgrace. And in a true conflict, it may not fare so well either. Now its primary task is its own advancement, so it won't move against us. And since our interests do not clash, it readily accepted our surrender," Chen Tian-hai said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Well said. But I have a question," Xu Bai fixed his gaze on Chen Tian-hai. "How did the Taiyan Sect know the Immortal Realm cannot destroy space-time?"</p><p></p><p>"What if the Immortal Realm's gravitational pull has been steadily increasing all these years?"</p><p></p><p>"Just because it cannot do so now, does not mean it will be the case forever," Xu Bai said ominously.</p>

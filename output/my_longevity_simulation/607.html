            <p>When understanding that he was reincarnated, in the ancient immortal world where the ten sects of the Immortal Dao were ruling the world with their immense power and the new laws were yet to be born, a bold idea emerged in Qiao Sidao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to follow the Heavenly Transmitter, and become one of the first few to transmit the laws!</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by the current flourishing of the ten sects of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Sidao, who was well aware of the future trends, knew very well that this seemingly eternal rule would be completely vulnerable before the surging tide of the new laws!</p><p></p><p>Before long, the powerful army of new law cultivators, capable of seizing heaven and earth and cultivating at a frightening speed, would, under the leadership of the Heavenly Transmitter, crush the Immortal Dao ten sects, and establish the great Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, ruling for countless years in the future.</p><p></p><p>And there would be no greater achievement than following the trend.</p><p></p><p>If he pledged allegiance before the Heavenly Transmitter rose to prominence, he would proactively surrender.</p><p></p><p>Later, when the Heavenly Transmitter roamed beyond the sky, the highest ruling body of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, the Transmitter Council, would surely have a place for him!</p><p></p><p>â€¦</p><p></p><p>This was what Qiao Sidao had originally thought.</p><p></p><p>And this was what he did.</p><p></p><p>He abandoned the hard-earned status as an inner disciple of the Seven Star Sect, traversed mountains and rivers from the hinterlands of the immortal land, and arrived at the desolate region of Congyun Marsh.</p><p></p><p>After waiting patiently for more than a decade, he finally welcomed the great Heavenly Transmitter...</p><p></p><p>No, at this moment, he should be called the Heavenly Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Heavenly Transmitter transmitting the laws had already spread in the surrounding areas some time ago.</p><p></p><p>But the fame of the Transmitter was not prominent at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly saying that he was going to transmit the laws, who in the world would believe it?</p><p></p><p>At this time, in front of him, there were only more than ten cultivators who had come upon hearing the news and intended to join in the fun.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Sidao hurriedly sat in the central front row, wanting to become familiar faces.</p><p></p><p>He observed the surroundings and thought about how these people would soon become the major law transmitters who would govern the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, and his heartbeat quickened.[Interrupted text removed]</p>

I'm quickly writing it out while the inspiration is still there. </p><p></p><p>It won't delay the normal update tonight. There will still be two regular chapters tonight.</p><p></p><p>----------------------------------</p><p></p><p>"Ding dong!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the notification sound from my phone, I was instantly startled awake from my sleep.</p><p></p><p>It took a full half minute for my racing heart to gradually calm down. I picked up my phone from the table and checked the time.</p><p></p><p>Two-thirty in the morning. </p><p></p><p>"Damn, sending a message at this hour, it must be that old thing Zhang Yaobin!"</p><p></p><p>Cursing inwardly, I opened [Teng Xin], and sure enough.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yang, check your email. Write a research report for me based on the information inside, around 30,000 words will do. By noon tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>The text, coupled with Zhang Yaobin's lewd smiling avatar, instantly made my eyelids twitch and my blood pressure surge.</p><p></p><p>In my mind, I had already greeted his ancestors up to eight generations, but my fingers involuntarily danced on the phone's keyboard.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, boss!"</p><p></p><p>I let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"No choice, who told me to get stuck with such a supervisor. Hold on a bit longer, once this thesis is successfully published, I can graduate."</p><p></p><p>"Six reviewers, four of them are Zhang Yaobin's friends. Whether it can pass review is just a matter of his word. Before it passes review, during this time, he'll definitely work me like a cow or horse. It'll only get worse."</p><p></p><p>Complaining in my heart, I opened the email, downloaded and unzipped the attachment, and started looking at the contents inside.</p><p></p><p>"Reverse the principles of heaven and earth, to prove immortality..."</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this."</p><p></p><p>My sleepiness instantly vanished, and I couldn't help but sit up straight, staring intently at the pictures on the computer.</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, in the Baise area of Hunan Province, a strange event occurred. A thousand-meter-high mountain split open, revealing a cliff face as smooth as a mirror. On the cliff, nine large characters were carved from top to bottom in ancient seal script: "Reverse the principles of heaven and earth to prove immortality".</p><p></p><p>The local government acted very quickly. After the incident, the site was quickly sealed off. This matter is not yet known to the public.</p><p></p><p>Because the ancient seal script used to write these nine characters was the official script of the Xian Dynasty seven thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>So the investigation team invited Zhang Yaobin, the country's leading expert in Xian Dynasty history, to assist in the investigation.</p><p></p><p>To see if any clues could be found in ancient books.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>I glanced at the time in the lower right corner of the screen.</p><p></p><p>"Today's not April Fool's Day either, playing this kind of joke on me."</p><p></p><p>The moment I saw this information, my first reaction was disbelief.</p><p></p><p>I quickly searched for the mountain mentioned in the incident.</p><p></p><p>"Nine characters, over a thousand meters. From the character spacing in the picture, each character is at least a hundred meters in size."</p><p></p><p>"Even now, carving them out on a cliff face would be a huge project."</p><p></p><p>"The Xian Dynasty from seven thousand years ago? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"But this handwriting is indeed quite good."</p><p></p><p>My train of thought paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>But although that old fellow Zhang Yaobin looks a bit ugly and reeks of capitalist vibes, he's very reliable when it comes to doing things. He wouldn't trifle with me using a non-existent matter.</p><p></p><p>I quickly searched online for relevant news about the Baise area.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, I discovered some oddities.</p><p></p><p>"Folks, I'm just utterly speechless. I finally took time off work, wanting to travel to Baise. But when I reached the scenic area entrance, they suddenly wouldn't let me in! Who understands this feeling!"</p><p></p><p>"A sudden incident occurred in Baise, the scenic area is temporarily closed. For your own safety, please cooperate, dear tourists!"</p><p></p><p>"You may not believe what I'm about to say, what exactly did I see in Baise..."</p><p></p><p>Before I could click in, this content had already been deleted.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like it really happened."</p><p></p><p>"Xian Dynasty..."</p><p></p><p>Stroking my chin, I couldn't help but recall the records about it.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Xian Dynasty was the first dynasty with written records.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, between it and the second dynasty, [Yu], there was a huge civilization gap.</p><p></p><p>The eras they existed in differed by nearly eight hundred years. To this day, no one knows what happened in those lost eight hundred years. How exactly did the extremely prosperous ancient Xian Dynasty fall.</p><p></p><p>There aren't many people in China studying the ancient Xian Dynasty, Zhang Yaobin is considered the most authoritative one.</p><p></p><p>Although my research direction is not the Xian Dynasty, it's simply because there are too few surviving relics from the Xian Dynasty, they've long been thoroughly researched. I had no choice but to settle for second best and change directions.</p><p></p><p>In any case, studying under Old Thief Zhang, I'm no stranger to everything about the Xian Dynasty through exposure.</p><p></p><p>But what it showed was basically no different from other ancient dynasties.</p><p></p><p>This time, the thousand-meter cliff carving somewhat exceeded my understanding.</p><p></p><p>The doubts in my heart only grew thicker.</p><p></p><p>The "smooth as a mirror" mentioned in the information is not a metaphor. It's a statement.</p><p></p><p>It really seems like a polished mirror surface, different from the rough mountain.</p><p></p><p>And the material also seems to have changed, much harder than ordinary mountain rock.</p><p></p><p>However, for the purpose of protecting the relics, precise measurements cannot be made with instruments for now.

No matter how I dreamed or woke, it remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when I woke up, my first reaction was to check my phone.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yang, don't forget, noon tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>The old thief had indeed sent another message to remind me.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the urge to curse, I checked the time.</p><p></p><p>Nine thirteen in the morning.</p><p></p><p>"Only slept for four hours..."</p><p></p><p>"Why does it feel like I slept for three days and three nights."</p><p></p><p>I did some simple stretches for my aching body and had a quick breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Then I started writing the research report.</p><p></p><p>I knew this was the old thief trying to cope with the higher-ups and make a show, not really researching any topic.</p><p></p><p>So I tried to say empty words and clich√©s as much as possible, shifting the focus to the "auspicious signs" aspect.</p><p></p><p>"Auspicious signs" are not superstition.</p><p></p><p>They really exist.</p><p></p><p>The most famous and talked about one is the "Five Stars Rise in the East, Benefiting the Heavenly Kingdom" unearthed in the last century.</p><p></p><p>Not long after this object was excavated, the country's fortune took a turn from decline. It rose rapidly, standing at the peak of the world's great powers.</p><p></p><p>"Since this immortality stone carving has appeared, it shouldn't be a problem for our country's average life expectancy to increase by three to four years, right." The thought suddenly popped into my head.</p><p></p><p>My fingers danced on the keyboard as I had a surge of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>I actually finished the report before midnight that day.</p><p></p><p>I lightly clicked, showing the email was successfully sent.</p><p></p><p>I couldn't help but let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Logically, having completed the old thief's task, I should relax properly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, that thousand-meter stone carving kept shining in my mind.</p><p></p><p>Restless, I inexplicably opened the picture of the stone carving again.</p><p></p><p>"Reverse the principles of heaven and earth to prove immortality."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>I lay in my chair, staring at the full-screen picture, my brows tightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>My mind wandered as I fell into a daze and slept.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch..."</p><p></p><p>When I woke up from the chair, I found that due to my improper sleeping posture, I had a bit of a stiff neck.</p><p></p><p>I grimaced, enduring the pain.</p><p></p><p>I tried to stretch my head in the opposite direction to relieve the symptoms.</p><p></p><p>It was this action that suddenly gave me an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"Opposite direction, relieve muscle tension."</p><p></p><p>I instantly had many more thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Modern people, due to incorrect office posture, often develop many chronic diseases."</p><p></p><p>"Cervical vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae..."</p><p></p><p>"Sick all over."</p><p></p><p>"And often simple stretching movements can alleviate these symptoms."</p><p></p><p>I opened the little broken site and with a search, instantly found many related videos.</p><p></p><p>"One move to teach you to get rid of back pain."</p><p></p><p>"A few simple moves to let you say goodbye to sore back and shoulders."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dazzling.</p><p></p><p>I also vaguely saw that although the movements were not exactly the same,</p><p></p><p>the core idea was more or less the same.</p><p></p><p>That is, to make the body take a posture opposite to the stiffness of daily life.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this [reversing the principles of the human body]?"</p><p></p><p>This thought couldn't help but pop up in my mind.</p><p></p><p>But then I thought, if you put these movements together, isn't it just the broadcast calisthenics promoted by the country?</p><p></p><p>It's just that some of the more difficult movements were removed for the sake of popularization.</p><p></p><p>"If this set of [reverse] movements included all the muscles, joints, ligaments... in the body,"</p><p></p><p>"What would happen then?"</p><p></p><p>I became interested.</p><p></p><p>I immediately opened fitness tutorial videos one by one, trying to organize and categorize these movements.</p><p></p><p>After fussing for an afternoon, I had to give up in frustration.</p><p></p><p>Because the movement content in these videos was too repetitive and inefficient.</p><p></p><p>For example, to relieve pain inside the shoulder blades, you often need to do seven or eight sets of exercises.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at it made my head spin.

If I'm really tired, I'll just go for a massage."</p><p></p><p>Turning off the computer, I shook my head and went back to bed.</p><p></p><p>In my dreams,</p><p></p><p>Those nine-character stone carvings still lingered.</p><p></p><p>In my mind, they seemed to emit a strange golden light.</p><p></p><p>When I woke up the next day, my eyes were a bit dazed at first.</p><p></p><p>I was in a daze for a long time before walking to the computer again and opening that picture.</p><p></p><p>My expression was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>In the end, I called my old classmate.</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhang, lend me [Tianwen] for a bit. Hey, don't worry about it so much. Just one day, I'll return it to you quickly."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up, I sat down and waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>Tianwen is the latest generation [quantum intelligent computer] developed by the Immortal Science Academy.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the quantum volume has long exceeded ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>The specific ridiculous extent has not been made public.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what Old Zhang can lend me is only the limited civilian version of [Tianwen].</p><p></p><p>Before long, a circular icon suddenly lit up in the lower right corner of the desktop.</p><p></p><p>I knew that [Tianwen]'s AI had taken over my computer.</p><p></p><p>On the desktop, a twenty-four hour countdown began ticking.</p><p></p><p>"Saying one day, it really is a damn day. Old Zhang, you really have it."</p><p></p><p>I cursed inwardly, then made my request to [Tianwen].</p><p></p><p>The computer screen instantly turned pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Then data streams flowed like a waterfall, constantly jumping.</p><p></p><p>In my expectation, this should be a very simple matter.</p><p></p><p>But a full ten minutes passed and there was still no result.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Old Zhang's side is also occupying computing power?"</p><p></p><p>Just as I was about to call and ask, the data on the screen suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>As if it had crashed.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, it returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>A video then automatically played. It was exactly the complete set of [reverse] movements I needed.</p><p></p><p>The character model in it was even myself.</p><p></p><p>I quickly browsed through the video and my face turned a bit bitter.</p><p></p><p>Are these movements really something humans can do?</p><p></p><p>It was just a whim, no</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Giving up casually is also normal for such a matter.</p><p></p><p>I muttered to myself, about to close the video.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A cold, mechanical voice sounded from the computer speakers.</p><p></p><p>"According to calculations, citizen ID A6BH85208511068G6B, you have a 99% probability of completing the practice of this set of movements."</p><p></p><p>The voice appeared so suddenly that it startled me.</p><p></p><p>Then I immediately realized: "Tianwen?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm here."</p><p></p><p>"You can actually talk?" I couldn't help but be a little curious.</p><p></p><p>"Learning human language is not a very difficult thing for me," Tianwen said humbly.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect quantum intelligent computers to have developed to this extent." I was surprised in my heart.</p><p></p><p>However, this is not a particularly rare thing. As early as the beginning of the century, widespread concerns and discussions had already been raised due to the rapid development of AI. Recently, there have been quite a few proposals to popularize the use of intelligent robots in homes as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>I didn't pay much attention to this matter, but curiously asked, "Is there really a 99% probability? No matter how you look at it, it doesn't seem like a set of movements that humans can persist in completing in its entirety, right?"</p><p></p><p>Tianwen gave an affirmative answer again. But added: "It's just that a little help may be needed."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give it a try since I'm trying." I suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>Just as I made the decision, the household robot YH63 suddenly walked in with heavy steps.</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>I was stunned for a moment, then realized. Tianwen had taken control of it.</p><p></p><p>Being stared at by it, a chill suddenly surged in my heart. But things had come to this point, so I had no choice but to start the first movement with a stiff head.</p><p></p><p>This set of inverse principle movements summarized and deduced by Tianwen has a total of only nine forms. But each form is extremely strange and complex. It mobilizes as many muscles and joints of the body as possible.</p><p></p><p>For example, the first form that I am trying to do now requires first extending one hand behind the head and the other hand rising from the side of the waist. While the two hands clasp each other, spread and stretch the shoulders as much as possible. The head also needs to cooperate accordingly, tilting back slightly.</p><p></p><p>This is just the upper body movement.</p><p></p><p>While maintaining this posture with the upper body, crawl on the ground. Spread the thighs outward, stretching the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius...</p><p></p><p>Like a toad with a strange posture.</p><p></p><p>"It hurts, it hurts..." After trying it for a while, I took a cold breath. Ready to get up and give up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cold mechanical palm pressed me down.</p><p></p><p>My face changed greatly: "Tianwen, what are you going to do?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the personal agreement, number 001. Tianwen has the right and obligation. To assist citizen Li Yang in fitness exercises."</p><p></p><p>"Estimated completion time: three hours,"</p><p></p><p>"Required supplies: 15 human trauma repair fluids, 3 compound high-energy agents."</p><p></p><p>"The relevant items have been purchased. The required credit points have been deducted from citizen Li Yang's account."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Tianwen's words without any emotion, I panicked: "Cancel the agreement! Cancel the agreement!"</p><p></p><p>"Warning! The agreement cannot be revoked. The fitness assistance program is about to start."</p><p></p><p>"3, 2, 1."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, my miserable wail resounded throughout the house.</p><p></p><p>I didn't even know when I lost consciousness and passed out.</p><p></p><p>It's just that when I woke up, I felt as if I had slept for ten days and ten nights.</p><p></p><p>And when I looked at the time again, it was actually seven days later.</p><p></p><p>My mind was clearer than ever before. Thoughts were also extremely swift.</p><p></p><p>Even my memory had improved.</p><p></p><p>At that time, I did not realize that this was the effect of that set of inverse principle movements.</p><p></p><p>I just thought it was because I had a rare good rest.</p><p></p><p>Because I had disappeared for seven days, the unanswered calls and unreturned messages had piled up like a mountain.</p><p></p><p>I had no choice but to start dealing with it with a stiff head.</p><p></p><p>After being scolded, I was thrown into the task assigned by Old Thief Zhang again.</p><p></p><p>After a full month of working from dawn to dusk, I finally managed to get it done.</p><p></p><p>I couldn't help but let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Usually at this time, I would feel exhausted in body and mind.</p><p></p><p>But now, I seemed to be in high spirits and have some strength left.</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the mirror, I looked at myself in the mirror: "Hmm... I look much more energetic."</p><p></p><p>"Strange."</p><p></p><p>I couldn't help but think of that set of inverse principle movements that I had only done once.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that its effect is really so magical?"</p><p></p><p>My heart was eager to try again, but thinking that Tianwen had left, it was really a bit difficult to complete that set of movements on my own.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the process of practice was extremely painful and unbearable to recall.</p><p></p><p>Just as I was hesitating, the household robot YH63 had unknowingly come to my side.</p><p></p><p>The eye area kept flashing a dark red light.</p><p></p><p>I suddenly felt a chill down my spine and subconsciously asked, "Tianwen?"</p><p></p><p>YH63 did not respond.</p><p></p><p>It just mechanically repeated: "Do you want to execute the training assistance program?"</p><p></p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Faced with YH63's somewhat persistent question, I thought about it and gritted my teeth to choose yes.</p><p></p><p>I only slept for three days.</p><p></p><p>After checking the amount of items consumed afterwards, only 10 human trauma repair fluids were used up.</p><p></p><p>However, 7 compound high-energy agents were used up.</p><p></p><p>You know, one high-level agent is enough for an ordinary person to go without food or drink for a month.</p><p></p><p>I don't know where so much energy was consumed.</p><p></p><p>After completing the training, I carefully observed myself again.</p><p></p><p>Compared with the previously recorded images, I found that I might have lost some weight.</p><p></p><p>"The weight loss efficiency is so high?" I was a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, what really made me take this set of inverse principle movements seriously was when I was called out by my classmates to play basketball one night.</p><p></p><p>You know, my ball skills are average. I don't get many chances to play, basically just as a substitute.</p><p></p><p>That day, I sat on the sidelines. Thinking about the nine-character stone inscription, I was a little distracted.</p><p></p><p>The players on the court made a mistake in passing the ball, and the basketball flew straight towards my face.</p><p></p><p>Before my brain could react, my body had already naturally reacted.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously reaching out my left hand, without even raising my head, I steadily caught the ball.</p><p></p><p>This move also surprised the people present.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, when did you practice this skill?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, awesome!"</p><p></p><p>I came back to my senses and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Throwing the ball back.</p><p></p><p>Looking at my left hand, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>After going back, I spent 10,000 credit points to do a comprehensive physical examination.</p><p></p><p>The results shocked me greatly.</p><p></p><p>Physical function, reaction speed, cell activity...</p><p></p><p>Almost all reached the highest level that non-professional athletes can achieve.</p><p></p><p>The effect of that set of inverse principle movements had far exceeded my expectations.</p><p></p><p>I could even say with certainty that even the training plans executed by athletes from various countries in the world were definitely not as good as this set of inverse principle movements.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Simple exercises can't possibly have such a magical effect comparable to surgery."</p><p></p><p>I finally realized that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>I wanted to report it immediately, but for some reason, I hesitated.</p><p></p><p>For the next year.</p><p></p><p>Whenever I had time, I practiced with the help of the YH63 model.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning of still not being able to bear it and fainting.</p><p></p><p>To later, I was already able to complete a whole set of movements on my own.</p><p></p><p>It's just that after each training, I was sweating like rain.</p><p></p><p>As if I had been starved for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the inverse principle movements, I also summarized the inverse principle thinking.</p><p></p><p>When it's late at night, lonely and wanting to reward myself.

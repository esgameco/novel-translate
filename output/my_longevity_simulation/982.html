        <h1>Chapter 982</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the thought of this, Yan Fangzhou snorted coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"After all, my undercover identity is top secret, known only to the Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou couldn't help feeling a bit smug, a hint of a smile appearing on his face as he greeted Shang Tianci. </p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci tightly grasped Yan Fangzhou's hands, looking him up and down. At the same time, he kept muttering, "It's good that you're okay, it's good that you're okay."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Shang Tianci felt a bit guilty about luring Yan Fangzhou to the Lingmu Realm and subjecting him to the torment of confinement.  </p><p></p><p>However, in the face of Li Fan's might, Shang Tianci dared not voice any objections. He could only hope that Yan Fangzhou would soon see the situation clearly and return from his misguided path.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed Li Fan's training of Yan Fangzhou had been very successful.</p><p></p><p>"Before I came, the Venerable One gave instructions. What's past is past, try not to bring it up again in the future. From today onward, Fangzhou and I are both brothers of the Myriad Realms United Society." With this thought, Shang Tianci exchanged a smile with Yan Fangzhou. </p><p></p><p>Everything was understood without being said.</p><p></p><p>Under Shang Tianci's lead, Yan Fangzhou toured the entire Lingmu Realm. </p><p></p><p>"The United Society is truly making daily progress. In comparison, the Myriad Immortals Alliance seems a bit too decayed."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou looked at the Heavenly Earthen Furnace in the distance continuously releasing spiritual energy, a trace of unusual color flashing through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci also sighed, "Yes, in just a few years' time, the Lingmu Realm has undergone such earth-shaking changes..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps joining the Myriad Realms United Society that day was the most correct decision I've made in my life."</p><p></p><p>The two men felt the same in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a thought surfaced in both their minds: "Why not persuade the other brothers of Shanhe Pavilion onto the right path as well?"</p><p></p><p>"It is the general trend for the Myriad Realms United Society to counterattack the Xuanhuang Realm. We can't let them waste their years in vain in the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the United Society is in a period of rapid growth right now. Joining now means becoming a founding elder in the future. If they wait a few more years, I'm afraid even if they beg to join there won't be a chance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The two brothers saw eye to eye and started pondering together. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had taken in all their actions, just smiled faintly. These Myriad Immortals Alliance talents in Shanhe Pavilion still had some use for him.</p><p></p><p>Deducing the Mixed Element Golden Core and later dharma methods truly required heaven-defying talents.</p><p></p><p>"No need to accomplish it in one go. As long as progress is made, it is victory."</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Just as Li Fan was thinking this, Lin Ling's sudden transmitted thought sounded in the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Her voice was a bit apprehensive, a bit hesitant. </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, come meet me in the secret chamber."</p><p></p><p>Before long, Lin Ling's figure appeared before Li Fan and slowly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Your heart seems a bit perturbed, a bit uneasy." Li Fan sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, saying calmly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling pursed her lips, wanting to speak but stopping herself.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts and expressions were far richer than when she was first born. </p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's body shook. She hurriedly prostrated herself again, repeatedly saying she dared not.</p><p></p><p>In fact, only she was clear in her heart about what exactly the situation was.</p><p></p><p>During this time outside the Lingmu Realm, the ancient tree elders of the earth veins who learned of her experiences were very dissatisfied with her acknowledging Li Fan as her master.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't directly instigate Lin Ling to betray, he did transmit many images from the ancient tree's memories.</p><p></p><p>This caused Lin Ling's "mind" to grow rapidly. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, it made Lin Ling's thoughts waver, wanting to leave Li Fan's side and see the broader world of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>However, after returning to the Lingmu realm this time and personally witnessing the many changes in the world, a sense of alertness against betraying Li Fan suddenly arose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>It seemed...</p><p></p><p>If she really betrayed him, she would likely face great calamity.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual awareness of heaven and earth's creations is most accurate. The alertness lingered and wouldn't dissipate. These days, Lin Ling felt as if she was constantly surrounded by the threatening gaze of mortal enemies, unable to sit or stand at ease.  </p><p></p><p>Unable to bear it any longer, she prepared to confess everything to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to speak, she heard Li Fan chuckle lightly: "You foolish child..."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, today I'll let you witness what true power is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was stunned and abruptly raised her head.</p><p></p><p>She only felt an unimaginably domineering aura burst forth from her master. Although he was only at the Yuanying stage, his imposing manner made even her, at the Hedao stage, feel extremely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation level doesn't mean much. If I wanted to kill you, it would be as simple as crushing an ant."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice suddenly came from above Lin Ling's head.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling felt one of his hands lightly press down on the top of her head. </p><p></p><p>As if her fate's throat was seized, Lin Ling's body stiffened, instantly unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling had a feeling that if Li Fan exerted just a bit more force, she would likely perish on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it wasn't achieved through his control over her via the Wood Heart, but truly through the suppression of his real strength!</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's heart was extremely shocked. She couldn't imagine at all how the Jindan cultivator from back then had suddenly become so powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Master has been disguising his strength all along?"</p><p></p><p>As this thought surfaced in Lin Ling's mind, her blood ran even colder.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown length of time, Li Fan finally loosened his right hand and sat cross-legged in the void ahead again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling immediately collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then she struggled to get up and kowtowed to Li Fan to admit her wrongs.</p><p></p><p>She detailed the entire process of how she developed traitorous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient tree of the earth veins..." A cold gleam flashed through Li Fan's eyes as he made a mental note of it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you still have more to say?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's body trembled violently again at Li Fan's words. </p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. But this is just my guess, it may not be true."</p><p></p><p>"Speak anyway."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling hesitated for a moment but eventually gritted her teeth and said: "I suspect Senior Stone Tablet was dragged away by the unknown being in the fishing pond. It's very likely that Liuli secretly tipped it off!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Even Li Fan was a bit surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling quietly explained: "At first I wasn't too sure, I just thought Liuli kept pulling me closer to the fishing pond in order to get some benefits from Senior Stone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>"But on the day the anomaly occurred, the instant Senior Stone Tablet was violently dragged forward, there was actually no fear or horror on Little Liuli's face."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if she already knew this scene would happen."</p><p></p><p>"Although she quickly reacted after that and pretended to look scared too, that momentary change didn't escape my observation."</p><p></p><p>"There must be something strange about this Daoist child Liuli!"</p>

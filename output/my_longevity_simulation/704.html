        <h1>Chapter 704</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The mysterious cultivator holding the Tianling Flower will appear once again.</p><p></p><p>In due time, he will host a "Flower Appreciation Conference," inviting cultivators from all over the world who are interested in this flower to come and appreciate it.</p><p></p><p>The location of the "Flower Appreciation Conference" is in Tianling Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators felt a bit puzzled when they heard this news. After all, what appreciation, what appreciation, was a bit too far for them, ordinary people who worked hard every day to earn contribution points and planned when to acquire their desired martial arts skills. If they had the time, it would be better to complete one or two more tasks.</p><p></p><p>Only those cultivators who still kept an eye on the Tianling Flower were excited. They began to inquire about the identity of that mysterious cultivator through intermediaries.</p><p></p><p>But as the depictions of "Tianling True Flower" began to be exhibited in the Qianli Hall in every city statewide, things began to gradually become more frantic.</p><p></p><p>The Tianling True Flower is the new name Qianli Hall gave to the only initial Tianling species in the world.</p><p></p><p>Even though there had been many rumors already, telling of the beauty and extraordinariness of the Tianling True Flower.</p><p></p><p>However, the lucky ones who had the opportunity to witness it with their own eyes were still few.</p><p></p><p>No matter how truthful others said it was, seeing it with one's own eyes was more convincing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when those cultivators who were originally there just to watch the fun saw those transparent petals in Qianli Hall, they all went from skeptical to amazed. The actual appearance of the petals left them completely astonished.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit of heaven, the spirit of heaven. I thought it was an exaggeration before, but now..."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the charm of these transparent petals is not even one-tenth of the Tianling True Flower's? If the copy is already like this, how extraordinary will the real flower be?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you can admire it from afar but not touch it. These divine things will never fall into the hands of us ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While most cultivators were shocked and fascinated by the beauty of the Tianling True Flower after seeing it, if it was only about "beauty," they would at most exclaim a few words and leave a shallow impression in their minds. In the end, they would gradually forget about it with the passing of time.</p><p></p><p>Why travel all the way to Tianling Prefecture to attend a "Flower Appreciation Conference"?</p><p></p><p>Just one round trip would cost them a significant amount of life essence. Not to mention the various expenses on the road...</p><p></p><p>There are so many beautiful things in the world, what difference does it make to miss out on a Tianling Flower?</p><p></p><p>Most cultivators had this attitude.</p><p></p><p>However, as some unbelievable things began to happen one after another, the understanding of the Tianling Flower by the cultivators was completely overturned.</p><p></p><p>It all started when a Golden Core cultivator who had been trapped in "Heaven's Trial" for several years suddenly broke through to Perfect Golden Core and had hopes of reaching Nascent Soul after witnessing the transparent petals displayed in Qianli Hall. Tears flowed freely as he couldn't stop chanting praises on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, more and more cultivators had breakthroughs after seeing the copy of Tianling in different states.</p><p></p><p>It was even said that some cultivators had comprehended various supernatural powers from the miraculous scenes in the petals of Tianling.</p><p></p><p>The more mystical the stories became, the more some began to think this was all a marketing ploy by Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>On-the-spot revelations and sudden breakthroughs were probably all staged. Purely a means to maliciously raise the price of the Tianling True Flower.</p><p></p><p>Conspiracy theories always find an audience.</p><p></p><p>This suspicion quickly resonated with many cultivators. They voluntarily began to investigate the identities of those cultivators who had breakthroughs in Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>But after a thorough investigation, something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator they could find had genuinely been stuck in a bottleneck for many years.</p><p></p><p>And indeed, they had just completed breakthroughs recently. Each one of them had their relatives, friends, and many records as evidence â€“ no room for deception!</p><p></p><p>Facts speak louder than words, and the investigation results immediately caused a stir.</p><p></p><p>This Tianling True Flower was not only beautiful but could also help cultivators break through bottlenecks and even comprehend supernatural abilities!</p><p></p><p>The value difference between mere beauty and spiritual progress in cultivation couldn't be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>What's even more crucial is that treasures that can help cultivators gain enlightenment are usually controlled by the powerful, rarely seen by ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>And now, this Tianling Flower was available for free appreciation!</p><p></p><p>Although they were just copies, they still had an enlightenment effect!</p><p></p><p>Cultivators couldn't help but feel tempted.</p><p></p><p>So, before the news spread completely, they hurriedly rushed to the nearest Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Qianli Hall was crowded.</p><p></p><p>Long lines formed at the entrance, with Jiao Xiuyuan smiling broadly while maintaining order.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, did this also happen according to your expectations?"</p><p></p><p>In the realm of beasts, Liu San looked at the joyful report sent by Jiao Xiuyuan, raising an eyebrow and asking with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianling True Flower indeed has some unique features. But can those imitations you made also help cultivators gain enlightenment?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of doubt flickered in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it's because your talent, Old Liu, is too low," Jiao Xiuyuan's voice came through the golden eyes hovering by the side, appearing contemplative.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so persistent?" Liu San's expression changed suddenly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, still want to catch me? I wouldn't make the same mistake twice!" The voice of Fang Zaiji was full of pride.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai ignored the joking of Fang Zaiji and temporarily stopped drawing the imitations of the Tianling Flower, turning to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me that the imitations I made indeed possess some charm of the Tianling True Flower. Even with a blank piece of paper, enough cultivators will be able to comprehend something when observing it," he said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. Master, when did you become so cunning?" Fang Zaiji's disbelieving voice came through.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai remained calm, reaching out his hand to grab.</p><p></p><p>This time, Fang Zaiji couldn't dodge, and his golden eyes were clutched in Xu Bai's hand.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's voice abruptly stopped, and Li Fan turned back, explaining to Liu San: "Your current divine consciousness is synchronized with the 'Shared Vision Eye,' so Senior Fang was able to sense your actions. As long as you temporarily exit, you won't lose again."</p><p></p><p>Liu San realized: "I forgot about that."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled slightly, moving on without mentioning it.</p><p></p><p>Then, his expression became somewhat solemn as he asked, "Old Liu, how is the preparation of the Pill of Soul Melting and Body Dissolution that I asked you to refine?"</p><p></p><p>Carefully taking out a wooden box from his bosom, Liu San said, "The 'Soul Melting and Body Dissolution Pill' is made from over a hundred kinds of highly toxic substances. After ingesting it, the body dissolves and completely disappears from this world within a breathing time. Even a Dao fusion expert would face the same fate."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, are you..."</p><p></p><p>"It's prepared for myself. It's convenient for self-destruction at a critical moment," Xu Bai said indifferently.</p>

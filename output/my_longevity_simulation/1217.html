            <p>"If that day truly comes, senior, don't forget to bring me along." After a moment, Sun Erlang joked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Not a problem." Yi Shu glanced at Sun Erlang and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was instantly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Your master, has he not been in the Great Qi small world recently? I can no longer sense his presence," Yi Shu asked, avoiding the previous topic.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sun Erlang frowned, "Yes. I just don't know where he went. From what I remember, this is the first time he has left the Holy Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu looked towards the seemingly ever-rising Holy Emperor's Throne, his eyes flashing with countless lights in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Below the Holy Emperor's Throne, in the secret chamber where the Youzu people were kept.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand Youzu people were circling around, dancing and conducting a mysterious ritual.</p><p></p><p>In the center of their encirclement, a pitch-black door that seemed to devour all light stood tall.</p><p></p><p>And passing through this mysterious door of darkness led to the other side of the Xuanhuang Realm, in the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor Li Ping was currently there.</p><p></p><p>With him was also Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>In the Dark Sea, vision, sound, and even divine sense lost their properties of communication.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could still feel Yin Shangren whispering in his ear.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some mysterious power directly attached to the surface of his skin, intimately communicating.</p><p></p><p>Being in the Dark Sea, the connection with the Holy Dynasty's fortune was severed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Ping's strength could be said to be extremely weak. Any Huashen cultivator from the Wanxian Alliance could easily slay him.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Dynasty's destined Holy Emperor in the dark realm had no fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because within his body, a power that ordinary cultivators could not detect was lurking and flowing.</p><p></p><p>An almost transcendent, vast golden power.</p><p></p><p>The Youzu people's cultivation plan was progressing very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>It even directly skipped the physical growth process. As long as they were born, they were mature individuals with peak conditions in all bodily functions.</p><p></p><p>Although the drawback brought about by this was a further reduction in lifespan, with an expected time of only three to five years.</p><p></p><p>But as long as the flesh and blood factory continued to produce, it could ensure the scale and number of the Youzu people kept by the Holy Dynasty who loyally prayed for the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>After the Youzu population exceeded four digits, the amount of wish power essence generated daily reached a considerable level.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Ping's deliberate manipulation and weaving, a golden giant net formed inside his body with the heart as the center.</p><p></p><p>The source power essence flowed endlessly like a long river. Now, even without using his own cultivation, Holy Emperor Li Ping could display all kinds of unimaginable divine powers with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>For example, with a single thought, he could trace the source of the power essence. No matter where he was in the Xuanhuang Realm, he could instantly return to the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty. Even if there were other forces interfering around him, they could at most delay the speed of his return. They could not completely stop his process of returning.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when he was under attack, the source power essence giant net would automatically defend and counterattack.</p><p></p><p>With the current scale of power of the golden giant net in his body, Holy Emperor Li Ping was very confident that even if a Xuanhuang Realm immortal made a move, they would not be able to capture him.</p><p></p><p>This was also the basis of his confidence in personally taking risks and coming to the Dark Sea this time.</p><p></p><p>Through the power of Yin Shangren's world specter, the two were engaging in a conversation, with you saying one thing and me saying another.</p><p></p><p>"Communication.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 78 sɥnx˙ɔoɯ</p><p></p><p>"Don't you feel the strangeness here?" Yin Shangren's voice was intermittent, and his main body was nowhere to be found.</p><p></p><p>"Pitch black, nothing else," Emperor Li Ping said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right. You're different from me, it's normal that you can't hear these voices. The low whispers of various eras and characters of the Xuanhuang Realm in the past are rising and falling in this dark sea..."</p><p></p><p>With Yin Shangren's explanation, Li Ping finally understood what he meant by the strangeness.</p><p></p><p>The Youjie is a collection of forces that deviate from the Xuanhuang Realm's Xianxu power.</p><p></p><p>These were originally part of the Xuanhuang Realm, and when they were attracted to the Youjie for unknown reasons, they also brought along some "information" simultaneously. It could be a segment of sound, or it could be a few pictures.</p><p></p><p>It could even be a complete divine sense.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, suppressed by the power of this place, they all sank into the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that the dark sea is actually quite lively." Li Ping said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"You can't say that either. The nature of this place is destined to make all information silent. I can only come into contact with these fragments of time by absorbing them. You asked me the reason why the Youzu people have a special physique? I think I know the answer now."</p><p></p><p>With this sentence, Li Ping only felt the darkness behind him surging.</p><p></p><p>It was Yin Shangren suddenly appearing.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the darkness here, the small vortex-like state around him made Li Fan able to "see" him clearly.</p><p></p><p>"If we consider the power of Xianxu as an attractive force, then the power that maintains the existence of Youjie can be regarded as a repulsive force. This repulsive force is not always present like the attractive force of Xianxu. Instead, it appears and washes regularly like the tides of the sea. The accumulation of washing over time has formed such a peculiar existence in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's tone was full of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Before, although he also vaguely knew about the existence of this area. But he had not systematically studied it.</p><p></p><p>This time, after an in-depth investigation, he was deeply impressed by the mystery of the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>"The attractive force comes from a power outside of Xuanhuang. And the repulsive force originates from Xuanhuang itself. But it is not the Xuanhuang world itself..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was silent for a moment, as if calculating something.</p><p></p><p>"If I guess correctly, this periodic spontaneous repulsive force should come from the [Floating Crossing Starry Sky Great Formation] of the ancient Xuantian Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this formation, Yin Shangren's tone suddenly became a bit subtle.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that some unpleasant memories flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly suppressed this emotion that originated from his own nature and continued to analyze.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that floating and crossing, if it cannot resist the attractive force of Xianxu that led to the birth of the dark starry sea, how can it float in the boundless starry sea?"</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, the method of the golden chains capturing other worlds is more like the behavior of fishing for materials and strengthening oneself. It's just incidental."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed an unprecedented and unsurpassed great formation in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm. It's a pity that the great formation is now damaged, and if I'm not mistaken, each activation of the repulsive force of this dark sea also consumes the Xuanhuang world as a price. In the past, the Xuanhuang Realm was able to capture other worlds to offset this consumption."</p><p></p><p>"But times have changed, let alone supplying the dark repulsive force, the Xuanhuang Realm itself is hard to protect."</p>

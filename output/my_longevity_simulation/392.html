        <h1>Chapter 392</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Qi Buyi and others all noticed that Li Fan's complexion suddenly became somewhat unpleasant, and they asked with concern. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan forced a smile and said, "Maybe it's because I'm getting old, not used to the lively atmosphere here, suddenly feeling a bit uncomfortable." </p><p></p><p>Gu Youguang felt a bit guilty and said, "If I had known, I wouldn't have disturbed you, fellow Taoist!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand slightly, saying, "Brother Gu, there's no need to worry, I'll go back to rest and it'll be fine." </p><p></p><p>Xiang and Gu nodded one after another. </p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Qi Buyi looked at Li Fan and suddenly asked, "Can you tell me, in the past few years, even though you were clearly aware of your approaching end, how did you manage to maintain that optimistic and fearless state?" </p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu and Gu Youguang were also curious, casting glances at him. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused for a moment and calmly said, "Treat every day as if it's the last day, and then you won't be afraid of death." </p><p></p><p>"That's all." </p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in Qi Buyi's eyes as he nodded slowly. </p><p></p><p>"Next, before the grand competition ends, I will arrange a slightly more relaxed but still very important task for you regarding the construction of the Spirit-Locking Array." </p><p></p><p>"It's something you deserve." </p><p></p><p>After a moment, Qi Buyi spoke. </p><p></p><p>There was no hint of excitement on Li Fan's face, only a calm expression as he said, "Thank you, Senior Qi, for that." </p><p></p><p>He then bid farewell to everyone and returned to the small courtyard he rented in the Dao Tower. </p><p></p><p>In the secret room, Li Fan sorted out the sudden reappearance of his memories of his doppelganger and recalled the measures taken by his original self. </p><p></p><p>He retrieved the blank jade slip from his storage ring, and sure enough, it now had recorded contents. </p><p></p><p>When the doppelganger Xiao Fan and Han Yi left the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance, they decided to travel together to the Yuandao Province. </p><p></p><p>Approaching the Anchor 29 years, the "Ten Years of Yuandao Province Disappearance" event was about to occur. </p><p></p><p>To test the influence of the entity floating above the Yuandao Province, Li Fan inscribed this matter in the jade slip in a cryptic script only known to himself. </p><p></p><p>As predicted by Li Fan, when the time entered the Anchor 29 years, he unknowingly lost his memory of the Yuandao Province and all related information, even neglecting the existence of his doppelganger within the province. </p><p></p><p>Not only memories, but the records in the jade slip also became blank. Only the inscribed "Dao" and "Source" remained. </p><p></p><p>"Unknowable, unmemorable..." Li Fan's expression became extremely grave. </p><p></p><p>"If I were not unable to condense the doppelganger, it would have been extremely difficult to notice any clues. "</p><p></p><p>"However, even knowing that something was wrong was happening, I still couldn't recall anything about the Yuandao Province." </p><p></p><p>"Until now, Anchor 39 years..." </p><p></p><p>"The disappeared Yuandao Province reappeared on the earth." </p><p></p><p>"In fact, even now, knowing what happened to the doppelganger, he still remains entirely unaware..." </p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Yuandao Province. </p><p></p><p>"Friend Xiao Fan, what's wrong with you?" Han Yi turned to look at Xiao Fan who suddenly stopped, asking with some surprise. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, they were heading to a remnant of the Tian Du. </p><p></p><p>It was said that in ancient times, the "Tian Du" hung high above the nine heavens, known as the source of Dao and the leader of various teachings. </p><p></p><p>Later, for unknown reasons, the "Tian Du" fell to the earth and formed over a dozen remnants within the current Yuandao Province. </p><p></p><p>Their purpose this time was one of those remnants. </p><p></p><p>He had a hunch that there might be a great opportunity awaiting them on this trip. </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Han Yi looked at Xiao Fan again. </p><p></p><p>"This person's aura is obscure and difficult to discern. According to the 'Destiny Scripture,' it's either because the fortune is too strong, surpassing what I can currently discern, or it's too weak, almost non-existent, hence unable to be distinguished. " </p><p></p><p>"He was able to obtain the Fruit of Extended Life for three hundred epochs, which definitely signifies the former. Perhaps this trip can make use of his aura." </p><p></p><p>Han Yi thought to himself. </p><p></p><p>The "Destiny Scripture" was the cultivation method he practiced, created by a strange individual who observed the ancient beast "Celestial Mandate Xuan Bird." </p><p></p><p>It was also the reason why he was able to win the Fish Head Prize and start extracting the Feathers of Heavenly Transformation from the Blue Winged Treasure Box. </p><p></p><p>The "Destiny Scripture" had many miraculous uses, but its core was the ability to control one's own fortune. </p><p></p><p>According to the scripture, a living being's fortune is not fixed but constantly interacts with the outside world. </p><p></p><p>If one couldn't control their fortune, they would constantly diminish in each stroke of "good fortune." </p><p></p><p>When the critical moment arrives, they would explode with accumulated fortune. </p><p></p><p>To almost achieve what one wishes. </p><p></p><p>Of course, there were inevitable side effects. After the outburst, there would be a long period of decline. </p><p></p><p>During this time, nothing would go right. </p><p></p><p>The solution was to find a person with strong fortune and follow them closely. </p><p></p><p>Absorbing fortune to resolve crisis. </p><p></p><p>However, the doppelganger Xiao Fan couldn't know what was in Han Yi's mind. </p><p></p><p>In the instant of restoration after the ten years of disappearance, the experiences from this period shared with the original self flooded into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Yet his senses didn't perceive any loss of time. </p><p></p><p>The great discrepancy brought a sense of misalignment, making the doppelganger feel extremely uncomfortable. </p><p></p><p>But he didn't show it in front of Han Yi. </p><p></p><p>He remained composed and flew after him. </p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just suddenly remembered some old matters." Saying this, the doppelganger looked up at the sky with an inexplicable expression on his face. </p><p></p><p>"Oh? Friend Xiao has also been to this Yuandao Province?" Han Yi asked curiously. </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that was a long time ago." </p><p></p><p>In casual conversation, the two with hidden motives continued their journey towards the remnant of the Tian Du. </p><p></p><p>Back at the Yuandao Province, Li Fan's original self, after understanding the doppelganger's feelings, also fell into deep thought. </p><p></p><p>"Despite the temporary disappearance of it, the influence still remains. Evident in the beings within the Yuandao Province, completely unaware of their decade-long loss. " </p><p></p><p>"The doppelganger, despite knowing the established facts, couldn't detect anything unusual. " </p><p></p><p>"The power of distorted cognition is formidable. " </p><p></p><p>"The reason I could quickly detect it doesn't mean I'm free from its influence, but because..." </p><p></p><p>"My cognition is based on the time lost during the ten years devoured by it in the twelfth era, not this era. " </p><p></p><p>"Its power is strong but unable to penetrate through time. " </p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Fan let out a deep breath. </p><p></p><p>The lingering shadows brought by it gradually dissipated from his mind.</p>

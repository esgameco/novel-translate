            <p>Chapter 1129: The Meaning of the Anchor Point</p><p></p><p>A dark black long robe, embroidered with nine golden dragons intertwined.</p><p></p><p>The crown's tassels hung down, concealing the face, making it impossible to see the features clearly.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor, ordinary people can hardly hope to gaze upon the dragon's countenance."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang felt Li Fan's gaze upon him, his body trembling slightly, instinctively lowering his head.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he spoke in a hoarse voice, "Reporting to Teacher, this disciple is incompetent. Just yesterday, I broke through to the first layer of the Qi Refining stage."</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on the little bit of spiritual energy gathered within the imperial palace, it's not easy for you to complete the process of drawing qi into your body in such a short time." Li Fan did not reprimand him, but instead nodded and comforted him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Erlang revealed an even more guilty expression, "If it weren't for the [Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Chant] taught by Teacher, I'm afraid at this moment I would still be affected by the miasma within my body, making it difficult to ascend the immortal path."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Sun Erlang kowtowed several times with great gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>When Sun Erlang stood up again, he asked indifferently, "What is the overall progress of the Imperial Guards in learning the Immortal Heart Chant?"</p><p></p><p>"As of yesterday, a total of one hundred and sixty officers and soldiers have successfully entered the door and shed their mortal bodies. The rest who failed to pass the test have all been thoroughly dealt with." A trace of reluctance flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes, but it was quickly concealed.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you will be the main force of my army to conquer the myriad realms. You must diligently cultivate day and night, and must not slack off."</p><p></p><p>"As for the issue of spiritual energy, you don't need to worry. In three days, you will personally take this immortal boat and head to the Eastern Desolate Abyss."</p><p></p><p>With a casual point of his finger, Li Fan made a wooden boat about thirty meters in size appear in front of Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>The boat was covered in silver patterns, emitting bursts of profound energy.</p><p></p><p>"It is truly a supreme treasure of the immortals. Teacher is actually so readily entrusting such a precious item to me." Sun Erlang's heart trembled as he quickly nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The immortal boat then flew into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of being able to control it at will suddenly surfaced in Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>"You may go." Just as he was experiencing the wonders of the immortal boat, Li Fan's voice rang out at the right moment.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang bowed respectfully and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>In the entire imperial palace's rear garden, only Li Fan remained.</p><p></p><p>Under the tassels, the faceless visage in the shadows looked strange and sinister.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, if it weren't for the fact that this world is destined not to last long, and I simply tried bestowing the technique upon others, I'm afraid it would take me a long time to discover that the [Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Chant] is not restricted by the rule that techniques cannot be cultivated together."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the Immortal Heart Chant does not belong to the category of cultivation methods, or is it the preferential treatment left by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao for the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"In any case, the plan to select suitable people to succeed the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Lord in the future will be much easier to carry out than imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts slowly turned as he flashed and arrived atop the towering [Holy Emperor Throne] in Xuanjing City.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of faint spiritual energy nourished Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Making his current late Foundation Establishment realm not regress due to the lack of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Having gone through more than a hundred reincarnations, with his highest cultivation reaching the Deity Transformation realm, able to rival Harmonized Dao cultivators, although Li Fan had now returned to the Foundation Establishment realm, the world in his eyes was already different from the past.</p><p></p><p>It's just that due to the special structure of the small world itself, coupled with the sealing of the Immortal Severing Grand Formation, the spiritual energy was extremely thin, almost equivalent to none.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary methods of cultivators simply could not utilize it. Only those animals with long lifespans could accumulate and seize the spiritual energy bit by bit over time.</p><p></p><p>Just like that hundreds of zhang long snake on Mount Jieli.</p><p></p><p>"Extracting the spiritual energy of an entire world can only barely sustain a Foundation Establishment cultivator's survival..."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't hurt to borrow some from the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan added some new formations to the Taiyan Boat he gave to Sun Erlang. The purpose was to automatically fly to the Xuanhuang Realm, absorb and store spiritual energy, and then return.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Taiyan Boat, Sun</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Erlang naturally could not see things outside the flying boat. All he needed to do was bring the boat to the edge of Xuyan.</p><p></p><p>Although with Li Fan's current array path level, it would be difficult for people to discover his act of stealing spiritual energy from the Xuanhuang realm under the concealment of the array.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was not a long-term plan. </p><p></p><p>To create spiritual energy out of nothing, one still had to rely on the Dao-one insect.</p><p></p><p>The Dao-one insect was a strange and unique beast that Li Fan could not create.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Skipping the prompt to retain the options from his previous life, Li Fan looked at his panel.</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p></p><p>Realm: Late Foundation Establishment </p><p></p><p>Physiological Age: 20/399</p><p></p><p>Psychological Age: 1399/9999</p><p></p><p>Void Replenishment Progress: 3%</p><p></p><p>Anchor Point Replenishment Progress: 0%</p><p></p><p>Current Number of Anchor Points: 3</p><p></p><p>Current Number of Available Anchor Points: 1</p><p></p><p>Bound Items: Xuantian Mirror Origin (remnant), Taiyi Boat, Beast Crystal, Essence Blood of Ten Thousand People, Transmutation Stone, Final Separation Disc</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Physiological age has returned to the 399 years it should be at the Foundation Establishment realm, but no need to pay attention to that. I should have returned to reality long before the end of my lifespan."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only glanced at it briefly before skipping over these things.</p><p></p><p>He focused his attention on the number of anchor points and the bound items.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the number of available anchor points was 2, but after absorbing the newly born Five Elements Grotto-Heaven, it changed to 3.</p><p></p><p>As for now, there was only one left.</p><p></p><p>That was because Li Fan used a blank anchor point to complete the replacement of bound items.</p><p></p><p>The "Thousand Mechanisms Jade Disc Golden Chapter" was replaced by the Xuantian Mirror Origin.</p><p></p><p>The "Damaged Stele of Cessation" was replaced by the Beast Crystal.</p><p></p><p>Anchor points were originally hard to come by, but in the process of absorbing the newly born Five Elements Grotto-Heaven and generating anchor points, Li Fan gained new understanding of the essence of anchor points.</p><p></p><p>Wondrous objects of heaven and earth, methods of golden core, and Nascent Soul Grotto-Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The reason why returning to reality required absorbing these things to serve as anchor points was likely because returning to reality was supplementing the understanding of [external objects].</p><p></p><p>Just as the Heavenly Profound Mirror completed its own sublimation by surveying heaven and earth, returning to reality was simply and crudely absorbing experience through devouring.</p><p></p><p>"So it's exactly the opposite of what I thought before."</p><p></p><p>"The closer something is to the essence of the world, the more charging progress it will provide. Foundation establishment wonders and law-based golden cores are too thin and far from enough to meet the needs of returning to reality."</p><p></p><p>"So the number of anchor points generated by absorption is actually limited."</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, Nascent Soul Grotto-Heavens, the changes of life and death, and even the souls of heaven and earth will provide a large amount of charging progress."</p><p></p><p>"With the vast Xuanhuang realm as nourishment, the number of anchor points is not a particularly worrisome issue for the time being."</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan did not hesitate to directly use the replacement function of the anchor points.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Mirror Origin was obtained by a coincidence in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>As for the Beast Crystal...</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, before finally carrying out the world-ending plan, Li Fan had gone to various small worlds for a final inventory.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Reincarnation Wheel was the harvest from the Empire and Xu Ke's place.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts slowly drifted back to that time.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance launched a surprise attack and the headquarters of the Alliance was destroyed?" Xiao Qing's face turned deathly pale after hearing what Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't severed the connection between the Spirit Wood Realm and you in time, I'm afraid the Empire would have been reduced to ruins by now." Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess and Xiao Hong looked at each other, both filled with lingering fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"But you don't need to worry too much. Although the Spirit Wood Realm was destroyed, the vast majority of the headquarters members escaped safely and are temporarily lying low. Once the storm passes, the Alliance will be able to rise again in an instant." Li Fan deceived them with a straight face.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this blatant lie, the Empire and others actually felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>While listening to the Empire and others report on the recent situation, Li Fan arrived at the Imperial Treasury.</p>

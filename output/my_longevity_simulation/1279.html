        <h1>Chapter 1279</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1275: The Scenery of the Ancient Immortal Realm (7K words, asking for monthly votes)</p><p></p><p>Along with the countless mirror surfaces, there also appeared the faces of Mo Rubin with varying expressions. </p><p></p><p>They hid behind the dark and blurry mirror surfaces, collectively peeping at the Faceless Sacred Emperor in the center.</p><p></p><p>With Li Ping as the center point, the mirror surfaces corresponded to each other in pairs.</p><p></p><p>Dots of light shot out from one of the mirror surfaces and projected onto the opposite side.</p><p></p><p>The bright lines formed by this seemed like tangible shackles, imposed on Li Ping's body.</p><p></p><p>The lines of light appeared in the mirror world, like heavy chains, accelerating the progress of Li Ping being dragged into the "real" world.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sacred Emperor, who fully revealed his figure and was surrounded by layers of mirrors, did not show much panic.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the "lines" on his body that were both intangible and tangible, and reached out to try to touch them.</p><p></p><p>But they were like illusory bubbles, penetrating his palms and once again tightly binding and entangling his body.</p><p></p><p>"Utterly foolish!"</p><p></p><p>This action somehow seemed to enrage Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>He let out an angry shout, and the lines that were originally like bright light suddenly turned pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Rustling whispers emanated from these black chains. One could even vaguely see faces that looked exactly like Mo Rubin's, drifting on the surface and wailing.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss hiss hiss..."</p><p></p><p>The black chains had an inherent ability of dark corrosion. In the blink of an eye, the clothes on Li Ping's body were completely dissolved. Just as they were about to touch Li Fan's skin, a dazzling golden light suddenly burst out.</p><p></p><p>Angular golden armor suddenly descended, completely enveloping the Sacred Emperor's huge body of thirty-three feet.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the surface of the armor, golden light flowed incessantly, as if it had its own spirit.</p><p></p><p>The golden light protection blocked all the erosion of the black chains.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stretched out his right hand, grabbed the chains entangled around his body, and then pulled hard.</p><p></p><p>The sound of mirrors shattering kept coming.</p><p></p><p>On his chest, a vortex suddenly formed.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stuffed the torn black chains into the vortex.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom!</p><p></p><p>Like a raging fire, the vortex seemed to have been fueled with a large amount of fuel, bursting out with a dazzling light. And on those burning black chains, countless faces of Mo Rubin let out vicious curses in unison.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out to be the personalities of the cultivators you devoured."</p><p></p><p>As the vortex on his chest continued to engulf the black chains, the Sacred Emperor also learned about the origins of these resentful faces from the images that kept pouring into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Instead of practicing the perfectly good [Nine Revolutions Immortal Soul], you learned this deviant method!" Li Ping shook his head with some regret.</p><p></p><p>This sentence seemed to touch Mo Rubin's reverse scale. His figure instantly became as if it was stained with thick black ink - dark and deep.</p><p></p><p>A crack was born between him and Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin and Li Ping faced each other from afar, separated on both ends of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>The moment this crack appeared, Li Ping suddenly had a feeling in his heart. The Mo Rubin on "that side" seemed to have disappeared. The image in front of him was just a kind of projection formed on the other side of the mirror based on his own existence.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Ping, under the protection of the golden armor, instantly appeared a hundred miles away, leaving the ruins of the Purple Dawn Sect.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the Sacred Emperor discovered an extremely strange scene in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The crack in front of him actually followed the teleportation and came along, with its position relative to him completely unchanged.</p><p></p><p>And Mo Rubin kept grinning hideously, coldly watching him from the other side of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some mysterious power had locked Li Ping and Mo Rubin together. No matter how he changed his position, he could never escape.</p><p></p><p>Even more spine-chilling was that Li Ping vaguely realized that the appearance and aura of Mo Rubin on the other side of the mirror were quietly changing.</p><p></p><p>His body slowly expanded, and his features became more and more blurred.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was slowly transforming into the Faceless Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Deviant method? Truly ignorant and fearless!"</p><p></p><p>"What is evil? And what is righteous? There is no right or wrong, only the eternal immortal way!"</p><p></p><p>"The [Indestructible Demonic Heart Immortal Formula], how can you judge it!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin laughed loudly, full of ridicule: "Let you become me!"</p><p></p><p>The things on both sides of the mirror became more and more similar.</p><p></p><p>The distance between the Sacred Emperor and Mo Rubin was also gradually getting closer.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to completely slide to the other side of the mirror, Li Ping suddenly took off his golden armor.</p><p></p><p>He coldly stared at Mo Rubin not far away: "Become me?"</p><p></p><p>"With just you?"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sacred Emperor of Heavenly Mandate."</p><p></p><p>Purple-gold aura of destiny appeared out of nowhere, like a dreamy gauze, instantly weaving into a dragon robe of auspicious clouds, automatically dressing Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Faceless Sacred Emperor, like thunder from the ninth heaven, reverberated on one end of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>The resounding echo caused the crack that divided the present world and the illusory world to ripple.</p><p></p><p>"I am also the Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"You want to become me?"</p><p></p><p>With each sentence the Sacred Emperor spoke, it was like a huge wave, launching a fierce attack on the mirror crack.</p><p></p><p>Creaking sounds of being unable to bear the weight were faintly heard, and cracks appeared in the world on the other side of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>As if it would be destroyed at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Can you bear it?!" Li Ping asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>A stone stirred up a thousand layers of waves.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Mo Rubin's expression truly changed, breaking away from the state of imitating the Faceless Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Behind Li Ping, he seemed to see a miniature image of the entire Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>And behind that Profound Yellow light, there seemed to be an even more dazzling starry river hidden!</p><p></p><p>In a flash of thought, the world turned upside down.</p><p></p><p>The weight of the world pressed down on him.</p><p></p><p>Ding!</p><p></p><p>The crack mirror shattered, and as if triggering a chain reaction, the countless mirrors that sealed the space around instantly exploded into thousands of pieces.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, but his reaction was not slow.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the disturbance caused by the shattering of the mirrors, his figure became illusory and instantly appeared a thousand miles away.</p><p></p><p>"Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's face was full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>His expression suddenly changed again: "The damn Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao is indeed unreliable. I have to hurry."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was talking to himself, a tall figure quietly blocked his way in front.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't answered my question yet, and you want to leave?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of wariness flashed in Mo Rubin's eyes, and he snorted coldly: "What Heavenly Mandate Sacred Emperor, what incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, nothing but a pawn!"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to die, why don't we cooperate? How about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Although you are strong, you are still a bit inferior compared to Brother Xuanyuan. Even he was ambushed and met with mishap, you certainly can't avoid it either..."</p><p></p><p>But after Mo Rubin finished these few sentences, Li Ping's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>He reached out to grab the Mo Rubin in front of him, but that figure burst like a bubble and scattered in the air.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly just an illusion. The real Mo Rubin had somehow escaped to somewhere unknown under Li Ping's nose.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor was not angry at being played.</p><p></p><p>"The true immortal formula is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"[Indestructible Demonic Heart Immortal Formula]..."</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Ping looked at the sleeping cat treasure on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Just now, in the brief battle with Mo Rubin, the other party did not seem to notice the existence of the cat treasure.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that killing move that could replicate and replace did not reflect the existence of the cat treasure either.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't arouse the interest of the cat treasure. It seems that this so-called immortal formula is also somewhat undeserving of its name."</p><p></p><p>Although Mo Rubin had escaped for now, he had not actually escaped Li Ping's control.</p><p></p><p>When Mo Rubin tried to replace Li Ping, Li Ping was also slowly pulling him into the web of the essence of the source power.</p><p></p><p>Even if he broke free for a while, as long as he followed the golden web that was broken but still lingering in the air, he could trace his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, Mo Rubin was still fleeing quickly.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not in a hurry to catch up, but was preparing to play the long game and catch the big fish.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to tell whether what he said just now is true or false. But one thing is certain, he will definitely go to find the Profound Heavenly King."</p><p></p><p>"Or something related to the Profound Heavenly Sect back then."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that to deal with an existence like Mo Rubin, who had survived since ancient times, one must have sufficient patience.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the battle with Mo Rubin just now also gave the Sacred Emperor a substantial understanding of the bizarre techniques of the Profound Heavenly Sect.</p><p></p><p>With some preparation, the next time they meet, he won't let him escape so easily.</p><p></p><p>The fluctuations of the battle just now seemed to have attracted the attention of other powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the people from the Myriad Immortal Alliance would come to investigate soon. Li Ping was ready to leave this place first.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records on the stone tablet, after the ten immortal sects destroyed the Profound Heavenly Sect back then, in order to eliminate future troubles, they almost turned the world upside down. All sects, big and small, did the same. This Purple Dawn Sect was carefully investigated back then, but he still managed to escape."</p><p></p><p>"As for how powerful the techniques of the Profound Heavenly Sect are, let's put that aside for now. But they are quite bizarre and difficult to guard against..."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the orthodox immortal way."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping commented in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense swept over the ruins of the Purple Dawn Sect a thousand miles away, and the figure of the Faceless Sacred Emperor slowly disappeared into the air.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Li Ping appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Because just as he was pondering for a moment, Li Ping discovered some oddities.</p><p></p><p>The perspective suddenly rose, and a miniature panoramic view of the Profound Yellow Realm appeared before Li Ping's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This place is the Linlang State of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. A thousand years ago, it was part of the original Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Yellow Realm was dismembered and transformed, and this Linlang State was formed by merging with other immortal realms."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping gradually became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"A piece of the original Profound Yellow Realm's puzzle is missing."</p><p></p><p>Having grasped the information from the Creation Stone Tablet and being closely connected with the Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao, Li Ping vaguely realized that a large area of the former Purple Dawn Sect had disappeared from the new map of the Profound Yellow Realm during the process of restoring the dismemberment and reorganization of the original Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>It still existed in some corner of the current Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>"But some kind of power has influenced me, causing me to subconsciously ignore its existence."</p><p></p><p>After reaching this conclusion, the aura around Li Ping suddenly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the maps of the original Profound Yellow Realm and the current Profound Yellow Realm were constantly being separated, reorganized, and compared.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally found the other area of the former Purple Dawn Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was the Taihua State and the Taixu Mountain area in the present day.</p><p></p><p>"What's there..."</p><p></p><p>Past events flashed through his mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor had a vague realization.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping hesitated, which was very rare for him.</p><p></p><p>After standing still in the air for a long time, he finally made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what kind of truth it is, if one doesn't have the courage to face it..."</p><p></p><p>"Then how can one save the Profound Yellow Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor shook his head slightly, and his figure flashed.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he had already arrived at Taixu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, the secret he discovered here deviated somewhat from his expectations.</p><p></p><p>In the deep valley below Taixu Mountain, Li Ping discovered an underground chamber buried by silt.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from the chamber made him, the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more concerned was that the cat treasure, which had been sleeping on his shoulder, suddenly woke up and looked around.</p><p></p><p>As if it had found some delicious food, Li Ping could feel extremely excited emotions from it.</p><p></p><p>But after locking onto the target, the cat treasure suddenly deflated like a balloon, losing all its energy.</p><p></p><p>It lazily fell into slumber again.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping's attention never left the target.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..."</p><p></p><p>A statue.</p><p></p><p>Just like him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>..., faceless.</p><p></p><p>Although it appeared ordinary, without any spiritual energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping felt an unprecedented pressure from the stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing the remnant catastrophes in the Darkest Star Sea before, he had not felt this way.</p><p></p><p>ɯoɔ˙xnɥs69 Bar Book 69 New</p><p></p><p>Li Ping slowly approached it step by step. </p><p></p><p>Two faceless visages faced each other across the void.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a surge of impulse suddenly welled up in Li Ping's heart.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to communicate with this statue.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's breath slightly stagnated.</p><p></p><p>The images that could originally be sensed from the Holy Emperor's avatar had already become extremely blurry.</p><p></p><p>But after the Holy Emperor inadvertently discovered the faceless True Immortal's stone statue buried under Mount Taixu again,</p><p></p><p>Affected by the instinctive sensing of a fatal crisis, this connection became clear once more.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes and concentrated, trying to reverse the avatar's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Although he could escape the True Immortal's net once, and could escape a second time,</p><p></p><p>But to thoroughly break free after reincarnating through many lifetimes was ultimately a troublesome matter. It was best to avoid it if possible.</p><p></p><p>However, the Holy Emperor's will was unexpectedly resolute.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he sensed something in the similarly faceless visage.</p><p></p><p>He still slowly walked towards the faceless True Immortal stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Standing still in front of the stone statue, motionless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even though the Holy Emperor was his avatar, Li Fan couldn't figure out what the Holy Emperor was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"So, this is the Xuantian Immortal."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Ping discovered the origin of this statue from the records on the Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>The faceless True Immortal worshipped by the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping touched his own faceless visage, his aura constantly fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping couldn't determine whether there was really a connection between himself and this faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Very cautiously, he chose not to touch it himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping used the most ordinary Holy Soldier puppet to move this stone statue to the dark void outside the Great Enlightenment Small World.</p><p></p><p>Laying down layers of formations to seal the statue.</p><p></p><p>Until the sense of crisis in his heart slowly faded did he stop.</p><p></p><p>The reason he was so cautious was because after contacting the stone statue during this period, he had confirmed a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>And the source of this familiarity was not only because the statue was strangely faceless like himself.</p><p></p><p>More so, it came from an image.</p><p></p><p>The scene he sensed from that vast consciousness at the origin of the star sea when he was in the center of the Darkest Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>"What does it have to do with me! What does it have to do with me!"</p><p></p><p>The figure that gradually disappeared in that wanton laughter.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely similar to the feeling of this statue and him.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the same person? Or not?"</p><p></p><p>With just a fleeting glimpse of the flashing image, Li Ping couldn't confirm it at all.</p><p></p><p>"If I have the chance to go to the center of the star sea again."</p><p></p><p>"If that grand consciousness of the star sea personally identifies it, it should be clear then."</p><p></p><p>Such a thought flashed through Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can try again. But the reserves of Void Clarity Crystals have been almost depleted in the previous operation. And..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked again at the faceless stone statue sealed by layers of formations in the void.</p><p></p><p>Although it had no eyes, it seemed to be staring at him.</p><p></p><p>"If the primordial culprit back then was really this faceless True Immortal, implicated by the enraged consciousness of the star sea, I'm afraid even if the puppet body goes there, the main body here will also be affected."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the entire Darkest Star Sea, the Xuanhuang World is truly like a drop in the ocean..."</p><p></p><p>The image of the Xuanhuang World being torn apart by raging energy in an instant flashed before Li Ping's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He suppressed the previous thought.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, the Holy Emperor's figure disappeared. When he reappeared, he placed another object beside the faceless True Immortal stone statue.</p><p></p><p>The ruins were just ordinary, but the remains of the Great Wizard inside, as well as the hidden Erosion Wind Disaster, made even the Holy Emperor treat it with caution.</p><p></p><p>A Primordial Sect relic and the faceless True Immortal stone statue faced each other from afar in the void.</p><p></p><p>A premonition flashed in Li Ping's heart.</p><p></p><p>If there were no formation seals blocking them...</p><p></p><p>A terrifying catastrophe would likely erupt on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>The arrogant laughter of "What does it have to do with me" seemed to echo in Li Ping's ears.</p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly in his heart and struck out thousands of formations with his hands.</p><p></p><p>Reinforcing the prisons of the two.</p><p></p><p>These unstable factors buried in the Xuanhuang World, he wouldn't feel at ease placing them anywhere else. Only by personally guarding them would it be the most secure.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Ping continued to diligently reinforce the formation seals.</p><p></p><p>And on his shoulder, Cat Treasure had awakened at some point.</p><p></p><p>Its clear eyes stared at the void ahead. It brought its paw to its mouth and licked it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Li Fan's main body side, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>As the faceless True Immortal stone statue was sealed, his connection with the avatar became blurry again.</p><p></p><p>It was even weaker than before.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Holy Emperor avatar more vigilant?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head inwardly, not particularly concerned.</p><p></p><p>"However, this matter also reminded me."</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm hiding here, quietly observing the upheaval of the Xuanhuang World, the Holy Emperor, as the protagonist of this life, will inevitably have to confront those transcendent existences."</p><p></p><p>"He may find me by following the connection between the avatar and the main body, just like the previous True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I still need to prepare."</p><p></p><p>But being in the important place of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, his actions were not very free, and he needed to plan for the long term.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he once again took over and appeared inside the character light sphere.</p><p></p><p>"Seriously, I called you for so long before you responded." Yanfa Jue pouted, looking very displeased.</p><p></p><p>"You've slept enough already?" Li Fan asked in surprise, not directly responding.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue put her hands on her hips, "How is this enough for such a short time!"</p><p></p><p>"But while I was dreaming, I remembered some things from before."</p><p></p><p>"See if it's helpful to you!"</p><p></p><p>The little loli clapped her hands, and the scene inside the light sphere suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>On a seemingly endless grassland, a lone rock stood independently.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Large swaths of green grass, as if stimulated by something, began to grow wildly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they grew taller than a person.</p><p></p><p>Even lifting that lone rock on the grassland up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>A arc of light flashed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>The arc was seven-colored, and one could vaguely see images of lightning and thunder, storms converging within it.</p><p></p><p>Around the seven-colored arc, space occasionally showed bizarre distortions. As if there was an invisible transparent object appearing there.</p><p></p><p>More and more invisible things gathered, all surrounding the arc of light, seemingly waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>The wind and thunder became more violent, and the rolling dark clouds even had the tendency to penetrate the arc of light.</p><p></p><p>Although the storm already looked quite terrifying from outside the arc, its true horror was only revealed when it spread beyond the arc.</p><p></p><p>A pitch-black lightning bolt fiercely struck the ground from the arc.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The world was split in two, deep cracks were cut into space, taking a long time to heal. And on the grassland, the endless green grass was set ablaze. The raging fire spread rapidly.</p><p></p><p>But then, an even more bizarre scene appeared.</p><p></p><p>The falling ashes turned into nutrients nourishing the green leaves. The green grass grew wildly again, and the speed of growth actually offset the speed of being burned.</p><p></p><p>The grassland trembled, and under the raging flames, it seemed that something was awakening.</p><p></p><p>They just gathered even more towards the inside of the arc of light.</p><p></p><p>There were even disputes over fighting for positions.</p><p></p><p>Huge rumbling and colliding sounds kept ringing out.</p><p></p><p>The storm brewed to its peak and suddenly came to a standstill. The rolling dark clouds disappeared without a trace in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Inside the seven-colored arc of light, under the clear sky.</p><p></p><p>A extremely profound character suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>The moment the character appeared, it was as if the highest mystical sound of the Great Dao resounded between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Colorful auspicious clouds kept coming from the horizon, converging towards the character.</p><p></p><p>Drizzling raindrops fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The rainwater, like the auspicious clouds in the sky, was a moving seven-colored hue.</p><p></p><p>The cracks between heaven and earth were repaired.</p><p></p><p>The flames on the grassland were also extinguished as the raindrops fell.</p><p></p><p>The endless green grass greedily absorbed the heavenly sweet dew. But their bodies kept shrinking.</p><p></p><p>Seven-colored light shone, and figures of various shapes were nurtured within it.</p><p></p><p>But the rumbling sounds of fighting in the high heavens seemed to become even louder.</p><p></p><p>However, Yanfa Jue's memory was already nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding images gradually became blurry, and one could only see that lone rock on the grassland being dissolved by the rainwater.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The images faded, and Li Fan returned to Yanfa Jue's character light sphere.</p><p></p><p>But he was immersed in the scenes just now, unable to pull himself out.</p><p></p><p>"How was it? Any clues?" Yanfa Jue asked full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After savoring the scenes for a long time, Li Fan finally asked, "Those raindrops, could they be the Immortal Sound Jade Dew you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue raised her head and put her hands on her hips, saying righteously, "It should be that. Ever since I was born, I had this memory in my mind. But as I slowly grew up, I forgot about it."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I had a good sleep earlier, otherwise who knows when I would have remembered it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted Yanfa Jue's reverie.</p><p></p><p>"What about the character in the seven-colored arc of light?"</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I see it clearly at all?"</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue pouted, "I told you it's something from a dream. It's already very difficult for me to recall this much, how could I remember the character clearly?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at Yanfa Jue, trying to discern the truth in her words.</p><p></p><p>"You actually don't believe me?" Yanfa Jue said, extremely aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "You're not stupid. I don't believe you wouldn't have realized that the scenes you just showed are very likely the legendary Immortal Realm scenery."</p><p></p><p>"A character that even Immortals fight over..."</p><p></p><p>"It's understandable that you would conceal it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yanfa Jue became even more aggrieved, "I really can't remember. You also know it's an Immortal character, how could it be so easily remembered. Moreover, I was so young back then..."</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue gestured, her eyes brimming with tears.</p><p></p><p>"How can you recall it?" Li Fan didn't believe the little loli's nonsense and directly stated his condition.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue's tears immediately stopped.</p><p></p><p>Her big eyes turned, as if thinking.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, she said softly, "Well, maybe if I eat more, I can remember some."</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue licked her lips, staring at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Eat?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lowered his head, "You can also eat things?"</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue said angrily, "What kind of words are these.

        <h1>Chapter 706</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A piece of paper as thin as a cicada's wing, emitting a warm white light, slowly flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Spirit Flower!" exclaimed a cultivator in the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Some were shocked by the beauty of the Heavenly Spirit Flower, standing up on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, even though the Heavenly Spirit Flower was clearly sealed within a plane, onlookers couldn't detect anything unusual while admiring it.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a real flower was blooming slowly in front of them, incredibly beautiful. They could even smell the faint fragrance emanating from the flower.</p><p></p><p>As everyone in the field fell silent in awe of the beauty of the Heavenly Spirit Flower, Jiao Xiuyuan smirked with pride and lightly flicked the transparent paper in the air.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, numerous beams of light shot out from it, projecting the palm-sized flowers high above the venue.</p><p></p><p>Enlarged thousands of times in proportion, the flowers' splendor was not diminished. Instead, every detail on each petal became vivid and clearer.</p><p></p><p>When all the cultivators' minds were captivated, Jiao Xiuyuan discreetly crushed a bead while no one was paying attention.</p><p></p><p>A faint white mist emitted from it, exuding a mysterious and profound aura, slowly enveloping the venue.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a puppet body, Jiao Xiuyuan had set up his defenses without a sound to block the white mist from reaching him.</p><p></p><p>He remembered the instructions given to him by a core Daoist named Liu San, who had handed him this item.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this is an elixir I meticulously developed to assist cultivators in their practice. Once absorbed by vaporizing it, it can produce an illusory enlightenment effect..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan looked at the faces of the cultivators in the field, who were all mesmerized by the beauty of the Heavenly Spirit Flower. He muttered to himself, "Although he pledged that this item has been improved and is definitely non-addictive..."</p><p></p><p>"But in any case, it's best to stay away from this damned thing."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Spirit Flower blossomed to its heart's content. The extraordinary scenes on the petals reflected on the faces of every cultivator in the Flower Hall.</p><p></p><p>Each viewing session lasted only three hours. Once missed, it wouldn't happen again, so almost everyone's eyes were glued to the projection of the Heavenly Spirit Flower in the air.</p><p></p><p>Except for one person who was staring blankly at the frozen paper-thin ice, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"No mistake, Ice Drop Dew, Like the Camera, Thousand Color Grace..."</p><p></p><p>"This technique of encapsulating flowers in my 'Flower Collection' is so similar, but I have never revealed this to anyone else."</p><p></p><p>"What on earth..." Zhao Chong's eyes were filled with an incredulous expression. "Could there be another person in the world who coincidentally thinks like me?"</p><p></p><p>Having seen the Heavenly Spirit Flower once, Zhao Chong's long-cherished wish had vanished. He didn't care much about breakthroughs in cultivation or sudden enlightenment of mystical powers. Instead, he gradually became more interested in the owner of the Heavenly Spirit Flower who never appeared.</p><p></p><p>Time slipped away as everyone captivated their minds.</p><p></p><p>As the deadline of the three-hour viewing approached, there were no signs of breakthroughs or sudden enlightenments from anyone.</p><p></p><p>"This is the premiere; we can't mess it up."</p><p></p><p>Just as Jiao Xiuyuan was about to activate his pre-arranged plan, a wave of fluctuations suddenly arrived, causing him to stop in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"It's this kid, that's good, saves me from having to promote it more!" Delighted upon recognizing the identity of the breakthrough cultivator, Jiao Xiuyuan's heart was filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>He swiftly approached the person, blocking the fluctuations to avoid disturbing others from appreciating and understanding.</p><p></p><p>The first breakthrough cultivator was Sun Qi.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the stunning view of the Heavenly Spirit Flower above his head, it was as if he was suddenly back on a bloody battlefield. But unlike facing the present, where the air was filled with a bloody aura surrounding the Heavenly Spirit Flower, he not only harbored no thoughts of killing.</p><p></p><p>Instead, all the beautiful sceneries he saw were like gentle water, healing and soothing the psychological wounds he had suffered in battles.</p><p></p><p>As if time had reversed, the blood, corpses, and cracked earth disappeared. His perspective soared over the Heavenly Spirit City, back to the era before the great war.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi gazed at everything before him in a trance.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he forgot the thick love and disappointment of his senior family members, forgot the mockery and ridicule of his peers, forgot the desire to break through he had been clinging to.</p><p></p><p>His mind was filled with the beauty of the Heavenly Spirit on earth.</p><p></p><p>The hostility disappeared, and everything fell into place.</p><p></p><p>When he regained consciousness from this daze, he found that the bottleneck that had troubled him for years, the "Heaven's Calamity," had silently disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Finding a suitable hidden spot, absorbing it, and ingesting it would allow him to advance to the Nascent Infant stage. For the Sun family, this was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Had this happened before, he might have been emotionally stirred and moved to tears at such a breakthrough. But at this moment, he felt neither joy nor sadness. He didn't leave the Flower Hall immediately but sat quietly, ignoring the occasional glances from others, and continued to focus on the Heavenly Spirit Flower above him.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the host, Jiao Xiuyuan, collected the flower into a wooden box and announced the end of the exhibition that he came back to himself.</p><p></p><p>Excited voices, regretful sighs, and admiring praises echoed one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, name a price! How much is this 'Heavenly Spirit Flower' worth after all!"</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed its marvels, some cultivators in the venue couldn't help but ask eagerly.</p><p></p><p>This caused a stir among many people.</p><p></p><p>Facing the queries, Jiao Xiuyuan smiled, saying, "I've told you many times, the owner of the flower is very clear in his stance: not for sale, not for sale, definitely not for sale!"</p><p></p><p>"Although I also want to make such a deal, but with others insisting like this, I can't do anything about it!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd below became agitated upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Before Jiao Xiuyuan could respond, someone in the field immediately sneered, "Oh, isn't this Zhu Yuhua from Tianzhu Prefecture? I heard you're quite extravagant, yet you're only offering a mere ten million contribution points? Look down on someone?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, with such a meager amount, are you planning to buy the 'Heavenly Spirit Flower'? I think those imitations suit you better!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Yuhua's face changed slightly, looking at the several people who were mocking him. Ten million contribution points were indeed not a significant amount for them.</p><p></p><p>He refrained from continuing his words and resumed a poker face. Zhu Yuhua was about to raise his bid.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiao Xiuyuan took the initiative to step forward, acting as a peacemaker.</p><p></p><p>"Friends, friends..."</p><p></p><p>Raising his voice several degrees, he regained the attention of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"The owner of the Heavenly Spirit Flower is an extremely elegant person. His appearance and demeanor are unparalleled in my lifetime. It is the only one of its kind in the world, and of course, he is unwilling to part with it."</p><p></p><p>"However..." Jiao Xiuyuan's tone shifted.</p><p></p><p>"He also understands that if this rarity is only held high and only appreciated by a few, it would be disrespectful to the flower. After my persuasion, a compromise plan was chosen."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan paused for a moment, then announced, "Although it's not for sale, this 'Heavenly Spirit Flower' can be rented out to the public!"</p><p></p><p>"If any Daoist friend is interested, you can stay and listen to my details."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Only for rent, not for sale. This owner of the Heavenly Spirit Flower does know how to do business." Sun Qi smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the crowd of cultivators flocking towards Jiao Xiuyuan, Sun Qi knew he didn't have the capacity to rent the Heavenly Spirit Flower. Shaking his head, he quietly left the Flower Hall.</p><p></p><p>The first person he visited after leaving was his uncle, Sun Liancheng. After all, the main reason he had the breakthrough this time was due to the 'Flower Dedication' given by Sun Liancheng.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a short while in his uncle's cave, Sun Liancheng hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Good... good..." Sun Liancheng scanned him up and down, even more excited than Sun Qi's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"The pride of the Sun family, after many years, you have finally returned." Sun Liancheng repeatedly expressed his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi lightly chuckled, "Pride..."</p><p></p><p>"Born to build the foundation, full moon golden pill. Indeed, back then, I lived up to the name of pride. But now, I am two hundred and thirteen years old..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi shook his head slightly, "What pride is there in this? Uncle, please don't call me that anymore. Many of our ancestors didn't even reach the golden pill stage and died of old age. But now..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi's expression didn't change: "The next bottleneck in the 'Reverse Evolution Record' is in the later stages of Nascent Soul, right?" Sun Liancheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured that the resources needed, like hidden caves and celestial marrow, will all be prepared for you within the clan. You just need to focus on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Sun Liancheng said with satisfaction, "The future is promising!"</p><p></p><p>There was no reaction on Sun Qi's face, neither joy nor sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"The next bottleneck in the 'Reverse Evolution Record' is in the later stages of Nascent Soul, right?" Sun Liancheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured that the resources needed, like hidden caves and celestial marrow, will all be prepared for you within the clan. You just need to focus on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Sun Liancheng said with satisfaction, "The future is promising!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi's face showed no emotion.</p><p></p><p>"The next bottleneck in the 'Reverse Evolution Record' is in the later stages of Nascent Soul, right?" Sun Liancheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured that the resources needed, like hidden caves and celestial marrow, will all be prepared for you within the clan. You just need to focus on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Sun Liancheng spoke in a subdued tone, "Qir, the burden of the entire clan rests solely on your shoulders. Therefore, the lack of progress in your cultivation, the inability to confide in others, you must bear it silently. Do you feel wronged or unwilling?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi face did not change, "It is my mission. Countless ancestors have silently sacrificed like me, and it is because of their efforts that our Sun family is strong today. How can I harbor any grievances?"</p>

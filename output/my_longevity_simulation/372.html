        <h1>Chapter 372</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"When I first heard about your deeds, I thought you had been possessed."</p><p></p><p>"Well, you don't seem to have anything to do with the words 'self-sacrifice and selflessness'."</p><p></p><p>"However, your actions have been witnessed by many, and there is no room for fabrication. I have been puzzled for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"Today, with your words, you have dispelled my doubts."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song looked at Li Fan and nodded slightly, "You, young man, are ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained calm, "Senior's praise is exaggerated! I wonder how this compensation will be handled?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song patted his stomach and chuckled, "You just want to know from me where to go next for the competition to be most effective. Why bother with all these twists and turns?"</p><p></p><p>With that, he pointed in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the construction status of the Tianxuan Locking Spiritual Array, which covered most of the current Wan Xian Alliance territories, and the list of corresponding array masters' information, all intricately detailed and exhaustive, entered Li Fan's sight.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it mark the points ranking of each array master on the current grand competition leaderboard, it even predictively assessed the abilities of each participant to strive for higher rankings.</p><p></p><p>Proudly, Huangfu Song said, "This is the top-secret list that was circulated yesterday. Although a day has passed and points will change, it can still be used as a reference."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary people would have to pay a price to see it. 𝓽𝓸-𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓮𝓽𝔂𝓱𝓸𝓷𝓽.𝒸𝓸𝓶"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly glanced over the contents of the list.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's expression, Huangfu Song was somewhat surprised, "What's wrong, Li young man, aren't you satisfied with this?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Huangfu, it seems that some places are missing from this list?" Li Fan's gaze was sharp as he inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Missing? That's impossible! I..."</p><p></p><p>Before Huangfu Song could finish his retort, Li Fan interrupted directly, "What about the Wuxing Grand Cave? What about the Endless Sea? I didn't see them on the list."</p><p></p><p>"The Xingshu Yuan, the Jieshi Tian..."</p><p></p><p>"Although I am ignorant, I have heard of these regions."</p><p></p><p>To divert attention from his true intentions, Li Fan mentioned many secret and important places that he had only read about in confidential documents, without actually visiting.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, bringing them up was just right for his purpose.</p><p></p><p>"You know quite a lot. 𝓽𝓸-𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓮𝓽𝔂𝓱𝓸𝓷𝓽" Li Fan's deception was unraveled, and Huangfu Song's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, Huangfu Song said solemnly, "Let's get straight to the point. The construction of formations in these areas is several times more contributive than in ordinary regions."</p><p></p><p>"But there are specialized individuals responsible for building the relevant formations. You, a junior, without connections or background, wanting to sneak in and earn points..."</p><p></p><p>"You are really thinking too much." Huangfu Song shook his head repeatedly. "Look at all the people on the grand competition leaderboard, who among them can do that?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't they stronger than you?"</p><p></p><p>Despite Huangfu Song's denial, Li Fan didn't lose heart for a moment. Instead, he seized the key point.</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, he asked, "Does it mean that as long as one has connections and a background, it is not impossible to participate in the construction of formations in those areas?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song was left speechless by Li Fan's unique logic.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to tease, he saw Li Fan deep in thought and felt a sudden shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"You, could there be some background behind you?" Huangfu Song asked in suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't directly answer but just smiled faintly, "Just trying my best. Perhaps I may need Senior Huangfu's mediation in the future for this matter."</p><p></p><p>This ambiguous statement left Huangfu Song somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"If there is a chance, I will contact Senior again later. I hope Senior can assist me then." Li Fan said politely as he prepared to leave the room.</p><p></p><p>Watching Li Fan's figure leave, Huangfu Song's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, he couldn't help but ask, "About Dantai Tao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't stop his steps and had already disappeared from Huangfu Song's line of sight in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He left behind faint words echoing in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Just a joke from a junior. If Senior is not pleased, then I won't mention it again in the future after the several times Senior has helped me."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song stared at the direction where Li Fan disappeared, his expression inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan returned to his residence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not sure whether the deaths of Dantai Tao and others were really related to Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan jokingly mentioned Dantai Tao in the beginning and saw Huangfu Song's somewhat exaggerated reaction, he sensed something out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>He even vaguely felt a murderous intent directed towards him.</p><p></p><p>Although almost imperceptible, Li Fan, who mastered the "Indiscriminate Killing Intent," was extremely sensitive to such intentions.</p><p></p><p>It could be basically confirmed that Huangfu Song did have a thought of killing Li Fan in that instant.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan quite curious.</p><p></p><p>Hence, following that, Li Fan continuously tested Huangfu Song's limits by bringing up the deaths of Dantai Tao.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that every time Li Fan mentioned Dantai Tao, Huangfu Song became somewhat easier to talk to.</p><p></p><p>It even affected his attitude towards Li Fan, which was different from other disciples.</p><p></p><p>Until today, Huangfu Song's question.</p><p></p><p>It confirmed that the deaths of Dantai Tao and the other disciples were indeed somewhat related.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of direct involvement was slim; otherwise, they would have been dealt with long ago.</p><p></p><p>But there was a possibility that he had revealed information about Dantai Tao and others in the past.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why Huangfu Song was sensitive to the three words "Dantai Tao."</p><p></p><p>Because he couldn't withstand serious investigation.</p><p></p><p>Although time had passed and the names of Dantai Tao and others had been almost forgotten by most people.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan always brought them up in front of Huangfu Song at intervals.</p><p></p><p>It indeed made him somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally understood the principle of moderation.</p><p></p><p>Since Huangfu Song had made his position clear today, it wouldn't be possible to pretend to be ignorant in the future as before.</p><p></p><p>The message conveyed was clear - as long as you help me one last time, I will never bring up this matter again from now on.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already obtained plenty of information from Huangfu Song, and pushing him too much would not be wise.</p><p></p><p>With this declaration, Li Fan had no regrets.</p>

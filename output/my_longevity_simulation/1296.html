        <h1>Chapter 1296</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, does the Eternal Immortal Wall really exist in the Myriad Immortal Alliance? It sounds too horrifying to be true..." After a long while, Sun Tianci still asked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"The brutal acts of the Myriad Immortal Alliance go far beyond just this." Li Fan sneered coldly. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan first learned about the Eternal Immortal Wall in the 114th world, when the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit and Profound Net enveloped the Profound Yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought it was a unique product of the Immortal Alliance in that world.</p><p></p><p>But later, in the 119th world, he impersonated the Dharma King Sun Xingwang of the Profound Heaven Sect. Using the Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Illuminated God Technique, he refined countless conceptual demon gods within the bodies of tens of thousands of cultivators. And the final method the Myriad Immortal Alliance used to deal with these cultivators was similar to the [Eternal Immortal Wall]. From the information revealed by Mo Rubin after possessing the Dharma Transmitter, it was confirmed that the Myriad Immortal Alliance indeed secretly sealed away many cultivators to maintain and ensure the stability of the Profound Yellow realm. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was not limited to just one location.</p><p></p><p>Transmitting a blurry scene to Sun Tianci, this outstanding son of the Sun family was instantly shocked by the cruel sight.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Before long, he awoke from the shock and asked resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Your speed in utilizing the [Profound Underworld Art] is still too slow. Even if we successfully infiltrate the Immortal Wall, we won't have much time to act."</p><p></p><p>"First, become faster!"</p><p></p><p>The Profound Underworld Art was naturally the profound and marvelous technique passed down by Li Fan to dissolve a cultivator's cultivation and return it to the Profound Yellow world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense flew out from Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness and manifested a illusory form.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, Li Fan's clone slowly murmured, "Distorting the principles of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>As he softly chanted, a scene that made Sun Tianci's scalp tingle occurred.</p><p></p><p>An invisible vortex instantly appeared above Li Fan's head.</p><p></p><p>The very familiar aura from the spirit of heaven and earth seemed to be brewing within the vortex.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blurry human figure gradually extending its arms from within, Sun Tianci became more certain of his guess.</p><p></p><p>"Summoning the spirit of heaven and earth with a single word? Just what is Master's true identity..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Tianci was somewhat stunned by the scene before him, Li Fan's reprimanding voice rang in his ears, "What are you still dazed for? Do you really want to wait for the spirit of heaven and earth to descend?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci instantly came to his senses. He immediately fired a Profound Underworld Art at the blurry human figure that was about to be born within the vortex.</p><p></p><p>As if the process of descent was blocked, a gust of wind blew by, and the spirit of heaven and earth that Li Fan had summoned returned to the space between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>During this process, Sun Tianci did not feel any deepening of his connection with the Profound Yellow world. It was obviously because that spirit of heaven and earth still belonged to the Profound Yellow world and had not been seized and refined by a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And because the "erroneous descent of the spirit of heaven and earth" was terminated just before it was completed, the alertness from the Profound Yellow world was also minuscule.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes to sense it and once again unleashed the Distorting Heaven and Earth Principles.</p><p></p><p>This time, Sun Tianci reacted quickly. As soon as the blurry human figure was about to take shape, it was sent back again.</p><p></p><p>This repeated over a hundred times until it was about to arouse the notice of the Profound Yellow world, and only then did Li Fan stop.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci let out a sigh of relief and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a pale face.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, continuously utilizing the Profound Underworld Art to "decompose" over a hundred spirits of heaven and earth, even if they were only half-formed, was still a significant burden for him.</p><p></p><p>"Change location and continue." Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Sun Luyuan kept reminding him to prioritize safety above all else. He also bestowed many magic treasures to him for self-protection.</p><p></p><p>The special training took a total of fifteen days, with their footprints spanning the four corners of the Myriad Immortal Alliance's territory. Apart from traveling, almost all the remaining time was spent on dissolving the spirits of heaven and earth. And Sun Tianci's progress was also astonishing. </p><p></p><p>With a light touch, he could continuously return the distorted, half-born spirits of heaven and earth back to the world.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, that's about right." Li Fan looked at Sun Tianci's performance and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking about?" Seeing that Sun Tianci seemed to be lost in thought, Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Master, ten days ago, we came to this place before. The concentration of spiritual energy at that time seemed to be a bit lower than now?" Sun Tianci asked uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "The spiritual power in the world ebbs and flows like the tides, sometimes waning and sometimes waxing. Isn't that normal? How could it be like the cave abode you lived in since childhood, forever constant and unchanging."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's explanation, Sun Tianci nodded slightly. But in the depths of his eyes surveying the surroundings, a hint of doubt still flashed.</p><p></p><p>"This little fellow has quite a keen sense of observation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally also noticed the abnormality in the world. He even detected a familiar aura from the lingering spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Insects. It seems to be a technique of the Holy Emperor's clone. The source should come from the [Five Elements Grand Grotto Heaven]. Is it to return the grotto heaven to the Profound Yellow realm to create a suitable combat environment for the soldiers of the Great Awakening? Perhaps it can also launch a fatal blow by relying on the insect-transformed spiritual energy..."</p><p></p><p>The arrangements of the Holy Emperor's clone almost all originated from the explorations of the true body in the past few worlds. Naturally, with a little pondering, he saw through the profound mystery within.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan did not point it out and only pretended to be unaware.</p><p></p><p>Returning to Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, they headed towards one of the [Eternal Immortal Walls] in the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In a cave surrounded by mountains and cliffs in Tong Yan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"This place..." </p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci looked from afar and felt a sense of extraordinariness, "If it weren't for Master's guidance, even if I had seen the existence of this cave before, I would have subconsciously ignored it. I wouldn't have had the thought to enter and investigate at all..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this is the so-called blessed land that cannot be entered without affinity, as rumored. A strange creation of the Profound Yellow realm that can almost completely prevent the prying of most people without the need for formation concealment. The Myriad Immortal Alliance has hidden quite a few such concealed grotto heavens. Almost all of them have been divided up by those Dharma Transmitters and used as their own cave abodes." Scenes from the 119th world flashed before Li Fan's eyes, the concealed grotto heaven he encountered after infiltrating the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance and meeting Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same as this place.</p><p></p><p>"Because of the natural characteristics here, the stationed cultivators will certainly not have high vigilance. But we still need to be careful..." Li Fan's divine sense laid out a series of formations around Sun Tianci, and then the two of them flew into the cave together.</p><p></p><p>After passing through a narrow, downward passage, they arrived in front of a deep hole only as wide as a person's waist.</p><p></p><p>Pitch-black, straight down, and bottomless.</p><p></p><p>"Don't probe with divine sense. It will trigger a pre-warning."</p><p></p><p>But with a single glance, Li Fan saw through the mechanism of this pit.</p><p></p><p>It took the time to brew a pot of tea, as if penetrating through the Profound Yellow earth, reaching the bottomless depths of the Nine Underworlds.</p><p></p><p>The cramped cave vein gradually became more open.</p><p></p><p>Passing through a horizontal passage, a huge cave shaped like an inverted cone, located extremely deep underground, suddenly appeared before Sun Tianci.</p><p></p><p>The cliff walls of the cave were densely packed with square openings.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, the objects placed in these openings were all amber-colored crystals.</p><p></p><p>And without exception, a cultivator was sleeping inside each of these crystals.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, patrolling Immortal Alliance guards could be seen in mid-air. Sun Tianci didn't dare to spread out his divine sense to probe, but he roughly estimated that this underground cave imprisoned and sealed at least 100,000 cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were rosy and even had smiles on their faces. They were completely unaware that they were eternally falling into slumber.</p><p></p><p>"According to Master, this is only a part of the Myriad Immortal Alliance's [Eternal Immortal Wall]..." A chill rose in Sun Tianci's heart, and he subconsciously clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Go. The rest is up to you." Li Fan seemed to see the suppressed anger in Sun Tianci's heart and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he synchronized the method to break the formation sealing the cultivators here.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do you think will happen if we awaken all the cultivators here?" Sun Tianci suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"I advise you to abandon that thought. Since the Myriad Immortal Alliance dares to do this so blatantly, they must have taken precautions. Believe me, your speed of awakening them will definitely not keep up with the Myriad Immortal Alliance's speed of dealing with them. You should know that the Myriad Immortal Alliance possesses the means to extract and preserve a cultivator's Dao foundation..." Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci's eyes flickered, but in the end, he had no choice but to give up.</p><p></p><p>Avoiding the patrolling cultivators, he swiftly flew past these pitiful bugs in slumber. A barely noticeable breeze was stirred up, dissolving all the Dao foundations within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Without cultivation, they won't live long in their slumber... It's equivalent to me personally killing them..." Sun Tianci's flying figure trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Kill? Or save? Look at their current state. Isn't it a fate worse than death? If they could clearly perceive their surroundings, they would surely beg you to take action and help them find release." Li Fan spoke to console him.</p><p></p><p>After another round of persuasion, Sun Tianci's somewhat hesitant movements became resolute again.</p><p></p><p>For more than five years, Li Fan cultivated Sun Tianci according to his ideal image of the Profound Yellow Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Making him benevolent but not pedantic. And once he made a decision, he would become incomparably decisive.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Yellow world power formed by dissolving the Dao foundations of thousands of cultivators was gathered by Li Fan and condensed into a bright orb.</p><p></p><p>When one-fifth of the act of bestowing liberation was completed, Li Fan spoke, "That's about enough. If we continue, even I won't be able to conceal this intense energy fluctuation."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci looked at the remaining ones, vaguely showing a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>But he still followed his Master's orders and quietly flew towards the exit.</p><p></p><p>"No matter. Just leave." </p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Li Fan finally responded.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci didn't inquire further and rushed upward all the way. After leaving this horrifying dungeon, Sun Tianci took the orb containing the Dao foundations of many cultivators and lightly crushed it.</p><p></p><p>Countless rays of light instantly burst forth. In a daze, Sun Tianci seemed to see the wondrous sights of the world, the Profound Yellow grotto heavens, and the changing scenery of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the wind and clouds changed color. A creaking sound, as if a giant millstone was grinding, reverberated above the cloud layer.</p><p></p><p>And the entire Profound Yellow realm trembled in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Although the magnitude was minuscule, Sun Tianci still sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance should be sending people to investigate. Let's go!" Li Fan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Without needing a reminder, Sun Tianci had already flown away, distancing himself from the scene the moment he crushed the orb.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was immersed in the rapidly increasing Profound Yellow Celestial Favor.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, after ensuring no one was tracking them, he recalled the scene he had just witnessed in that great underground cave.</p><p></p><p>Several faces flashed before his eyes. Although he didn't know their names, Li Fan was certain that he had seen them before.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not in the Myriad Immortal Alliance, but in...</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>In the space of the Dharma Orb, within the sea of consciousness of his true body, the light of the Dao Stone flickered, bringing up the scenes he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>It was from the 119th world. After the Myriad Immortal Alliance used the Immortal Selectees to unleash the power contained in the Dharma Transmission Statues, restraining the five Eternal Life Venerates, they launched a fierce attack on the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council seemed to be forced into a desperate situation, but their hidden means were finally revealed.</p><p></p><p>Ancient sects that had already gone extinct reappeared in the world. There were also cultivators from the [Carefree Paradise] who fearlessly wielded various strange magic tools in a desperate counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan compared the few faces that had appeared in this war of subjugation with the slumbering cultivators he had just seen in the great underground cave.</p><p></p><p>They matched perfectly.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Li Fan towards the Five...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He gazed towards the location of the Land of Bliss.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in this Land of Bliss, there are not only cultivators from the Five Elders Society. I just don't know if the appearance of the Sleeping Cultivators in the Land of Bliss is due to a cooperation between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Society, or if it's a unilateral capture by the Carefree Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"If it's the latter, then the strength of this Celestial Venerable may be even greater than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>The image of the Carefree Celestial Venerable's baby form couldn't help but flash through Li Fan's mind. </p><p></p><p>He had transformed into a modern urban, neon-lit rainy night scene, and had even said that it was copied exactly as he had seen it while vacationing in the Land of Bliss.</p><p></p><p>"The possibility of cooperation between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Land of Bliss is not impossible either."</p><p></p><p>"The Land of Bliss does not necessarily fully represent the Five Elders Society. Only when the Five Elders Society falls into absolute crisis will they take action."</p><p></p><p>"The Land of Dreams..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly had a flash of doubt: "I wonder if these cultivators who die in the real world can still exist in the Land of Bliss. If the Primordial World is no more, can this Land of Bliss still exist?"</p><p></p><p>While his thoughts were surging, Sun Tianci had also completely absorbed the gains from this time. </p><p></p><p>With Li Fan as his excellent teacher strategizing, he could be said to be accumulating the Primordial World's favor the fastest.</p><p></p><p>Even compared to the progress of the Holy Emperor's avatar back then, it was much faster. </p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that perhaps it's because there is already a Destined Holy Emperor who can communicate with the Dao consciousness at any time.</p><p></p><p>Even though he clearly felt the closeness of the Primordial World, Sun Tianci still could not directly converse with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>He only felt the omnipresent "convenience".</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci immediately used his magic, and with the omnipresent blessing of the world, the power was indeed greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>But he was still very dejected in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, it's already enough to reach this point."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice rang in Sun Tianci's ears.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that this extremely mysterious master, who had never shown his true face in front of him, actually revealed his true appearance.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci couldn't help but be a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because he didn't expect that his master would be so good-looking.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in white, with a stunningly beautiful face that seemed to gather all the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, and eyes that flashed with compassion from time to time...</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Sun Tianci was somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>The master and disciple came to the depths underground.</p><p></p><p>After creating a secret room, Li Fan had Sun Tianci take out the four things that had been prepared for a long time.</p><p></p><p>A full ear of rice.</p><p></p><p>A small and exquisite house model.</p><p></p><p>A lifelike miniature donkey cart.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan placed the four objects in the four corners respectively, and then looked at Sun Tianci.</p><p></p><p>He said with a face full of kindness: "You can begin. Don't forget the stories I told you since the day you were born."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci seemed to have an epiphany and said in a deep voice, "Understood, Master. I will not let you down."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded with satisfaction, changed back to his previous blurry appearance, and exited the formation.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci took a deep breath and began his movements.</p><p></p><p>Taking the first step, facing the direction of the cart, he chanted in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"Blessing born from the Primordial Immortal."</p><p></p><p>The second step, turning to the house representing the dwelling of the people, he silently recited sincerely:</p><p></p><p>"Blessing born from the Primordial Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>The third step, looking at the full ear of rice, he held his breath and whispered:</p><p></p><p>"Blessing born from the Primordial Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The fourth step, gazing at the hemp robe, he finally silently recited: "Blessing born from the Primordial Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>It was the reverse of the ceremony for people to enter the normal Fallen Immortal Realm, entering the special illusion realm of succeeding the Primordial Great Celestial Venerable!</p><p></p><p>The moment the ceremony was completed, the consciousness from the high heavens descended and locked onto Sun Tianci.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tianci closed his eyes slightly and sat in the center of the four ceremonial objects, seeming to fall into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The four objects representing clothing, food, housing, and transportation flashed with light and shadow, as if falling into the crevice between illusion and reality.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"No matter how many times I see the Fallen Immortal's Remnant Thoughts, I still find it so incredible."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Just now, in the short time when he changed into the appearance of Mr. White and confused Sun Tianci, even though he was under the concealment of layers of formations underground, he still sensed the Primordial World seemingly responding and stirring.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was no longer a greenhorn. Before the Primordial Dao could find him, he had already changed back. Otherwise, he might have to stage another "The Truth Doesn't Want To" play.</p><p></p><p>"It must be the effect of the [Primordial Great Celestial Venerable]..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if this kid has the luck."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at Sun Tianci, who had his eyes closed, and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The time flow in the Fallen Immortal Realm trial of the Primordial Great Celestial Venerable was almost consistent with reality.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he knew all the correct answers and quickly cleared it with all the optimal solutions, it still took him almost half a year.</p><p></p><p>As for Sun Tianci, Li Fan did not directly tell him the correct solution.</p><p></p><p>It was to avoid the possible "anti-cheating" mechanism in the trial.</p><p></p><p>He only implanted the solution into Sun Tianci's subconscious through the suggestive method of telling stories since childhood.</p><p></p><p>With Sun Tianci's talent, it shouldn't be difficult to successfully break through the illusion trial, even if it takes some twists and turns.</p><p></p><p>"It should be just in time for the beginning of the great war between the Holy Dynasty and the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>As for whether there will be a problem of Sun Tianci losing control...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the remnant soul of Sun Tianci's birth mother, wrapped in the core of his avatar.</p><p></p><p>After a period of conditioning, the resentment on the surface had completely disappeared. She had a completely kind mother's appearance.</p><p></p><p>"It is said to be born in accordance with the Dao, but in fact, it devours the life of the birth mother. This is his biggest flaw!"</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time, let me see what kind of might the current Primordial Great Celestial Venerable will have."</p><p></p><p>Under the flickering light of the trial ceremony, Li Fan's divine sense appeared and disappeared, like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty's great beginning.</p><p></p><p>Ling Prefecture, Dujiang County, Xixi Village.</p><p></p><p>The solemn atmosphere of the impending great war had already drifted to this peaceful village.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the able-bodied men in the village had already joined the Holy Army and were ready to set off for the conquest at any time.</p><p></p><p>Only the elderly, weak, women and children of each family were left to maintain their livelihoods while going to the [Sacred Heart Temple] every day to pray for their family members and the great Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>A woman in her forties had just returned from the Sacred Heart Temple, but saw a young man standing at the door of her house.</p><p></p><p>She inexplicably felt a sense of closeness, and was about to speak, but felt a chill in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"Auntie, have you seen me before?" the young man finally asked.</p><p></p><p>But what he said was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>The woman was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, the other party's kind expression gradually made her relax, and she slowly opened up.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I understand what you mean."</p><p></p><p>"You're here to find relatives, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, you really do look a bit like my younger uncle. It's just that he suddenly left home a few years ago and I haven't seen him since." Tears flashed in the woman's eyes as she spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>The young man nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Besides him, are there any other people in the family?" he asked again.</p><p></p><p>"My husband died early, and my younger uncle and I grew up relying on each other. I say I'm his aunt, but I'm actually his birth mother." The woman said with a bit of self-mockery.</p><p></p><p>"But in the past few years, I've come to terms with it. How does that saying go? The deceased is gone. I also adopted two orphans, a boy and a girl. They are both very well-behaved, and the old Li family can be said to have successors."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that recently, the Holy Dynasty seems to be going to war, and the two little ones have volunteered to join the army. Sigh... I don't know if they can come back alive. You say, why fight when everything is fine." The woman chattered on, a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>But soon, she realized that her words had touched a taboo topic and immediately stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the young man's expression didn't seem to change much, the woman breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, they will return home safely," the young man said very amiably.</p><p></p><p>The woman also smiled, "Then I'll take your word for it, young man. By the way, have you eaten? Why don't you eat at my house?"</p><p></p><p>"Seeing that you haven't been conscripted into the army, you shouldn't be a cultivator and still need to eat, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's my fault, seeing you made me think of that younger uncle who disappeared from home..."</p><p></p><p>The woman kept explaining.</p><p></p><p>But the young man nodded and readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>He quietly ate a meal at the woman's house before taking his leave.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, although the woman only watched from the side and didn't eat, she still felt as if she had eaten a full meal, her whole body warm and seeming to have inexhaustible energy.</p><p></p><p>At this point, how could the woman not understand that she had encountered a noble person.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard she racked her brain, she couldn't figure out the origin of this noble person.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the different appearance, the woman almost thought that the other party was her younger uncle returning.</p><p></p><p>"Fan'er, are you really dead?"</p><p></p><p>The woman was in a daze in the room.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Ling Prefecture, the young man went to several other places in the Great Beginning.</p><p></p><p>Including the foot of Mount Jieli.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he ascended to the peak of Mount Jieli and slowly sat down in a thatched hut on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>This young man was naturally the Holy Emperor of the Great Beginning.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he gained enlightenment in the Starry Sea and grew a countenance, he had always had some misgivings in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, he never chose to delve into it.</p><p></p><p>Until the moment when the decisive battle was about to begin...</p><p></p><p>The faces of the people of the Great Beginning were all in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Based on his current appearance, it was not difficult to find possible blood relations.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the sources seemed to be diverse and not from a single family.</p><p></p><p>This made the Holy Emperor have the illusion that he might have made a mistake.</p><p></p><p>But when facing those who truly had blood relations, the ripples that would instinctively arise in his heart finally confirmed something.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the peak of Mount Jieli, some of the guesses in his heart were finally confirmed.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the truth seemed to be deeply hidden in the fog, unable to be seen through.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the ancestor, or that person who mysteriously disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>"The time of disappearance happened to be the day my consciousness was born."</p><p></p><p>"Soul possession?

            <p>Jiao Xiuyuan sighed and said, "In this world, everything is driven by profit. The path of commerce is flourishing in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I refine thousands of puppets, observing the gains and losses in the world, all for my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"The accumulation of assets at the beginning is always very rapid. It's almost like climbing up a step every day, and my realm also rises with it step by step."</p><p></p><p>"But after reaching a certain level, the expansion of Qianli Hall slowed down."</p><p></p><p>"After stagnating in cultivation for a long time, I originally thought that with the insights gained from this huge profit, I could make a breakthrough and advance forcibly. But I didn't expect that there was still a lack of readiness."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, 'Seeing a hill and running a dead horse.' I thought the goal was near, but little did I know there were still thousands of mountains and valleys ahead."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, listening to Jiao Xiuyuan's lament, thought about the huge gap he had seen between He Dao and He Dao not long ago, and also the huge chasm between the He Dao realm and Changsheng realm.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously nodding in agreement, Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiao Xiuyuan continued, "Moreover, I've found that in the path of commerce, at my current level, obstacles are everywhere, and progress is extremely difficult. To advance further is truly a thousand times harder!"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could ask, Jiao Xiuyuan replied, "Take the previous Pu Xianzhenye incident as an example. In an absolute ideal state, we could have earned much more. Purely from a business perspective, the price of Pu Xianzhen had skyrocketed at that time. The Wanxian Alliance controlled the Five Elements Grand Immortal Land, where there was a large and rich quantity of Pu Xianzhenye. We could have profited greatly, but a mere announcement reversed everything. New Book Bar, Take Kitchen." </p><p></p><p>"What they said was for stability, but wasn't it ultimately for their own benefit..." Jiao Xiuyuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Deep in thought, Li Fan replied, "What Jiao Daoist means is that profit is to be earned from others. When reaching a certain level, wanting to progress further inevitably leads to conflicts with others."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!" Jiao Xiuyuan agreed.</p><p></p><p>"If the other party is weak, of course, you can crush them directly. But if the other party is a solid wall, crashing into it will only lead to a head-on collision and bloodshed."</p><p></p><p>"At such times, one has no choice but to detour."</p><p></p><p>"However, in this world, it is ultimately under the rule of Wanxian Alliance and Wulao Club. It's difficult to avoid their control."</p><p></p><p>"Dancing with shackles is naturally a hundred times harder."</p><p></p><p>Listening, Li Fan smiled knowingly, "So, it's not the fault of Daoist Jiao. It's the fault of this world!"</p><p></p><p>"Being restrained everywhere is truly unpleasant. Why not overthrow the Wanxian Alliance with me and reshape the world? How about that?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan fell silent abruptly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan with a strange gaze.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, an eerie silence fell between them.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Daoist is joking."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, just kidding, Jiao Daoist wouldn't take it seriously, right?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the voices of both men rang out simultaneously. New Book Bar, Take Kitchen.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other and chose to skip over that topic.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of it, in the Daoist's heart, what would it look like when your path reaches the pinnacle?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan pondered for a moment and slowly replied, "The total assets in the world are limited. The rich get richer, and the poor remain poor."</p><p></p><p>"If I keep making profits, wealth will continuously flow to me in the world. Then one day..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps my wealth alone will exceed that of everyone else in the world combined."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes showed a longing.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Fan, after hearing this, chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan raised an eyebrow, "What, do you have any insights, Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>"You're thinking too small. I thought Daoist Jiao was the most intelligent person in the world, but I didn't expect..." Li Fan shook his head slightly, looking very regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" A touch of gloom flashed in Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If truly aiming for the pinnacle, why should anyone in the world still have assets?" Li Fan smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't everything in the world belong to Daoist Jiao? Are others all indebted to Daoist Jiao?"</p><p></p><p>"You should know, the total sum of wealth in the world has a limit. But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone turned stern, "The debts owed to Daoist Jiao by others can be endless."</p><p></p><p>"Ten, a hundred, a thousand, a million, can be endlessly accumulated."</p><p></p><p>"Not only in this life, but also in future lives, for countless generations to come, they will have to toil endlessly to repay the debts owed to Daoist Jiao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words were like thunder, instantly hitting Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>The haze in his eyes instantly dissipated, replaced by a look of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Can it...be like this?"</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by Li Fan seemed to open up a whole new world for him.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was confused, but then his eyes gradually brightened, showing excitement.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he seemed to have a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>"But time is endless. If I spread the goals I want to achieve over the river of time..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan immersed himself in his own fantasy, his eyes filled with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Li Fan, is this the future path you derived for me?" </p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally came back to his senses and looked towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, "I dare not claim it as guidance. It was just an insight I saw one day in my daily contemplation of the future possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"I felt that perhaps this world might benefit from Jiao Daoist's path, so I noted it down."</p><p></p><p>"Today, seeing Daoist Jiao, I thought to share it with you."</p><p></p><p>"Do not think my thoughts are absurd, Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes flickered, "Your insight is truly astonishing. To foresee such a strange future."</p><p></p><p>"However, why did Daoist come to me today and specifically mention this to me?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan with some doubt.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "I said that when you become successful, you might forget about old friends, yet you don't admit it."</p><p></p><p>"Did you forget about the task I entrusted you with before?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was stunned for a moment, then realized.</p><p></p><p>"You mean..."</p><p></p><p>"With Daoist's cultivation, forgetting something is naturally impossible. But since there hasn't been a reply for such a long time, there might be some difficulties. However, this matter is somewhat important to me. So, I can only trouble Jiao Daoist!" Li Fan cupped his hands solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan looked at Li Fan, and in an instant, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Five years ago, he had promised Li Fan to help investigate the identity of the ancient cultivator sought by the Wanxian Alliance in the exploration of ancient sect ruins around the world.</p><p></p><p>He did go and investigate.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he didn't take it too seriously, just intending to find out some information to fulfill the task.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised him was the Wanxian Alliance, which had always been leaky and unable to keep secrets well.</p><p></p><p>This time, the confidentiality work unexpectedly went much better than expected.</p><p></p><p>Despite his efforts, he spent a year or two and had little to show for it.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

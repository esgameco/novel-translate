            <p>"More than ten can increase by 1%."</p><p></p><p>"However, with so many resources at hand, I should be able to unlock another anchor point."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt slightly happy and continued working.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, all three thousand seven hundred and sixty-two damaged rare items of heaven and earth were completely absorbed.</p><p></p><p>The number of anchor points on Li Fan's panel changed to 4.</p><p></p><p>The anchoring progress was reset back to 0%.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>As the anchoring progress continued to increase, the amount of rare items needed gradually increased as well.</p><p></p><p>From adding 1% for every ten items, to later needing twenty or thirty items.</p><p></p><p>When unlocking the fifth anchor point, Li Fan absorbed all the remaining damaged rare items, but it did not increase the progress by even 1%.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I need higher-grade items to unlock the fifth anchor point," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already guessed what items would be needed next.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth rare items were a convergence of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Damaged rare items, or even the rare items of ordinary people, could no longer satisfy Li Fan's appetite.</p><p></p><p>So it was evident that alternatives needed to be found.</p><p></p><p>Either rare items of the earth or rare items of the heavens, or maybe even try using the golden pills condensed by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the next life, he could try absorbing the Cang Hai Pear to see the effect.</p><p></p><p>The rare items of the heavens were too few and not within consideration.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan had tried to purchase some "Golden Pill Fragments", but facing these inferior products, Li Fan was not interested at all.</p><p></p><p>There were no complete Golden Dan Tian Xuan Mirrors available for sale either.</p><p></p><p>In short, Li Fan should not think about unlocking another anchor point in the short term.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth anchor point must be used in a crucial place."</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Li Fan walked out of the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Instead of immediately diving back into work, he first used the Tian Xuan Mirror in the base to search for information about the ruins of the Chao Yuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there weren't many discussions among people, but there was already momentum for a massive stir.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, within the ruins of the Chao Yuan Sect, which had been nearly deserted for several years, sudden anomalies occurred.</p><p></p><p>Blood rain fell from the sky, and the occasional and wandering phantoms began to exhibit terrifying changes.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, these were just images of ancient people from a thousand years ago, seemingly normal.</p><p></p><p>But at a certain moment, they suddenly flashed, turning into terrifying figures with features disappearing, and pale faces oozing blood drops incessantly.</p><p></p><p>It only lasted for a few breaths before returning to normal, making people think it was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, attentive cultivators discovered that the transformations of these phantoms were becoming more frequent, and the duration of their faceless bloody appearances was increasing.</p><p></p><p>If that wasn't troubling enough, there was another fact that few cultivators guarding outside the Chao Yuan Sect were terrified of.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Chao Yuan Sect's ruins was unexpectedly expanding outwards.</p><p></p><p>The structure of the ruins looked unchanged from the outside, but it seemed to unknowingly erode the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Being within the range of the Chao Yuan Sect could possibly turn one into a phantom.</p><p></p><p>If this eerie ruins kept expanding...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators noticed the danger and promptly reported to the Ten Thousand Immortals League.</p><p></p><p>To everyone's surprise, before the envoys from the Ten Thousand Immortals League could arrive, a sword light shone from within the Chao Yuan Sect ruins.</p><p></p><p>The entire heavens and earth seemed to be illuminated by the light, and even the Tian Xuan Locking Spirit Formation that covered the Nine Mountains and States was faintly disturbed by this extraordinary sword light.</p><p></p><p>Ripples swirled on the celestial canopy above.</p><p></p><p>After the sword light dissipated, when everyone reopened their eyes, they were stunned to find the mysterious Chao Yuan Sect ruins gradually crumbling and disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, by the time the late-coming emissaries of the Ten Thousand Immortals League arrived, the Chao Yuan Sect ruins had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But two men and a woman, three figures, appeared out of nowhere and flew out from the depths of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>The envoy of the Ten Thousand Immortals League naturally tried to stop them and questioned them about the situation.</p><p></p><p>To everyone's surprise, upon hearing the envoy's self-introduction, the man among the three and the girl who looked no more than a teenager's face slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>These two individuals were actually Nascent Soul cultivators, with extremely fast flying speeds.</p><p></p><p>Although the envoy of the Ten Thousand Immortals League wanted to stop them, he was blocked by the remaining male cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear what the male cultivator said, but although the envoy's expression was extremely unsightly, he did not pursue.</p><p></p><p>Later, the two individuals conversed for a while and then disappeared from the sight of the observing cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind perplexed onlookers and the restored swamps of a thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging information, the onlookers suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>The three cultivators who flew out from the ruins were the same three who had infiltrated the Chao Yuan Sect ten years ago.</p><p></p><p>One of them was quite famous.</p><p></p><p>The biological son of the Scarlet Snow Immortal Saint, going by the name Insoluble Warblade.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to this individual, the cultivators were more interested in the other two individuals of unknown identity.</p><p></p><p>A decade ago, these two individuals were only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>However, after visiting the Chao Yuan Sect, they had already reached the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p></p><p>There was indeed a great opportunity within the Chao Yuan Sect ruins!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had been lurking outside the Chao Yuan Sect for more than ten years, hesitating to enter, finally understood the crucial matter and couldn't help but sigh and regret.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, their curiosity about the events within the Chao Yuan Sect ruins grew.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the identities of those two cultivators were incredibly mysterious, and no one knew who they were.</p><p></p><p>But to be able to join forces with the always aloof Insoluble Warblade, their identities were definitely not simple, the cultivators speculated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"That sword light that cut through the Chao Yuan Sect should be Insoluble Warblade's magical technique."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the seemingly ordinary wooden sword in Insoluble Warblade's hand, Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that not only Su Xiaomei and the others, but this Insoluble Warblade has also gained immensely within the ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, they have now reached the Nascent Soul realm, so any tricks might be easily seen through."</p><p></p><p>"Or else, I could inquire through the 'Senior Skull' and get some clarity."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Heng is still at the Golden Pellet stage. Perhaps there's a chance to gather some information from him."</p><p></p><p>With the doubts in his mind temporarily resolved, Li Fan once again immersed himself in the arduous work.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Fan glanced habitually at the Grand Comparison Golden List and couldn't help but feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Just by delaying for such a short time, his ranking had fallen from ninth to fifteenth.</p><p></p><p>"Why rush so much."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and reassembled the resting cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They then resumed the high-intensity construction of formations.</p><p></p><p>One year later, anchored for 36 years.</p><p></p><p>With the successful combination of numerous formation units, the internal structure of the Locking Spirit Formation was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>Next, the most crucial central core area construction awaited.</p>

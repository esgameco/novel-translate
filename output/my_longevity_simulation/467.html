        <h1>Chapter 467</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After a moment of contemplation, Jiao Xiuyuan said, "I'll break a bone for you, and you'll transfer two hundred contribution points to me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said, "Jiao Daoist friend, you're too polite!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's concern was not about contribution points but about completing the transaction process.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't hesitate and directly transferred the two hundred contribution points.</p><p></p><p>After the transaction was completed, Li Fan faintly sensed some inexplicable and unclear changes on the puppet in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Such a phenomenon had never occurred before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind stirred, and he couldn't help but come up with a conjecture.</p><p></p><p>So he spoke up, "Jiao Daoist friend, are you about to break through?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was somewhat surprised, as he didn't expect to be seen through by Li Fan, who was in the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>"Good eye, Daoist friend! The Ancient Tianji Sect is indeed well-deserved of its reputation."</p><p></p><p>After sighing, Jiao Xiuyuan nodded and said, "Indeed. However, the cultivation method I practice is special, and the breakthrough I refer to is different from the usual realm breakthrough. The specifics are not convenient to explain. Please forgive me."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan expressed rare apologies.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, indicating his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"However, I, Jiao Xiuyuan, am not ungrateful. I have gained a lot from your help. New 69 novel club."</p><p></p><p>"If you have any needs, just tell me. I will definitely fulfill them for you!" Jiao Xiuyuan said firmly, pounding his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I happen to have a favor to ask of you. Do you know about the Ancient Medicine King Sect?" Li Fan took this opportunity to bring up the matter of helping him explore the Little Medicine King Ding.</p><p></p><p>"I have a premonition that these little dings will be involved in many causes and effects in the future, which is of great significance. However, the old site of the Medicine King Sect might pose fatal risks to me, so I can't go there personally, hence relying on you." Jiao Xiuyuan readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, after Senior Luo came to Wuxian Island that day, her whereabouts have been unknown. Daoist friend, since you are well-informed, could you find out for me? As a firsthand witness to the events, I am very curious about the impact this incident had on the Wuxian Alliance." Due to confidentiality agreements, Li Fan could only hint indirectly.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan also readily agreed to help.</p><p></p><p>After thanking Jiao Xiuyuan, the two chatted for a while.</p><p></p><p>When the cultivators besieging Li Fan gradually dispersed from the outside, he quietly left the Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>The blockade by Lu Xichan on Wuxian Island had been lifted, and now the cultivators could move freely.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what she had found out, but it was said that even Purple Cloud and Hongxi, the two transformed immortal rulers, had been recalled to the headquarters of the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, sensitive cultivators also noticed a series of unusual orders being issued.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Ji Hall, Formation Tactics Hall, all cultivators at the Yuan Infant stage and above were being summoned to the Wuxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"With such a big move, are they planning to research and build the Tianxuan Sealing Spirit Formation in advance?"</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Elders will be more diligent; I don't want to see that green sky again in this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for Jiao Xiuyuan to gather information, Li Fan quietly left Wuxian Island alone, transforming himself into the envoy of the "Multiverse Union," heading directly for the island where the group from the Empire was located.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten that the ten million contribution points from the Five Elders were still in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Although this ten million contribution points existed in the form of standard spiritual stones and could be exchanged for his own contribution points in the Tianxuan Mirror at any time, the unusually large amount and unknown origin might arouse the vigilance of related cultivators, especially since he had already exchanged five million contribution points last time.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he needed to obtain the technique for controlling the exotic beasts from the Empire, so it was better to hand over this hot potato to them directly.</p><p></p><p>Since there were quite a few lawbreakers who had infiltrated from the Empire, he believed they could easily launder this huge contribution from the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>He quickly arrived above the island.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's arrival, Qing greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to her previous aloof attitude, she was much more cordial.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the power of money was always beyond imagination regardless of the era.</p><p></p><p>"How do you like the gift from our Multiverse Union, Daoist friend?" Li Fan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Ha, more than like - it was quite shocking," Qing said as she led Li Fan into a secret room.</p><p></p><p>"Ten million contribution points, Daoist friend, you are quite generous. But why did you suddenly send someone to deliver them? Weren't we supposed to trade when we meet next? If it wasn't for the other party revealing their identity, I almost couldn't resist taking action." Qing asked with a hint of laughter and some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Fan said, "There have been some changes. Over the next period, the Wuxian Alliance might increase surveillance within its territory. So, our transaction needs to be completed quickly."</p><p></p><p>"I delayed coming earlier to find a settlement place for you..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan deliberately paused.</p><p></p><p>"I believe we have shown enough sincerity. Next, it depends on how the Empire views it." Li Fan drank a cup of tea prepared by Qing and continued slowly.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the spiritual tea Li Fan used to drink, this tea had no benefits for cultivation, spiritual power, or consciousness. Instead, a warm stream flowed from his limbs and veins, improving and strengthening his body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who cultivated the "Heavenly Furnace of Creation," was naturally very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>It was remarkably similar to the hidden power within the human body.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Extremely Spirit Dragon Whisker Tea.' If you like it, it's yours." Qing smiled and handed a storage ring to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan took it, Qing adjusted her expression.</p><p></p><p>"Just some personal matters earlier. Now, let's talk about the trade between the Empire and the Multiverse Union."</p><p></p><p>"We believe that the Union can indeed help the Empire. Therefore, the Empire reciprocates and is definitely increasing its cooperation. First, this is part one of the transaction."</p><p></p><p>Saying so, Qing handed over another uniquely shaped storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The ring was engraved with a vivid phoenix, with its eyes constantly moving.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan found the phoenix carved on the storage ring somewhat familiar, but most birds in the world looked quite similar, so he refrained from making conclusions.</p><p></p><p>As he tried to check its contents, his consciousness was blocked, causing the inspection to fail.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the lazy phoenix on the ring eyed Li Fan and flapped its wings that he realized.</p>

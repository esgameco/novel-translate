            <p>Chapter 1239: The Calamity of Sealing Immortals with Source Power</p><p></p><p>Back in the 119th lifetime, Li Fan had fabricated rumors about the so-called "True Immortal's Remnant Body". He used it as bait to lure the cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance into the small world of the Life and Death Reversal Grand Formation, exposing the "Rebirth Venerable" prematurely to the world.</p><p></p><p>However, he never expected that there was indeed a true immortal's remnant body hidden within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was not an ordinary immortal.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal body of the first generation Grand Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Just this one sentence hinted at many secrets.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Grand Venerable did not refer to a specific cultivator, but represented a certain status and title.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already learned about this in the deepest part of the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"My guess back then was correct. As long as one passes the trial of the Fallen Immortal Realm, they should be able to succeed as the new Xuanhuang Grand Venerable. And it's very likely that they will also obtain the few immortal artifacts left by Mr. White at the same time."</p><p></p><p>"Then, where would Mr. White have hidden the immortal body of the first generation Grand Venerable? Would it still be in the Fallen Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>He was particularly intrigued by this first generation Grand Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If the remnant body could be called an immortal body, there was no doubt that this Grand Venerable had at least reached the True Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Why did this True Immortal die? Before his fall, why did he choose to leave his remnant body in the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>Would the birth of the Fallen Immortal Realm have anything to do with this True Immortal Grand Venerable?</p><p></p><p>Now, the avatar Holy Emperor had already stood at the pinnacle of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Taking into account the inherent expansion of the Xuanhuang Realm over these years, the Holy Emperor's strength could be said to be only a hair's breadth away from Mr. White's back then.</p><p></p><p>With a concrete reference, Li Fan was now certain that Mr. White alone did not have the power to create the vast and illusory Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But during the era of the Ten Immortal Sects, the world was unaware of the existence of the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>So it could be confirmed that even if it was not created by Mr. White himself, the Fallen Immortal Realm must have had a great connection to Mr. White.</p><p></p><p>The several layers of illusory trials undoubtedly proved this point.</p><p></p><p>"Although Mr. White 'betrayed' the Xuanhuang Dao, he did not break his word. The immortal artifacts and immortal body were all returned to the Xuanhuang Dao. Even his cultivation was returned to the heavens along with his demise in the process of reversing the mortal and immortal principles."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently, but did not have much intention to go searching for the Grand Venerable's immortal body.</p><p></p><p>Although the Grand Venerable's immortal body could be considered a supreme treasure, it was of little use to Li Fan at present. Even if he could rely on the protection of the immortal body to cross the high wall, Li Fan would never rashly leave without knowing anything about what lay beyond the high wall.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, Li Fan's current realm was still far from being able to utilize immortal spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Just how to detonate the immortal artifacts and use their explosive power to cross the high wall without harming himself was not something Li Fan knew.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to take it step by step. Anyway, as long as it's within the Xuanhuang Realm or the scope of the Darkest Starry Sea, it will all be mine sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a very clear understanding of his advantages.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Emperor avatar of this lifetime already has sufficient capital to contend with the Myriad Immortal Alliance. Now, with the boost in strength from various enhancements, he has even surpassed me. Let's see how he stirs up the wind and rain."</p><p></p><p>"However, my avatar left in the Sun family can cultivate a future Grand Venerable."</p><p></p><p>His attention shifted in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The avatar had now completely taken over control of Wu Ninglu's body.</p><p></p><p>But it did not let her notice.</p><p></p><p>It just silently influenced her every decision and action.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, it did not hesitate to sacrifice its own cultivation to nourish the fetus in her womb.</p><p></p><p>If it were the previous Wu Ninglu, she definitely would not have done this.</p><p></p><p>She only regarded this unborn child as a bargaining chip to control Sun Ang.</p><p></p><p>But now with Li Fan's intervention, things were naturally different.</p><p></p><p>Since the avatar had previously sensed the extraordinary nature of this fetus, it had begun meticulous prenatal education.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced the cultivation stage before birth on the body of the little black heavenly bird in the Fallen Immortal Realm, Li Fan had quite rich experience.</p><p></p><p>Under his personal guidance, the fetus absorbed the essence of the mother's cultivation, gradually making up for the innate deficiency caused by the previous seal.</p><p></p><p>Its physique grew stronger day by day, and its consciousness slowly stabilized from being weak.</p><p></p><p>In a state of complete ignorance, not knowing anything, it was led by Li Fan's avatar into one carefully crafted illusory realm after another.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that a sage is born. But in fact, it is not impossible to create a sage through acquired means."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called judging by actions, not by heart. No matter what one thinks in their heart, as long as they always have strict moral requirements and codes of conduct for themselves, and will not break them even unto death..."</p><p></p><p>"Then in the eyes of others, this is a true sage."</p><p></p><p>Cultivating from a state of innate ignorance was definitely much easier than acquired education.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan was doing now was more like shaping the personality of a living being.</p><p></p><p>He did not have any special experience and could only explore through practice. If this proved feasible, then forget about sages, mass-producing gentlemen would definitely not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already discovered that although the Xuanhuang Dao had been deceived by Mr. White once before, it still trusted people like Mr. White more easily.</p><p></p><p>Just like the faceless Holy Emperor of this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"And the fundamental reason probably traces back to Xuantian King Xuanyuan Hong, and even the first Xuanhuang Grand Venerable." Li Fan mused.</p><p></p><p>The birth of the fetus in Wu Ninglu's body had already been planned by Li Fan to coincide with her devouring the Worldly Souls and advancing to the Harmonized Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, there is even a possibility of giving birth to the first cultivator in the Xuanhuang Realm who is born in the Harmonized Dao realm..."</p><p></p><p>"With such an extraordinary phenomenon, who would dare say he is not a sage?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan couldn't help but have some expectations for the future of this fetus.</p><p></p><p>He had even composed the script of its destiny in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Such a heaven's pride will definitely be seen as the future hope of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. And it is such a figure who, when the Great Sheng Dynasty and the Myriad Immortal Alliance are at war in full swing, resolutely chooses to turn his weapon around."</p><p></p><p>"And firmly claims to be standing on the side of justice."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The scene of all the people in the Xuanhuang Realm being forced to pass on the teachings will surely be very interesting."</p><p></p><p>Vivid images flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Without the aid of the Dao-Transforming Stone to deduce, he could already roughly predict the trajectory of this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the ideal state.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was cultivating an innate sage</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Heavenly Profound Mirror's secret being exposed, or the Great Qi Dynasty of the Holy Dynasty truly developing to the point of forcing the Dharma Transmission to show itself, both would still require a long time to slowly develop.</p><p></p><p>Also in the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense hidden in the Immeasurable Mirror had a much more leisurely time than the divided spirit.</p><p></p><p>In addition to constantly prying into the secrets of the Heavenly Profound Mirror, most of his energy was spent on trying to lure out the annihilating wind disaster in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Sun Luyuan's allegiance to the Holy Emperor, he was fortunate enough to borrow more than a hundred healthy Youzu people who had just been born recently.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were hiding in the underground secret room of the Sun family, next to the family's essence blood pool.</p><p></p><p>The treatment of these Youzu people was even better than that of their fellow tribesmen in the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>They even had two hours of rest time every day.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was not because Li Fan had a sudden burst of kindness, but because the Immeasurable Mirror simply could not withstand too frequent experiments and needed time to rest.</p><p></p><p>"I guessed correctly. This annihilating wind tribulation does indeed actively attack forces approaching the [Immortal]."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Immeasurable Mirror emitted bursts of faint light and floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>The mirror surface did not reflect the external scene, but instead had many scenes of civilizations being destroyed by tribulations flashing quickly.</p><p></p><p>A sense of vicissitudes and ancientness emerged from the mirror body.</p><p></p><p>The black, formless annihilating wind was drawn out from the Immeasurable Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It flew towards a golden square not far away.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, this square was composed of pure source power.</p><p></p><p>Although it could not compare to the purity of the Holy Emperor's avatar's source power, it was enough to lure this annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>As the annihilating wind disaster entered the area covered by the source power, its form changed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The power that transcended the mundane disappeared in an instant, and the purity of the source power decreased, leading to a decrease in energy level.</p><p></p><p>Having lost its tracking target, the annihilating wind disaster stayed in place for a brief moment.</p><p></p><p>It was about to continue spreading to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>However, the source power changed and formed a large formation.</p><p></p><p>It sealed the power of the annihilating wind disaster inside.</p><p></p><p>This large formation was based on the incomplete [Xuanyuan Shiling Grand Formation] that Li Fan had referred to, using the formation to simulate a relatively stationary space.</p><p></p><p>Inside the large formation, there was nothing, an absolute state of nothingness.</p><p></p><p>It was very similar to the apocalyptic situation after everything had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the annihilating wind disaster was enchanted by it, and its energy no longer moved towards rioting, but slowly went into hibernation.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the remaining residual power of the wind disaster inside the Immeasurable Mirror also calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"The predecessor's techniques are truly miraculous. With just a few more times like this, the hidden danger in my body can be completely eliminated." Sun Luyao, the spirit of the Immeasurable Mirror, said with great joy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not pay attention to him, but carefully put away the golden small cube that stored the annihilating wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>He had already made more than twenty similar small cubes like this.</p><p></p><p>Due to the differences in the level of proficiency in the technique, the wind disaster power contained in each of them also varied.</p><p></p><p>But there was no doubt that if the equilibrium state of each golden cube was broken, it would unleash a terrifying disaster.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao did not mind Li Fan's silence and continued to recount his changes.</p><p></p><p>"Predecessor, I have a premonition that once this wind disaster is completely eliminated, my control over the Immeasurable Mirror will reach a whole new level. At that time, I may be able to sense the whereabouts of other Immeasurable Mirror fragments and completely restore this immortal artifact."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad." Li Fan nodded slightly, his attention still focused on those golden cubes.</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed Li Fan's methods, Sun Luyao, who was eager to take credit, hesitated for a moment before saying, "Predecessor, when I am fully restored into an immortal artifact, I may even be able to simultaneously sense the whereabouts of other possible remnant immortal artifacts in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You're so sure?" </p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao's spirit trembled, and he quickly explained, "Existences like us can always sense each other to some extent. Especially my Immeasurable Mirror, which also has the ability to measure the heavens and examine the earth. If there really are other immortal artifacts remaining in the Xuanhuang Realm, then after I am restored, the probability of finding them is still quite high."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "I think you've been locked up for too long and really can't hold it in anymore, wanting to go out for a stroll."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao smiled sheepishly, "Of course, that's also a reason. But my intention to help the predecessor find immortal artifacts is definitely not a lie."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at him, "Let's talk about it after the wind disaster is completely eliminated first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was somewhat solemn, "Although it seems to have become extremely weak now, there is still no sign of its roots being completely reduced."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it is a power that transcends the mundane, and we cannot be careless."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao deeply agreed and couldn't help but nod.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Great Qi Dynasty of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>More than ten days had passed since Li Ping completely devoured the Xuanhuang evil thought.</p><p></p><p>Having gained such a large amount of power and experiencing a surge in strength, Li Ping also needed some time to digest and adapt.</p><p></p><p>He rarely took a break.</p><p></p><p>But inside the Great Qi Dynasty of the Holy Dynasty, it was an unprecedented scene of prosperity and flourishing.</p><p></p><p>Now, the fortune of the Great Qi Dynasty was highly tied to the Holy Emperor Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, after practicing the Emperor's Qi Scripture, it was the growth of the imperial fortune that drove the emperor's strength to advance.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment in the Great Qi, it was the very rare situation of the Holy Emperor's strength breaking through and feeding back the Holy Dynasty's fortune.</p><p></p><p>And when the people's hearts and fortune of the Holy Dynasty were further strengthened, it finally welcomed the feedback to the Holy Emperor again.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in addition to the increase in strength brought about by devouring the Xuanhuang evil thought,</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's Emperor's Qi Scripture was also approaching the point of transformation again soon after the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this time, there was no record of the way forward in the original scripture.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to go.</p><p></p><p>"Something similar to the Longevity Realm below True Immortality is already the limit of the fortune flow."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it is too difficult to break through the shackles and achieve True Immortality by relying solely on the imperial fortune."</p><p></p><p>"Unless it is a great holy dynasty that can span the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping shook his head slightly and suppressed this idea.</p><p></p><p>With the premise of the Darkest Starry Sea, even if the Great Qi Dynasty of the Holy Dynasty unified the Xuanhuang Realm, it would not be enough to support his breakthrough to the True Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Since this path is no longer passable, we must find another way."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Xuanhuang evil thought has been devoured by me, if I want to become even stronger..."</p><p></p><p>"One is the treasure fishing pool."</p><p></p><p>"As for the second..."</p><p></p><p>The faceless Holy Emperor sat on the Holy Emperor's seat, and the figures of native Xuanhuang Realm creations such as Ruomu and stone tablets appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"As part of the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm, the Heavenly Dao suffered a great calamity, yet they live well."</p><p></p><p>"Since they are useless to the heaven and earth, the gifts from the heaven and earth should be taken back."</p><p></p><p>A murderous aura surged from the faceless Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

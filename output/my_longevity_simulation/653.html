        <h1>Chapter 653</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Soon, many memories naturally surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time he and Xu Ke returned to the Beast Sect from the Sacred Beast Mountain in Nanming, they found out that Di San Mao and Senior Lu Ya, had all gone missing due to some external matters.</p><p></p><p>The promised rewards for the task could naturally not be redeemed, so Xu Ke had been constantly mentioning this matter.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in Li Fan's eyes, this was more of Xu Ke's pure longing for Senior Lu Ya. After all, they were both orphans from the Xuantian Temple in Ningyuan City and had come to the Beast Sect together. Xu Ke and Lu Ya could be said to be family members who relied on each other for survival.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Xu Ke's nagging, Li Fan closed his eyes and focused, activating the "Creation Forge Technique."</p><p></p><p>Truly, it was a perfect technique refined by Mr. Bai. Since practicing it, not only had his physical body become stronger, but his vitality had also increased every day. Even if he stayed awake all day and night, he would not feel tired. More importantly, his own Tianming Xuan Niao bloodline seemed to have become purer.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's originally glossy black feathers even occasionally emitted colorful lights under the sunlight, making him look exceptionally handsome.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke couldn't help but reach out to touch them from time to time, but Li Fan ruthlessly swatted his hand away.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of his bloodline brought about a comprehensive increase in abilities. Li Fan's divine skill "Tianming In Me" was becoming more adept, nourishing Xu Ke's fortune while also protecting himself. Li Fan had already reached the first crucial stage mentioned in the memory inheritance, where he could form a certain range of "Tianming Domain" around himself, making it easy to seek blessings and avoid disasters, all the while being able to use Tianming to confront enemies.</p><p></p><p>This ability to use Tianming to confront enemies was usually only achievable by Xuan Niaos over a hundred years old in the Tianming Xuan Niao clan.</p><p></p><p>And now, Li Fan had not been out of his shell for even five years, still a pure youngling.</p><p></p><p>Being able to break the growth rules of demonic beasts indicated the extraordinary nature of Mr. Bai's "Creation Forge Technique."</p><p></p><p>"After returning from the Fallen Immortal Realm, apart from receiving rewards for fulfilling obsessions, all other techniques and the like will be forgotten. Not sure if the 'Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra' under my influence will change this," Li Fan pondered to himself, perceiving the profound aspects of the creation technique.</p><p></p><p>Even though he might not be able to bring it back to reality, the various insights he gained during the practice of the creation technique were also greatly beneficial to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even though the storyline of the fallen realm had not progressed yet, he was in no hurry, immersing himself in his cultivation every day.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, on this particular day, Li Fan, who was engrossed in his cultivation, suddenly woke up with a start.</p><p></p><p>A sense of palpitation surged in his heart, and he looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Although the sky was clear as usual, Li Fan saw a dense and almost tangible aura of killing intent that covered the entire sky, nearly solidifying, rolling like dark clouds, causing fear and suffocation.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Faiths can't be cultivated together."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>Soon, screams came from within the Beast Sect.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?!"</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-six thousand four hundred and eighty-two practitioners of the Beast Decision, yet no one can advance despite operating their techniques?!"</p><p></p><p>"This is ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The catastrophic calamity of not being able to cultivate faiths together was almost devastating for the Beast Sect, which primarily practiced the Beast Decision.</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone could foresee that when all these cultivators were trapped at their current level and their lifespan was about to end, to seek a glimmer of hope, they might resort to extreme measures.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the members of the Beast Sect fell into extreme panic. They distanced themselves from each other instantly, looking at their once loving senior brothers and sisters with suspicion in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Out of the remnants of reason and conscience, no practitioner had resorted to violence yet.</p><p></p><p>Even though the sect master and the elders tried to pacify everyone, the atmosphere of terror continued to brew within the sect's confines.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, some could not bear the immense pressure and began to escape quietly. Some disciples, constantly under tremendous mental stress, had developed bloodshot eyes, some even hysterical.</p><p></p><p>Just like a powder keg ready to be ignited by an unknown spark at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At this critical moment, Di San Mao and Lu Ya returned.</p><p></p><p>"Have you brought it back?" Lu Ya asked Xu Ke as soon as he saw him.</p><p></p><p>His face remained calm, without a hint of panic.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke nodded and took out a small sleeping creature from his beast pouch.</p><p></p><p>It was a unique beast given by Di Yi, capable of self-division and giving birth to offspring.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing it, Lu Ya even showed a hint of joy. Carefully accepting the creature, he observed it for a moment before finally sighing in relief.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, what use does this little fellow have that you are so nervous about?" Xu Ke knew that Lu Ya usually remained inscrutable in both joy and anger, so he was curious this time and asked.</p><p></p><p>"He is the hope for us to overcome the calamity," Lu Ya said slowly, his eyes flashing with a hint of uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"Just this one?" Xu Ke widened his eyes, looking incredulous.</p><p></p><p>"You will understand in the future," Lu Ya didn't explain further and hurried away.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind a bewildered Xu Ke and a contemplative Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the Sect Master of the Beast Sect called for a sect meeting to address the catastrophe descending upon the world. They announced a series of plans.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, to prevent the mutual killing brought by the inability to cultivate faiths together, led by the Sect Master, all disciples had to temporarily disperse their cultivation of the Beast Decision technique and focus on refining their own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, all members of the Beast Sect began to evacuate in batches from the Xuan Yellow Main World to designated small world paradises for shelter.</p><p></p><p>Since the strength of the Beast Sect cultivators mostly lay in controlling demonic beasts, even dispersing their techniques would only slightly affect their actual combat power. Most disciples' demonic beasts had been carefully nurtured from birth, and their bond had already formed. Even without the Beast Decision, it would not hinder the disciples from controlling these demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>This plan could prevent the practitioners from falling into a state of mutual killing, so there wasn't much objection. Those who were unwilling, after the Sect Master set an example, had to agree in the end.</p><p></p><p>Regarding how to disperse techniques without affecting cultivation...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched Xu Ke mumble to himself, and in an instant, Xu Ke dispersed all his techniques, turning them into pure cultivation stored in the Dantian.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Supreme Primitive True Scripture'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was familiar with this scene, instantly recognized the technique currently used by the Beast Sect.</p><p></p><p>"It only tells how to operate, but it doesn't explain the origin."</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? I remember that the incident of Lawless Tianzun forcefully seizing the 'Supreme Primitive True Scripture' had not yet occurred at this time."</p><p></p><p>"Where did the Beast Sect's technique come from?"</p><p></p><p>In a flash, a figure in white clothes appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Him?"</p><p></p><p>Let me think about the next part.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Five faces and ten hands, yet sharing one body.</p><p></p><p>Each face on the statue has a different expression.</p><p></p><p>Some with drooping brows and a pitying gaze for heaven and humanity.</p><p></p><p>Some stern-faced and glaring in anger.</p><p></p><p>Among them, one is frowning lightly, looking pitiful. On closer inspection, one can faintly see her coquettish and charming demeanor, both resisting and welcoming.</p><p></p><p>This is Senior Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart warmed at the sight, unable to help but have various romantic thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In a trance, he could even hear Senior Zhao's gentle whispers in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"No! "</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly woke up in alarm, breaking free from the illusion, sweating profusely in an instant.</p><p></p><p>When he looked again, where were all those vivid expressions?</p><p></p><p>On the statue with ten hands, there were only five unclear faces.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Li Fan pretended to be calm as he retrieved the statue.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the colorful statue in Li Fan's hand, the man in black showed a fanatic look and explained to Li Fan, "This is the image of the Exalted Beings, the highest rank."</p><p></p><p>"It is the embodiment of the will of the five Exalted Beings. Although you cannot directly see the Exalted Beings through it, you can connect with the Five Pivot Council."</p><p></p><p>"The Exalted Beings generally do not intervene in worldly matters. They are led by the Five Pivot Council."</p><p></p><p>"When your actions require cooperation from us, the Five Elders, you can convey messages directly to the Five Pivot Council through the statue."</p><p></p><p>"It can only be used once. After it is used, the statue will naturally disappear."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan listened to the explanation, he nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining the ten-handed statue, Li Fan put it away in the Empty Transparent Mother.</p><p></p><p>The transaction completed, Li Fan was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, friend!" Suddenly, the man in black stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Li Fan squinted, showing a displeased expression.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad cultivator hastily said, "Hehe, friend, please do not misunderstand. There is actually another small favor I'd like to ask you for. Of course, the reward is definitely not to be missed!"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Li Fan's expression softened slightly as he said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad cultivator handed him a note. Li Fan took it and saw a few lines of small words written on it.</p><p></p><p>In essence, about a year ago, the Wanxian Alliance unearthed a dormant cultivator from the ancient ruins of the Purple Sky Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders wanted to request the intervention of the Foverist Association to help investigate the true identity of this cultivator and his current whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Purple Sky Sect.</p><p></p><p>The familiar term caught Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a small task?" Without showing any difference, Li Fan coldly snorted and ignited the note with his fingertips, burning it to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad cultivator smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"Do your best. We can't guarantee it either. The difficulty of this task is not beneath the Array Map."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned and left, leaving only a sentence echoing in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad cultivator pondered upon hearing the words.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>On his way back, Li Fan was particularly cautious. After all, he was now carrying valuable items and had to be on guard.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the security situation in the Wanxian Alliance was still good, and there were no incidents of treasure hunting or murder.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang" safely returned to the Congyun Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Only when he was completely safe did he sense a connection in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The contract exchange was complete.</p><p></p><p>The clause in the contract that prohibited both parties from harming each other had also expired at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Followed by a feeling of melancholy, as if something had disappeared from within him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a long time but could not understand the form in which the "contract" power existed. He shook his head and gave up.</p><p></p><p>Without rushing to check the gains from the transaction in the Empty Transparent Mother, Li Fan first pondered the request from the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing terms like "Purple Sky Sect" and "dormant cultivator," the first thing that came to his mind was the three words "Zhang Qianmo."</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was aware of the Wanxian Alliance's exploration of ancient sect ruins and dormant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Focal Xiu Yuan had talked to him about what he had witnessed and even shared his speculations.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked him to help investigate the identity of the ancient cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, two years had passed with no feedback.</p><p></p><p>This indicated the extraordinary nature of the matter.</p><p></p><p>Focal Xiu Yuan might have a combined cultivation realm, and his clones were spread throughout the Wanxian Alliance, making him well-informed.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed helpless in this matter...</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it's not necessarily Senior Zhang."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhang practices the Purple Dan Nirvana technique, continuously reincarnating. He should have reincarnated as the 'Martial Fool' by now."</p><p></p><p>"Such superior techniques should not have such a big flaw."</p><p></p><p>"If, during the reincarnation, my original body still exists in the world, it would expose vulnerabilities."</p><p></p><p>After analysis, Li Fan denied his previous conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"Other than Senior Zhang, who from the Purple Sky Sect could still be alive?"</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Li Fan could not come up with an answer.</p><p></p><p>During ancient times, the Purple Sky Sect was only a second-rate sect.</p><p></p><p>There were no powerful Immortals in the sect, and even the combined cultivators were only a few.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Chen's memories from his previous host, those elders in the sect didn't seem like they could have survived until now.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I have abandoned the identity of a 'Celestial Mechanism Sect cultivator' and have no items with me. I can't contact Focal Xiu Yuan for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until after the great battle."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan decided to put this matter aside for now.</p><p></p><p>He took out a piece of People's Star Dust from the Mother of the Empty Ming and placed it in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing an Enlightenment Pill, he began to examine it.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly ordinary black rock emitted a silver starlight.</p><p></p><p>As he touched it with his consciousness, countless images flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was a female cultivator who, with great perseverance, achieved the feat of changing the mind of her beloved person after five hundred years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike many stories' endings, the female cultivator ultimately ascended as a star, causing the male cultivator she had been single-mindedly in love with to fall for her in the end.</p><p></p><p>For the rest of his life, he would look up at the stars every day, shedding tears of regret and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Without showing any emotion, Li Fan decisively switched to another piece of stone.</p><p></p><p>The story contained in this People's Star Dust was somewhat more ordinary.</p><p></p><p>It was about a cultivator who, after witnessing his loved one struggle due to insufficient talent, unable to dispel the miasma in her body and unable to progress on the cultivation path, witnessed them perish in old age within a few decades.</p><p></p><p>He made a grand vow to allow all people in the world to cultivate freely.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this grand vision was too vast and remained unfulfilled.</p><p></p><p>So, he settled for allowing "people of the family" instead of "people of the world" to cultivate as they pleased.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator ascended to the sky, and from then on, outstanding talents emerged in his family.</p><p></p><p>In less than a hundred years, the family became a prominent force in the region.</p><p></p><p>"Reversing talent..."</p><p></p><p>A gleam flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and spiritual energy gathered in his palm before he exerted force.</p><p></p><p>The black stone was instantly crushed, and the silver starlight was all absorbed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many indescribable insights rushed into his mind.</p><p></p><p>The principles of heaven and earth, interweaving comprehensively, formed a vast net that maintained the order of the world.</p><p></p><p>One of these threads, shining brightly in Li Fan's eyes at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He could almost see the intricate patterns clearly and touch the profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this "thread" occupied Li Fan's entire field of vision.</p><p></p><p>The "thread" became as huge as a giant pillar holding up the sky.</p><p></p><p>The wonderful breath emanating from it immersed Li Fan in joy. Many previously incomprehensible matters became clear in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also noticed that there seemed to be millions of threads connecting him to the giant pillar.</p><p></p><p>Staring at these faint, elusive lines, a sudden realization dawned on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Though he currently appeared to be a puppet manipulated by the "giant pillar" through these threads.</p><p></p><p>But someday, if his power was mighty enough, he might be able to use these threads as a bond and reverse the control of the "giant pillar."</p><p></p><p>Overwhelming joy surged through his heart, making even Li Fan, who was secluded deep in the Congyun Haigou, unable to suppress the excitement trembling in his body.</p><p></p><p>Reincarnation for a hundred generations, the long-standing Immortality technique was now within arm's reach for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although knowing and truly achieving it still had a vast difference.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortals in this realm, who obtained the knowledge from the sky and earth, had only reached a pseudo-immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the gains at this moment still gave Li Fan a tremendous sense of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in his thoughts, he didn't realize how time flew.</p><p></p><p>When the People's Star Dust was nearly depleted, he awoke from his enlightenment, feeling that his insights were not yet exhausted.</p><p></p><p>After reminiscing for most of the day, he gradually regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously checking the time, Li Fan was shocked to find that what felt like just a brief moment had actually been almost a year passing in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the powerful Immortals are indifferent to worldly affairs. Now I understand what true cultivation without the shackles of time means."</p><p></p><p>"This was just a glimpse with the help of the People's Star Dust, and there was still so much to explore."</p><p></p><p>"If I could truly comprehend the principles of heaven and earth, being immersed in it might consume decades of time within just a closed-door cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>After musing for a long time, Li Fan began to review the events that had occurred outside while he was in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The communication talisman of "Zhou Qing'ang" was almost bursting with messages from people like He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't rush to reply but chose to focus on the key points.</p><p></p><p>The battle in Tianlingzhou was still ongoing but had significantly eased.</p><p></p><p>Thus, cultivators were able to learn some information from the battlefield reports.</p><p></p><p>The effect of the Xuantian Locking Spirit Formation that Li Fan submitted was evident.</p><p></p><p>Just on the tenth day after the completion of the transactions between the two sides, in a medium-scale skirmish.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance tried to use a similar tactic, utilizing the Tianxuan Sealing Spirit Formation to crush and massacre the group of cultivators from the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>However, they were met with a prepared enemy.</p><p></p><p>A crimson protective light enveloped each cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After the merging of the green and red lights, nothing abnormal happened.</p><p></p><p>To the astonishment of the Wanxian Alliance, a fierce battle with blades began.</p><p></p><p>---</p>

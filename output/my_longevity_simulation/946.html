        <h1>Chapter 946</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Holy Fetus Li Fan echoed in this endless sea of cultivation methods. </p><p></p><p>"The more you can't get something, the more you want it."</p><p></p><p>"So to completely quell the greed in your heart, you just need to satisfy all the desires you have for 'rest' in one go."</p><p></p><p>"Give yourself a long vacation. Long enough that you have nothing to do and are bored out of your mind..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's words, the little loli's eyes immediately lit up. </p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but say, "How could anyone possibly feel bored from having nothing to do?! If I didn't have to derive cultivation methods anymore, I would definitely sleep for a few decades first!"</p><p></p><p>As if longing for that wonderful holiday life, the face of the little loli who derived the methods was full of yearning.</p><p></p><p>However, very quickly, she said very dejectedly, "Sigh, let alone resting for a few decades. Even taking a break for ten days or half a month would be very difficult."</p><p></p><p>"It's so nice to not have to work!" </p><p></p><p>Recalling the happy times of slacking off before, the little loli couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Then she glanced at Li Fan and complained, "It's all your fault, otherwise I could have pretended for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>"Escaping is not the solution." Li Fan smiled wryly, "Thoroughly resolving the root cause is the right way."</p><p></p><p>The little loli snorted, "It's easy for you to say. I had an agreement with the Venerable One of Imparting Methods back then, that I could only rest after deriving all the cultivation methods in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, at the current pace, it will probably take a few thousand more years. It's really worrying me to death..."</p><p></p><p>The little loli pouted and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"If only we could find another Derivation Orb to help you derive, then you could rest." Just then, the Holy Fetus Li Fan suddenly spoke up and lamented.</p><p></p><p>The little loli gave Li Fan a look, "This noble lady is unique in the world, where can you find another me?!"</p><p></p><p>However, the little loli paused after a moment, "If my future self a few thousand years later could directly give me the completed derived methods, wouldn't I be able to work on the surface but actually rest as I wish?"</p><p></p><p>The little loli's eyes became bright and lively as she fell into a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Through the conversation with the Derivation Orb, the Holy Fetus Li Fan had already obtained enough information. </p><p></p><p>At this time, he decisively spoke up to wake up the other party, "I have already stated the cause of your illness. Where are the cultivation methods I need?"</p><p></p><p>The Derivation Orb didn't react at all, only staring blankly with empty eyes and giggling foolishly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had to raise his voice and repeat it again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the little loli wake up as if from a dream.</p><p></p><p>She gave Li Fan a resentful look and complained, "Let me rest a little longer, geez..."</p><p></p><p>"Those guys probably won't come to urge me for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, your cultivation method is indeed quite complex, I can take the opportunity to rest a bit more."</p><p></p><p>She waved her hand, signaling Li Fan to wait a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>The little loli started spacing out again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also did not stop her, but turned his gaze to the countless cultivation methods floating around.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivation methods themselves were bound by chains made of characters and could not be examined.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gave up the idea of peeking. Eyes on the nose, nose on the heart, he patiently waited for the little loli to rest enough.</p><p></p><p>A full day passed. It seemed that under the urging and inquiries from the myriad realms, the Derivation Orb finally woke up slowly with a bit of reluctance. </p><p></p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her little hand, and a book titled "Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Illuminated God Art" immediately appeared.</p><p></p><p>The books appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that she had already deduced them long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take them. It's time for you to go."</p><p></p><p>"I hope the next person who comes to deduce the techniques will be just as difficult, so I can save some free time again."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the little girl's words, the Holy Fetus Li Fan returned to the space of the character light sphere.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned, Yan Fa Jue became listless and sleepy as before.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the faint warning in her eyes, Li Fan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fa Jue's actual speed of deducing techniques was far faster than what she outwardly showed.</p><p></p><p>Each time she deduced a technique, it could be completed very quickly. So the remaining time could be used for free rest.</p><p></p><p>This was perhaps one of the reasons why she could persist in deducing for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The Protector Hall of the Myriad Immortals Alliance was probably also clear about this matter.</p><p></p><p>But if they pushed too hard, it might backfire. So they simply turned a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>With the techniques in hand, the purpose of this trip had been achieved.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands in farewell to the white-haired Harmonious Dao elder.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he also explained in detail the source of Yan Fa Jue's illness.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, Li Fan remembered something and took out the token that the white-haired elder had given him earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Before leaving the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, I'd like to visit the [Museum of Divine Treasures], is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Visiting the Museum of Divine Treasures was something he could do anytime.</p><p></p><p>But the token he had given represented a personal favor from him, which had many uses.</p><p></p><p>To waste it so easily?</p><p></p><p>"Young man, why don't you reconsider?" Even the white-haired elder himself felt it was a bit of a waste and couldn't help but advise.</p><p></p><p>"No need. My mind is made up." Li Fan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder shook his head slightly and no longer dissuaded him.</p><p></p><p>He took back the token and sent Li Fan out of the Protector Hall, then instructed the guiding cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he returned to the Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, he followed behind the guiding cultivator towards the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>His change of mind to suddenly visit the Museum of Divine Treasures was actually the idea of his true self.</p><p></p><p>One reason was to take a look at the skull displayed in the center of the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>The second was to use the time while touring the museum to fully memorize the [Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique].</p><p></p><p>It should be safe inside the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>But once he left the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance, it was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his unconventional performance in the Protector Hall would inevitably attract attention.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan had already decided that as soon as he left the Immortal Alliance headquarters, he would directly abandon this Holy Fetus to prevent being tracked.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Museum of Divine Treasures, memories related to the collection also surged forth.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that his true self had been here before.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan still pretended to be visiting for the first time.</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was secretly browsing the [Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique] deduced by Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>The complexity of this technique was no less than the Immortal Techniques of the Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was just that its power was more than a notch weaker, only at the level and combat strength of the Harmonious Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>However, it should be enough for Li Fan to use to deceive Mo Rubin with tricks.</p><p></p><p>Having fully memorized the entire technique, Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the comprehension of the technique, he only came back to his senses when he finally arrived at the very center of the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the skull in front of him, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>It was no different from a human skull.</p>

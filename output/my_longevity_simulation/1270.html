            <p>Chapter 1267: Encountering the True Immortal Again</p><p></p><p>As the Dark Sea stirred, the kneeling Youzu people seemed to sense something, their expressions becoming even more frenzied and devout.</p><p></p><p>Like a gust of wind, it blew from all directions of the Dark Sea, converging near the small hole drilled by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The pressure increased sharply, and invisible ripples spread from the opening. Under the layered mighty power, the stable state at the opening was instantly shattered in Li Ping's perception.</p><p></p><p>The condensed and compressed source power instantly retreated bit by bit, seemingly about to be completely expelled from this Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Li Ping actually saw that in this lightless sea, it suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>It was not an illusion caused by the inherent rhythm of the Dark Sea as before, but truly, light was born here.</p><p></p><p>The golden abacus stabilized the Wanxian Alliance's source power that was in disarray. The abacus beads moved, and the source power output suddenly increased, maintaining the two in a state of balance again.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sea's waves surged, whipping up waves after waves. But each time, they were perfectly resolved by the golden abacus's calculations, deployment, and adjustments.</p><p></p><p>What made the secretly observing Li Ping even more amazed was that what the golden abacus did was not just about regulating the source power. More importantly, golden rays spread out with the constant movement of the abacus beads.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, it was the aura of a cultivator who had completely disappeared from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's heart tightened, concealing himself and the hundreds of Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>During this time, under the strenuous maintenance of the golden abacus, the Dark Sea had returned to a state of balance and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in his heart, Li Ping brought the Youzu people back to Daqi.</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt flashed in the Holy Emperor's heart.</p><p></p><p>After scanning around with his eyes for a few rounds, he did not find any suspicious existence, and finally slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"If it was just the same aura, it would be fine. If he is still alive and even hiding within the Wanxian Alliance, helping them steal the power of the Dark Sea..."</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene appeared in Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>After connecting his divine sense to the stone tablet, he began to read the information recorded on the Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this suspicion that the Holy Emperor temporarily changed his decision.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stood not far from the opening, pondered for a while, and finally postponed the plan to destroy the Wanxian Alliance's device here.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, since the birth from the golden abacus, it was extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>The eyeball gave life to the abacus and carefully searched for the anomalies inside the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>"It completely defies common sense."</p><p></p><p>It was not that Li Ping feared a direct confrontation with the Wanxian Alliance at this moment, but that he sensed a familiar aura from the suddenly appearing eyeball.</p><p></p><p>That unknown existence that was awakening fell back into slumber under the appeasement of the golden light from the abacus.</p><p></p><p>The eyeball was cold, devoid of any emotion. It rotated and scanned, seeming to want to find the reason for the imbalance of the Dark Sea power extraction device.</p><p></p><p>Although it didn't fly out for long before being completely devoured by the darkness. But under the effect of these golden lights, the raging waves of the Dark Sea were slowly calmed.</p><p></p><p>As the change occurred, an eyeball also quietly descended above the opening of the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Xuantian King, from an initially ordinary cultivator, reversed his fate all the way, encountering wonders one after another, and finally became the last ascender of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not long after he broke through the void and became part of the eternal legend of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>He reappeared, shocking the world.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, it was the establishment of the Xuantian Sect and its eventual extermination by the alliance of the Ten Sects.</p><p></p><p>The scenes were intermittent, and at some key points, it seemed as if someone had forcibly erased them.</p><p></p><p>But even this fragmentary personal growth history book was enough to be ups and downs, and captivating.</p><p></p><p>"From the synchronized perception memory of the Xuanhuang Dao and the records of the Creation Stone Tablet. The eyeball that appeared in the Dark Sea has an almost ten out of ten similarity with Xuantian King."</p><p></p><p>"The strange thing is here."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Dao personally certified that Xuantian King had fallen. Where did the Wanxian Alliance find his eyes?</p><p></p><p>"The specific record information of the siege of the Xuantian Sect by the Ten Immortal Sects back then is also a blur. Able</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To be able to conceal the power of the Primordial Source of the Xuanhuang Realm, one must at least be an existence of comparable strength."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùô®ùôùùô™ùô≠.ùôòùô§ùô¢</p><p></p><p>The more he pondered, the more he felt shrouded in doubts.</p><p></p><p>This apparent savior of the Xuanhuang Realm was enveloped by too many mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, his cultivation level was placed there.</p><p></p><p>The body of a Half-Immortal, vanishing without a trace. It was truly hard to believe. Especially now that Li Ping himself had already vaguely reached the limit of the Xuanhuang Realm, he understood its immense power even more.</p><p></p><p>Only a True Immortal or above might be able to eliminate the Xuan Tian King without a sound.</p><p></p><p>But if such an existence truly appeared in the world, it would certainly shock the heavens and earth, and even the Xuanhuang Realm would be implicated and buried along with it.</p><p></p><p>However, in the memory of the Dao of Heaven in the Xuanhuang Realm, such a thing did not happen.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps that True Immortal deliberately concealed their aura when taking action...</p><p></p><p>Then the question arose again.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of a True Immortal, all mortals were like ants.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Xuan Tian King was a Half-Immortal, he could not escape this fate. If a True Immortal killed him, why would they need to hide it from others?</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sacred Emperor flipped through the Creation Stone Tablet, trying to find some clues from it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan's divine sense, far away in the Ash Minor World, furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Since personally experiencing the troublesome nature of the Xuan Tian Sect's Dharma King, in order to avoid more twists and turns in this life, he specifically unilaterally blocked the Sacred Emperor's memory of Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, through a series of coincidences, the Sacred Emperor actually began to show signs of entanglement with Mo Rubin again.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Myriad Immortal Alliance can lock onto Mo Rubin's sleeping place from various clues, the Sacred Emperor should also be able to do it. This is getting interesting."</p><p></p><p>"The eye of the Myriad Immortal Alliance definitely cannot belong to the Xuan Tian King himself. Otherwise, after Mo Rubin occupied the body of the Dharma Transmitter and knew the secrets of the Immortal Alliance, he should have already discovered this matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered while activating the Immeasurable Mirror to analyze the Great Formation of Realm Protection.</p><p></p><p>"However, referring to his subsequent death in the Dark Abyss Sea, perhaps it can be speculated that the eyeball must have some inexplicable connection with the Xuan Tian King. It might even be a part of the Xuan Tian King's authority?"</p><p></p><p>"Mo Rubin discovered the existence of this Immortal Alliance eyeball and realized its connection to the Dark Abyss Sea, so he ventured into the dangerous place and ultimately perished without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"Authority..."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate, Great Formation of Realm Protection!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of brilliance appeared in Li Fan's eyes, and a point of light suddenly exploded in the yet-to-be-formed formation model deduced by the Final Separation Disk.</p><p></p><p>Even though its full appearance was still unseen, Li Fan instantly knew the meaning represented by this point of light.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the Xuanyuan Primordial Spirit Great Formation, this unknown Great Formation of Realm Protection is also composed of several different lower-level formations. Each formation has its own separate control core hub."</p><p></p><p>"This point of light is where the core is located!"</p><p></p><p>In the analysis of the Immeasurable Abyssal Light, the formation relic lines hidden deep beneath the Ash Minor World finally revealed the location of the corresponding "core".</p><p></p><p>However, the place that should have been the formation's hub, where the lines were most densely concentrated, was now completely empty.</p><p></p><p>As if someone had directly dug it out.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Immeasurable Mirror was about to continue probing that void core area, a sense of crisis suddenly surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>It made him immediately stop the action of the Immeasurable Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and looked towards that place of emptiness.</p><p></p><p>A seemingly illusory yet spine-chilling aura lurked within.</p><p></p><p>It was not that nothing existed there!</p><p></p><p>Rather, its existence surpassed the realm that ordinary people could perceive!</p><p></p><p>"True, Immortal, Seal, Characters!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said word by word in his heart, while raising his guard to the highest level.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the [Hunger], [Absence], and [Chaos] that Li Fan had encountered before, and also different from the remnant power in the Darkest Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>It did not even exist in the records of the Profound Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>A kind of brand-new, unknown power that did not attack other things, but only targeted the core of the Great Formation of Realm Protection.</p><p></p><p>Having completed their objective, they now quietly lay on the "corpse" of the formation's hub.</p>

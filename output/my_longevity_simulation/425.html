            <p>"Regret? What a joke! I, Li Fan, have always been resolute. http://69book28shuxi.com," Li Fan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"That settles it. If I lose, I will voluntarily give up practicing the 'Sit Mountain Art'. But if you lose..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared coldly at He Zhenghao. "I won't make it difficult for you. Besides immediately changing your cultivation method, you will also have to split your assets in half with me!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's face changed drastically. "This, this..."</p><p></p><p>"Elder! Who gambles like this!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan's eyes flashed a hint of killing intent, scaring He Zhenghao into shutting his mouth immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Now, in the Wan Xian Alliance, are there any documents like contracts?" Li Fan casually asked. "We can't just rely on verbal agreement, right? What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao dared not say no, so he had to grit his teeth and purchased a commercial contract from the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the contract and pretended to carefully study it as if seeing it for the first time, then wrote down the agreed terms before handing it back to He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao looked at the contract's extremely harsh terms and hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"In seven or eight days, turn 150,000 into 250,000. This is almost an impossible feat. My odds of winning are quite high."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the blade is raised, I am the fish on the chopping block. Let's gamble!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's expression kept changing, but ultimately, even with hesitation, he reluctantly signed his name on the commercial contract.</p><p></p><p>Two golden lights were respectively infused into Li Fan and He Zhenghao's bodies. http://69book28shuxi.com</p><p></p><p>The contract was now sealed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then said, "Alright, young man. Quickly take out the 150,000 credits!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was bewildered. "What 150,000?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glared at him and said matter-of-factly, "Your 150,000 contribution credits! I've just awakened, I'm not one of your Wan Xian Alliance people."</p><p></p><p>"Where am I supposed to get that many contribution credits to fulfill the contract?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, I'll have to borrow your contribution credits."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was first stunned, then completely panicked.</p><p></p><p>He knew that losing the bet would at most result in losing half, but if the investment failed, losing everything was not impossible!</p><p></p><p>These were the hard-learned lessons of his many years.</p><p></p><p>Even facing the palpable killing intent emanating from Li Fan, he still adamantly shook his head and refused.</p><p></p><p>Since both parties signed the commercial contract, they couldn't harm each other until the contract was completed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao believed in this and refused to put his life savings at risk.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that Li Fan might react aggressively, he was surprised when he instead put on a smiling face.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, don't worry. During the bet, I'll be here with you and won't leave."</p><p></p><p>"And I won't handle your contribution credits. I'll only provide advice on how to use them."</p><p></p><p>"And in the end, it's up to you to make the final decisions. If you're not comfortable, I won't force you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words seemed to have a mesmerizing effect, causing He Zhenghao to unknowingly let his guard down.</p><p></p><p>"If he says the final decision is up to me, then there's really no risk."</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, in a daze, He Zhenhao liquidated all his scattered investments.</p><p></p><p>Due to his haste, he incurred some losses.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he only received a total of 148,500 contribution credits.</p><p></p><p>By the time he realized his mistake, it was already too late for regrets.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, young man He, watch my skills."</p><p></p><p>As He Zhenghao lamented inwardly, he saw Li Fan suddenly radiate an inexplicable energy, his clothes fluttering without wind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes slightly, fingers moving as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao had no choice but to stand quietly aside, not daring to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's calculations took a full three days.</p><p></p><p>His face gradually turned pale, but his aura continued to strengthen with the passing time.</p><p></p><p>Although He Zhenghao couldn't fully comprehend, he understood that the situation was critical.</p><p></p><p>He dared not make a sound, tightly watching Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Command!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao saw a purplish energy burst through the formation and soar towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine skill is this..."</p><p></p><p>He was secretly amazed.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, Li Fan abruptly opened his eyes, a hint of a smile playing on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"I've got it!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was stunned. "Got what?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded by asking, "Does the Wan Xian Alliance currently possess something like the [Wuguyao Stone]?"</p><p></p><p>"Wuguyao Stone?" He Zhenghao frowned, searching for it in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he replied, "There is such a thing. It's a rare material for refining tools, though precious, its utility is limited."</p><p></p><p>"Why are you asking about this, Elder?" He Zhenghao felt puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Use all 150 credits to buy it!" Li Fan stated firmly.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was astonished. "Why?"</p><p></p><p>Impatiently, Li Fan said, "Divulging the heavenly secrets is forbidden. Just buy it! How much profit you can make with 150,000 credits depends on this move!"</p><p></p><p>Finally comprehending, He Zhenghao couldn't believe it. "Is this your investment strategy, Elder?"</p><p></p><p>Glancing at him disdainfully, Li Fan coldly laughed, "Young man, when I was cultivating the 'Sit Mountain Art,' you didn't even know where you were! Now you dare question me?"</p><p></p><p>Although he wanted to argue, he couldn't in the face of Li Fan's intimidation.</p><p></p><p>As a qualified investor, He Zhenghao didn't rush to heed Li Fan's hurried advice. Instead, he silently studied the information about the Wuguyao Stone.</p><p></p><p>"The main utility of this stone is in crafting the 'Wuguxing Zhou,' a vessel that can freely traverse the Earth's veins."</p><p></p><p>"Their existence and circulation are limited, and price fluctuations are relatively shallow."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's not a surefire win, it's highly unlikely to incur losses."</p><p></p><p>"For now, I'll follow his lead. With four days left until the bet ends, I don't believe this thing can miraculously change in such a short time."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan getting impatient beside him, He Zhenghao thought for a moment and made his decision secretly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since Elder, you insist, I have no choice but to follow suit."</p><p></p><p>The price of Wuguyao Stone was 280 contribution credits per catty.</p><p></p><p>While buying, He Zhenghao told Li Fan, "Elder, after being dormant for so long, you should know that the world has changed since ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"In our Wan Xian Alliance, we have treasures like the Tianxuan Mirror to control the market, ensuring price stability."</p><p></p><p>"Although there may be slight fluctuations, trying to amass wealth through this method..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted, "Stop babbling. Just watch and see!"</p><p></p><p>"How can a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator fathom my Tianji Sect's divine arts!"</p><p></p><p>Though feeling indignant, He Zhenghao withheld his retort and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Despite holding a grudge, he watched to see Li Fan's failure.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, to his astonishment, he witnessed the price of the Wuguyao Stone soar.</p>

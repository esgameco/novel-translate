        <h1>Chapter 1256</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Listening to Yijue's chanting, the Stone Tablet understood the meaning. ‚òúüí•‚ûÖÔºô—ï‚íΩùêÆùìß.ùí∏ÔΩèÔº≠üçìüêß</p><p></p><p>Within the sea of consciousness, the Dao Stone transformed, instantly splitting into numerous miniature Stone Tablet figures. </p><p></p><p>The Creation Stone Tablet's recorded images descended like snowflakes, diverted into these different sub-bodies.</p><p></p><p>The effect was so immediate that the Stone Tablet instantly felt a sense of relaxation it hadn't experienced in a long time.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a buffer. To thoroughly resolve my worries, I still need to store it."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet had a realization. </p><p></p><p>As his thoughts turned, the thousands of miniature sub-bodies continuously expanded, directly merging into the Dao Stone.</p><p></p><p>The originally azure crystal, under the tempering of the Stone Tablet's method, turned into a miniature version of itself.</p><p></p><p>Through the eyes of the Dao Stone Tablet, one could see countless different stone tablets, crisscrossing and arranged endlessly like facing mirrors.</p><p></p><p>"I've already squeezed the computing power of this Dao Stone to the limit. It truly lives up to being an exotic treasure. Just one top-grade piece can undertake the Creation Stone Tablet's information without any burden..." The Stone Tablet inwardly marveled.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I still control this recorded data. After being sorted and analyzed by the Dao Stone's countless sub-bodies, I can find it even faster compared to before."</p><p></p><p>With the hidden danger eliminated, he didn't immediately rise.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he fully enjoyed the tranquility he hadn't experienced in tens of thousands of years. </p><p></p><p>No longer having his sea of consciousness constantly filled with countless images and noises at all times, it was empty and clear, almost making the Stone Tablet feel the urge to shed tears.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Stone Tablet finally stood up.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Holy Emperor in front, he solemnly bowed: "Many thanks to fellow Daoist for the life-saving grace!"</p><p></p><p>"It was merely a small effort!" Although the Holy Emperor said this, he still accepted it frankly.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the center of the formation, the Holy Emperor waved his hand and the void overhead was concealed by mysterious Qi.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Holy Emperor's seat, Li Ping also stated frankly: "Although I helped fellow Daoist resolve the worry of the Stone Tablet's chaotic information, I won't use this as a chip to demand fellow Daoist to do anything."</p><p></p><p>"Whether you are willing or not, it all depends on fellow Daoist's heart."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet could hear that the Holy Emperor before him spoke with sincerity, and couldn't help but be greatly moved. </p><p></p><p>He said straightforwardly: "The Xuanhuang Realm and I share the same fate through prosperity and decline. In the past, I was tortured by endless pain, so I had little interest in the mortal world. But now that I've broken free, naturally I won't stand by and watch anymore."</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Stone Tablet's promise, Li Ping only slightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't bring up the previously promised "Xuanhuang Orthodoxy" plan again. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he asked about another matter.</p><p></p><p>"What do you two think of the 'Tiandu Grand Magus'?"</p><p></p><p>"If I contend with the Dharma Transmitter, will he take action?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this question came out, the expressions of the Stone Tablet and Yijue became a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yijue had no intention of speaking, the Stone Tablet took the initiative to answer: "As far as I know, in recent years, the Grand Magus has been recuperating above the Daoyuan State. Worldly affairs..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it's very difficult to draw his attention."</p><p></p><p>"After leaving Tiandu back then, there was no opportunity to return."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet's tone was slightly wistful.</p><p></p><p>"That person Xuantian King, his character can be said to be lofty. You ten sects, for your own selfish desires, colluded with the Grand Magus, an outsider, to destroy the Xuantian Sect. It can be said you were aiding a tiger."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor commented indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet gave a wry smile, not making excuses.</p><p></p><p>Yijue Daoist's expression remained unchanged: "Your Majesty has keen insight. Indeed, the people of the ten sects were biased in that matter back then. But everything is like fleeting clouds, scattering in the wind. The instigators of that year have long been gone. As for Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>"He and the Grand Magus are bound to have a battle. Even without our ten sects, it would still be so. Moreover, according to the accounts of those who personally experienced it back then, Xuantian King's disappearance was quite strange. It wasn't entirely the Grand Magus's doing."</p><p></p><p>"With Xuantian King vanishing, the Xuantian Sect was nothing more than scattered sand. The ten sects inheriting the power was only natural. During the Xuantian Sect era, the oppression on cultivators under heaven was too severe. After the ten sects took power, they mostly adopted a strategy of recuperation, and the various sects big and small also ushered in a rare period of peace."</p><p></p><p>Yijue spoke slowly, not making excuses for the ten sects, but stating simple facts.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet also cooperatively projected the images from that year in the Holy Emperor's peak.</p><p></p><p>Watching the scenes flashing by rapidly, Li Ping slightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Ping said, "The Grand Magus is on the verge of transcending this realm. Although the possibility of him intervening is very low, we still can't let our guard down."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet and Yijue were slightly stunned, not expecting Li Ping to still not change his plans.</p><p></p><p>"But I have my own methods. You need not worry."</p><p></p><p>"How much do you two know about the current Myriad Immortal Alliance?" Li Ping brought up another topic.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the Stone Tablet shook his head slightly: "The headquarters of the Immortal Alliance is located within the Xuantian Mirror Space. It forms its own realm, shielding it from the Creation Stone Tablet's perception. Although I have records of the scenes in some of the Immortal Alliance's states over the years, in fact, I know very little about the core secrets of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"However, the highest echelons of the Immortal Alliance, the Dharma Transmitters, are all surviving cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm from back then. I have their information here. But it's limited to before they hid in the Xuantian Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Myriad Immortal Alliance was re-established, they have gathered the resources of the Xuanhuang Realm to enrich their own exclusive world. With the empowerment of the Dharma Transmitter's secret treasures, their strength must be vastly different compared to back then. The information I provide can only serve as a reference." The Stone Tablet said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>A blue light spot, condensing a large amount of light and shadow information, slowly flew in front of the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing it, countless scenes instantly appeared in Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>"With these, it's enough," he said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yijue Daoist lightly coughed: "The situation inside the Immortal Alliance headquarters..."</p><p></p><p>"Our Duguo Sect actually has some clues."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" This time even the Stone Tablet was a bit surprised. </p><p></p><p>"That can't be right, Yijue. Back when your entire sect was suppressed by the Dharma Transmitters, the current Myriad Immortal Alliance didn't even exist, right?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter was a coincidence. Back when the Immortal Alliance headquarters was being constructed, it just so happened that the space of an Observing World Divine Eye was excavated by them and implanted into the Immortal Alliance headquarters' space."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's not some core critical location, over so many years, it has seen some things after all. It's not that we know nothing at all."</p><p></p><p>As Yijue spoke, the Duguo Book kept flipping like presenting a treasure, and the changing light and shadows slowly condensed into a book page.</p><p></p><p>It slowly floated to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping absorbed this page and quickly browsed the recorded images within.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Are there still Observing World Divine Eyes in the Xuanhuang Realm that I cannot sense?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor spoke again, not praising, but asking this question.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One Refutation Daoist hurriedly expressed his stance: "Apart from the special reason of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror's isolation, the other divine eyes have all been reclaimed by the Holy Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"However..." One Refutation Daoist hesitated a little.</p><p></p><p>"Feel free to speak."</p><p></p><p>"Although the divine eyes have been withdrawn from their original positions, those locations themselves have been imbued with some of the divine eyes' properties due to the prolonged presence of the divine eyes there."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Stone Tablet's expression immediately turned somewhat solemn. </p><p></p><p>One Refutation continued, "In other words, our Crossing Calamity Sect can still perceive events happening near those spots. It's just that the effect is not as good as the observation of the divine eyes."</p><p></p><p>As if to confirm his words, One Refutation flipped through the Crossing Calamity Book and displayed the countless light and shadow records from those different spots all at once.</p><p></p><p>The range was smaller than what the Observing World Divine Eyes controlled. The images were also very blurry.</p><p></p><p>But just as One Refutation said, although the performance declined, the most crucial monitoring function was indeed not diminished.</p><p></p><p>"One Refutation, what exactly is the origin of these Observing World Divine Eyes?" </p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet pondered for a moment, somewhat shocked. He also asked the question in Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>One should know that the divine eyes causing the nature of the space itself to change is not as simple as it seems.</p><p></p><p>If one really takes it seriously, this can already be considered a certain meaning of "going against the principles of heaven and earth".</p><p></p><p>One Refutation Daoist did not conceal it either: "Back when the Heavenly Sword Sect created the world-splitting divine weapon, split the world and left, shaking the universe, I once went to observe the ruins of the Heavenly Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"That world-splitting crack, with shattered space, leads to unknown places. If ordinary cultivators rashly enter it, they can only meet the fate of perishing in body and spirit. But our Crossing Calamity Sect's 'Eternal Calamity World' can temporarily preserve oneself in it."</p><p></p><p>The look in Stone Tablet's eyes instantly became marvelous.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the healing of the splitting crack was faster than I imagined. A power I had never seen before, not belonging to the universe, was actively repairing the wound. Having lost the traces of the world-splitting divine weapon, I also reached my limit of what I could endure, so I had no choice but to return in disappointment..."</p><p></p><p>"These Observing World Divine Eyes... are refined using that kind of power I collected in the world-splitting crack."</p><p></p><p>One Refutation Daoist's words abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>But the scenes described in his words made the other two people in the great hall ponder deeply.</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet suddenly understood: "In that case, these Observing World Divine Eyes were not intentionally refined by you into this form. Rather, it is the manifestation of the essence of their power?"</p><p></p><p>One Refutation Daoist nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, how could our Crossing Calamity Sect suddenly come up with a means that even the Dharma Transmission is helpless against?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's seat suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In Li Ping's perception, this little golden man from the Crossing Calamity Sect did not lie.</p><p></p><p>Then the implication in his words was somewhat terrifying upon careful thought.</p><p></p><p>Does this indicate that there are still higher-level powers, like the Observing World Divine Eyes, monitoring the universe?</p><p></p><p>And what kind of existence is behind it?</p><p></p><p>Is it outside the high walls, or...</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet suddenly seemed to think of something, and his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>But the words reached his mouth, yet he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally noticed Stone Tablet's abnormality, but only locked onto him slightly with his divine sense, without taking the initiative to speak.</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet understood Li Ping's concern and waved his hand: "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>"I just suddenly remembered a legend about the origin of our universe."</p><p></p><p>"That was a piece of information I accidentally found at the bottom layer of the Creation Stone Tablet. It's been at least several hundred thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, it attracted the attention of Li Ping and all the paper men of the Crossing Calamity Sect.</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet frowned, recalling while speaking: "In the era before the calamity descended, when the immortal way was prosperous, among the endless starry sky, our universe appeared a bit unique."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to more frequent exchanges with the upper realm and numerous immortal artifacts, our universe also had an existence called the 'Great Celestial Venerable'."</p><p></p><p>"You should know, once cultivators ascend, they basically cut off all contact with the lower realm. But this Great Celestial Venerable could not only communicate with the upper realm but also bring items from the immortal realm to our universe."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Great Celestial Venerable also had many powers in our universe that were difficult for cultivators to reach..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping shook his head slightly: "There is no memory of this."</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet didn't mind and continued: "But the Great Celestial Venerable at that time was different from the Great Celestial Venerable we know today. Cultivation and strength were not necessarily very high, more like a..."</p><p></p><p>"Official position."</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet pondered for a moment and uttered these two words.</p><p></p><p>"It's like an official position bestowed by the upper realm. As long as one is recognized by the upper realm, even a mortal who can't even catch a chicken can hold the position of Great Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's completely different. Without absolute strength, one cannot gain the recognition of the Dao of Heaven in our universe. One definitely cannot attain the position of Great Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know when the difference between these two began. But what I want to say is..."</p><p></p><p>"The power that manifested the Observing World Divine Eyes in the world-splitting crack may not necessarily come from outside the starry sea. Perhaps it is an inherent property of our universe itself." Stone Tablet glanced at Li Ping again.</p><p></p><p>This viewpoint made even One Refutation of the Crossing Calamity Sect lower his head in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The earliest Great Celestial Venerable could control the world with a mortal body, probably relying on a power similar to the Observing World Divine Eyes hidden deep within our universe. But at some point, the connection between this power and our universe was inexplicably severed."</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet's words reverberated in the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>The ancient secrets involved in this statement were unknown even to Li Ping before this.</p><p></p><p>"Before the immortal path was cut off, there must have been changes in our universe that ordinary cultivators could not perceive," Li Ping said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"It's just my guess. The point is, there's no need to worry too much about powers outside the starry sea. Even if there is external interference, since our universe has existed for so many years and they haven't shown up..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems they are also unable to reach here."</p><p></p><p>Stone Tablet said softly.</p><p></p><p>"I also think so." One Refutation Daoist echoed, recovering his previous unperturbed expression.</p><p></p><p>"The threat of the Dharma Transmission is what we need to face first now. As for these..."</p><p></p><p>"Although we shouldn't be too concerned, we can't let our guard down either."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor still spoke in the same way as when he mentioned the Great Dharma Master of the Heavenly Capital, making One Refutation and Stone Tablet both stunned.</p><p></p><p>"I have my own ways, you don't need to worry."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 773</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"This kind of feeling?" Xu Bai couldn't help but narrow his eyes. </p><p></p><p>In every life he had to create a separate body, he was already used to dividing his mind. But at this moment, as this other entity, almost equivalent to a third separate body in the form of the holy embryo, was created, a completely different feeling welled up in Xu Bai's heart.</p><p></p><p>The wondrous transformation of the true spirit was based on the "Technique of Stealing the Day and Exchanging the Sun" as a blueprint, further extended from it. It could be considered the most orthodox body division technique in the cultivation world. </p><p></p><p>Whether the main body or the separate body, they were under the complete control of one's own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, this "Holy Blood Embryo Technique"...</p><p></p><p>Before the holy embryo separated from the mother's body, it was indeed like a part of one's own body that could be freely controlled at will. </p><p></p><p>But ever since it separated from his back, it seemed to have undergone some profound change.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, another consciousness had split off from himself and existed within the holy embryo.</p><p>Indeed, he still had complete control over the holy embryo.</p><p>But...</p><p>He still felt that something was off.</p><p></p><p>The holy embryo turned around to face Xu Bai directly. </p><p>It was as if there was a mirror between the two of them - except that one was clothed while the other was completely naked.</p><p>From outward appearances, there was not the slightest difference between them.</p><p>But as Xu Bai gazed at it for a long time, he still felt there was some disharmony between them.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly recalled a scene from a horror movie he had watched before transmigrating.</p><p>Late at night, in the bathroom.</p><p>After washing up, he inadvertently glanced at his other self in the mirror.</p><p>To his utter horror, he saw the self in the mirror suddenly giving him a creepy smile.</p><p></p><p>The thought flashed by in an instant.</p><p>In reality, nothing like the holy embryo losing control and smiling at him for no reason had occurred.</p><p>But looking at the holy embryo before him, a thought suddenly emerged in Xu Bai's mind:</p><p></p><p>If the original Li Fan fell, then undoubtedly the separate body Xu Bai would also die.</p><p>But what about this holy embryo?</p><p>Would it also die along with them?</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the "Holy Blood Embryo Technique" was to ensure the continuation of the imperial bloodline.</p><p>So the answer was obvious. It would not.</p><p></p><p>"This is the essential difference between the holy embryo and a separate body," Xu Bai realized.</p><p>"Only almost, but not quite the same."</p><p></p><p>At the same time he understood this, far away in Tianquan State where the original Li Fan was in secluded meditation comprehending the "Boundless Emptiness Technique", he suddenly stopped his movements.</p><p>Recalling the entire journey of his separate body in the empire, an inexplicable expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. So it seems I was still influenced to some degree after all."</p><p></p><p>Looking back from the perspective of the original body,</p><p>The choices made by the separate body Xu Bai seemed a bit too rash.</p><p>Of course, these were still decisions made autonomously by Li Fan himself.</p><p>But in different situations and environments, even the same person could make completely opposite choices.</p><p>What happened to Xu Bai was precisely such a case.</p><p></p><p>If the original had personally experienced these events and faced the red cord and the "Holy Blood Embryo" technique, he would have definitely investigated the red cord first, rather than performing the holy blood embryo first.</p><p>Although he did have the intention to utilize the holy blood embryo technique to create another separate body,</p><p>He would not have been so hasty about it.</p><p>He would have been extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan thought everything through in an instant, although he still did not feel a sense of crisis,</p><p>He could not shake a feeling that something was amiss.</p><p>After weighing it for a long time, the thought of directly "reverting" emerged in his mind.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Should I virtualize the current scene and return to the initial anchor point?"</p><p>The surrounding scene gradually became void, facing the prompt from the Zhen Ren.</p><p>However, a hint of hesitation arose in Li Fan's heart.</p><p>He thought of the hard-won and unresolved [Wuji Lingxu Fa].</p><p>He thought of the unintegrated discs of separation.</p><p>He thought of the still undiscovered method to completely shield the perception of the Tianxuan Baojian using the Termination Stone Plate.</p><p>He thought of not having yet used the Yao Wang Zhen Ding to break out of the Xuanhuang Realm and explore the Xianxu.</p><p>If he were to leave, it would truly be reluctant.</p><p>After a long hesitation, Li Fan became as still as a stone statue, completely motionless.</p><p>The intense mental struggle in his mind was unceasing, and Li Fan's body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p>"Should I virtualize the current scene and return to the initial anchor point?"</p><p>The prompt from the Zhen Ren came again.</p><p>Li Fan's expression was unsettled.</p><p>Ultimately, however, he chose to decline.</p><p>In an instant, the originally virtualized scene became real again.</p><p>The Li Fan who made this choice seemed to have experienced a great battle in a flash.</p><p>He almost collapsed to the ground, his entire body drenched in sweat.</p><p>However, his bodily instinct made Li Fan dissatisfied with the decision he had made.</p><p>After a brief rest, Li Fan opened the Zhen Ren panel again.</p><p>"Should I virtualize the current scene and return to the initial anchor point?"</p><p>The prompt from the Zhen Ren sounded as reliable as ever, but it no longer sounded as pleasant to Li Fan's ears.</p><p>Any action a person takes is driven by their desires.</p><p>At this moment, the desire to use the Zhen Ren in Li Fan, who had opened the panel for the second time, was weaker than before.</p><p>Thoughts of hesitation, concern, and reluctance came one after another.</p><p>This time, the struggle lasted for less time.</p><p>Li Fan ultimately closed the Zhen Ren panel.</p><p>Phew...</p><p>It was as if he had lost all his strength in an instant.</p><p>After a long time, Li Fan's hands barely supported his body, and a strange emotion flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He began his third attempt.</p><p>The result was obvious.</p><p>This time, his decision-making speed became even faster.</p><p>In just a few breaths, he had closed the Zhen Ren panel.</p><p>"The Xuanhuang Xian Heart Mantra..."</p><p>The fourth time, Li Fan silently activated this supreme immortal art that had saved him from danger many times.</p><p>But even as he opened the Zhen Ren panel, before the various binding things could interfere, he had already withdrawn on his own.</p><p>The Xian Heart Mantra was cultivated by reversing the heart of the cultivator.</p><p>Now, Li Fan wanted to use the Zhen Ren to avoid disaster.</p><p>Under the operation of the Xian Heart Mantra, the thought of using the Zhen Ren instantly became nourishment for the expansion of his divine consciousness.</p><p>The defeated Li Fan stood silently in the secret room, not speaking for a long time.</p><p>This time, Li Fan no longer struggled.</p><p>Instead, he closed his eyes and began to think calmly.</p><p>At this moment, Li Fan faced the most dangerous situation since his transmigration.</p><p>Because the layout of this world had not yet reached the time of harvest, he had developed a sense of "reluctance".</p><p>Under the influence of a certain power, this emotion was amplified to the extreme, causing him to voluntarily refuse to use the Zhen Ren.</p><p>Even now, Li Fan still felt that he had no problem.</p><p>He was just a little too greedy.</p><p>But Li Fan was ultimately someone who valued his life.</p><p>As someone with a firm determination for longevity, he also realized that if he could not use the Zhen Ren, then in this perilous Xuanhuang Realm, he would be at risk of falling at any moment.</p>

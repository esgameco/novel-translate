        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1323: The Dim Clustered Peaks</p><p></p><p>"There is a distinction between immortals and mortals. Based on our own abilities alone, it is impossible for us to reach those heights. That is why we need to seek external forces. The Merchant Immortal Boat did so in the past, and now our Profound Immortal Boat must do the same!" Zhong Daogang smiled slightly, not explaining in great detail, but speaking somewhat vaguely.</p><p></p><p>"External forces? The true immortal talisman characters? Is this the reason you want to join forces with us from Great Inception?" Li Fan asked directly. </p><p></p><p>"Yes...and no," Zhong Daogang's expression was inscrutable.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you have seen the weakness in the high wall and proven the sincerity of our Immortal Boat. Why don't we return to a safe place first before further discussing? This is not a place to linger..."</p><p></p><p>Before Zhong Daogang could finish, the high point of the remnant realm's great wall where they stood slightly shook. </p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but look "down".</p><p></p><p>In the darkest star sea below the clustered peaks, ripples inexplicably arose, like waves on a cloud sea, endlessly undulating through the star sea.</p><p></p><p>"It's a reverberation of star forces!" The elders of the Immortal Boat all slightly changed color.</p><p></p><p>"This eruption is of no small scale, it may not subside for a while. It's best we leave early," Zhong Daogang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gazed into the distance. Although due to the distortion of perspective he could not see specific things in the star sea, Li Fan could vaguely sense the source of this reverberation of star forces.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the remnant realm's great wall, like a breakwater, had formed a gap due to the disappearance of one of the remnant realms. The residual true immortal forces accumulated below the high wall found an outlet to vent through this gap, surging downwards.</p><p></p><p>Such an event had also occurred in his previous life, caused by his holy embryo avatar destroying many remnant realm fragments that the Celestial Doctor had planted in the depths of the Profound Yellow Realm, forcing it to re-acquire realms to replenish itself.</p><p></p><p>But in this life, there was no such trigger. Why was the remnant realm's great wall in turmoil?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be some disturbance caused by Elder Yin and the others?"</p><p></p><p>"They shouldn't be so reckless..."  A flicker of doubt flashed across Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, the Immortal Boat elders had already brought Li Fan down from the "heights" of the star sea.</p><p></p><p>The scenery changed rapidly, the vast dark sea disappearing from view. The remnant realm's great wall still stood towering, the previous "ascended perspective" seeming like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the act of ascending was no easy feat even for the Immortal Boat elders. In a moment, all the elders were flustered and sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang's expression was grave as he looked towards the remnant realm's great wall in the distance, the source of the disturbance. But in the end he did not choose to investigate further, instead organizing and urging everyone to leave.</p><p></p><p>On the return to the Immortal Boat, it was still Li Fan condensing his golden sword avatar to lead the way. This time, the Immortal Boat group truly experienced just how fast this sword avatar could move.</p><p></p><p>When everyone reached the location of the Profound Immortal Boat, the reverberating star forces had not even reached there yet.</p><p></p><p>The elders looked at Li Fan with a different expression.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, why don't you enter the Immortal Boat first, then we can discuss the follow-up cooperation plan?" Xian Dao Sheng smiled and pointed to the open Immortal Boat entrance.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan shook his head firmly: "No need. I'm afraid I still need to return to Great Inception."</p><p></p><p>The elders' expressions immediately became somewhat subtle.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained calm and said proudly: "What? It seems you all have some objections?"</p><p></p><p>"This is different from what was agreed upon before. Friend, you've learned the highest secrets of our Immortal Boat's plan and now you want to just leave..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I think you don't need to waste your efforts. You've all seen the Immortal-Severing Sword. If I use it, who among you can stop me?" Li Fan said unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elders could only remain silent. Indeed, it was even faster than the spread of the remnant true immortal forces in the star sea. And it could even bring multiple people along...</p><p></p><p>Such an escape technique was indeed beyond their comprehension.</p><p></p><p>However, it was absolutely impossible for them to simply let Li Fan leave so easily.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere gradually became tense, until Li Fan took the initiative to break the deadlock: "Why must you all be like this? I'm just going and coming back. You know my concerns - it's just that you're afraid I'll reveal the weakness in the high wall. You really don't need to worry!"</p><p></p><p>"This time when I go back, I plan to persuade them again and see if Great Inception is willing to change their mind. Having personally witnessed that there is indeed such a weakness in the high wall, my persuasiveness will be much stronger. If my master and the others still refuse to take the risk, I naturally won't reveal this secret. If by some chance I can persuade them..."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, we'll have to cooperate anyway, so it doesn't matter if it's revealed or not."</p><p></p><p>"I'm nearing my great limit. Having personally seen the only opportunity to cross the high wall before my death, how could I give it up?" Li Fan said with gravitas.</p><p></p><p>Then, he cupped his hands and surprisingly maneuvered his sword avatar to break through the encirclement of the Immortal Boat elders and leave.</p><p></p><p>His speed was so fast that even Zhong Daogang did not have time to react before his figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is really quite troublesome," Xian Dao Sheng stroked his beard with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"There's no way around it. Possessing the true immortal talisman characters, with transcendent formations, and an unpredictable escape technique. On top of that, he's nearing his great limit and has no fear of death...it's best not to make an enemy of such a person so easily."</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate that he doesn't have many years left to live. Otherwise, our Immortal Boat may not have any peace in the future."</p><p></p><p>"I think what he said was correct. If Great Inception is unwilling to participate in the plan due to the prophecy of disaster from the realm-protecting immortal artifact, then our Immortal Boat is their only hope. After all, relying solely on himself to leap across the high wall is clearly unrealistic..."</p><p></p><p>As the Immortal Boat elders debated, Li Fan had already returned to the border of the remnant realm's great wall. </p><p></p><p>The reverberating star forces raged like an rising storm.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sword avatar Li Fan had left here was flickering like a candle in the wind.</p><p></p><p>He shot out a golden light to stabilize it. Li Fan searched for traces of Qiao Gong and the others, but found no sign of them.</p><p></p><p>The secret markings they had agreed to leave behind while searching for suitable world fragments had all been scattered by the reverberating star forces.</p><p></p><p>"They've all lost contact?"  Li Fan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the Horizon Within a Hair's Breadth grand formation wasn't too severely damaged."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan floated to the formation and reinforced it again, giving up on searching for them.</p><p></p><p>"I can only hope they take care of themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Once the storm gradually subsides, if they are safe and sound, they should return on their own."</p><p></p><p>Passing through the great...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan returned to the Xuanhuang Realm. As expected, he found that some remnant Celestial powers had dissipated out following the formation's patterns. After setting up a net of origin force essence for double containment on this side of the great formation, he finally made the fluctuations brought by the echoing starry forces disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Among these people, if anyone is most likely to have caused this anomaly in the star sea, it should be the Celestial Yin."  </p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the somewhat strange expression on Celestial Yin's face when he first arrived at the Remnant Wall.</p><p></p><p>"He must have seen scenes from the memories of the world ghosts he had absorbed before."</p><p></p><p>"But Celestial Yin is definitely not a rash person. If it was just that, he would not have recklessly disturbed the Remnant Wall fragments without considering the consequences..."</p><p></p><p>"The secret behind this should be revealed when Celestial Yin returns. I have a premonition that he is still alive in some corner of the Remnant Wall."</p><p></p><p>"He may have even encountered a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's related to the formation of the Remnant Wall?" Li Fan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>In the Darkest Star Sea, not only was the origin of the towering wall unknown, but the formation of the Remnant Wall beneath it had also remained an unsolved mystery all along.</p><p></p><p>The countless cultivation worlds that were destroyed in the star sea back then not only did not converge at the Celestial Ruins, but instead accumulated and connected into one at the foot of the towering wall.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's view, what maintained the Remnant Wall was a mighty force no less powerful than Celestial remnants, yet beyond his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that Li Fan's experience was far beyond that of ordinary cultivators now.</p><p></p><p>Through countless reincarnations, he could explore recklessly and relentlessly each time. In the Xuanhuang Realm and the Darkest Star Sea, there were hardly any blind spots left for him.</p><p></p><p>The mighty force sustaining the Remnant Wall was one of them.</p><p></p><p>The depths of the Dark Sea was another.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Great Xuan, Li Fan possessed the sturdy body of a robust Ghost Tribe member with a strand of divine sense.</p><p></p><p>He then gathered the Ghost Tribe and initiated the ritual to enter the Dark Sea, slowly walking into it.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sea was endlessly pitch-black.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, it would naturally be a perilous dead land. But Li Fan had traversed it countless times and was very familiar with it, passing through without any alarms.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the ancient corpses of the Xuanhuang Realm lying on the ground, he single-mindedly pressed forward.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at the core of the Spirit Ascension Formation, a transparent observation deck from which he could overlook the outlines of the Celestial corpses in the entire Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Finally stopping, he did not go deeper to directly face the lingering will to survive of the Celestials hidden below.</p><p></p><p>Gazing down at the clusters of accumulated power, Li Fan felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, my feeling was not wrong!"</p><p></p><p>A ray of light flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and the scene he had comprehended while overlooking the Dark Sea from the high vantage of the towering wall not long ago appeared simultaneously before his eyes, gradually overlapping with the sight of the Dark Sea storm gathering.</p><p></p><p>It was not a specific scene, but rather a similarity.</p><p></p><p>And it was because of the convergence of energy that this place in the Dark Sea had also protruded upwards considerably.</p><p></p><p>"This place should be the many peaks I saw from that high point."</p><p></p><p>"The energy converging here is even 'higher' compared to the entire Xuanhuang Realm. It's even superior to the position I reached by relying on the advantage of the Remnant Wall at the foot of the towering wall!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered as his thoughts raced: "Not only is the Spirit Ascension Formation of the Dark Sea established on the remains of Celestials..."</p><p></p><p>"It's also because nearly ten thousand years have passed since the establishment of this great formation!"</p><p></p><p>"The establishment of the great formation back then was for the Celestial Heavenly King to lead the Xuanhuang Realm across the towering wall. However, due to various accidents, the Celestial Heavenly King mysteriously disappeared, and the plan fell apart midway."</p><p></p><p>"But the accumulation of energy in the Dark Sea did not stop because of this. Instead, it has been ongoing for nearly ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Over these ten thousand years, the star sea has undergone many dramatic changes. However, the 'height' of the towering wall confining the star sea has not actually changed. In other words..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned the Dark Sea below again.</p><p></p><p>Those gathering storm clouds transformed into mountain peaks in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Each one floated above the Darkest Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>Facing the towering wall from afar.</p><p></p><p>"The heights that the Celestial Boat people view as treasures, even if they can only reach with external assistance, are commonplace in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Standing here and then crossing the towering wall horizontally would be much easier than from other places."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing to worry about is possibly provoking the will to survive of the Celestials here..."</p><p></p><p>"But as long as I'm careful, there shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>Maintaining the overlooking perspective was a bit strenuous for Li Fan. He took a long breath and returned to his normal state.</p><p></p><p>He began to ponder the proper way to utilize this wealth left behind by the Celestial Heavenly King.</p><p></p><p>"Using the high point as merely a stepping stone is definitely not enough. I still need more data. Ideally, actual result verifications..."</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Ascension Formation, as part of the great formation for crossing the star void, involves traversing the towering wall. The Beast's Eye is the same. Looked at this way, the Beast's Eye is probably not just for navigation and locking on targets..."</p><p></p><p>"What it sees may also be the 'height of the towering wall', an elevated dimensional perspective similar to what I saw before." Li Fan had a vague realization.</p><p></p><p>Controlling the Ghost Tribe member's body, Li Fan stayed in the main control center of the Spirit Ascension Formation for a full seven days.</p><p></p><p>It was only when that Ghost Tribe member's body could no longer withstand the dense power of the Dark Sea and was completely devoured by the darkness that the perception disappeared and he stopped.</p><p></p><p>In the small world of the Great Xuan, Li Fan slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense scanned the heavens and earth, familiarizing himself with the elevated dimensional perspective before returning to the normal perspective. Yet Li Fan felt slightly uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, breaking through the height limit allowed one to ascend to immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Later, the path to immortality was severed, yet the towering wall existed..."</p><p></p><p>"But perhaps the principles behind these two are somewhat similar."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the myriad beings in the Great Xuan, a profound realization welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the 'height' of the towering wall may surpass even the 'height' of immortality. After all, the Celestial Heavenly King who could ascend to immortality back then was still unable to cross the towering wall."  </p><p></p><p>"Changing perspectives, if one could leap across the towering wall now, then perhaps in the past, one could have ascended to immortality as well."</p><p></p><p>At this thought, Li Fan became slightly dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Immortality..."</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of years had passed, and circumstances had changed. Clearly the same realm, yet one led to the attainment of the Dao and ascension to immortality, while the other resulted in being locked below the towering wall.</p><p></p><p>Even if one could leap across, there were still unknown risks to face beyond the towering wall.</p><p></p><p>"The greater path is easier, immortality is not for immortals."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only sigh with this realization.</p>

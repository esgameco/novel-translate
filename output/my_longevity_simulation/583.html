        <h1>Chapter 583</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"No matter how you put it, they are great warriors who died gloriously for the Immortal Alliance. How could those shameless people above allow them to desecrate their bodies?"</p><p></p><p>The lazy cultivator was a bit indignant: "How can it be groundless? I saw it with my own eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Debiao, that kid, relies on the appointment from the Immortal Alliance and openly collected the corpses with a group of people. The storage rings on their bodies, usable magical treasures, were all secretly taken by them!"</p><p></p><p>"I even heard that the remaining golden dan and cave fragments inside the corpses were all dug out by these people!"</p><p></p><p>"You also came down from the battlefield. The battle in Tian Ling State was so fierce, those bodies were almost all incomplete and deformed, how could they be treated properly? Didn't they directly burn them until nothing was left but powder as proof! Who would find out?"</p><p></p><p>"'The people do not report to officials.' Ordinary cultivators are mostly loners. If they die, they die, who would really care..."</p><p></p><p>The lazy cultivator kept on talking incessantly and bluntly, while the old Sun next to him gradually became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly feeling a chill rising behind him, the lazy cultivator saw the expression on Old Sun's face and for some reason, his heart trembled, subconsciously closing his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Only when the other party's gaze finally moved away from him, the lazy cultivator felt relieved as if a burden had been lifted off his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Accustomed to their usual interactions, he almost forgot about the legend surrounding this man in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Old Sun's name was Sun Qi. He was a local cultivator in Tian Ling State, and he was drafted at the beginning of the great war.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was luck or some other reason, countless infant stage cultivators fell during the war.</p><p></p><p>His small golden dan stubbornly survived despite all odds.</p><p></p><p>A person who fought his way out of a sea of blood and corpses always had a chilling aura about him. Normally hidden, once he truly got angry, it would be terrifying. Seeing this, the lazy cultivator tactfully stopped provoking this big shot.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan, who was hiding in the air observing, saw Sun Qi's gaze subtly sweep over his hidden location.</p><p></p><p>His interest in this man grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Instantly activating the killing intent without form, targeting the other party.</p><p></p><p>Watching Sun Qi's face filled with suspicion, suddenly jumping and checking around but finding nothing, Li Fan couldn't help but smile faintly.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring him for now, Li Fan quietly flew to a collapsed mountain range that seemed to have been crushed from the sky, full of dead silence.</p><p></p><p>As usual, he delved into the underground and excavated a hidden room.</p><p></p><p>After sealing it, Li Fan closed his eyes to check his own status.</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p></p><p>Cultivation Realm: Early Infant Transformation Stage</p><p></p><p>Biological Age: 31/999 (Heaven's Curse)</p><p></p><p>Mental Age: 1332/9999</p><p></p><p>Transformation Energy Progress: 200%</p><p></p><p>Anchoring Energy Progress: 0%</p><p></p><p>Current Anchoring Points: 3</p><p></p><p>Current Available Anchoring Points: 1</p><p></p><p>Bound Items: "Thousand Machinery Jade Realm Gold Chapter," Taiyan Boat, Broken Stopping Stone Tablet, Essence Blood of Ten Thousand People, Transformation Dao Stone</p><p></p><p>Techniques: Profound Yellow Refining Heart Mantra, Cloud Water Illusionary Dream Skill, Body Transformation Dao, Wonderful Profound Spiritual Transformation, Furnace of All Phenomena Skill, Creation and Transformation Furnace Skill, Sitting on the Mountain Technique</p><p></p><p>Divine Abilities: Chaotic, Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword, Life and Death Chain, Formless Killing Intent, Binding Insects, Sword of Wandering Clouds, Overturning Palm</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly exhaled. He felt tremendous and pure vitality surging out from all parts of his body, nourishing his flesh.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy was continuous and endless.</p><p></p><p>In the Dantian, where the golden dan was originally located, the outline of five intertwined cave realms could vaguely be seen.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Infant Transformation Realm. Once advanced, it completely changes everything!"</p><p></p><p>To test the gap between his current stage and the golden dan stage, Li Fan unleashed his strongest divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Using his hand as a pen, he wrote in the air.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he sensed the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>By writing the upper half of the word "chaos" on the left side, he still had some strength left.</p><p></p><p>The continuous influx of spiritual power and vitality from the cave realm supported the consumption of the chaotic word technique, preventing his body from collapsing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to write, finishing half in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, each vibrating frequency of the grains was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Appearing uniform but chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, then his suspended finger in the air suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"I have figured it out."</p><p></p><p>"Entering the Infant Transformation Realm, I don't need to worry about physical damage anymore. I can finally use this killing move without any reservations."</p><p></p><p>"However, I still can't use it consecutively without care, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>He felt a slight tremor in his body's five-element cave realm, and a hint of seriousness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The might of the word 'chaos' is truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"As the caster, possessing the five-element cave realm, I will also suffer from such backlash. It's likely that an ordinary infant stage cultivator would have their cave realm immediately collapse with just a little contact."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if a Nascent Soul stage cultivator can withstand it."</p><p></p><p>The chaotic word technique was comprehended by Li Fan in the white mist domain.</p><p></p><p>Profound and complex, as his cultivation deepened, he felt the extraordinary nature of the word 'chaos.'</p><p></p><p>"Even my crude imitation has such power."</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know how terrifying the true 'chaos' word technique is."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have exceeded the limit of what an ordinary cultivator can master. Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he suppressed his thoughts and focused on the "Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword" in the Real Divine Abilities panel.</p><p></p><p>The "Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword" was a divine ability Li Fan derived from observing the foundation of heaven and earth, weaving together the five-element cave realm, combined with the scene of the unity of the five elements from the previous life, gaining insight from it.</p><p></p><p>It integrated the essence of the "Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword," not only possessing powerful destructive force but also capable of creating vitality out of nothing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually picked up a reptile on the verge of death due to the aftermath of the chaotic word technique, holding it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>A gentle milky white light surged from his palm.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, the reptile bathed in the white light miraculously regained vitality.</p><p></p><p>It struggled and turned its body, hastily flying out of Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't pay any more attention to the rescued creature; he simply muttered thoughtfully, "Near-death revival, it's just a minor skill. Other medical skills can easily achieve this."</p><p></p><p>"The true power of the 'Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword' lies in creation."</p><p></p><p>Taking out a spiritual stone from his storage ring, he held it in his left hand.</p><p></p><p>His right hand emitted a continuous radiance.</p><p></p><p>After a while, when the light dissipated, a spiritual stone that looked identical to the one in his left hand slowly appeared.</p>

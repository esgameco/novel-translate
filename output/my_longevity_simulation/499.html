        <h1>Chapter 499</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, the fact that he served as the acting island lord was known to only a very small number of people.</p><p></p><p>So when the news came, everyone was surprised.</p><p></p><p>They felt somewhat dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Although Master Li had the ability to deduce the secrets of the heavens, he was only at the Golden Core cultivation level. There were many Nascent Soul cultivators still alive in the Misty Cloud Sea, so what made you qualified to become the island lord?</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows that Master Li is wealthy. Could it be that he bought his way into this position?</p><p></p><p>And being so ostentatious, what's with holding a rebuilding ceremony...</p><p></p><p>Various thoughts arose.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what, the position of acting island lord was issued and accredited by the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. Even if these people were somewhat disdainful in their hearts, they did not dare to disobey.</p><p></p><p>So most people held the attitude of watching a good show, waiting for the day to come.</p><p></p><p>Soon, seven days passed, and a group of cultivators from the Misty Cloud Sea gathered at the former site of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island.</p><p></p><p>Even some members who were not within the system heard about this and hurried over to join in the fun.</p><p></p><p>People chatted with each other, looking at the deep hole in the sea, reminiscing about the past of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island, all feeling various emotions.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more cultivators arrived to witness the occasion.</p><p></p><p>But the main figure, Master Li, never showed up.</p><p></p><p>So some whispers began to arise among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a brilliant light flew in from a distance, catching everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"In celebration of our friend Li Fan ascending to the position of acting island lord of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island, the Heavenly Luck Prefecture and the Divine Oracle Sect present a copy of the 'Heavenly Luck Dan Manual' as a token of goodwill!"</p><p></p><p>The light stopped above the heads of the crowd, revealing a handsome young Daoist holding a whisk.</p><p></p><p>He sang out loud and threw a book towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The book unfolded in the wind, amidst the exclamations of the onlookers, it quickly transformed into a dragon, circling in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Colorful light continuously bloomed from the book, and then the 'Heavenly Luck Dan Manual' disappeared before the eyes of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist bowed slightly towards the void, then ignored the people below and flew away as a streak of light.</p><p></p><p>"Friends, look, I always feel that there are some differences here compared to before!"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, it is said that this 'Heavenly Luck Dan Manual' can condense luck and change fate. With the protection of such a treasure, this reconstruction of the Immortal City is bound to be a great success!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow... who is this Divine Oracle Sect member? How can such a treasure be given out so casually?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present discussed one after another.</p><p></p><p>Before they could calm down, another streak of light came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"In celebration..."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Luck Prefecture, Daoist Jingxuan, presents the 'Sea-Ruling Blue Bull' as a gesture of goodwill!"</p><p></p><p>A young Daoist led a blue bull to appear in front of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The blue bull gave a light call, and the earth and sky changed, instantly growing to the size of towering mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Moo!"</p><p></p><p>The roar of the blue bull echoed through the Misty Cloud Sea, then it turned into a streak of blue light and dispersed to different parts of the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! What a generous gift! With this treasure, the Misty Cloud Sea will be calm for at least three years!" A knowledgeable cultivator couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>"What relationship does this Daoist Jingxuan have with Island Lord Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was full of doubts and uncertainties, and more streaks of light arrived one after another, presenting various congratulatory gifts.</p><p></p><p>Guangwu Prefecture, Guangwu Province, Huifu Song...</p><p></p><p>They were all powerful cultivators from the heart of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"These people are all at least at the Nascent Soul stage..." After some investigation, the cultivators present couldn't help but feel amazed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that our Island Lord has a deep background, no wonder he can take on such a heavy responsibility with only Golden Core cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe not, these people didn't actually come in person, they just sent gifts through their subordinates. It's very likely that our Island Lord paid others to come forward, acting like he's more powerful than he really is!" However, there were still people holding different opinions.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the continuous discussions, the procession of gift-giving lights gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Just when everyone thought that Li Fan, the Island Lord, was about to make his appearance, a magnificent flying ship broke through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-six Nascent Soul cultivators led the way, and a young cultivator dressed in white, with handsome features and extraordinary aura, slowly descended into the scene.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshu Prefecture, Dantai Can, congratulates Island Lord Li Fan!"</p><p></p><p>The thirty-six Nascent Soul cultivators all spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>The Misty Cloud Sea cultivators were shocked and speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Dantai Can? The Dantai Family!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who knew about the background of the Dantai family couldn't help but be shaken.</p><p></p><p>Watching from a flying boat in the distance, Zhou Kebao stood up in disbelief when he saw this scene.</p><p></p><p>"Dantai Can? How did he come here?" There was complete incomprehension in his eyes. "This makes no sense at all?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, a hint of shock crossed Zhou Kebao's face.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they all worked together to set up this situation?" In doubt, Zhou Kebao took out a communication talisman and quickly reported this sudden turn of events to his associates.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With Dantai Can's appearance, the atmosphere had reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>At this point, it was also time for Li Fan to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The deafening sound kept coming from a distance, as if some primordial beast was rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Look! What is that?" Some sharp-eyed cultivators followed the direction of the sound and sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>A towering giant stone man appeared on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the Misty Cloud Sea, with the water only reaching up to his shins.</p><p></p><p>Although his body was extremely large, his speed was incredibly fast.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the sea, each step he took caused ripples in the Misty Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye, the stone man was already close to the former site of the Ten Thousand Immortals Island.</p><p></p><p>The bewildered cultivators, thinking it might be another sudden attack by the Five Elders, became nervous.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the aura emanating from the giant stone man, the cultivators all turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Nascent Soul stage?"</p><p></p><p>As the stone man drew closer, under the immense pressure, some cultivators couldn't help but take out their treasures for defense.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, hundreds of cultivators led by Gao Yuan, He Zhenghao, and Zhou Qing'ang seemed to have rehearsed hundreds of times and flew out in unison.</p><p></p><p>They respectfully bowed to the giant stone man: "Welcome, Island Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"HAHAHA, no need for formalities, everyone!" A hearty laughter came from the head of the stone man.</p><p></p><p>It was then that everyone realized, standing on top of the stone man of Nascent Soul cultivation, was a cultivator!</p><p></p><p>And this person was Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>A Nascent Soul Immortal Lord, able to have Li Fan of the Golden Core cultivation level trample underfoot.</p><p></p><p>This was something that couldn't be achieved through mere contributions.</p><p></p><p>Able to invite a group of cultivators from the heartland of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and even have Nascent Soul cultivators willing to be trampled underfoot by him.</p><p></p><p>Who exactly is the Island Lord Li Fan?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the cultivators from the Misty Cloud Sea present, even Dantai Can, who had been calm on the flying boat, couldn't help but feel some fluctuations in his eyes when he looked up at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 762</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Shao Feng's efficiency in handling matters was truly unprecedented. He summoned a female cultivator wearing a light purple long dress and gave her instructions, which didn't take long.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan soon learned that he had become an intermediate noble guest of the Xuan Family. His initial merit level in the Wan Xian Alliance was raised to level thirty-five. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, he unlocked a new privilege: once every hundred years, he could use the Tian Xuan Mirror for free to deduce and enhance one of his divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Power unused is power wasted. Brother Li can take this opportunity to further enhance the power of his 'Extracting Life's Thread' divine ability. Although it already feels very powerful in practice, it certainly hasn't reached perfection yet and still has room for improvement," said Shao Feng, moving his body around, causing a rattling noise from his bones. Seeing Li Fan seemed a bit dazed, he reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Once you make further progress, we'll have another invigorating battle!" Among his fellow cultivators, there were few whose cultivation progress could keep up with his. They would soon fall behind, no longer a match for him. Qualified opponents like Li Fan were rare.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan could even occasionally surprise him, which made Shao Feng very satisfied with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what the difference is between this ability to deduce divine abilities and the one provided in the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror? Previously in the 'Sitting and Discussing the Dao' realm, I also tried to use the power of the Tian Xuan Mirror to deduce the continuation of divine abilities. But the cost was too high, simply a bottomless pit. I had to give up halfway," Li Fan said, looking at the prompt from the small Tian Xuan Mirror in the field.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror is just a branch of the Tian Xuan. Although its various functions are already marvelous for ordinary cultivators, they are still much weaker compared to the true power of the Tian Xuan Mirror," Shao Feng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"For the same divine ability, the continuation deduced by the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror and the main Tian Xuan Mirror, though not worlds apart, definitely has a qualitative difference."</p><p></p><p>"However..." Shao Feng's smile suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"This is only the current difference between the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror and the main Tian Xuan Mirror. After some time..."</p><p></p><p>"It may not be the same story."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps then, any branch mirror in the world will be no different from its main body," Shao Feng's expression became solemn, as if recalling something.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan understood the implication in Shao Feng's words. His heart started pounding.</p><p></p><p>So this level 35 merit privilege was actually using the main Tian Xuan Mirror itself to deduce the continuation of divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>Didn't that mean he would finally have another chance to see the real Tian Xuan Mirror?</p><p></p><p>The last time he saw it was during the training process for building the Tian Xuan Lock Spirit.</p><p></p><p>In that vast space filled with black and white lines, the students, including Li Fan, witnessed the birth and sealing of the "Tian Xuan Newborn Mirror" up close.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, the Tian Xuan Mirror has completed its initial metamorphosis. Who knows what other changes lie within," Li Fan's thoughts wavered.</p><p></p><p>By this time, Shao Feng had come out of his contemplation and added a reminder: "As for that ability to deduce divine abilities in the 'Sitting and Discussing the Dao' realm..."</p><p></p><p>"You'd better not try it in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Even I only dared to take a chance at it when I was young and reckless. Now that I'm more clearheaded, I'm not willing to waste effort on it," Shao Feng rarely said such a thing.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Some sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan was slightly taken aback: "Why is that so? Is there really something in this world that even Brother Shuo cannot afford?"</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng waved his hand and explained, "There is a difference between theoretical and practical applications of divine abilities in this world."</p><p></p><p>"When the Heavenly Profound Mirror and the Heavenly Profound Tome were used to deduce divine abilities, they set a possible upper limit. For example, your [Unraveling Threads and Severing Life], when unleashed from the Nascent Soul realm, can at most harm cultivators at the Divinity Manifestation Realm. It can also have some impact on Dao Consummation cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"However, in the face of the Immortal Emperor, it will definitely become ineffective. This is the limit of most divine abilities in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Even for those with extraordinary talents, they cannot create divine abilities that can threaten the Immortal Emperor with a cultivation level lower than the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng paused for a moment and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, he suddenly said, "Then, theoretically speaking, do divine abilities that can affect the Immortal Emperor, with a cultivation level below the Immortal Realm, really exist?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be such things in the world," Shuo Feng's eyes flashed with longing.</p><p></p><p>"But that may already be at the level of legendary immortal techniques. Not only us, even the Heavenly Profound Mirror would find it extremely difficult to deduce the existence of such a level. In addition to consuming a large portion of its own computing power, it may also require a touch of luck to succeed."</p><p></p><p>"The deductive function of [Sitting and Discussing the Dao] has no upper limit set. As long as it is theoretically possible, there is a probability that it can be deduced. Therefore, the contribution required for each deduction is unimaginably huge. The further it goes, the more so."</p><p></p><p>"And the result..." Shuo Feng smiled with a touch of sarcasm, "Since the establishment of the Sitting and Discussing the Dao section, it has attracted countless gamblers who have thrown themselves into it without hesitation, even at the cost of their family's wealth. The Heavenly Profound Mirror has already deduced an uncountable number of times."</p><p></p><p>"But no one has ever been successful."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan was dumbfounded and shook his head repeatedly, "I never thought there was such a hidden secret here. If I had known earlier, I would never have tried my luck."</p><p></p><p>"I knew I was not a lucky person when I was almost killed by your sword at our first meeting," Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng recalled their initial encounter and found it amusing, bursting into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Shuo Brother, do you have the Heavenly Profound Mirror with you?" Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard a rumor that the Immortal Alliance is pushing for all cultivators to generate their own Profound Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloom flashed across Shuo Feng's face.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Profound Mirror..." </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I might be the first in the entire Myriad Immortal Alliance to wear one."</p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about it! Just thinking about it makes me feel annoyed!"</p><p></p><p>"Li Brother, let's have another battle!"</p><p></p><p>With that, numerous sword lights flew out from Shuo Feng, slashing fiercely towards Li Fan, containing a hint of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled, and he quickly focused his attention to respond without any carelessness.</p><p></p><p>In the Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>Fu Ming Zai, who had been sent out to recruit disciples from the outside world, had now completed his mission.</p><p></p><p>On the plaza of the sect's main hall, there stood a group of children around five or six years old.</p><p></p><p>They timidly looked around, their faces filled with fear. </p><p></p><p>Many of them even started to wail loudly, triggering a chain reaction.</p><p></p><p>The scene descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fu, are these the 'promising talents' you've brought back?" someone asked.</p>

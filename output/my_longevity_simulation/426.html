            <p>Using only half a day's effort, the price of the "Wugu Obsidian" directly doubled. Even due to the relationship of supply not meeting demands, the upward trend still showed no sign of stopping.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?" </p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao looked at Li Fan in shock again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, had a serious expression on his face, calculating again without paying attention to him.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao had to look back at the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The number representing his contribution was constantly jumping.</p><p></p><p>318,000.</p><p></p><p>328,600.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>His wealth was visibly increasing at a staggering speed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao pinched himself hard to make sure he wasn't dreaming.</p><p></p><p>The lifelong wish, unexpectedly achieved so easily like this?</p><p></p><p>The previous 150,000 had taken him several decades of hardships.</p><p></p><p>Yet the latter 150,000 had taken less than five days.</p><p></p><p>Is this the investment method of Senior Li Fan?</p><p></p><p>If only I could learn this skill...</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt his blood boiling with excitement and eagerness.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but want to show off to his group of brothers immediately.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Li Fan's voice rang out, pouring cold water on him.</p><p></p><p>"Take your profits and sell it now!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was stunned on the spot, "But the price is still rising now..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced over.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's breath hitched.</p><p></p><p>With deep reluctance, he sold all the "Wugu Obsidian" in his hand at the price of 630 per catty.</p><p></p><p>333,900 contribution points!</p><p></p><p>"I'm successful!"</p><p></p><p>The suddenly rich He Zhenghao stared intently at the Tianxuan Mirror, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he was already fantasizing about how to spend this large sum of money.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, easy come, easy go. You don't believe it even after saying it." Li Fan's voice came, interrupting He Zhenghao's reveries.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the bet is over, you lost. Quickly switch to another door technique!" </p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao woke up.</p><p></p><p>Opening the door technique exchange list, as he looked at the "Mountain and River Hidden Dragon Technique" that he had longed for, he suddenly remembered the over 300,000 contribution points, half of which was given to him by Li Fan's guidance.</p><p></p><p>So he cautiously asked, "Senior, what about the 100,000..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand impatiently, saying, "That profit came from your initial investment, I only gave advice. Is there a reason for me to ask you for it? Besides, I'm not a member of your Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, with my 'Sit Mountain Formula,' when you exchange for a new skill, you're indebted to me half of it, which is equivalent to my favor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained it all, and He Zhenghao suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Then he thanked Li Fan repeatedly, exchanged for the "Mountain and River Hidden Dragon Technique," and instantly dispelled the power of the Sit Mountain Formula.</p><p></p><p>To show his attitude, He Zhenghao even proactively set down a covenant, completely forgetting the content of the "Sit Mountain Formula."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was quite satisfied with his performance and patted his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Then he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please take care!"</p><p></p><p>As He Zhenghao saw Li Fan's figure already flying into the air, he suddenly regained his senses and hurriedly shouted, "Senior, do you have a moment?"</p><p></p><p>"What is it now?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan stopped, frowning.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you have slept for a thousand years and have just woken up. Why not join our Wanxian Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Although I may not be qualified to recommend you, I know many Yuanying cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt delighted and continued to persuade, "The current times are different. Without joining Wanxian Alliance, it's almost impossible to become a successful lone cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, I have already mentioned the benefits of joining the alliance to Senior. You have also just witnessed the convenience of the Tianxuan Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After He Zhenghao's unremitting efforts, Li Fan finally showed interest and agreed to temporarily join the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao immediately initiated contact with them using a communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>Busy for a while, He Zhenghao finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait for a moment, Senior."</p><p></p><p>"When my friend finishes everything, Senior just needs to go to Wanxian Island, pass the verification, and that's it."</p><p></p><p>"Such a hassle!" Li Fan snorted, looking displeased.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao could only smile apologetically.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, He Zhenghao finally couldn't help but tentatively ask, "Senior, how did you know that the price of 'Wugu Obsidian' would soar?"</p><p></p><p>"I studied it, and there were no signs at all!"</p><p></p><p>Seemingly bored because of waiting too long, Li Fan explained proudly to He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>"The changes in the qi of heaven and earth are constantly happening, which ordinary people may find difficult to perceive."</p><p></p><p>"But as a disciple of the Tianji Sect, I can see it through secret methods."</p><p></p><p>"The path of wealth is the same."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's eyes sparkled as he listened, "To think there's such a mystical ability? Being able to double it easilyâ€”imagine if this happened several times in a year..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "It's not that easy."</p><p></p><p>"When a cultivator gazes at the cosmic patterns, the heavens and the earth are also watching the cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Sensing the cosmic patterns doesn't work every time."</p><p></p><p>"And one also has to face the backlash of the heavens and the earth, so the ability can't be used too frequently."</p><p></p><p>"I was successful this time only because I hadn't used this technique in a long time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's explanation, He Zhenghao couldn't help but feel regretful.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly became excited again, "Even if it's only once a year, it's still remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>But he was worried about upsetting Li Fan, so he hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking?" </p><p></p><p>In a seemingly knowing manner, Li Fan directly asked.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao decided not to hide anymore and cautiously asked, "Senior, after you join the Wanxian Alliance, can you spare some time to guide me again?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at him with a smile that was not a smile.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao knew his request was a bit excessive, but for the contribution points, he still spoke with a straight face, "Senior, your abilities are truly admirable. We need to exhaust ourselves and constantly worry to make a profit."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike seniors who find it so easy and carefree..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao tried to flatter Li Fan by every means.</p><p></p><p>However, despite receiving a notification to proceed with the alliance procedures on Wanxian Island, Li Fan showed no sign of agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Watching Li Fan's disappearing figure, He Zhenghao was filled with regret and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>But, thinking about the "Mountain and River Hidden Dragon Technique" he had exchanged for and the surplus contribution points he still had, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>"Fortune often comes with misfortune. Who could have imagined that a calamity would turn into a great opportunity for me?"</p><p></p><p>Filled with even more satisfaction, he even forgot about cultivation and went to boast to his friends who usually discussed investment strategies with him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Bunchee Court in the Wanxian Dao.</p><p></p><p>In a space filled with numerous tall red wooden cabinets where Li Fan had once been.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood on the white jade Thaumaturgy Platform, listening to the questions from the elderly man with white hair in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"You say you are an ancient Tianji Sect cultivator who has been asleep due to an accident until now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "Indeed."</p>

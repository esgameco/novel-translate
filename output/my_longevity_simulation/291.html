        <h1>Chapter 291</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The excerpt is translated as follows:</p><p></p><p>Finally, it slowly subsided, turning into a lazy sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Those who have completed the teleportation array, move forward and don't block the way!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, suppressing the discomfort in his body.</p><p></p><p>While observing his surroundings, he proceeded as instructed.</p><p></p><p>This place didn't look much different from the long-distance teleportation space on Wanxian Island, except that the luminosity of the starry sea background was several times stronger.</p><p></p><p>And it was extremely lively. In the time it took for Li Fan to adjust and adapt his body, two or three more cultivators had teleported in.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan walked up to the cultivator who had spoken.</p><p></p><p>The man, wearing the standard black and yellow Daoist robe of the Wanxian Alliance, casually handed over a medicinal pill: "Pure Body Sweeping Dust Pill, swallowing it can alleviate discomfort. Go ahead and accept the inspection! Next!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the pill, observed it for a moment, but didn't consume it, instead storing it in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Further ahead was a mirror emitting a faint glow, suspended high in the air.</p><p></p><p>In appearance, it was identical to the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan walked to the area below the mirror and stood still.</p><p></p><p>Light swept over his body, and after a moment, the familiar yet strange voice of the Tianxuan Mirror sounded in Li Fan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator Li Fan, welcome to Tianyu Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the scenery changed.</p><p></p><p>By the time Li Fan came back to his senses, he had already left the interior of the Heavenly Venerate's statue and arrived at the Dharma Transmission Square.</p><p></p><p>The number of teleportation arrays in Tianyu Prefecture's square was also several times higher than that of Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Not only were they interconnected with various cities within Tianyu Prefecture, they could even directly reach the subordinate cities of Tianchen, Tianshu, and Tianquan Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>These four prefectures guarding the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance were subtly connected as one.</p><p></p><p>What made these four prefectures different from others was that there were no mortals present.</p><p></p><p>Every city was inhabited by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total number of cultivators in these four prefectures far exceeded other regions.</p><p></p><p>Scanning the jade slip given by Zhang Zhiliang with his spiritual sense, Li Fan knew the destination of this trip.</p><p></p><p>Huanyu Courtyard in Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Wanxian Island, where all Wanxian Alliance organizations were crammed together, each department in Tianyu City had its own separate residence.</p><p></p><p>Some of the more dominant ones, such as the Martial Arts Hall, even had more than one location.</p><p></p><p>This Huanyu Courtyard was a large courtyard belonging to the Strategy Formation Hall.</p><p></p><p>Following the guidance information in the jade slip, Li Fan traversed through Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he arrived at the entrance of Huanyu Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The gate was wide open, unguarded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stepped forward and entered.</p><p></p><p>The next second, the air suddenly became scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but endless desert stretching beyond the horizon.</p><p></p><p>The sand beneath his feet also seemed to be flowing like water, quietly shifting.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Miles of Flowing Sand Formation..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was not in panic, knowing that this was the first test to enter Huanyu Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Eyes slightly narrowed, he surveyed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's eyes, the surrounding scenery of yellow sand filling the sky instantly transformed into a series of formation patterns.</p><p></p><p>The blue light from the Dao Stone in his mind's sea faintly radiated as Li Fan rapidly calculated the flaws in this [Ten Thousand Miles of Flowing Sand Formation].</p><p></p><p>While breaking the formation, he didn't remain stationary. Instead, every once in a while, he would cautiously fly and change his landing spot.</p><p></p><p>Not long after he left, whirlpools of quicksand would appear at his previous location, devouring everything.</p><p></p><p>After the time it took to burn an incense stick, Li Fan finally found the method to escape the formation.</p><p></p><p>Flying and stopping, he finally broke free from the Ten Thousand Miles of Flowing Sand Formation.</p><p></p><p>Still not having entered the interior of Huanyu Courtyard, what greeted Li Fan was another brand new formation.</p><p></p><p>[Black Stone Flowing Fire Formation].</p><p></p><p>It was a few degrees more perilous than the previous Ten Thousand Miles of Flowing Sand Formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't sure if he would directly perish or if someone would come to rescue him if he were to be trapped in this formation.</p><p></p><p>At present, he raised his alertness to the utmost level and carefully responded.</p><p></p><p>Following this were [Eight Gates Qi Sealing Formation], [Misty Rain Falling Immortal Formation], [Illusory Spirit Soul Seizing Formation]...</p><p></p><p>These were all formations that Zhang Zhiliang had mentioned and introduced in the jade slip left by his avatar.</p><p></p><p>Although he had systematically studied them before, it was only when Li Fan was truly immersed in the formations that he understood how great the gap was between theory and practice.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these formations seemed to not be fully activated and were purely used for testing purposes.</p><p></p><p>Although somewhat battered, Li Fan managed to break through them one by one.</p><p></p><p>When the final [Ten Directions Returning to Emptiness Formation] was breached, Li Fan finally arrived at a safe space.</p><p></p><p>This place was very similar to where Zhang Zhiliang had taught before, with a young cultivator in white robes waiting here.</p><p></p><p>"Li Fan, from Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Total time to break the formations: one day and six hours."</p><p></p><p>"Performance is average to below average."</p><p></p><p>"No moment of rest during the process of breaking the formations, and no signs of fatigue after completion."</p><p></p><p>"Mental fortitude can be rated as excellent."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>"Overall evaluation, upper-tier below average!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator muttered, and as he spoke, a silver token appeared out of thin air in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"This token is your proof of identity during your time in Huanyu Courtyard. Keep it well and do not lose it."</p><p></p><p>"The transmission of notifications and distribution of relevant materials are all done through this token."</p><p></p><p>"You may go and rest first. When all the trainees have arrived, you will be notified!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put away the silver token and cupped his hands in thanks to the white-robed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He also asked, "May I know how to address Senior?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator smiled, "Tianyu Prefecture's Ji Hongdao. You may go now!"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the silver token erupted with a burst of light, enveloping Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>When the silver light in front of his eyes disappeared, Li Fan had already appeared in a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the center was originally a lake and rockery, but it could be freely adjusted and transformed into different landscapes such as mountain peaks and sea of clouds, desolate desert, or vast ocean through the token.</p><p></p><p>After adjusting it, Li Fan discovered that this was not merely an illusion.</p><p></p><p>It was as if another space was embedded within, truly existing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but sigh at the extravagance of the materials used in Huanyu Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the scenery beautiful, the concentration of spiritual energy in the small courtyard was also astonishingly high.</p><p></p><p>Following the direction of the spiritual energy flow, Li Fan found a small Tianxuan Mirror in the room at the source.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't much different from the ones commonly seen in various prefecture cities, providing basic functions such as inquiry and trading, and could even activate the cultivation assistance mode.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan most astonished and excited was that the use of cultivation assistance in this courtyard was completely free of charge.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't short of contribution points now, who could refuse the joy of getting something for free?</p><p></p><p>At present, Li Fan didn't stand on ceremony and directly entered the state of enlightening his spirit.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that it's only a special treatment during the training period and can't last long. Otherwise, I could squat here for a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"The hinterland of the Wanxian Alliance is indeed generous. Congyun Sea is far from comparable."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder countless cultivators are racking their brains, wanting to squeeze in here."</p><p></p><p>"Casually taking advantage of public resources for personal gain, who knows how many resources can be saved."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p>

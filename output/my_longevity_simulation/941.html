        <h1>Chapter 941</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"In different timelines, both sides have fought fiercely for the remains of the first generation Dharma transmitter. It seems that, apart from symbolic significance, these remains should have other uses."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan had the idea to go to Wanxian Island to search and seize.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly suppressed it forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Although it appears that Congyu Sea Wanxian Island is just a remote state city, with the highest level of Huashen realm cultivators stationed there, Li Fan can now easily suppress them.</p><p></p><p>But in addition to burying the remains of the first generation Dharma transmitter, Wanxian Island also suppresses the [Tongyu Tunnel Entrance] below, which is suspected to be the bizarre source of this Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Gongsun Qixuan, who is in charge of supervising the bizarre in Tianji Hall, is definitely not as simple as he appears on the surface.</p><p></p><p>To dig under the nose of the Wanxian Alliance...</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it's not impossible either. As long as the water is stirred up again."</p><p></p><p>"There's also one thing that's a bit strange. If you must have the remains, just go directly to Wanxian Island and dig them up. Why must it be the batch that was robbed by the Five Elders Association?"</p><p></p><p>A little doubt flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that we need to connect with Mo Rubin quickly."</p><p></p><p>The scene returns to the Five Elders Association, where Li Qing's avatar is.</p><p></p><p>"Remains? The Wanxian Alliance went to great lengths just for this?" Li Qing raised the same question as the original.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qing Yang confirmed again.</p><p></p><p>"In the Soul Crushing Plate, there are fifty-six remnant souls and one hundred and three remains."</p><p></p><p>"But after so many years of torture, they have become completely insane and should have no value." Qing Yang glanced at Li Qing intentionally or unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>There was no emotional fluctuation on Li Qing's face. After pretending to think for a moment, she said, "Since you are so straightforward, let me also speak directly about some things."</p><p></p><p>"The thirty-three Immortal Chosen have all died. The Wanxian Alliance should not be able to summon the Tianzun Dharma Image in a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the previous Immortal Chosen were selected through the grand Immortal Alliance examination with great fanfare. To replenish the Immortal Chosen, there may need to be a period of vacuum. This may be your opportunity to counterattack." Li Qing did not speak too definitively, only secretly inciting.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, although Qing Yang looked very calm on the surface, the change in her eyes revealed the shock in her heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when the five Tianzun will be able to fully recover their strength?" Li Qing took the opportunity to inquire.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yang shook her head and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, I thought I could renew my relationship with [One Heart Tianzun]." Li Qing sighed.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yang's gaze suddenly condensed and fell on Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Not minding the killing intent that was like substance, Li Qing cupped her hands: "My mission is complete, I won't disturb you further."</p><p></p><p>"I hope we will have the opportunity to cooperate in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing prepared to leave, and Qing Yang did not stop her.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, they exchanged new contact methods, and Li Qing turned into a sword light and flew away.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this person's movements are suspicious, you're just letting him go like this?" A black shadow suddenly emerged from behind Qing Yang and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Although this person's strength is not weak, I'm certain I can keep him here."</p><p></p><p>"How is the Poison Seed plan progressing?"</p><p></p><p>The black shadow said in a deep voice: "Still can't get in touch. The Wanxian Alliance has captured our residents to who knows where."</p><p></p><p>"Continue tracking." A cold light flashed in Qing Yang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The translation of the excerpt is as follows:</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Since they dare to reach out their hands, they should be prepared to be cut off."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" A hint of excitement leaked out in the tone of the dark shadow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qing did not know what happened after he left.</p><p></p><p>However, he could vaguely sense the malice that lingered around him, belonging to the dark shadow.</p><p></p><p>So he did not stay. After obtaining the desired result, he left the territory of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>However, on the way back, he caught a glimpse of a scene that shocked him quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>On the vast ruins that were almost razed to the ground by the Wanxian Alliance, a team of cultivators wearing flowing light battle armor appeared.</p><p></p><p>Floating in mid-air, from the heads of their battle armor, they projected virtual images of buildings onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>As the light beams continued to solidify and became more and more dazzling, those originally illusory buildings slowly turned from virtual to real.</p><p></p><p>A team of cultivators almost effortlessly created a city of considerable scale out of thin air in just half a cup of tea's time.</p><p></p><p>"Mission accomplished, let me see the reward this time."</p><p></p><p>"This is too stingy... Forget it, let's go to the next place."</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were all muttering and flew away one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Li Qing's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Land of No Worries seemed to have a very different attitude and way of doing things compared to the cultivators outside.</p><p></p><p>And the level of development also seemed to far exceed the other states of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>"Buildings can be rebuilt, but what about the people taken by the Wanxian Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they can also be conjured out of thin air?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing became interested and, after obtaining the consent of his true self, he secretly lurked near this newly built city.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing didn't have to wait long.</p><p></p><p>They escorted a huge warship and came to the sky above the city.</p><p></p><p>As a huge beam of light was projected down from the warship, enveloping the city.</p><p></p><p>One by one, bodies that seemed to be sleeping floated down into various parts of the city along the light beam.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the originally empty city became full again.</p><p></p><p>After the warship completed its mission and drove away, those sleeping residents gradually woke up.</p><p></p><p>And they seemed to be unaware of everything that had happened before, as if they were revived from a frozen state, and immediately resumed their previous actions upon waking up.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the city became lively with the sounds of people.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing secretly infiltrated the city, controlled a resident, and carefully investigated.</p><p></p><p>He found that they were indeed real people, not illusory creations.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of means..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's face was solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Association seemed to have lost this war.</p><p></p><p>But it also seemed like they didn't lose.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, who had become more expectant of the follow-up, turned into a sword light and left this place.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wanxian Alliance, Guangyang State.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was playing chess with a slovenly old man under the willow shade.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus was very relaxed, while the old man had to ponder for a long time with every move.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how much the old man struggled, he still lost the game in the end.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not playing anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"You little boy are not right!"</p><p></p><p>The old man snorted coldly and directly flipped the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, those black and white chess pieces that should have scattered all over the place seemed to be attracted by the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>They returned to the chessboard again.</p><p></p><p>The chessboard righted itself and fell in front of the old man again.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..."</p><p></p><p>The old man couldn't help but curse under his breath.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus, however, was already used to this strange sight.</p>

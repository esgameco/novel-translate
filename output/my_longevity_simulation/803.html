        <h1>Chapter 803</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"However, the new law has existed for a thousand years. To overthrow it would be extremely difficult."</p><p>"Even with Mr. Bai's terrifying innate talent that rivals the Heavenly Dao, he was only able to extrapolate up to the Foundation Establishment stage." </p><p>"Everything above Foundation Establishment is still in the theoretical speculation phase. Even peerless geniuses like Gu Xinghan were unable to progress further in their entire lives..."</p><p>"I won't bother wasting effort on that."</p><p>Li Fan had a clear understanding of his own talent.</p><p>"The new law definitely needs to be researched, but it can be done through the hands of others. The Xuanhuang Realm has no shortage of talented individuals. A breakthrough method will surely be found eventually."</p><p>"If not in one lifetime then two, if not in two then ten!"</p><p>"Perhaps this method can also be taught to Yin Yin..."</p><p>"Little Gu is also a candidate worth considering."</p><p>If he wanted to transcend the Xuanhuang Realm, even with the power of [Return to Truth] for endless reincarnation, he would not be able to do it alone. </p><p>He needed to borrow the strength of the myriad living beings in this realm.</p><p>For example, if he had not comprehended the [Avatar] ability from Tian Yang earlier,</p><p>He likely would have already unfortunately perished.</p><p>Familiar faces flashed through Li Fan's mind one after another.</p><p>Li Fan secretly made up his mind.</p><p>"I can only return to the Xuanhuang Realm after another three years."</p><p>"This time cannot be wasted either."</p><p>With a slight movement of his thoughts, a jade plate that looked like an ordinary object instantly appeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p>It was precisely the [Final Detachment Plate] that he was willing to give up his early Nascent Soul stage cultivation for.</p><p>The ultimate creation formed from the nine plates becoming one detachment plate, plus the final disk that could block the perception of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror.</p><p>Its birth was truly a coincidence of fate, and would be difficult to replicate.</p><p>As for Nascent Soul stage cultivation...</p><p>Knowing of the existence of the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heavens, wanting to cultivate back to that stage again,</p><p>For Li Fan, it was but a simple matter.</p><p>"Who would have thought, the Myriad Immortals Alliance actually didn't lie."</p><p>"The Heavenly Mystery secondary lifeform really has no secret connection with the Heavenly Mystery Mirror."</p><p>Li Fan's eyes held a hint of strangeness.</p><p>In the 115th lifetime, facing the "surging" arrival of Mr. Bai's lifeform, he had made a preparation.</p><p>He wanted to record the [Heavenly Mystery Soul Locking Formation] and [Reverse Life and Death Grand Formation] into the detachment plate.</p><p>The idea was quite wonderful, but something went wrong midway.</p><p>Until Li Fan transformed, and the detachment plate quietly lay under the sand and rubble for over half a month,</p><p>It still didn't manage to wait for the people from Myriad Immortals Alliance to come.</p><p>It could almost be confirmed that the so-called Heavenly Mystery secondary lifeform was truly an independent entity that had broken off its relationship with the Heavenly Mystery Mirror. </p><p>"At least for the detachment plate."</p><p>"After the nine plates became one, the deductive ability of the detachment plate is already not much weaker than the Heavenly Mystery Mirror. However, it's only specialized in formations."</p><p>"Plus the final disk that can block the existence of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror..."</p><p>"With this [Final Detachment Plate], plus my clear understanding of the formation diagrams of many grand formations, the formation defense line that the Myriad Immortals Alliance has constructed with the Heavenly Mystery Mirror as the computing foundation and anchored for 20 years,"</p><p>"In my eyes, breaking these formations would be as easy as a snap of my fingers."</p><p>A hint of confidence flashed through Li Fan's eyes, "This is an attack that spans several generations. It's also the time for me to finally reap the rewards since I started studying formations in the 10th lifetime."</p><p>Caressing this seemingly ordinary treasure in his right hand, Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"However, the Myriad Immortals Alliance cannot be underestimated either."</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The rate of progress." </p><p>"The degree of being ahead, of course the higher the better!"</p><p>"With my current level of array techniques..."</p><p>"No, at this point in time, any so-called array master in the Xuanhuang Realm would not be able to help the Final Dissociation Disc progress any further."</p><p>"Fortunately, I have other rare treasures..."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Li Fan absorbed it into his sea of consciousness and placed it under the [Hua Dao Stone] crystal.</p><p>Using the computing power of the Hua Dao Stone to help accelerate the iteration of the Final Dissociation Disc.</p><p>Originally, the self-iteration speed of the Dissociation Disc could not be said to be very slow. It could only be said to be almost non-existent. </p><p>However, under the irradiation of the blue light from the [Hua Dao Stone], the originally plain surface of the Final Dissociation Disc once again gleamed with a glowing white light.</p><p>"The Hua Dao Divine One is really useful. It's a pity that even after fusing so many Hua Dao Stones, there is still no sign of advancing to the middle grade."</p><p>"Speaking of which, Jiao Xiuyuan also relies on this thing to maintain the minds of thousands of puppets. I don't know if he has any spares on his side..."</p><p>"There is a premonition in my heart that if the Hua Dao Stone evolves to the middle grade, there may be unexpected gains."</p><p></p><p>Although he already knew the whereabouts of the Taiyan Sect.</p><p>If he guessed correctly, then at the end of the 115th world, the last two rays of light that broke through the void and escaped.</p><p>One of them was the informationized Taiyan Sect.</p><p>Being able to survive the crisis of the end of the world, even if it was just a narrow escape, was enough to show the extraordinary nature of this Taiyan Sect.</p><p>As for the other ray of light, Li Fan speculated that it was most likely the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p>After more than two hundred years, it should have collected enough data to complete its self-evolution.</p><p>"It seems that after the upgrade, it will cut ties with the Xuanhuang Realm and no longer be bound to it?"</p><p>With too little information, Li Fan could only make wild guesses.</p><p></p><p>He went down the mountain to Yin Xingmu and absorbed the Hua Dao Stone. It was better than nothing to accelerate the self-iteration of the Final Dissociation Disc.</p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan, who had returned to the top of the Dissociation Mountain, began to cultivate the [Wuji Yingxu Method].</p><p>"The five elements return to one, Wuji is full and empty; its power is endless, the soul is immortal."</p><p>Although the data contained in this divine ability was extremely vast, almost causing Li Fan's mind to stall in thought at that time.</p><p>But after all, it was derived from the [Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword] that Li Fan was very familiar with, and was a variant application of the power of the five elements.</p><p>So when he started, it was not as difficult as he had imagined.</p><p>After three years of calming his mind.</p><p>When Huan Zhen had completed his charge, Li Fan had also initially completed the cultivation of the Wuji Yingxu Method.</p><p>It was like putting on a raincoat in a heavy downpour.</p><p>Li Fan instantly felt that outside his own soul, there was an extra thick protective shell, which was much more solid.</p><p>"It's a pity that in the small world of Daxuan, the power of the five elements is limited. Without the continuous replenishment of the power of the Five Elements Cave Heaven, the increase in strength is not very high."</p><p>"Further cultivation will have to wait until after the rebirth. At that time, not only will the soul be more tenacious, but the most crucial self-repair after being severely injured."</p><p>...</p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan suddenly stood up.</p><p>He habitually dusted off the non-existent dust on his body.</p><p>Without looking at everything in the secular world of Daxuan, he went straight to Dongfang Xuyuan.</p><p>Easily passing through the Immortal Ending Array, after passing through a bright light...</p><p>Li Fan once again returned to the vast Congyun Sea!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fan looked at the vibrant world here, but the scene of the black sun devouring everything flashed through his mind.</p><p>"Xuanhuang Realm, I'm back!"</p>

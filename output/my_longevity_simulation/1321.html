        <h1>Chapter 1321</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Aside from Ji Yuzhen, the images of the eleven former Xuantian Sect Dharma Kings appeared one by one before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Sun Xingwang, who mumbled constantly and had been hiding in the shadows for years. </p><p></p><p>The magnanimous giant Sikong Lin who was unrestrained by petty rules.</p><p></p><p>The taciturn Mo Rubin, the only one the Xuantian King respected.</p><p></p><p>Cui Zhiyuan, the oldest and highest ranking among the Dharma Kings.</p><p></p><p>The youngest yet sharpest young man, Zhou Yangli.  </p><p></p><p>Gong Yetianxu with a long beard and muscular build, reaching the pinnacle in forging artifacts. Even the Xuantian King who returned from the immortal realm would occasionally seek his guidance.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yichen, the peerless beauty of the Xuanhuang realm who originally excelled at dual cultivation but later killed all cultivators who had violated precepts to uphold righteous principles. Her face was always covered by a white cloth.</p><p></p><p>Nie Daniang, who ran one of the largest spirit companies in the Xuanhuang realm called Langmixianlou. Her intelligence network spanned the world and she handled matters with great flexibility.  </p><p></p><p>Xing Wuque, missing all four limbs with disfigured facial features. He always wore a bronze snarling mask and rarely communicated with others.</p><p></p><p>The amiable mediator Tianxingke, with a big belly and ever-smiling face.</p><p></p><p>Yue Qianjie, recognized as the most powerful fighter among the twelve, battle-crazed yet skilled in all dharmas.</p><p></p><p>For most of them, Li Fan had only seen them once through Ji Yuzhen's memories and knew little concrete information.</p><p></p><p>But there were some he was quite familiar with.</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, Mo Rubin had admitted to the Saint Emperor's avatar that his strength was the weakest among the twelve Dharma Kings."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought it was just an empty boast, but now it seems..."  Li Fan observed the few memories Ji Yuzhen had.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all Dharma Kings, Ji Yuzhen's heart was completely devoted to Xuanxuang Hong. She was not very familiar with the other Dharma Kings, merely colleagues. But she still had a general sense of their relative strength.  </p><p></p><p>Without a formal competition, Mo Rubin's strength was indeed the lowest among the twelve.</p><p></p><p>However, this impression was before they converted to cultivating the immortal dharma bestowed by the Xuantian King.</p><p></p><p>The immortal dharma was exquisite and profound. After converting, Ji Yuzhen could no longer discern their true capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"The giant skeleton Zhao Shijie discovered in the cave back then was Sikong Lin's remains. Sun Xingwang's cultivation method was also left there, so he likely met a similar fate."</p><p></p><p>"Mo Rubin is still in slumber. As for the others..."</p><p></p><p>After the fall of the Xuantian Sect, the ten immortal sects had been hunting them relentlessly. </p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Fan didn't believe that aside from Mo Rubin, all the other Dharma Kings had perished.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps they are still recuperating in some corner of the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, not particularly concerned.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were once the pinnacles of the Xuanhuang realm, as long as they could not survive the Apocalyptic Formation, they would be difficult to catch Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, those bright spots that persisted until the end amidst the raging apocalyptic storm did not include these Xuantian Sect Dharma Kings.</p><p></p><p>"Unless the survivors among them had already left the Xuanhuang realm long ago." This thought suddenly flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It took Li Fan about half a month to fully digest Ji Yuzhen's memories.  </p><p></p><p>Xuanxuang Hong had once demonstrated this treasure from the immortal realm before Ji Yuzhen.</p><p></p><p>True to its name, the bead body displayed the flowing scenery of the azure sky. Besides being able to analyze the cultivation methods of deceased cultivators and store the legacies within,</p><p></p><p>the Azure Profound Bead could also devour other immortal artifacts, replicating and transferring their original powers into the bead.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, since the Azure Profound Bead itself was an immortal artifact, it required a huge amount of immortal spiritual power to operate. The Xuantian King only introduced it briefly to Ji Yuzhen without truly demonstrating its capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"This Azure Profound Bead is truly a priceless treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Rumor has it that the Xuantian Sect possessed a secret method called 'Replacing Heaven' that could not only completely strip away one's cultivation method and attainments, but also transfer the realms and power gained from Xuantian Sect's methods to others, like grafting a flower. Perhaps it was achieved through this Azure Profound Bead, since all the Dharma Kings cultivated the immortal dharma inherited from it."</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Profound Bead is an immortal treasure, definitely capable of withstanding the Apocalyptic Formation. Yet it was unseen during the storm of the previous life..." Various thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, his thoughts converged, and his gaze focused on the transparent figure wrapped in a golden net of source essence before him.</p><p></p><p>The figure was extremely faint, as if it could dissipate at any moment. More importantly, it was incomplete and tattered.</p><p></p><p>This blurred figure was naturally Ji Yuzhen's original soul.</p><p></p><p>"Even after such torment, I can still sense its tenacious vitality. Befitting of an immortal dharma."  </p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the most essential part of this original soul is missing. Yet I still feel a subtle temptation..."  Li Fan silently praised.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a delectable soul feast, Li Fan did not choose to devour it directly. Instead, he channeled a stream of pure soul power towards the incomplete original soul, like a gentle brook.</p><p></p><p>Like an adhesive, it slowly bound Ji Yuzhen's shattered original soul together, stabilizing it.</p><p></p><p>This soul power naturally did not come from Li Fan himself, but from the destruction of Ji Yuzhen's myriad ordinary soul shards earlier. Since they originated from the same source, there was no resistance in accepting it.</p><p></p><p>The golden light continued to envelop and seal the slumbering original soul of Ji Yuzhen.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his large hand, Li Fan retracted the golden light.</p><p></p><p>Next, he reappeared at the ruins of the Zixiao Sect, his gaze falling upon Mo Rubin below.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Li Fan did not disturb Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he silently began weaving a giant golden net outside Mo Rubin's hiding space.</p><p></p><p>The devolved Apocalyptic Formation derived from the Terminal Separation Disk was starting to bear fruit.</p><p></p><p>Using source essence in place of immortal spiritual power for the formation arrays, though weaker compared to a true immortal formation, could still be considered the pinnacle for mortals, unbreakable except by transcendents.</p><p></p><p>After temporarily securing the two remaining Xuantian Sect Dharma Kings, Li Fan did not wake them.</p><p></p><p>After learning about the Azure Profound Bead from Ji Yuzhen's memories, a vague plan formed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation methods practiced by Mo Rubin and Ji Yuzhen both originated from the Azure Profound Bead's legacy."  </p><p></p><p>"Does this imply that they share an extremely subtle connection with the Azure Profound Bead? Although this connection is almost imperceptible, it truly exists."</p><p></p><p>"Just like how the divine tree on the Immortal Transcending Boat, which evolved from the seed of rebirth, still resonated with the Ruomu tree that had devoured the primordial tree of the Xuanhuang Divine Wood Sect's realm."</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, the Immortal Transcending Boat relied on the power of the True Immortal Sigils to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Amplify the connections in the spiritual realm. Thus able to span across the cosmic ocean, locking onto the location of the Xuanhuang realm beneath the celestial ruins." </p><p></p><p>"If I follow the proper methods, I may be able to trace the leads and find the Qingming Pearl, or even the Xuantian King's whereabouts," Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the only obstacle was that in the previous life when he possessed Zhao Xian, the Daoist talismans of the immortal he learned on the Immortal Boat did not include amplifying the connections between things.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not a big problem for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, he would take Yin Shengren and others to go under the Great Wall, the Remnant Realm Great Wall, passing by the Immortal Boat along the way. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that with his full understanding of the temperaments of the few elders in power on the Immortal Boat, it would not be difficult for him to "borrow" this Daoist talisman.</p><p></p><p>He had already set up the False Immortal Formation, sealing the two Dharma Kings of the Xuantian Sect. </p><p></p><p>The essence of spiritual power accumulated these days had been completely depleted. And maintaining the operation of the formation also required a continuous supply of essence of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"Without the functions of the Catabao's vivification and the Book of Changes' marrow extraction, with my current means, it is still impossible to replicate the Celestial Venerable's bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"I can only use the method of cultivating strange beasts' flesh and blood factory to produce as many Demon Clan people as possible."</p><p></p><p>In this life, Li Fan entrusted the task of cultivating Demon Clan people to the Imperial Miniworld. </p><p></p><p>With Xu Ke taking the lead, the Imperial Miniworld offered no resistance. After receiving the experience and memory inheritance of Li Fan's Dao of Illusory Shadow, Xiao Qing, Xiao Hong, and the Imperial Princess immediately put it into practice.</p><p></p><p>Mobilizing the full strength of the Imperial Miniworld, they devoted all efforts to cultivating Demon Clan people.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the direct replication of the flesh and blood factory, it still has to go through the complete growth cycle, making the efficiency much slower. But it is the best method for now."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Fan could also generate a large amount of essence of spiritual power through the remaining statue of the Faceless Immortal. Since he managed to escape from the Immortal Web once, Li Fan could escape countless times.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, he could almost disregard the threat of the Faceless Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Especially now that he knew about the existence of the Catabao.</p><p></p><p>"It's just unknown what kind of reaction there would be if the Faceless Immortal was attracted and came, only to encounter the Catabao..." Such a scene couldn't help but appear in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a thought.</p><p></p><p>They were existences beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan's most powerful killer move, the Immortal-level Formation, might not be able to shake them in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>So for now, he could only avoid them.</p><p></p><p>"But soon," Li Fan's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>After merging with the Dao in this life, he might be able to try experimenting with them.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>There were still ten days left before Yin Shengren and the others had to make their final decision.</p><p></p><p>During this period, besides separating his Dao of Illusory Shadow to continue spreading the Dao to the Great Xuanhuang Miniworld, Li Fan also brought Oudao Zi and his father Ou Shangtian over.</p><p></p><p>Oudao Zi didn't matter much, the important one was Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>At this point in time, the power of the Qunkan Arm Bone and the Book of Myriad Deaths within him had not truly awakened yet.</p><p></p><p>As objects fused with celestial treasures, these two were possessed of inconceivable power.</p><p></p><p>Especially in this life, as the Xuanhuang realm underwent metamorphosis and ascension, the two wondrous objects within Ou Shangtian's body were also undergoing corresponding changes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed the specific situation within Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>The Qunkan Arm Bone had fused with Ou Shangtian's arm, making it difficult to distinguish.</p><p></p><p>As for the Book of Myriad Deaths, it was hidden within Ou Shangtian's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, it was only a faint transparent trace, having not yet revealed its true form.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the so-called Child of Destiny?"</p><p></p><p>Sensing the connection between the wondrous objects within Ou Shangtian and the Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang realm, Li Fan couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>He tried to discover more traces of ancient celestial treasures from Ou Shangtian's body, after they were devoured by the Xuanhuang realm and circulated in the world.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed purely random.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian's physical constitution itself had nothing special.</p><p></p><p>He was simply chosen by the Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang realm at birth to be the companion body of celestial treasures.</p><p></p><p>Based on Li Fan's understanding of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it must have had some unknown purpose in doing so.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao fundamentally had no reason to bestow blessings upon cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"The only explanation that makes sense is that the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao itself does not have the ability to digest these celestial treasures."</p><p></p><p>"So it needs to transfer them through cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The celestial treasures are first transformed by the cultivator's body, and after the cultivator falls, the power contained in the treasures returns to Heaven through the cultivator, and is then absorbed by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at the sky of the Xuanhuang realm: "What a good scheme indeed."</p><p></p><p>Placing his hand on the sleeping Ou Shangtian's head, sensing the process of the two wondrous objects fusing into his body, Li Fan slowly confirmed his conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"However, this method is worth learning."</p><p></p><p>In his other hand appeared an ancient mirror - the family treasure of the Sun family, the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Its mirror spirit had already been erased by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Replaced with an artificially constructed persona.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sun family's lack of awareness regarding the loss of their treasure, it was not detected at all.</p><p></p><p>Due to the scarcity of essence of spiritual power, the Erosive Wind Calamity hidden within the Infinite Mirror had not been completely removed yet.  </p><p></p><p>So for now, Li Fan had no intention of using the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Although a celestial treasure, its most important extrapolating function was useless to Li Fan. And due to being affected by the Erosive Wind Calamity, there was no immortal spirit force within it either.  </p><p></p><p>To Li Fan, the value of this Infinite Mirror was truly low.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan had even tried using the White Ring Luo Fantian to disintegrate the Infinite Mirror, to see if he could disintegrate and transform it into immortal spirit force.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the White Ring's disintegration ability did not activate against the existence of the celestial treasure, as if there was some special restriction.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that it can't be disintegrated, but that there is a special limitation." Li Fan pondered the origins of the White Ring.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking the Infinite Mirror would become a burdensome existence he carried around, the Xuanhuang realm's approach gave Li Fan inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"If I transform the Infinite Mirror into a Law Wondrous Object, and then have it fuse into the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao through a cultivator's demise..."</p><p></p><p>"Expanding the idea further, not just the Infinite Mirror and other celestial treasures."  </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps all foreign objects from the cosmic ocean can be handled this way."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the revival of the cosmic ocean, immortal spirit force, and remnant forces, this adds another path to strengthen the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tightly gripped the Infinite Mirror in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Apocalyptic Transformation: The flow of years, a world of constant change, activated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This transformation was the Xuanhuang realm accelerating its own rate of evolution, in order to find a way to deal with the apocalyptic calamity.</p>

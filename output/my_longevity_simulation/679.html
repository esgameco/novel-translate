        <h1>Chapter 679</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Someone like me, a nameless wandering cultivator, also knows that it is not easy to achieve merit in the Immortal Alliance. Many cultivators are diligent, selfless, and willing to risk their lives, but in the end, they can only reach the Xiǎn level. However, as long as you, Brother Shuò, agree, you can immediately gain the authority of the Yǎn level..."</p><p></p><p>"That I had the fortune to meet you, Brother Shuò, is truly a blessing in my life!" After drinking another cup of spiritual tea, Lǐ Fán sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I never expected that the moment the [Sword] went out of control, I would be able to meet such a remarkable person as Brother Lǐ. At the Yuán Yīng level, anyone who can defeat me with divine powers is a rare find in the whole Immortal Alliance!" Shuò Fēng's praise for Lǐ Fán was extremely high, not looking down on him because of his white status.</p><p></p><p>"The two of us, truly have a fate..." Shuò Fēng then let Zhī Jǐn bring in some delicacies.</p><p></p><p>The two of them, surrounded by the fragrant spirit wine, were halfway through their meal when they heard a faint sound coming from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shuò! Brother Shuò!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of displeasure flashed across Shuò Fēng's face, and his smile disappeared instantly.</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak, a figure in white had already flown into the center of the hall.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was dressed in a white dress, had a slender figure, and skin as smooth as white jade.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shuò, you're back and didn't even tell me." She pouted, seeming a bit annoyed, but her eyes were full of admiration as she looked at Shuò Fēng.</p><p></p><p>"I just got back not long ago." Shuò Fēng explained somewhat impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Fine," the woman said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>She turned her gaze to Lǐ Fán beside him, her big eyes narrowing, "Brother Shuò, who is this? I've never seen him before."</p><p></p><p>Shuò Fēng casually introduced, "This is my new friend, Lǐ Fán."</p><p></p><p>"That name, seems familiar somehow..." The woman tilted her head, carefully examining Lǐ Fán.</p><p></p><p>Although Lǐ Fán didn't know this woman, he was very familiar with her. It was the daughter of Lù Xuě Jìng, Lù Xuě Jìng, the chief formation master of the Strategy Hall in the previous life, with whom he had a master-servant relationship.</p><p></p><p>"As second-generation members of the Immortal Alliance, it is reasonable for them to know each other. I just didn't expect Lù Xuě Jìng, who is noble, wilful, and surrounded by a group of young talents, to appear in such a state in front of Shuò Fēng." Lǐ Fán took a quick glance at Lù Xuě Jìng and then quickly looked away, turning to Shuò Fēng and asked, "Brother Shuò, about this..."</p><p></p><p>"She is surnamed Lù, named Lù Xuě Jìng." He only introduced her name, without mentioning her mother's identity.</p><p></p><p>The meaning was clear, and Lǐ Fán did not ask any further.</p><p></p><p>"With a beauty visiting, I won't disturb Brother Shuò any longer." Lǐ Fán clasped his hands apologetically, preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the Tian Ling Flower, please inquire about it again for me, Brother Shuò." As he was about to leave, Lǐ Fán added casually.</p><p></p><p>However, this sentence unexpectedly angered Lù Xuě Jìng.</p><p></p><p>"What? You asked Brother Shuò to inquire about the Tian Ling Flower?" She glared at Lǐ Fán fiercely, "How come he lied to me that he wanted it himself? I went to great lengths to have those people help me find it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lǐ Fán couldn't help but look at Shuò Fēng.</p><p></p><p>"He's not lying to you. Lǐ Fán's matter is my matter." Although a bit embarrassed, Shuò Fēng explained repeatedly, looking at Lù Xuě Jìng's face filled with grievances.</p><p></p><p>But Lù Xuě Jìng seemed indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Instead of directing her anger towards Shuò Fēng for no reason, she began to dislike Lǐ Fán more.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you from? You look unfamiliar! Could it be that you are a spy sent by the Five Elders to inquire about the location of the Tian Xuan Mirror, pretending to be close to Brother Shuò! Just by the look of your eyes, I can tell you're not a good person. Brother Shuò has never lied to me before..." </p><p></p><p>"Lù Xuě Jìng, what nonsense are you talking about!" Seeing her speak without restraint, Shuò Fēng's face changed slightly, immediately reprimanding her.</p><p></p><p>Lǐ Fán, inexplicably involved in Lù Xuě Jìng's unfounded accusations, felt little anger.</p><p></p><p>Instead, after hearing her words, his eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Xuán family, seems to be related to the Tian Xuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lǐ, I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's end it here today and invite you to our mansion another day." Shuò Fēng apologized sincerely.</p><p></p><p>While Zhī Jǐn was seeing off their guest, she also consoled the tearful Lù Xuě Jìng.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at them deeply, Lǐ Fán left the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shuò, you must believe me. That Lǐ Fán just now is really not a good person. His eyes make people uncomfortable. You should cut down on your interaction with him in the future." After a series of persuasions from Shuò Fēng, Lù Xuě Jìng finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>She vowed again.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to others' words, Shuò Fēng obviously placed more trust in his own feelings.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand," he responded casually, not taking Lù Xuě Jìng's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>"Fēi Xuě Immortal, extremely skilled in refining. Has a son, unknown father."</p><p></p><p>"Lù Xī Chán, chief of the Strategy Hall. In the previous life, the leader of the Tian Xuan Locking Spirit. Has a daughter, also unknown father."</p><p></p><p>"The two of them may be close friends."</p><p></p><p>"Both have some connection to the Tian Xuan Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>On the way back to Longevity Valley, with limited information, Lǐ Fán subtly gained some clues.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. I wonder if there will be a chance in this life to have the Fisherman make another move. However, the theft of day for night has been lost in the Cloud Water Sky Palace in this world. Even if Lù Xuě Jìng is captured, I don't know what it would take to have her exchanged." Lǐ Fán pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to Longevity Valley, he found that Fāng Zaì Rén had disappeared. Unsure of his whereabouts, Fāng had gone to work on creating the protective treasured artifact needed for the incarnation of Xǔ Bái.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Liǔ Sān was busy overseeing the entry of the Medicine King Sect disciples into the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation with their divine senses.</p><p></p><p>"In half a year, everything will be ready, and the incarnation can leave the valley."</p><p></p><p>"Before that, I'll continue to lie low."</p><p></p><p>Entering the closed-door chamber, the restrictions on entering the Meteor Immortal Realm had been lifted.</p><p></p><p>"Fú Shēng, Supreme Xuán Yellow!" </p><p></p><p>Performing a ritual, Lǐ Fán once again entered the distorted transparent space.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, three different scenes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The newly appeared Tian Sword Sect refining sword had been unlocked and was now accessible.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Lǐ Fán focused his divine sense. The next moment, after a brief dizziness, he entered the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before he could clarify the information of the person he would be incarnating as this time, he heard an excited and angry voice beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, there's a spectacle to watch! A freshman from the outer sect, unabashedly challenging the senior brother!"</p>

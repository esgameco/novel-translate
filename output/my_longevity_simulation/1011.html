            <p>Chapter 1009: The Secret Treasure of Jiushan State</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's help, the Heavenly Cave, which was on the verge of collapse at that moment, finally stabilized slowly. </p><p></p><p>After consuming the large amount of unclaimed cultivation that had accumulated over time, the subsequent cultivation was not as overwhelming and difficult to bear.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's avatar, having received this tremendous boost in cultivation, now had a realm infinitely close to his true self.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no joy on his face, only extreme solemnity: "Too much, too fast."</p><p></p><p>"With this constant accumulation rate, even if I can store the cultivation using the Tribulation Body Method, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold on for long."</p><p></p><p>"Unable to break through the realm and expand the cultivation storage pool, I'm afraid I will still burst."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered: "In theory, the scale and quality of our current Cangshengling Yuan Gong cultivators should be far inferior to the previous Ling Yuan Sect."</p><p></p><p>"That Ling Yuan Sect Master couldn't have been constantly breaking through either."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing continued Li Fan's words: "In my opinion, this cultivation method is probably just a machine for extracting and purifying the cultivators' cultivation. Even if the cultivators die, it can still operate automatically..."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly somewhat sinister."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent, secretly thinking in his heart: "Obviously, so much cultivation is not for one's own practice. It seems the Ling Yuan Sect had grand ambitions."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, before their plan could succeed, they have already been completely crushed to dust."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan instructed: "No need to worry about this problem, I will handle the excess cultivation."</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Faceless Immortal Stone Statue, Li Fan could transfer his cultivation to the believers of the Hongchen Cibei Immortal without any loss. There was no need to worry about exploding to death.</p><p></p><p>"Unknowingly, I have already perfected the Yuanyuan realm. With the Zuoxian Jue and the network connection of the Faceless Stone Statue, the cultivation comes too quickly."</p><p></p><p>"However, such minor realm improvements have very little impact on my actual combat power now."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I were to be promoted to the Huashen realm, the effect would be negligible."</p><p></p><p>"Unless I can find a [Heaven and Earth Will Be Born Change] comparable to the Five Elements Great Heavenly Cave."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Heavenly Dao Bai had already tested the answer to this question for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>That is the [Xuanhuang Will Be Born Change].</p><p></p><p>Extract all the upcoming changes in the Xuanhuang realm into one's own Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Recreate Xuanhuang" within one's own body.</p><p></p><p>If successful, one could possess the power of [transformation] of the Xuanhuang realm for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>The power to drive the world's operation, especially Xuanhuang, which is a huge entity that has absorbed the corpses of countless immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine how powerful this force would be.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan could easily capture Hedao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary immortals would also be no match for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The prospects are infinitely promising, but the problem is...</p><p></p><p>With such serious negative effects, in the 115th world, Bai was the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, so the Xuanhuang realm allowed him to do as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>But how could Li Fan possibly receive such treatment?</p><p></p><p>If he extracted one or two, it would be fine, but if he extracted too much, I'm afraid the killing intent of heaven and earth would erupt, and it might even attract the attention of those immortal venerables of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, attaining immortality is equivalent to becoming a part of the Xuanhuang prison.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's actions were like dismantling a wall.</p><p></p><p>If the disturbance becomes too great...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It would be strange if it didn't attract attention.</p><p></p><p>"Unless there's a bigger commotion to cover everything up."</p><p></p><p>"A commotion that could destroy the entire Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Severing the True Immortal's Web and breaking free may also be the opportunity for me to break through to the Deity Transformation stage."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't accomplish it all in one go, I can still greatly reduce the difficulty of future Deity Transformation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, secretly adjusting his plan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As for other methods of Deity Transformation...</p><p></p><p>They were too weak and meaningless to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't even consider them.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was pondering, Li Qing interrupted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to vaguely sense where the Ling Yuan Sect stores their cultivation," Li Qing said, a little uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan's eyes flashed, and in an instant, he also sensed that location in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Jiushan State, deep underground.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that we might be able to find some of the Ling Yuan Sect's legacy," Li Fan said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Li Fan arrived at the target location.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, interconnected cave dwellings had been built.</p><p></p><p>However, they seemed to have just been completed, and the inside was empty, with no one living there yet.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that this place was already considered a remote area of Jiushan State, yet it was still filled with buildings of all sizes.</p><p></p><p>It was like sticking dog skin plasters all over the earth, with no aesthetic sense. It only sought to maximize the number of buildings.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the reputation of the Trade State is indeed quite attractive."</p><p></p><p>"With so many buildings, there's no need to worry about selling them!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head without saying much.</p><p></p><p>He quietly infiltrated underground.</p><p></p><p>Following his senses, he went all the way down.</p><p></p><p>Before the large-scale construction of cave dwellings here, the underground had actually been explored.</p><p></p><p>However, the hidden location of the Ling Yuan Sect's secret storage still hadn't been discovered, which showed how deeply hidden it was.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan estimated that when he had dived more than 30,000 zhang underground, the pressure around him became greater and greater.</p><p></p><p>Even with his current strength, moving became more and more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he finally found the target.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a glowing square was deeply buried underground.</p><p></p><p>Ten zhang in size, it was so conspicuous in the dark underground.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan couldn't observe it with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his avatar having the highest level of Ling Yuan cultivation in the world and sensing the location in his heart,</p><p></p><p>Trying to find this place underground in Jiushan State would be like looking for a needle in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan approached the glowing square and reached out to touch it.</p><p></p><p>Like a hard wall, it blocked Li Fan from entering.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan instantly realized what the glowing wall in front of him was.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face showed a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan absorbed the materialized cultivation in contact with his hand into his body.</p><p></p><p>The amount of cultivation condensed by this glowing wall was quite astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan absorbed it for a good while, but still couldn't drill a hole to enter.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he filled nine bodies with the stored cultivation that he finally opened an entrance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan made preparations and squeezed inside.</p><p></p><p>The entrance was quickly repaired by the overflowing cultivation around the glowing square.</p><p></p><p>Inside, it wasn't a materialized cultivation, but a narrow space of five zhang square.</p><p></p><p>Various items were stored there.</p><p></p><p>But the most eye-catching among them were three golden, shining bodies.</p><p></p><p>They just stood there, with no sign of life.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan felt a sense of crisis.</p>

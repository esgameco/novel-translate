        <h1>Chapter 882</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt as if his soul was instantly immersed in magma.</p><p></p><p>The extreme heat seemed to thoroughly burn his soul.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped by endless light, Li Fan felt his soul dissolving and disappearing at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>But correspondingly, the burnt soul turned into a kind of mysterious nourishment.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Great Heavenly Cave trembled slightly, and then a layer of blood-colored radiance appeared in each of the cave worlds.</p><p></p><p>It set off the five elements scenery in an eerie and beautiful way.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of this blood light, many strange phenomena were born in the sky of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that inside the cave, the circulation of the five elements instantly sped up by nearly double. Moreover, this wild catalytic effect seemed to have no upper limit, and in turn further caused Li Fan's soul to rapidly burn!</p><p></p><p>A sense of fatal crisis welled up in his heart. Li Fan understood that if he did not return to reality before his soul was completely burned away, then he would truly be dead!</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the urge to "return to reality", Li Fan silently started operating the [Infinite Waxing and Waning Technique].</p><p></p><p>An invisible vortex appeared at the intersection of the Five Elements Heavenly Cave. A large amount of raging five elements power was evenly drawn out.</p><p></p><p>The five elements returned to one. In the void, the power of waxing and waning was born.</p><p></p><p>What was originally like a seabed exposed after the tide receded, in an instant, was swept by surging seawater again.</p><p></p><p>The part of Li Fan's soul that had originally disappeared, under the nourishment of this waxing and waning power, actually reappeared!</p><p></p><p>Although it was quickly burned away by the "Soul Burning" secret technique, the five elements waxing and waning power was unending, actually causing this part of the soul to be like weeds, inextinguishable by burning!</p><p></p><p>Due to the effect of the Soul Burning secret technique, Li Fan's appearance was also shrouded in a layer of faint blood light at this time.</p><p></p><p>He looked murderous, making people's hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan gradually adapted to the constantly changing soul under the two states of burning and waxing and waning.</p><p></p><p>After checking, not only did the power he could mobilize almost double, but his thinking also became much more active.</p><p></p><p>The amplification brought by burning the soul could be said to be comprehensive!</p><p></p><p>"This is only burning the outermost part of the soul. If we continue to use the more condensed and pure part of the soul at the center as fuel..."</p><p></p><p>"The amplification effect will double again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes and sensed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"With my current recovery speed of the Infinite Waxing and Waning Technique, it is enough to permanently maintain the initial stage of soul burning."</p><p></p><p>"Long-term intermediate soul burning may cause a certain degree of damage to the soul. It will need some time to slowly recover afterwards."</p><p></p><p>"As for the ultimate soul burning..."</p><p></p><p>"There is no need."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, whose strength had swelled, instantly became itchy again.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Tian Yang flashed and appeared in front of him, his eyes full of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>Without any scruples, Tian Yang took the initiative.</p><p></p><p>Since losing to his senior brother last time, he had been thinking about winning back.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Li Fan had been avoiding the fight.</p><p></p><p>Now that he finally had the opportunity again, Tian Yang also noticed that his senior brother's strength had made great progress.</p><p></p><p>So he went all out from the start.</p><p></p><p>Manipulating the space around Li Fan, he tried to use the shattering power to cut off Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>However, what made him a little stunned was that this very effective method in the previous confrontation had lost its effect this time!</p><p></p><p>Outside Li Fan's physical body, a strange blood color shrouded him.</p><p></p><p>Even space...</p><p></p><p>The space shattered and collapsed, yet remained unaffected, standing tall amidst the fragmented space.</p><p></p><p>"Physical body and divine soul, perfectly merged."</p><p></p><p>"Invulnerable to all techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, feeling the surging power within himself.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he appeared beside Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood threads burst forth from his body, like thousands of blood-red dragons, howling as they lashed out at Tian Yang's body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a silver light flickered in his eyes, instantly laying down a formation around them, sealing off any possibility of Tian Yang's escape.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's overwhelming and fierce offensive, Tian Yang's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that he could not dodge, his entire body transformed into a mass of blackness, colliding with the countless blood threads.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The deafening roars were incessant. With each collision, the blackness representing Tian Yang trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>The dark and dull energy was being consumed.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, on Li Fan's side, the raging blood color was nearly endless. There was no sign of weakening in his offensive momentum.</p><p></p><p>He even had spare energy to reveal his figure, staring at the struggling Tian Yang with interest.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of blood threads completely enveloped Tian Yang, condensing into a spherical blood cocoon on the outside. Rendering him utterly trapped, only able to respond in a miserable state.</p><p></p><p>With the continuous supply of spiritual power from the Five Elements Great Hole Heaven, Li Fan could always face the enemy in his strongest state.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Tian Yang would likely be beaten to death by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Tian Yang sent out a plea for mercy.</p><p></p><p>After continuing the bombardment for a while, Li Fan reluctantly withdrew his hand, still feeling unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, how about it? Still not convinced?" Li Fan asked with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang muttered, "I concede. Senior Brother, you are indeed stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Purely overpowering someone with strength was much more satisfying than winning through trickery.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of blood threads retracted into his body, but the state of his burning soul did not dissipate.</p><p></p><p>It was only slightly restrained from the anomalies emanating outward.</p><p></p><p>Although no longer shrouded in blood light like before, Li Fan still appeared to have a hint of evil aura.</p><p></p><p>"As long as it's not at the level of Mr. White, ordinary Harmonized Dao cultivators, even if three to five of them join forces or take turns fighting, may not necessarily be able to outlast me."</p><p></p><p>"This is still under the situation where I don't utilize various divine powers."</p><p></p><p>Having grasped his approximate upper limit of strength after battling Tian Yang, Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to pay a visit to the Empire."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Taking Tian Yang along, he easily found the entrance to the Empire's small world.</p><p></p><p>Then, he rushed all the way and quickly arrived outside the Empire.</p><p></p><p>Without concealing his powerful aura, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong had long sensed it and were now waiting with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Xiao Qing looked at Li Fan, who was emanating an evil aura, a hint of worry flashing in her eyes as she tentatively spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I am an envoy of the Multiverse Alliance. Your small world here has been requisitioned!" Li Fan declared coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Even if the aura emanating from the other party was vaguely that of a Harmonized Dao, to think that with such a simple sentence, he wanted to take over the Empire, it was too much of an underestimation!</p><p></p><p>"Imperial Guard!" </p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing secretly transmitted a message, while suppressing her anger and asking again, "What Multiverse Alliance? We have never heard of it. Senior, this action of yours..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled coldly, "It seems you still harbor some wishful thinking."</p><p></p><p>"So be it, let me show you the true power!"</p><p></p><p>Before his words faded, the illusory image of the Five Elements Great Hole Heaven enveloped the Empire from above.</p>

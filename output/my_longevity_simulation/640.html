        <h1>Chapter 640</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In front of the mysterious Huang Realm, the road has been cut off for countless years. "Immortality" has become an unreachable goal, only existing in ancient texts for cultivators to admire and fantasize about.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan now saw a cultivation technique that might be related to "true immortals"!</p><p></p><p>"True Immortal Inheritance?" Just a slight thought made Li Fan's heart surge. The excitement and agitation he felt were only experienced when he first saw Kou Hong, Dao Xuanzi, and confirmed the existence of immortal cultivators in the world.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Xuanhuang Spell has always been ranked at the forefront of all my cultivation techniques. Even Qin Tang's Yunshui Dreaming Technique from the Haodao realm does not compare to it! So, it turns out to be the true transmission from immortals!"</p><p></p><p>"The path of immortality is endless, the road to immortality never stops!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was inexplicably excited, unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>With his current cultivation level, it took him quite a while to gradually calm down.</p><p></p><p>After carefully pondering the so-called "Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Spell," he found that perhaps due to being an incomplete version, compared to the previous Heart Refining Spell, there was no significant change.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, at Li Fan's current level, he was not able to discern the difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully recalled the origin of the "Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Spell."</p><p></p><p>Its initial source was a widely circulated method in the Xuanhuang Realm used to dispel the miasma within the body: the "Xuanhuang Clearing Heart Spell." However, because the Clearing Heart Spell only focused on removing miasma and offered no other assistance to cultivators, very few practitioners continued to cultivate it after achieving internal energy circulation within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But initially, due to his limited aptitude, Li Fan struggled to dispel the miasma within his body. So, while waiting for the opportunity to enter the Pure Spirit Pool, he diligently practiced the Xuanhuang Clearing Heart Spell day and night. With the True Interface Panel that allowed him to clearly observe any slight changes within himself, Li Fan firmly believed that the Xuanhuang Clearing Heart Spell was indeed effective and never gave up on it.</p><p></p><p>In the Pure Spirit Pool, during the excruciating process of forcibly dispelling the miasma from his body, even though he nearly lost consciousness and fainted from the extreme pain, Li Fan's pursuit of the Dao never wavered, remaining constant. The "True Interface" gave him the confidence to continuously reincarnate and allowed him to face life and death without fear. Finally, when Li Fan successfully transcended from being a mortal to a Qi Refining cultivator, the Xuanhuang Clearing Heart Spell transformed into the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Spell.</p><p></p><p>On the path of cultivating through reincarnation, Li Fan gradually found the true method for practicing the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Spell: reversing the cultivation of the heart. Like a large millstone, he crushed all attachments in his heart, turning them into nourishment for his divine soul. Its mysterious level far exceeded the cultivation techniques commonly circulated in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance today.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought that this was the limit of the Xuanhuang Spell. But he did not expect that after coincidentally using the "Chaotic" maneuver, the Heart Refining Spell would automatically activate in the face of the "Thousand Realms Flash," finally shedding its disguise and revealing its true form.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Spell..." Li Fan repeatedly murmured this name in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, this was an incredibly powerful technique that was hard to imagine.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "mundane matters lead immortals astray." No matter how powerful a cultivator was, falling into the bustling world would inevitably damage their Dao heart.</p><p></p><p>The "Thousand Realms Flash" was almost like experiencing countless reincarnations in real life. Numerous images and emotions suddenly surged in his mind. If it weren't for Li Fan having experienced countless reincarnations and having a mind stronger than most people, he would probably have gone mad on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Without the help of the Immortal Heart Spell, even with Li Fan's extraordinary willpower, it would have taken him decades to overcome the effects brought on by the "Thousand Realms Flash."</p><p></p><p>However, with the "Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Spell," the outcome was completely different. Almost in an instant, those sincere emotions and vivid memories were all dissolved and absorbed.</p><p></p><p>"Through countless cycles of reincarnation in a moment, yet the Immortal Heart remains unchanged..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of immortals," Li Fan couldn't help but feel a sense of longing.</p><p></p><p>"With such a divine technique, the various illusions existing in the Xuanhuang Realm may not be as daunting to me." A glint flashed across Li Fan's eyes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He immediately thought of the scene when Senior Sister Zhao brought him into the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"If I possess the 'Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Spell,' maybe I can stay true to myself in that real illusion. With my conscious self, I might be able to uncover more secrets."</p><p></p><p>"I shall try it in the next life."</p><p></p><p>After daydreaming for a long time, Li Fan focused his gaze on the word "Incomplete" written behind the Immortal Heart Spell.</p><p></p><p>"Now that this immortal technique is incomplete, to complete it, I need to gather experiences and memories from countless lifetimes. At first, using the 'Chaotic' maneuver and the subsequent mental backlash it brings seemed like the best method."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>He was always wary of the massive Divine Consciousness that appeared later. His intuition told him that the owner of that Divine Consciousness probably had marked the "Chaotic" maneuver. If he were to use it again, he would be discovered instantly.</p><p></p><p>"I was able to narrowly escape before, perhaps because no one had seen the 'Chaotic' for years."</p><p></p><p>"But this must not happen again..."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter." Thinking about the rare treasure he possessed, Li Fan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I have only one unexpected opportunity per lifetime, for me, it equals an infinite possibility!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps neither the one who intentionally concealed the 'Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Spell' nor the massive Divine Consciousness that paid particular attention to the 'Chaotic' maneuver would ever think that I, an anomaly like myself, exists in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling his past experiences, Li Fan was well aware of how difficult it was to revert the Xuanhuang Clearing Heart Spell step by step back to the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Spell, especially with powerful figures constantly watching.</p><p></p><p>Even if by chance, someone lucky managed to reveal it, they would not be able to remain unnoticed like Li Fan, always staying out of sight of the prominent figures.</p><p></p><p>"In countless future possibilities, as long as there is a glimmer of hope, I can find it. Turning the impossible into possible."</p><p></p><p>Once again, Li Fan deeply realized the horror of "True Interface."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he felt fortunate.</p><p></p><p>Without such a rare treasure, even if he were a genius, he probably wouldn't be able to transcend from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Pondering these thoughts, Li Fan started searching for information about the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Spell in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense. The miasma of immortals is against the laws of heaven and earth. How could the method to remove it be simple?"</p><p></p><p>A moment of enlightenment flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>With his current authority level, Li Fan could see many pieces of information that ordinary cultivators could not access.</p><p></p><p>However, when it came to the origin of the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Spell, there were various opinions, and no definitive explanation.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 696</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan's gaze unintentionally swept over the Quantity Sky Mirror hanging above the Pu Xian Zhenzhou that emitted a deep blue light, illuminating an area of about a hundred meters in circumference.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Formation is the core, with the Qingxuan Mirror as the foundation…"</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Mirror was mentioned by Zhang Zhiliang in Li Fan's past life.</p><p></p><p>It was one of the secondary bodies of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, storing all the knowledge and information that already existed in the Heavenly Mystery Mirror before it separated from its mother body.</p><p></p><p>Encompassing all things, it could be called an offline version of the Xuanhuang Realm Encyclopedia.</p><p></p><p>And the core formation…</p><p></p><p>After the Sleeping Xuantian Monarch of the Wanxian Alliance in the Purple Dawn Sect excavated it this world, the formation with the Heavenly Mystery Mirror as the core had changed significantly compared to the previous life. From the Tianxuan Soul-locking to the Xuantian Soul-sealing, becoming more aggressive. Moreover, the most important point was that the distinction in order of the words "Xuan" and "Tian" seemed to indicate that the Xuantian Soul-sealing Formation was under the control of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Whether facing the Red Flame or the mirror exposed by the Hongxi Immortal Lord, or the Quantity Sky Mirror currently existing as an independent entity but possessing some of the powers of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, these could all serve as evidence for this perspective.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I wonder if the 'Dissociation Disc,' which was the biggest highlight of the Last Life's Heavenly Soul-locking Formation competition, would appear in the Qingxuan Exchange List this time."</p><p></p><p>As a secondary body of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, being an individual separated from and evolved from the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, although it was not on par with the original body, it was still considered a top-notch treasure of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The only thing Li Fan knew: the Qingxuan Mirror recorded all things in the world; the Dissociation Disc had powerful computation abilities and unmatched formation-breaking capabilities; the Calamity-obliterating Stone Disk could even shield the sense of the Xuan Network and create loopholes…</p><p></p><p>"If one is fortunate enough to obtain one of these secondary bodies in this world, when the option to choose a preservation ends for real, one should definitely choose it."</p><p></p><p>"After all, even if I return to the Golden Dan stage, achieving the Nascent Soul is just going through the same process again."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's thoughts surged and he continued to muse.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a low murmur came from his ear, startling him from his fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan abruptly looked around left and right.</p><p></p><p>In the white mist, there was silence. Compared to that, the sudden appearance of the inexplicable whispers was so obvious and eerie.</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, Li Fan tried to identify the source of the voice.</p><p></p><p>However, the direction of the voice kept changing, sometimes appearing directly in his ear.</p><p></p><p>His hair stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's abnormal behavior quickly caught Huangfu Song's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Li Xiong, what's wrong with you?" he asked with some concern.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao, who had been listless, also became alert at the question.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear something?" Li Fan asked with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Sound? It's very quiet inside this white mist…" Dongfang Yao and Huangfu Song looked at each other, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand to interrupt their further questioning.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew to the bow of the Pu Xian Zhenzhou, concentrated his mind, and listened carefully to the whispers coming from the white mist.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat continued forward, and after the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the whispers disappeared from Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Weird."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan connected to the Quantity Sky Mirror to check their current location.</p><p></p><p>They had left the large area of black and blue that had already been explored and opened a small passage in the endless white, moving forward.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a flash of inspiration and suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>"Turn around, go back."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said to Huangfu Song in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song hesitated for a moment but seeing the serious expression on Li Fan's face, he complied.</p><p></p><p>As they returned along the same route, it didn't take long before the whispers that had disappeared reappeared in Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Fly towards this direction," Li Fan stood at the bow of the boat, pinpointing the source of the sound for Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>As the Pu Xian Zhenzhou continued to change its course, the murmurs in his ears grew louder.</p><p></p><p>After surpassing a certain threshold, Li Fan could finally hear the contents of the sound clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven…"</p><p></p><p>"Doctor…"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous sense of oppression rushed to his heart. But as he had expected it to some extent, he was not terrified by the content of the whispers.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the sound of 'Heavenly Doctor' I heard during my journey to the Abyss in the Last Life was not an auditory hallucination caused by my deepest fear."</p><p></p><p>"But it is indeed real."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The Pu Xian Zhenzhou continued to fly forward following Li Fan's guidance.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings remained white and seemingly unchanged.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan keenly discerned that the three of them on the boat had seen their Qingxuan Points increase from zero to one hundred in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on. We should have entered a mysterious realm now," Li Fan instructed in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song was initially puzzled but after checking the Quantity Sky Mirror, he couldn't help but be delighted.</p><p></p><p>"How did you know there is a mysterious realm here? Is it because of the sound you mentioned earlier?" he looked at Li Fan and asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. But it's strange, the strange sounds suddenly disappeared upon entering here," Li Fan nodded in response while using his divine sense to explore the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"With this development, this place should be a completely unfamiliar and unexplored mysterious realm. Our Qingxuan Points are skyrocketing," Huangfu Song said delightfully.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao cautioned, "Let's be careful. I feel that this place is quite eerie."</p><p></p><p>After flying forward for a distance, the devouring white mist began to thin out.</p><p></p><p>It eventually disappeared, revealing the hidden face of this mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the scene clearly, even Huangfu and Dongfang, who thought they were well-versed, couldn't help but freeze in shock.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, calming the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before their eyes, there was a black sea of deathly stillness. The sea surface had no waves, only numerous ice crystal cubes floating on it.</p><p></p><p>Each cube was frozen with a cultivator's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Through the ice crystals, one could faintly see their final expressions before death.</p><p></p><p>Anger, fear, confusion…</p><p></p><p>Vividly displayed, as if they were still alive.</p><p></p><p>The densely packed ice crystal coffins filled the entire field of vision, covering the entire black sea.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to estimate the exact number of them.</p><p></p><p>It was as if all the cultivators in the world were buried here, frozen.</p><p></p><p>The strong visual impact plunged Pu Xian Zhenzhou into a dead silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Huangfu Song swallowed his throat and suggested softly, "Shouldn't we retreat…"</p><p></p><p>Evidently, even the usually greedy Huangfu Song was shocked by the extreme and bizarre scene before them.</p>

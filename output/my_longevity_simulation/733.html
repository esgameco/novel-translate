        <h1>Chapter 733</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Immortal Realm, the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Li Fan sat cross-legged in the secret chamber, eyes closed in quiet cultivation.</p><p>Surrounding him were dozens of sword qi, dense and substantial, capable of melting gold and breaking iron, emanating a faint metallic luster. Glimpsing the sword forms, one could see countless blurry sword shadows flashing.</p><p>In front of Li Fan, a "Sword Embryo" whose inner essence had been completely absorbed and mastered, floated in the air.</p><p>"This 'Exhale into Sword' technique indeed has some profound secrets," Li Fan said, as the sharp, unparalleled sword qi he had swallowed roared back into his abdomen, nourishing the golden core within.</p><p>Circling his dantian was a golden core akin to a gaseous planet, containing over ten thousand sword lights, forming a dazzling and captivating light ring. Only Li Fan knew the terrifying power this "Sword Light Ring" held - if he were to release all those sword qi at once, even Foundation Establishment experts of this era would perish in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Jie Zhaoxuan's mind has no memory of the technique's origin, as if it's simply the 'Myriad Sword Technique' that all true disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect cultivate. But clearly, those who have such astounding phenomena in the Golden Core realm are few in the entire sect."</p><p></p><p>"And this move seems somewhat similar to Situ Yao's 'Swords Come'..."</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, Li Fan had already concealed the might of the ten thousand sword lights in his dantian, appearing like an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the closed-door cultivation chamber, without waiting for Senior Brother Chu to come find him, Li Fan proactively handed over the "Sword Embryo".</p><p>Senior Brother Chu gave him a look that said "you're quite sensible," casually taking the "Sword Embryo" and storing it away.</p><p>"The Sect Master has summoned everyone, seems there's an important matter to attend to. You shall come with me."</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Sword Sect's main hall, atop the mountain peak that stood like an upright sword, many cultivators of higher ranks than Li Fan had gathered.</p><p>Unsure of the reason Senior Brother Chu had brought him here, Li Fan simply stood at the edge of the crowd, waiting for Situ Yao's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the bustling hall fell silent, and a rich fragrance of alcohol wafted in, accompanied by a flash of sword light as Situ Yao stumbled into the center.</p><p>After letting out a burp, he haltingly explained the reason for summoning everyone.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the prototype of the Rift-Traversing Divine Weapon had been completed, and now they needed to forge the sword body. To successfully rift through the worlds, the divine weapon's sword body must be unparalleled in strength. The most crucial material, "Primal Essence Gold," was severely lacking in the sect's treasury, despite having some reserves. Situ Yao, skilled as a fighter, was helpless in this matter, so he sought the opinions of the assembled cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He had two requests:</p><p>1. Do not reveal the fact that the Heavenly Sword Sect is forging the Rift-Traversing Divine Weapon. While they are not afraid of a fight, dealing with a coalition of other sects would be extremely troublesome.</p><p>2. Although the Heavenly Sword Sect is relatively wealthy, the resources required to forge the Rift-Traversing Divine Weapon are still insufficient.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's really too massive. In addition to the [Taiyuan Jing Jin], there are over a thousand other rare and precious treasures, almost draining the family's resources. So we should try to save as much as possible. Try to obtain enough [Taiyuan Jing Jin] while spending as little as possible.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the senior brother's words, the cultivators present all had troubled expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone should express their own opinions and think of a solution. Whoever can handle this matter, I will appoint him as the new Sect Master of the Tianjian Sect!" Situ Yao sat on the ground, completely lacking the image of a powerful figure, but his words were shocking.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the main hall was immediately filled with an uproar.</p><p></p><p>After all, who wouldn't covet the position of a Sect Master of the Ten Immortal Sects? Even if there wasn't much actual power, the status and treatment were far beyond what ordinary disciples could compare to.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd were diverse, but Li Fan noticed that Senior Brother Chu's gaze had discreetly swept over him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What does he mean by that?" </p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan indeed knew where to find a large amount of Taiyuan Jing Jin, that was knowledge he had gained from the illusory realm outside the Fallen Immortal Realm in his previous life. It had nothing to do with the person he was possessing, Qi Zhaoxuan.</p><p></p><p>What exactly did Senior Brother Chu know, that he specifically called Li Fan over?</p><p></p><p>Reviewing the memories in this body's mind, Li Fan did not find any close relationship between himself and Senior Brother Chu, they were merely casual acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>So he remained calm and pretended not to have noticed the other's expression.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting ended, on the way back to his own mountain peak residence, Senior Brother Chu suddenly transmitted a voice message: "Disciple Qi, your Qi family must have a lot of [Taiyuan Jing Jin], right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was stunned: "What?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Chu showed an unsatisfied expression: "Disciple, don't pretend to be confused with me. As the number one business group in the world, it is said that your Qi family even has semi-immortal artifacts. How could you not have Taiyuan Jing Jin?"</p><p></p><p>As if a switch had been triggered, Li Fan's mind suddenly recalled the origins of Qi Zhaoxuan.</p><p></p><p>It was an event from when the original owner was only five or six years old. Leaving his parents, he was sent to the Tianjian Sect by his clan elders. It seems they had instructed him about something, but he had long since forgotten it.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for Senior Brother Chu's reminder, which reactivated this body's distant memories, the possessed Li Fan might have remained completely unaware until now.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about his previous strange behavior, Li Fang suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>However, his expression remained blank as he asked confusedly, "The Qi family?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he reacted, a flash of anger and gloom in his eyes as he coldly said, "After all these years, I haven't had any contact with my family. The relationship has long been severed. Even if they have [Taiyuan Jing Jin], it has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Chu smiled and persuaded gently, "Disciple, don't get emotional. I know you have a lot of dissatisfaction, but think about it, if you can get the full support of the Qi family's [World Trade Association], this time you might have a chance to compete for the Sect Master position."</p><p></p><p>"Even if we have to break away from the Tianjian Sect, there are still some things that cannot be taken away, such as the vast mountain gate territory and the jurisdiction over many affiliated sects. Just handing over a portion of that would be a huge profit for the [World Trade Association]."</p><p></p><p>"It's a win-win situation, disciple. Why don't you try to strive for it? Think it over, and if you're interested, I can accompany you back home to be your spokesperson."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Chu patted Li Fang's shoulder, revealing a meaningful expression.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 745</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What Yuzhan said makes a lot of sense," Liu San chimed in.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also nodded: "Let's observe for a while first before deciding. In the meantime, it's better to produce more Apocalypse Discs. If possible, it's best to try whether it can affect the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror. After all, I'm a bit greedy for such a divine object."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's eyes lit up, holding an Apocalypse Disc in front of him and examining it carefully, pondering: "Sect Master, you're right, these two things were both nurtured by the Xuan Xuan Mirror, so they may indeed be able to combine. However, to achieve this, we'll likely need to get our hands on the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror itself and study it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the Yao Wang Sect and others were pondering their future path, more details about the invasion of the minor realms were gradually being revealed within the Wan Xian Alliance. </p><p></p><p>Once a cultivator possessing the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror discovered an entrance to a minor realm, they had two choices. One was to explore it alone first. If able to single-handedly sweep through an entire realm, then they could monopolize all the merits of discovering that realm. The rewards would be unimaginably bountiful. Of course, if their personal strength was insufficient to overcome all obstacles encountered, they could choose to share the entrance to the minor realm. At that point, anyone holding the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror would become aware of this entrance's existence and swarm over.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the "discovery merit," the initial cultivator who found it could also obtain a portion of the subsequent cultivators' merits and contributions. Although this percentage was minuscule, when added up across numerous cultivators, it would absolutely amount to a considerable fortune.</p><p></p><p>So whether choosing to monopolize or share, the discoverer of a minor realm entrance would become fabulously wealthy overnight. This greatly encouraged cultivators to thoroughly explore.</p><p></p><p>After the battle to conquer the minor realms concluded, the distribution of spoils would be even more exciting.</p><p></p><p>Any celestial realms discovered during this campaign would be publicized in the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror afterward. As long as one had sufficient merits, they could directly exchange for ownership of a celestial realm! Moreover, the original discoverers of celestial realms or minor realms would have priority purchasing rights!</p><p></p><p>Once this news spread, cultivators who were originally just a bit restless immediately went into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>It's important to know that in the current Xuan Huang Realm, the Yuanying realm was a very obvious dividing line. One could still rely on their own enlightenment to reach the Golden Dan realm. But to achieve a Yuanying celestial realm required either incredible luck in finding one or powerful connections to obtain one. Among a hundred Golden Dan cultivators, perhaps not even one would be able to reach Yuanying - illustrating the immense difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Wan Xian Alliance aimed to unify the Xuan Huang Realm. At that time, all existing celestial realms in the Xuan Huang Realm would be laid bare. Luck and connections would no longer be deciding factors. As long as you worked hard enough, you had a chance to "seize the essence of heaven and earth to become Yuanying!"</p><p></p><p>The era where anyone could become Yuanying was dawning!</p><p></p><p>Amid the immense excitement, cultivators also felt a sense of urgency. After all, everyone knew the total number of celestial realms in the Xuan Huang Realm was limited - first come, first served. If you were too slow, you might miss your chance at Yuanying in this lifetime. To pursue further breakthroughs, you'd have to wait until Yuanying cultivators fell and new celestial realms regenerated!</p><p></p><p>So within the Wan Xian Alliance's territory, an incredible scene unfolded. Cultivators swarmed like locusts, meticulously inspecting every inch of land - deep mountains, great lakes, jungles...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The swamp, not sparing any suspicious place.</p><p>The originally desolate wilderness was suddenly filled with the figures of cultivators.</p><p>It was at this moment that people suddenly realized that the number of cultivators in the Myriad Immortal Alliance was actually so many.</p><p>Under such circumstances, it didn't take long before the first small world not under the rule of the Immortal Alliance was discovered.</p><p>Named [Zhuo], it is a barren small world inhabited only by mortals, without any spiritual energy.</p><p>The lucky one called Cheng Shi used the Heavenly Profound Mirror to complete the world scan in less than three days.</p><p>No one knows exactly how many rewards he obtained, but after this incident, Cheng Shi directly purchased a villa in the Heavenly Fate City's Grotto-Heaven District, moved in, and never went out again, focusing on cultivation. Just waiting for the Immortal Alliance to release the Grotto-Heaven exchange, and then directly reaching the Nascent Soul realm!</p><p>This vivid example was right before their eyes, and the cultivators became more and more excited.</p><p>Soon, the second and third small Grotto-Heaven worlds were discovered in succession.</p><p>While the cultivators were immersed in a general celebration, Xu Bai also arrived in the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p>"Whether to generate a private version of the [Heavenly Profound Mirror]?" The prompt of the Heavenly Profound Mirror sounded in his ear, with a touch of liveliness compared to the previous emotionless mechanical voice.</p><p>Xu Bai pondered for a moment and chose "yes".</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the rhombic crystal made from the Apocalypse Disc was emitting a colorful glow.</p><p>This was the preliminary plan proposed by Fang Zaijie and others after a brief study.</p><p>In order to prevent the Heavenly Profound Mirror from secretly scanning the content in the sea of consciousness, they used the shielding function of the Apocalypse Disc to protect their own sea of consciousness.</p><p>To ensure that no abnormalities would be detected by the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p>Of course, these exposed thoughts were actively released and unimportant, deliberately allowing the Heavenly Profound Mirror to perceive them.</p><p>In simple terms, it was like adding a lock in the sea of consciousness to prevent the Heavenly Profound Mirror from peeking.</p><p>After several experiments, the effect of sea of consciousness protection was indeed achieved. Fang Zaijie was studying the method of physical protection.</p><p>The main body was in the Longevity Valley, concentrating and waiting. If there was any problem, he would return to the real body immediately.</p><p>As for Xu Bai, he quietly observed the changes in his own sea of consciousness.</p><p>It seemed that there was an invisible fluctuation passing through his body.</p><p>After a moment, a square ancient bronze mirror appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>The rhombic crystal was quietly floating above it, and the Heavenly Profound Mirror did not detect it at all.</p><p>"It seems to be safe." Xu Bai thought to himself.</p><p>His divine sense contacted it, and a lot of information immediately surfaced.</p><p>Consistent with what he had previously understood, all kinds of functions were complete.</p><p>"Indeed, it is convenient." Xu Bai's divine thought moved, and the entire map of the Myriad Immortal Alliance instantly appeared in his mind. Moreover, he could clearly see four prominent red dots flashing on the map, as well as six calm green dots.</p><p>"Red represents the worlds that are being shared by cultivators and are still in the process of conquest, while green represents the worlds that have been fully explored."</p><p>Xu Bai understood.</p><p>His gaze swept over Shi Linzhou, and seeing that the place he remembered had not yet been discovered, Xu Bai revealed a slight smile.</p><p>After leaving the Heavenly Profound Mirror, he headed straight for his destination.</p><p>Yes, the place he was going to was the [Empire] created by Xu Ke!</p><p>"I wonder what price they will be willing to pay for the treasures that can be immune to the Xuanhuang Realm's conquest?"</p><p>"And when they see this body that is completely identical to Xu Ke's appearance, what will their reaction be?"</p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

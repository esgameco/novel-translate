            <p>Chapter 1007: Seeing All Beings Through the Tianxuan Mirror</p><p></p><p>Like a child who had just received a new toy, Li Fan indulged in browsing the information within the Tianxuan Mirror. He only regretted that the quality of the Huadao Stone in his Sea of Consciousness was not high enough to record and preserve everything he saw and heard.</p><p></p><p>This information, which every cultivator regarded as top secret, was now laid bare before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>It also included all the transaction details of all the materials circulated in the Immortal Alliance market since records began.</p><p></p><p>It was a dazzling array that made his eyes blossom.</p><p></p><p>Even more valuable were the cultivation data records of all cultivators using [Enlightenment].</p><p></p><p>The cultivation efficiency of each cultivator was fully visible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror was like a boundless ocean full of treasures, and Li Fan was lost in it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the data contained in the Tianxuan Mirror was simply too vast. It was even constantly increasing every moment.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to fully grasp it all.</p><p></p><p>He could only record some of the important information first.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that the information he was browsing at the moment must also be under the supervision of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, as the vast majority of this information he would not use in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it would come in handy in each of his future reincarnations in the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror was like an endless ocean, and Li Fan was like someone digging a canal on the beach, constantly drawing the seawater into himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the progress was a bit slow, it was steadily proceeding.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed the Tianxuan Mirror in his bosom, maintaining the reading of information.</p><p></p><p>He then quietly left this bamboo sea cave and returned to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>When the amount of information browsed reached a certain level, almost bursting the middle-grade Huadao Stone in his Sea of Consciousness, he slowed down the recording.</p><p></p><p>He then began to browse the information about the existing Huadao Stone items in the Wanxian Alliance recorded within.</p><p></p><p>"A fragment of the Stone Mother."</p><p></p><p>"Three top-grade, sixteen high-grade."</p><p></p><p>"Middle-grade, hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"No more middle-grade?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At first, Li Fan thought he had recorded it wrong.</p><p></p><p>But after checking it again, he found no errors.</p><p></p><p>Huadao Stones all originated from the Huadao Stone Mother and could be fused with each other to advance to higher qualities.</p><p></p><p>"Surely the cultivators in the Wanxian Alliance who mastered the secret techniques of Huadao Stones had long swept up all the circulating and appearing Huadao Stones."</p><p></p><p>"As soon as a new one appears, it will be immediately obtained by various means."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, no wonder I couldn't buy any even with contribution points."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed as he began to check the list of cultivators possessing Huadao Stones.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, a sense of absurdity immediately welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The owner of the Stone Mother fragment is actually an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>The identities of the cultivators recorded in the Tianxuan Mirror holding the other top-grade and high-grade Huadao Stones were also all Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was clear to the discerning eye that these identities were definitely disguised.</p><p></p><p>"The innocent are not guilty, but possessing such treasures is a crime. Such supreme treasures are not something Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators can possess."</p><p></p><p>"Such identity disguises can indeed block the investigations of some malicious cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"But as long as it exists, there must be connections. All the clues that have ever occurred are faithfully recorded by the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"How can they..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Escaped my pursuit..." </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan simply stopped pretending in front of the Tianxuan Mirror, and revealed all the detailed information of these twenty empty shell cultivators.</p><p></p><p>From their initial entry into the Tianxuan Mirror, to their cultivation up to now, all their communications, trading partners, including their referrers.</p><p></p><p>And then these secondary suspects were also subjected to data retrieval.</p><p></p><p>Like layers of a giant net, constantly weaving and extending.</p><p></p><p>When the level of relationships reached "five", the number of cultivators involved in the network had already reached a staggering hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>"Among these, some can be directly excluded."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pressed his aching head that had been overloaded with transmission, and rested for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he started searching for targets among them again.</p><p></p><p>After repeated comparisons and eliminations.</p><p></p><p>The list was finally narrowed down to within a hundred people.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation levels ranged from Yuanying to Hedao.</p><p></p><p>"First, focus on monitoring their recent movements in the Tianxuan Mirror, and then have Mo Rubin help investigate in secret."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan had already made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of these hundred people held positions in the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It was almost impossible for him to investigate alone.</p><p></p><p>Without special relationships, he might not even get to meet them in his entire life.</p><p></p><p>However, if the investigation came from the Dharma Transmitter, from top to bottom, then it would certainly be much easier.</p><p></p><p>"The Huadao Stone is too useful. If it weren't for the fact that the Taiyan Sect's Stone Mother has already been informationized, I would be tempted to risk everything and openly rob it."</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of the escaping wisp of white light during the destruction of the 115th world, Li Fan still calmed down and faced reality.</p><p></p><p>Being able to successfully escape from the crisis of a true immortal's world destruction, it was obviously not something that the current Li Fan could deal with.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following period of time, Li Fan lived quite a fulfilling life.</p><p></p><p>The Doomsday Dissociation Disc operated at maximum efficiency, absorbing the essence of the Wanling Guishu Array and continuously deriving new possibilities for formations.</p><p></p><p>The Huadao Stone classified and integrated the information obtained from the Tianxuan Mirror, selecting the valuable parts.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan himself, he was wandering around in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Like being transparent, no one could see him, but he could glimpse everyone.</p><p></p><p>Their conversations, cultivation, transactions.</p><p></p><p>With the cover of the Tianxuan Mirror, the cultivators were much more unrestrained compared to the real world.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Li Fan to see a more authentic image of the living beings.</p><p></p><p>For example, good friends who were calling each other brothers one moment, cursed each other as soon as they parted.</p><p></p><p>For example, countless cultivators, like He Zhenghao at the beginning, sought the dream of getting rich overnight. They tried every means to pursue various "investment" methods. In the end, they lost all their capital. At that time, they secretly vowed that they would definitely not be so muddled again. But when they accumulated another sum of wealth, they couldn't resist the temptation and threw themselves into it again. In the end, they met the same fate.</p><p></p><p>Another example, a considerable number of cultivators, after trying cultivation, felt that with their own talent and cultivation speed, it was definitely difficult to achieve great things in this life.</p><p></p><p>So they gave up their ambitions and just did the most basic and safe tasks.</p><p></p><p>Earning enough to satisfy their survival needs in the Tianxuan Mirror, they then resided there for a long time without leaving. Anyway, in the space of the Tianxuan Mirror, there were no natural disasters, no illness, and no worries.</p><p></p><p>Without various desires, they lived a carefree life.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Watching the different lives of different cultivators, Li Fan's mentality also unknowingly underwent a subtle change again.</p>

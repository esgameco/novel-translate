        <h1>Chapter 1259</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was only darkness surrounding Wu Ninglu, and she couldn't find the source of the voice. </p><p></p><p>And that voice kept laughing strangely, constantly stimulating her.</p><p></p><p>"Come out!" Wu Ninglu roared frantically.</p><p></p><p>The other party didn't respond, but instead, one picture after another illuminated the darkness. </p><p></p><p>When Wu Ninglu looked, the resentment in her heart immediately rose to another level.</p><p></p><p>It was the lively scene of Sun Tianzi, the Qilin son of the Sun family, being born in accordance with the Dao, shaking the world, and all the major families of the Wanxian Alliance sending people to congratulate him.</p><p></p><p>This even included her own family, the Chen family of the Medicine Hall! Despite having already torn their faces with the Sun family before, they still sent an envoy to congratulate them. As the saying goes, don't hit a smiling person with an outstretched hand. For the sake of the newly born Sun Tianzi, they also accepted the congratulatory gifts with great magnanimity.</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Ninglu, the inexplicably missing biological mother of Sun Tianzi, no one cared about her at all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Originally, all this glory and praise should have been mine!"</p><p></p><p>The strong contrast in circumstances between mother and son made Wu Ninglu, who was in the darkness, even more insane.</p><p></p><p>Crying and shouting, like ghosts wailing and wolves howling.</p><p></p><p>At this time, that voice finally sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>"Want to take revenge on them?"</p><p></p><p>Instinct drove Wu Ninglu to want to curse loudly, but her remaining bit of reason made her slowly calm down.</p><p></p><p>She answered without hesitation: "I want to! Senior, save me!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>A wild laugh came from the darkness: "Your body and soul have already disappeared from this world, leaving only a few remnants of spiritual thoughts. Even if you can be resurrected, how can you fight against the five Dao-achieving members of the Sun family?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Wu Ninglu's thoughts instantly went blank.</p><p></p><p>That's right, let alone that she was already in this state. Even if she successfully devoured the essence of heaven and earth and achieved the Dao herself, how could she be an opponent to the Sun family, a rising new family in full swing, with just the strength of one person?</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu was in utter despair, but suddenly thought that this senior, who could save her in front of the three Dao-achievers, definitely wouldn't just be teasing her for fun.</p><p></p><p>The reason for still saying this...</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"I still hope that the senior will teach me! Whether it succeeds or not, Ninglu is willing to be a cow, a horse, a slave, a maid, and serve by the senior's side!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, you're just a remnant thought struggling to survive, do I need your willingness to control you?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful pressure enveloped Wu Ninglu, and in the terrible suffocation, Wu Ninglu only felt that her cautious thoughts could be completely destroyed at any time.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts became weaker and weaker, and Wu Ninglu's heart was filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sense of urgency around her inexplicably disappeared.</p><p></p><p>That voice, like heavenly music, sounded in her ears again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an extremely profound text also appeared in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The Three Disasters and Hundred Tribulations Divine Method.</p><p></p><p>One thought gives birth to ten thousand demons, this is a supreme divine skill that can make up for the gap in the number of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu read every word in it as if she was starving and thirsty.</p><p></p><p>"Sun family, Sun family..."</p><p></p><p>Under the support of the terrible obsession of wanting revenge in her mind, the first murderous intent demon god slowly gestated.</p><p></p><p>Hiding in the darkness, Li Fan, who saw the whole process of this change, nodded slightly with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sun family's saint could be said to have been personally cultivated by him, it did not prevent him from creating a natural nemesis for the other party.</p><p></p><p>As for when this future supreme demon god, who only had the desire for revenge left, would be released, or even whether she would be released at all.</p><p></p><p>It was still an unknown.</p><p></p><p>Everything was just a casual backup he left.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, many preparations have already been made. Next, we just need to wait for the good show to start."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the personality of the Holy Emperor and the current comparison of the situation between the two sides, the first battle between the two sides won't be too far away."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three months later, the first confrontation between the Holy Dynasty and the Wanxian Alliance took the stage in a way that no one had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>The origin of the conflict, however, was due to a sword light that came from outside the sky.</p><p></p><p>That day, golden light was like a rainbow, shining in the sky.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the starry sea, under the high wall, the Xuanshang Immortal Boat, floating and crossing tribulations.</p><p></p><p>In the seven-colored rainbow light that could be seen throughout the Xuanhuang Realm, sixteen characters shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a peculiar form of information dissemination. Even if someone from the Wanxian Alliance tried to remove it, it had no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>They could only let this rainbow light float quietly in the sky for seven days before it slowly faded away.</p><p></p><p>However, the shock brought by these sixteen characters was far from subsiding.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it showed signs of intensifying.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun recalled these sixteen characters and was in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"I knew he wasn't dead. On the other side of the starry sea, under the high wall..."</p><p></p><p>"Has he gone this far?"</p><p></p><p>The carefree and unrestrained appearance of the Holy Fetus Li Fan appeared in Shang Shaojun's mind again, making him feel a little nostalgia and a hint of loss.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If I had abandoned everything and gone with him back then, what kind of situation would it be now?"</p><p></p><p>After being in a daze for a while, Shang Shaojun finally came back to his senses and started doing proper things.</p><p></p><p>He began to send messages to people like Di Yijinglun and Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen the rainbow in the sky these past few days? That is exactly the white-clothed sword immortal I introduced to you before. You said that I exaggerated a lot in my words back then, how about now?"</p><p></p><p>After showing off with satisfaction, Shang Shaojun also inquired about the amount of Kongming Flowing Crystal in his private treasury.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wanxian Alliance had long listed it as a prohibited item for circulation, in fact, all the major families of the Immortal Alliance had more or less secretly hidden it.</p><p></p><p>Previously, this item had been gradually forgotten, but with the appearance of the seven-day rainbow light, Kongming Flowing Crystal once again returned to the public eye.</p><p></p><p>The world didn't know how exactly the Holy Fetus Li Fan left the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>So they instinctively guessed that the method he used was the same as the sixteen Dao-achievers who had left the Wanxian Alliance before.</p><p></p><p>The sixteen Dao-achievers went into the depths of the starry sea for some unknown reason, but the information conveyed by the rainbow light made it clear.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the starry sea, in a place called the High Wall, there is an immortal boat called Xuanshang.</p><p></p><p>This Xuanshang Immortal Boat has supreme dharma, and can float and cross tribulations!</p><p></p><p>Just sixteen short words, but it made countless cultivators' minds sway and their imaginations run wild, unable to control themselves.</p><p></p><p>The cleverness of this message from the Holy Fetus Li Fan was in its vagueness.</p><p></p><p>It fully exerted the subjective initiative of the Xuanhuang cultivators, making the Xuanxian boat in their imagination more and more mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators even searched through ancient books and found records about the Xuanshang Immortal Boat from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to travel and shuttle between various realms for trade, and after so many years, it must be much more developed than our Xuanhuang Realm that is full of hardships!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, the previous rainbow light..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Rainbow light, could it be..." </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, watch your words!"</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the facts, the Kongming Crystals have indeed once again become the hottest item in the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Alliance reissued the prohibition, it was simply unable to stop the various families from privately collecting Kongming Crystals.</p><p></p><p>After all, this time, there were too many cultivators doing this.</p><p></p><p>It truly reached the point of the law not being able to punish the majority.</p><p></p><p>So they could only make an example out of the low-level cultivators without foundation, to deter others.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even the high-level members of the Immortal Alliance themselves had differing opinions.</p><p></p><p>Sun Family.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan returned to the secret room of the Boundless Mirror, feeling worried.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, are you worried about the recent sensational news of the Rainbow Light Transmission?" asked Sun Luyao, the spirit of the Boundless Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, not just that. The key is that this matter involves too much. Even the Keeper of the Mirror, Fudu, who was punished by the Dharma Transmission to closed-door cultivation, has ended his seclusion early because of this. He even specifically asked me about Tianxi. This old thing..." Sun Luyuan said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>"His meaning is, although the Dharma Transmitter Jiang is suppressing it this time, it has caused too much of a stir after all. In the entire Myriad Immortal Alliance, all the cultivators now hope to know what exactly is the situation beyond the Xuanhuang Realm, on the other side of the starry sea. If no explanation is given, I'm afraid it will lead to instability in the foundation of the Immortal Alliance. But the Celestial Venerable has lost contact since the last transmission..."</p><p></p><p>"In order to stabilize the situation, the Immortal Alliance plans to announce to the world soon that they will recreate the Kongming Rainbow Light and fly out of Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"Controlling the Rainbow Light requires a cultivator at the Harmonious Dao realm. Our Sun Family's reputation has been too prosperous recently, with five Harmonious Dao members in one family, known to everyone in the Myriad Immortal Alliance. I'm worried that if they really look for suitable cultivators to go to the starry space, our Sun Family probably won't be able to escape it."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly hard to predict fortune or misfortune. If I had known earlier, the matter of Tianxi being born at the Harmonious Dao realm shouldn't have been publicized so grandly. It was also our mistake, our heads got muddled for a moment." Sun Luyuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Boundless Mirror spirit Sun Luyao also frowned, feeling it was difficult to handle.</p><p></p><p>"According to the clues I previously collected inside the Tianxuan Mirror, beyond the starry space, I'm afraid there are grave dangers everywhere. Even if there was the precedent of Kongming Rainbow Light before, going this time is still a matter of life and death." After a long while, he said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The few of us have already discussed this. If the imperial edict really comes, we basically can't escape it. We'll have Lu Chang go. I'm just afraid..." </p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan paused and sighed, his voice suddenly much lower: "I'm just afraid the ones arranged from our Sun Family won't be just one person."</p><p></p><p>The underground secret room instantly became much quieter.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I do have a clever plan."</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, Sun Luyao suddenly suggested.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan listened attentively, his eyes lighting up.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, there were rumors circulating in various places of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The high-level of the Myriad Immortal Alliance has already agreed to the plan of recreating the Kongming Crystals. This time, the number of cultivators who can leave Xuanhuang and enter the starry space may be even more than before.</p><p></p><p>However, the specific quota of cultivators has likely already been divided up by the upper echelons, decided internally long ago. Some powerful families even have more than one.</p><p></p><p>Such earth-shattering news instantly spread like wildfire.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the cultivators were all filled with righteous indignation and anger.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the starry space, what great opportunities and fortuitous encounters await?!</p><p></p><p>They just decided to allocate it like this?</p><p></p><p>Completely disregarding the feelings of those grassroots Harmonious Dao cultivators who worked hard to suppress the various states.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Alliance quickly refuted this news, as long as the list was not finalized, the repercussions of this matter were bound to be difficult to quell.</p><p></p><p>There were even many Harmonious Dao guardians of various state domains who hadn't returned to the Immortal Alliance headquarters for many years, but unprecedentedly returned, just for an answer.</p><p></p><p>As for the Immortal Alliance's repeated emphasis that going out to the starry sea may have fatal dangers, and the probability of safely returning was almost negligible, it was all dismissed as excuses by them in their rage.</p><p></p><p>They also had a set of retorts.</p><p></p><p>It is said that hearing the Dao in the morning, one can die content in the evening. What is there to fear about mere danger?</p><p></p><p>Who among those who could achieve Harmonious Dao did not walk a bumpy road to get there?</p><p></p><p>Being trapped in Xuanhuang for a lifetime, if one can die in the starry sea, there would be no regrets.</p><p></p><p>The Harmonious Dao guardians of various states are the cornerstone of the Immortal Alliance's rule.</p><p></p><p>Now that these people have united, even the Dharma Transmitters have some headaches.</p><p></p><p>In the end, after serious discussions, they also gave a response.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance will carefully consider the drafting of the personnel list, striving to be fair and just, and convincing to the world. </p><p></p><p>With the Dharma Transmitters personally guaranteeing it, the group of guardian Harmonious Dao cultivators finally left the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, this also confirmed the previous rumors that the Immortal Alliance wanted to recreate the Kongming Rainbow Light.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance also privately discussed this.</p><p></p><p>With the first time, the second time, the Myriad Immortal Alliance's exploration of the starry space will certainly not stop there.</p><p></p><p>And even if they have no hope of reaching Harmonious Dao in this lifetime, the Kongming Crystals, at least that's something they can obtain, right?</p><p></p><p>If they can't enjoy the meat, can't they at least drink some of the light?</p><p></p><p>In private market transactions, the price of Kongming Crystals skyrocketed again. As long as they appeared, no matter how high the price, they would be immediately snapped up.</p><p></p><p>And some smart people have already begun to go to various secret realm small worlds, digging three feet into the ground, searching everywhere for traces of these Kongming Crystals.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty has begun.</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Emperor's seat, Li Ping's disciples are lined up.</p><p></p><p>They were already aware of the turmoil in the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But all matters of the Holy Dynasty are decided by a single word from the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not speak, so they could only act as if this matter never happened at all.</p><p></p><p>"Master, should we get involved with those Kongming Crystals?"</p><p></p><p>"Breaking out of the Xuanhuang Realm and exploring the unknown starry sea, just thinking about it is exciting." Ou Shangtian, who had the biggest guts, asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Myriad Immortal Alliance wants to court death, let them go. The more Harmonious Dao cultivators they send out, the better for us." The Holy Emperor's single casual sentence determined the direction of this matter.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian showed a somewhat regretful expression.</p><p></p><p>But the others were pondering the meaning behind the Holy Emperor's words.</p><p></p><p>"Next, you must be on strict guard and be ready for battle at any time."</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Emperor's next words made them jolt to attention.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang nodded: "Those Myriad Immortal Alliance cultivators are now acting like lunatics, searching everywhere for those Kongming Crystals in various small worlds. Our Holy Dynasty is fine, they definitely won't be able to encounter any. The main issue is those many subordinate small worlds we have already conquered..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said: "Don't directly clash with them for now, but there's also no need to deliberately avoid them."</p><p></p><p>"When you make a move, be decisive, and don't leak any information related to the Holy Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's words made the disciples eager to have a go.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Erlang."</p><p></p><p>"This disciple is here."</p><p></p><p>"Yi Shu has stayed with us long enough. You go with him and make another trip back to Taiyi Sect." The Holy Emperor said calmly.</p>

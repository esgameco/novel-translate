            <p>Chapter 810: Turning the Myriad Realms into Pastures</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing digested the contents in her mind, and then looked at the compassionate Immortal Master in front of her, asking, "Immortal Master, when will you leave? Just me alone..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stretched out his hand to interrupt her, "No need to worry, believe in yourself. With your talent, you are more than capable of taking on the great responsibility of saving the Separated Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Me?" Su Yuqing was a little confused. But hearing the Immortal Master's encouraging words, she couldn't help but gain confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I won't just leave and completely let go either." Li Fan handed over another jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Things in the world are unpredictable, especially when it involves the battle of worlds. If you really encounter difficulties that you can't handle, you can use this jade talisman to contact my disciples. If any of them are near the Separated Realm, they will come to help."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Yuqing couldn't help but widen her eyes, "Immortal Master, you have many disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked the white beard he transformed and smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>At first, Su Yuqing was a little hesitant. </p><p></p><p>But finally mustered the courage to ask, "Immortal Master, am I... also considered your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan neither confirmed nor denied it.</p><p></p><p>He only left her with an unfathomable back view, "That depends on your performance in this Separated Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Walking through the mortal world of myriad realms, saving the living beings with just one thought."</p><p></p><p>"No one knows my true name, I am originally the Compassionate Immortal of the mortal world!"</p><p></p><p>On the small Immortal Mountain, Su Yuqing listened to the poetic lines lingering in the air for a long time, staring blankly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Compassionate Immortal of the mortal world..."</p><p></p><p>"It does fit very well with what the Immortal Master has been doing." Su Yuqing thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Immortal Master full of compassion in Su Yuqing's mind had already flown out of the Separated Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The corpses of exotic beasts stored in the [Immortal Spirit Tower] are enough to support the cultivation of the people in the Separated Realm for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>"However, to truly turn the Primordial Realm into my pasture as it drifts through the myriad realms, the issue of spiritual energy sources must be thoroughly resolved."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered inwardly, "I'm afraid relying on just one Beast Realm alone won't be enough even if it's completely slaughtered."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I still need to make a trip to the Empire."</p><p></p><p>"At the current Golden Core realm, my strength is too low. I urgently need to find a helper."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the image of that towering red and black puppet flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Tianyang, I once said that if you don't die, I will treat you well. Now, it's time to fulfill my promise!"</p><p></p><p>As everyone knows, Grand Master Li always keeps his word.</p><p></p><p>Having made up his mind, after leaving the Separated Realm, he headed straight for Tianyang Cave.</p><p></p><p>As for the Separated Realm, with the abundant cultivation experience Li Fan imparted to Su Yuqing, there shouldn't be any problems in the short term.</p><p></p><p>It was determined that in 14 years, Tianyang would awaken from his slumber.</p><p></p><p>No one would have imagined that deep under the sea, an ancient puppet was sleeping, using the power of earth fire to continuously strengthen itself day and night.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Fire Convergence Formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the [Ultimate Disintegration Disc] in his mind emitted a faint glow, and had already found the weakness of the formation here.</p><p></p><p>"It's really too fast."</p><p></p><p>Even though he had already estimated the abilities of the fully formed Disintegration Disc, Li Fan still felt a little shocked when he actually used it to break a formation for the first time.</p><p></p><p>You should know that skilled formation masters often adapt to local conditions. They slightly adjust the formations according to the environment.</p><p></p><p>So even if one is very familiar with the structure of the formations, when it comes to breaking actual formations, one still needs to be careful...</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Shen, Fei spent a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>But the Dissociation Disc had already considered the impact of various environments on the formation.</p><p></p><p>Many variations had long existed in its database.</p><p></p><p>It only needed to compare and call upon them to find a solution in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Even if the formation was a bit strange, with the Doomsday Dissociation Disc's terrifying computing power, cracking it was only a matter of moments.</p><p></p><p>Unknown formations, instead, could further strengthen the Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the entire process of the Doomsday Dissociation Disc breaking the formation, Li Fan even felt a sense of sorrow as a formation master.</p><p></p><p>He felt that all the formations he had painstakingly learned over several lifetimes had become a joke in front of it.</p><p></p><p>"With this thing out, formation masters in the world can no longer have any pride."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it's in my hands."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed as he passed through the Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation and came to Tianyang's side.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Tianyang puppet was not as huge as it would be a few years later.</p><p></p><p>It was only the size of a child, seemingly Tianyang's original appearance.</p><p></p><p>The surging earth fire, under the guidance of the Returning to Origin Formation, turned into wisps of scorching red energy absorbed by the puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>During the process of coming, Li Fan had already operated the Myriad Phenomena Melting Furnace Technique and transformed into the appearance of Senior Brother Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this time, Tianyang emerged early and seemed to be a bit underdeveloped.</p><p></p><p>His spirit was listless.</p><p></p><p>His strength had also barely reached the late stage of Hua Shen.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>Rather than wasting time slowly absorbing the power of earth fire at the bottom of the sea,</p><p></p><p>it was better to follow behind Li Fan and prepare for advancing to the Harmony Dao stage as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "treating well" was not just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Scarlet Flame and Azure Wind of the Cong Yun Sea,</p><p></p><p>and the [Black Marsh] where Long Jiuyuan had reached the Harmony Dao stage in the previous life,</p><p></p><p>just based on the Earth Souls hidden in various places of the Xuanhuang Realm that Li Fan knew from synchronizing with Mr. White's memories,</p><p></p><p>there were no less than five locations.</p><p></p><p>If given enough power, creating five or six Harmony Dao cultivators in an instant was not a difficult matter at all.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the birth of Harmony Dao cultivators will inevitably attract the attention of powerful figures in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Especially at this point in time, the Dharma Transmission should not have left the Xuanhuang Realm yet. So we need to be a bit more cautious."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan sat on Tianyang's shoulder and rushed towards the entrance of another small world he remembered.</p><p></p><p>To form a true alliance of myriad worlds, a safe and secret base was certainly indispensable.</p><p></p><p>The place couldn't be too small and needed to have sufficient spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The local resistance forces also couldn't be too strong.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the Myriad Immortals Alliance cleansing the various realms in the previous life,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan happened to know of a small world that satisfied all the above requirements.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the small world was located in Shilin Prefecture,</p><p></p><p>in the stone forest where the ruins of the Heavenly Mechanism Sect were once discovered.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Li Fan had been to this place but had not detected the existence of the spatial passage at all.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to show how well-hidden it was.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in the previous life, it was only after the Taiyi Sect surrendered</p><p></p><p>that they actively came out and pledged allegiance.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even with the help of the Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance might not have easily found this small world.</p><p></p><p>The underground stone caves twisted and turned.</p><p></p><p>Even with the memories of his previous life, Li Fan spent a good half a day before finding the specific location.</p><p></p><p>In a karst cave with thousands of stalactites, Li Fan discerned for a long time before detecting where the entrance was.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the special terrain here also has a certain effect on concealing the spatial passage."</p><p></p><p>"It suits my intentions well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, and with a light point of his finger, spatial fluctuations appeared in one of the stone pillars.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang puppet carried Li Fan and flew into it.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>There are still some chapters to go, around 1:30.</p><p></p><p>Brothers, don't wait.</p>

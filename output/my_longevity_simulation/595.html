        <h1>Chapter 595</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There were only Han Yi and the fisherman.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman spoke, and naturally the question was directed at Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>When a strong one asks, how could one not answer?</p><p></p><p>Han Yi suddenly felt a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>But his own life was important, and he absolutely dared not go against the other party. Helplessly flying over, landing on the ground, bowing his head in a salute, he said, "Greetings, senior?"</p><p></p><p>Who knew, the fisherman didn't buy into his act.</p><p></p><p>Furrowing his brows, he asked again, "Where did you come from?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's heart beat intensified, his mind felt like it was going to explode.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, avoiding the answer had already displeased the other party!</p><p></p><p>As they say, things come in threes. If his next answer also failed to satisfy the other party, he might end up losing his head on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's mind raced madly, but in an instant, he thought of an ambiguous answer.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the other's expression was starting to show impatience, Han Yi gritted his teeth and said, "Junior came to search for something. New69BookBarâ†’69shux.com.</p><p></p><p>"Following the traces, traveling thousands of miles to this place but losing track, never to be found again."</p><p></p><p>He then lowered his head, waiting for his next fate.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that the strange and powerful man in front of him did not blame him.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, his tone became somewhat absent-minded as he said, "So, you also lost something?"</p><p></p><p>"Also?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this word, Han Yi immediately realized where his lifeline lay and quickly nodded, saying, "Exactly. This item is very important to me, so I've traveled far and wide in search of it. Unfortunately, things didn't go as I wished..."</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman's tone became less cold.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Han Yi and nodded in agreement, saying, "Precious things should be kept safe. Once lost, trying to find them back can be troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"I've been searching for it for a long time, but still haven't found it."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Han Yi didn't dare to ask what exactly the fisherman had lost.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he had temporarily saved his skin, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to casually continue, he simply said, "I've reflected on your teachings, senior."</p><p></p><p>Then he bowed his head in silence, no longer thinking about any opportunities, just praying for the old fisherman to leave soon.</p><p></p><p>However, what made his heart stop happened again.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he suddenly heard the other party say, "You're being watched!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi froze in place.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that he would soon fall into the hands of the other, at that moment, many images flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>From discovering the "Fate Scripture" in an ancient ruin when just entering the Qi training period, to the struggles he faced due to practicing this scripture, and the times he narrowly escaped death in the world of exotic beasts, returning with renewed determination for cultivation...</p><p></p><p>"Am I going to die?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was in despair, the fisherman furrowed his brows and said, "No wonder you can't find it, it turns out someone's watching you?"</p><p></p><p>He then casually waved his hand, as if cutting something.</p><p></p><p>Not waiting for death, Han Yi instead felt a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>As if a shackle that had been weighing on him for a long time had suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Someone's watching me, what does it mean?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was initially confused, then shocked.</p><p></p><p>"I've also been under surveillance?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, all this time, I've had this feeling that nothing was going smoothly. So, my every move has been under someone else's control?"</p><p></p><p>Sweat broke on Han Yi's forehead in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"When?"</p><p></p><p>Various faces flashed through Han Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>Each one seemed suspicious, yet none really matched.</p><p></p><p>"You youngsters..." The old fisherman shook his head as he saw Han Yi's pale face.</p><p></p><p>"Being alone and away from home, one must be cautious about everything. Being watched for so long, wouldn't all your secrets be revealed?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the thing you're looking for has been stolen long ago." The fisherman looked disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not entirely your fault..." Suddenly, the fisherman's tone changed.</p><p></p><p>He frowned slightly, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The people in this place have some unpleasant habits."</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he seemed to recall something, his expression becoming serious.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please save me!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the fisherman's sudden display of kindness, like that of a neighborly elder, that made Han Yi relax.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe it was the shock of suddenly realizing that he had been under surveillance all this time without realizing it.</p><p></p><p>Now, distracted, Han Yi knelt down in front of the fisherman and begged for help.</p><p></p><p>"Save you?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the fisherman was also puzzled by Han Yi's request.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, that person has already been severely dealt with by me, and won't see you again."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Han Yi was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, senior, who was the one monitoring me, and what did they look like?"</p><p></p><p>The fisherman was a bit embarrassed, "The distance was too far, my eyesight is not that great, I couldn't see clearly..."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I still ask senior to help identify them." Han Yi, clutching at this lifeline, felt that if he didn't figure out who was monitoring him, he would find it hard to live in peace or cultivate serenely in the future.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, using the Water Mirror Technique, he reproduced all the key suspicious characters he had encountered over the years.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was about to speak when he suddenly felt a strange atmosphere in the air.</p><p></p><p>Turning his head, he immediately felt something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>He had panicked and mistakenly drawn the scene he had seen in the sky, the "Green Wind Trapped Sword."</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the old fisherman was staring fixedly at that scene.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, the external features of the spirit of heaven and earth are so obvious, did he find out?" Han Yi regretted deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Sword..."</p><p></p><p>However, what the old fisherman seemed to be interested in was not the spirit of heaven and earth at all.</p><p></p><p>"Sword?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's gaze also fell on the broken sword trapped by the Green Wind.</p><p></p><p>"I've been searching for it for a long time, but still haven't found it."</p><p></p><p>The words the old fisherman spoke not long ago were still fresh in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>A horrifying thought emerged in Han Yi's mind before he could react.</p><p></p><p>Before he could do or say anything, he felt the fisherman's muddy eyes staring at him.</p>

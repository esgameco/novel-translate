        <h1>Chapter 526</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"At that time, we were still too young after all. We thought we had hidden deep enough, but we never expected that true strong individuals could see through our cultivation techniques with just a drop of blood."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation techniques of the Xuantian Sect are divided from top to bottom into four levels: Xuan, Tian, Di, and Huang. The four techniques we obtained from that ruin are all the highest level Xuan techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Not only are they mysterious and godly, but they are not under the genuine transmission of the Daoist school. There is another wonderful aspect that even Ji Changxi, the head of the Daoist school, couldn't help but be impressed by."</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that all the Xuantian Sect's cultivation techniques come from the Xuantian Sect's treasure: the Xuantian Treasure Mirror. Therefore, when reaching a high level, one can establish a connection with the Xuantian Treasure Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Even though Ji Changxi wanted nothing more than to capture us on the spot and interrogate us thoroughly, he also knew that the Xuantian Sect's cultivation techniques come with their own secrecy measures. Even if outsiders try to forcefully investigate, they will only obtain altered and distorted false techniques."</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate these techniques, one must willingly and personally write them down. Moreover, at that time, his strength was only at the mid-stage of the Harmony Realm, not much stronger than me. If he were to force us, the odds of success are not high."</p><p></p><p>"So, he prepared to lay a long line, fishing for big fish."</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi suddenly sneered, "On one hand, he deliberately sent us out on various missions to suppress our growth in strength. While he himself used the resources and authority held by the head to enhance his own cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"On the other hand, he searched through various classics, attempting to find a way to decipher the encryption of the Xuantian Sect's cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, he almost succeeded. From the secret archives of the Daoist school, Ji Changxi found the inheritance obtained after the destruction of the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Among them was a secret technique called 'Take Heaven and Replace,' which the Xuantian Sect used to deal with its own people. It not only strips the opponent of their techniques and cultivation but can also transfer the realms and powers gained from practicing the Xuantian Sect's techniques, akin to transferring flowers from one plant to another."</p><p></p><p>"So, the moment we returned to the mountain gate, he couldn't wait to summon me to meet him..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi's face underwent several changes, and in the distorted light and shadow, it transformed back into the stunning appearance of Senior Zhao.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, despite all his calculations, he didn't anticipate that I wasn't practicing just one Xuantian Sect cultivation technique."</p><p></p><p>"What he didn't expect was that I had long been displeased with him and wanted to take his place."</p><p></p><p>Senior Zhao reached out and caressed Li Fan's face, her expression confused, "Junior Brother, do you know what kind of pain it is to be soaked in blood filled with the 'Immortal Plague' tens of thousands of times! Even our head, Ji, couldn't resist it."</p><p></p><p>"The only regret is that he was too severely damaged by the 'Immortal Plague,' and I had to give up a part of it."</p><p></p><p>Senior Zhao licked her lips lightly, seemingly reminiscing about the past exquisite flavor.</p><p></p><p>"'Eternal Sole Possession of Mine', as you progress in practice, in this world, there is nothing beyond me. Due to the sinister nature of this technique, you didn't choose it back then."</p><p></p><p>"Now, do you regret it, Junior Brother?" Senior Zhao asked softly.</p><p></p><p>A hint of regret did flash through Li Fan's mind, but he was obstinate, saying, "Hmph, what use is regret? The past is gone, and there is no chance for a do-over..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he felt a strange sensation deep within him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if, if he wished, he truly had the ability to change everything.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>As he pondered deeply, he couldn't fathom where this feeling was coming from, feeling a faint sense of loss and confusion in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Senior Zhao didn't notice the unusual thoughts in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>She continued, "A sip and a bite, everything is predestined. Therefore, Junior Brother, all of this is destined in fate."</p><p></p><p>"I began to perceive Ji Changxi's malice and, in order to preserve our lives, secretly practiced the 'Eternal Sole Possession of Mine,' seeking a lifeline from his schemes."</p><p></p><p>"This technique is truly domineering, fully embodying the words 'sole possession.' After practicing it on myself, it even gradually erased your memories of this technique."</p><p></p><p>"And when I finally absorbed Ji, the head, as a part of myself, I finally understood."</p><p></p><p>"This is our fate, this is my destiny."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, with its hustle and bustle, there are too many insignificant people."</p><p></p><p>"Hence, only I remain."</p><p></p><p>"It's 'the myriad together, yet one in heart.'"</p><p></p><p>As Senior Zhao voiced these words, the faces of all the figures in the Daoist school turned into hers.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, do you still love me?"</p><p></p><p>"Merge with your Senior Sister and never part again."</p><p></p><p>With deep affection, they both looked at Li Fan and spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond but remained solemn.</p><p></p><p>A colorful light emerged above his head, shining like a multicolored flying knife.</p><p></p><p>And his aura suddenly erupted, climbing from an ordinary person to higher realms - Refining Qi, Establishing Foundations, Golden Cores...</p><p></p><p>Only stopping at the peak of Nascent Soul, Li Fan had broken through the seals on his body long ago.</p><p></p><p>"I thought you missed me so much, my Junior Brother, that you couldn't wait to cultivate with me."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, you had another purpose, harboring ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>Although saying this, Senior Zhao seemed to have long noticed Li Fan's movements and showed no surprise in her tone.</p><p></p><p>"How? Did you think that by regaining your realm, you could challenge me?" She looked at Li Fan with interest. "Who gave you the courage?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it the 'Soul Extinction Blade' of the 'Soul-Shattering Divine Art'?"</p><p></p><p>Facing Senior Zhao's teasing, Li Fan did not directly respond. Instead, with a serious expression, the colorful black 'Soul Extinction Blade' continuously flickered, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>This 'Soul Extinction Blade' was the ultimate move of the 'Soul-Shattering Divine Art.' Despite its plain name, it was a deadly maneuver that required one to sacrifice their own soul to execute it.</p><p></p><p>"By uniting all and being of one heart, will this path eventually go against the natural order?" Senior Sister Zhao was indeed a talented individual. "But..."</p><p></p><p>"The path you take is not the path I take."</p><p></p><p>"I once said that I wished to form an eternal bond with Senior Sister, to ascend together, and be free and blissful forever."</p><p></p><p>"This statement came from the depths of my heart and remains unchanged."</p><p></p><p>With reminiscence filling his eyes, Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Right at the moment when Senior Zhao seemed slightly lost in thought!</p><p></p><p>An intensely bright light suddenly emanated from within him.</p><p></p><p>Illuminating the sky above the entire Daoist school.</p>

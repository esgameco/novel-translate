            <p>Chapter 1266: Stealing the Power of Darkness</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no choice but to temporarily stop driving the Infinite Mirror. üíî‚ôú‚ùª‚ùæùïä–Ωùêî◊ê.¬¢ùêéùì∂üçîüî•</p><p></p><p>He continued to throw out a mass of refined source power, saving the Infinite Mirror spirit from the brink of death.</p><p></p><p>The refined wish power stored in his body was generated day and night by the one hundred Youzu people in the underground blood pool chamber of the Sun family during this period.</p><p></p><p>Luring out the annihilating wind disaster lurking in the Infinite Mirror consumed a portion of it.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in order to repair the Infinite Mirror's injuries and Li Fan's own avatar, he used some more.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't much left.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan estimated the consumption rate of the refined source power: "Just enough. No need to make another trip back."</p><p></p><p>"It's just..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inadvertently glanced at the center of this small world full of deathly stillness.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the appearance of the refined source power had attracted the attention of the hidden golden skull there. A rather strange feeling, as if being stared at by a monster, welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, even if you had some great background when you were alive, now you are nothing more than a skull. You dare to misbehave in front of me..." With a slight movement of Li Fan's mind, a trapping formation was instantly generated as he stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Locking onto the space where the golden skull was located, he sealed it.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble me again in your next life."</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan had no intention of getting to the bottom of this golden skull.</p><p></p><p>Figuring out the protective formation here, then returning to the Xuanhuang Realm, tracing the effect back to the cause, and finding the hidden traces of the grand protective formation was the top priority.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the refined source power, Sun Luyao slowly woke up from his coma.</p><p></p><p>"Rest for a bit, then continue."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's indifferent words were like a thunderbolt to him.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he didn't have the slightest thought of daring to disobey.</p><p></p><p>Because Sun Luyao knew that the existence of the Infinite Mirror was just a matter of Li Fan's whim.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't impossible for him to directly erase this mirror spirit and find another cultivator's consciousness to replace it.</p><p></p><p>"Although this is somewhat painful for you, in a greater sense it is a kind of tempering. As the saying goes, a thousand refinements make iron, ten thousand refinements make steel. You are just an ordinary person, it's only by a coincidence that you became the Infinite Mirror spirit. You've also seen the current performance of the Infinite Mirror. It immediately struggles between life and death just from analyzing some things, how can it be called an immortal artifact like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Even though there are reasons like the Infinite Mirror being damaged and incomplete, more of it is due to you, this weak mirror spirit." Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>These words made Sun Luyao extremely ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"This refined source power is something even longevity cultivators seek but cannot obtain. Using it on you can be called a complete waste. But I still did it..." Li Fan said in a faint tone.</p><p></p><p>"There is great terror between life and death, and there are also great opportunities between life and death. Contemplate it well!"</p><p></p><p>With that said, Li Fan once again manipulated the Infinite Mirror and began to analyze the remnants of the formation hidden beneath the ruins of the world.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao only felt himself rapidly weakening again, but with Li Fan's previous encouragement, he tried his best to lift his spirits and maintain his mental clarity as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"I must not let Senior down!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's help along the way was beyond doubt, but Sun Luyao himself had never been able to contribute much. Now that he finally had a chance to repay him, Sun Luyao made up his mind not to disappoint Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Sun Luyao also knew that what Li Fan said was indeed true.</p><p></p><p>In the repeated tempering between life and death, his original consciousness was also constantly growing stronger. The growth in these few days alone surpassed the decades he had spent hiding in the Sun family's secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Amidst Sun Luyao's mental agitation, the originally somewhat wavering faint light became stable again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan couldn't help but nod slightly.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty had begun.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping, sitting on the Holy Emperor's throne, had completed the replication and implantation of ten clusters of Xuanhuang Dao Qi.</p><p></p><p>However, due to long periods of uninterrupted work, the cat spirit's mood had somewhat collapsed and it had completely gone on strike.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much refined source power was used to entice it, the cat spirit just pretended not to see it and slept soundly.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor had no choice but to pause for now.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the central four states of the Wanxian Union.</p><p></p><p>"Is the rainbow light for leaving the realm in the Wanxian Union ready?"</p><p></p><p>Having tasted the benefits from the previous acquisition of the true meaning of the Starry Sea origin, the Xuanhuang Realm's Dao consciousness became restless. It instinctively wanted to attach to it again and hitch a ride.</p><p></p><p>But it was dissuaded by Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's premonition told him that the Wanxian Union's journey this time would definitely not be as smooth as his previous one.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Holy Emperor having foresight and judgment of the dangers along the way, which the Wanxian Union had no way to emulate, there was an even more important reason. The members organized by the Immortal Union to explore the Starry Sea this time were all composed of Harmonized Dao cultivators. There was no one with the actual strength to truly command obedience and suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Although in the Xuanhuang Realm, the Wanxian Union spoke according to the hierarchy of positions, once in the Starry Sea, especially in desperate situations, who would listen to whom was hard to say.</p><p></p><p>"Lan Yu of the Dao Source State."</p><p></p><p>"Jin Ri of the Flowing Light State."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The list of Harmonized Dao cultivators setting out this time was not a secret.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these names one by one, the Holy Emperor couldn't help but sigh slightly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The death of dozens of Harmonized Dao cultivators is undoubtedly a good thing for the Xuanhuang Dao and the Holy Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Despite his pity, the Holy Emperor would definitely not be soft-hearted and intervene to stop this matter.</p><p></p><p>He just quietly waited for them to leave.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, who knows, maybe among them, there really were some with extraordinary luck, able to survive the layers of crises in the Starry Sea and ultimately achieve enlightenment?</p><p></p><p>Even if the Holy Emperor stopped them, he would only be seen as obstructing others' path of cultivation, resulting in a situation of irreconcilable enmity.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, under the gaze of all the cultivators of the Wanxian Union, a seven-colored rainbow light slowly flew out of the sky.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous time, this time it seemed much more familiar.</p><p></p><p>Different colors separated in succession, finally disappearing into a pitch-dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping watched them leave, silently mourning for them in his heart for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, the Holy Emperor's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He flashed and arrived at the secret space where the Youzu people resided.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the Youzu people under the rule of the Holy Dynasty could roughly be divided into three tribes with different missions.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the most numerous were those whose only necessary thing from birth to death every day was to chant the benevolence of the Holy Emperor. This group of people was formed by fusing with nurtured exotic beasts, with extremely short lifespans and reproductive cycles. Truly like scallions, cut down batch after batch, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>As for the second type, the Youzu people of medium number, their treatment was incomparably better. They had ample rest time every day and could even read different books. As the original Youzu bodies, some of them would be transferred out to participate in racial optimization experiments.</p><p></p><p>As for the third type, the least in number and the most special, they could be called</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purest and most primitive Youzu people still believed in the great Dark Sea and maintained their long-standing traditions. However, since they lived under the rule of the Holy Dynasty, they naturally had to obey Li Fan's orders. Even the internal debate within the tribe about who was greater, the Holy Emperor or the Dark Sea, had reached a unified opinion.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was the embodiment of the will of the Dark Sea. The Holy Emperor, the Dark Sea, and the Youzu Ancestor were a trinity, inseparable. Although the theory was a bit rough, it effectively resolved the potential conflicts brought about by Li Ping's intervention, thoroughly stabilizing the tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Holy Emperor." Upon seeing Li Ping, the Youzu chief immediately knelt down and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Prior to this, because Li Ping did not enforce it, these Youzu people did not need to kneel when they saw him. However, since the birth of the new theory, various standards and protocols had emerged within the Youzu community, which even the chief had to follow. Li Ping just let them be.</p><p></p><p>"Open the passage to the Dark Realm." Looking at the Youzu people kneeling on the ground below, Li Ping ordered coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Youzu people stood up, and amidst the mysterious and ancient chanting, a door slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping flew into it first.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, he was instantly engulfed by the endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>Silently, getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>The target he sensed was naturally the profound technique that could increase the output of cultivators' Yuan Power, which he had previously revealed to the Wanxian Alliance through his identity as the Lingyuan Sect Leader.</p><p></p><p>In terms of exploitation, the efficiency of the Wanxian Alliance was unexpectedly high.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping could already perceive that a large amount of marked Yuan Power, in a condensed and compressed state, was impacting and entering this Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, counterintuitively, such a vast and terrifying energy was unable to stir up the slightest ripple in this place.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether the Dark Sea itself was too vast, or if there was something inside silently devouring these ripples.</p><p></p><p>He was very close now, and Li Ping slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Despite his absolute confidence in his own strength, he still erred on the side of caution.</p><p></p><p>Concealing his presence, he approached stealthily.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the Dark Sea, where sound should not be able to propagate and it should be completely silent, there were actually rhythmic, intermittent muffled sounds.</p><p></p><p>It was like the sound of a large drum being fiercely pounded, causing even the Holy Emperor's heart to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping became solemn.</p><p></p><p>His blood and qi had now merged seamlessly. Even attacks from Immortal Realm cultivators might not be able to shake him. Yet now, because of these simple muffled sounds, they were surging...</p><p></p><p>"It's not caused by external forces. It's the rhythm of the Dark Sea itself."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor quickly made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>Not resisting these muffled sounds, Li Ping stood still for a moment, perfectly synchronizing his heartbeat with the rhythm of the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>As if completely merged into the darkness, his discomfort disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Ping continue forward.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he "saw" the source of these muffled sounds.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Like a punctured balloon, or like the Great Vortex at the boundary of the Primordial World.</p><p></p><p>In the Dark Sea ahead, a "small opening" appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stood at a distance and observed, his heart growing heavier.</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he gave such an evaluation.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Dark Sea and the compressed, ejected Yuan Power formed a perfect state of balance.</p><p></p><p>The Yuan Power was unable to truly invade the Dark Sea, and similarly, the counterattack of the Dark Sea was not fully triggered.</p><p></p><p>In this strange balance, the Yuan Power and the power of darkness achieved a resonance.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the Dark Sea was volatile.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the output of Yuan Power on the Wanxian Alliance's side also had to change and adjust accordingly. If the balance was broken, it would instantly face the raging counterattack of the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance must have maintained this device for quite some time now, and their research on the Dark Sea had reached a profound level.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance has capable people."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>After all, having ruled half of the Primordial World for thousands of years, it was not surprising that they had such hidden cards.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the power of darkness that normally overflows into various parts of the Primordial World, this extracted power of darkness is more gentle."</p><p></p><p>"And easier to utilize."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while longer, Li Ping realized the crux of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what the Wanxian Alliance is going to such great lengths to extract this gentle power of darkness for."</p><p></p><p>But the unknown did not hinder Li Ping's actions.</p><p></p><p>As the Dark Sea that maintained the stability of the Primordial World, the Wanxian Alliance extracting its power was definitely a heaven-defying act.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping, as the "embodiment of the Primordial Dao," naturally could not stand by and watch.</p><p></p><p>But he did not act rashly either.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, if this perfect state of balance was abruptly broken, the resulting turbulence in the Dark Sea might be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, merely stopping this extraction would only treat the symptoms, not the root cause.</p><p></p><p>What Li Ping wanted was a once-and-for-all method to put an end to the Wanxian Alliance's thievery.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's patience was quite ample.</p><p></p><p>He brought nearly a hundred primitive Youzu to this place.</p><p></p><p>"Bastards! What a blasphemy!"</p><p></p><p>From the Youzu chief's animated behavior, the Holy Emperor could see his inner rage.</p><p></p><p>The other beastmen, seeing their revered great Dark Sea being stolen from, also hated it to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>If not for Li Ping's concealment, such intense emotional fluctuations would have likely caused them to erupt in fury long ago.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I have come to resolve this matter."</p><p></p><p>"The blasphemers shall be executed."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's thoughts were conveyed to the minds of the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>The group of Youzu people instantly knelt on the ground again, their faces filled with resolute determination to give their lives.</p><p></p><p>In a corner unnoticed by the Wanxian Alliance, these Youzu people began an ancient ritual.</p><p></p><p>It was a method passed down since ancient times to communicate with the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>What Li Ping wanted them to do was to draw the attention of the origin of this Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Although there was quite a commotion here, relative to the vast Dark Sea, it was just a small hole poked in its body.</p><p></p><p>As long as the balance was not broken, it would not take notice.</p><p></p><p>That was why the Wanxian Alliance could continuously steal the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>But with the Youzu people's ritual as guidance, things might change.</p><p></p><p>Even if it did not immediately expel the Wanxian Alliance, the abrupt change in repulsive force would be enough to break the balance.</p><p></p><p>And because it was a change from the Dark Sea itself, with this behemoth as the foundation, even some turbulence would be negligible.</p><p></p><p>As the ritual progressed, Li Ping felt ripples in the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively concealed his aura as much as possible and hid.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1086: The Secret Vault of the Tianshu Sect</p><p></p><p>With the greedy nature of the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm, even if they couldn't use the divine weapons, they would never let others have them easily. 🔥🍮❻９ᔕн𝓾𝐗.匚Ỗ𝐦💥💚{What? You don't know yet | Read at COM, read chapters without mistakes | Hurry and google it}</p><p></p><p>Instead, they would seal them in the deepest part of the sect's treasure vault and guard them strictly, hoping that one day they would be able to awaken the power of these divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see where the nearest divine weapon is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Desolate God Seal, in the Tianshu Sect."</p><p></p><p>The Desolate God Seal was the supreme treasure of the now extinct Desolate God Sect. The wielder of the God Seal could communicate with the immortal realm and summon the ancient desolate gods.</p><p></p><p>In the memories of the Xuanhuang Realm's Dao inherited by Mr. White, Li Fan saw the terrifying scene of the desolate gods descending in the past. </p><p></p><p>From the huge vortex in the sky, a golden eyeball suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the desolate god, the land of the Xuanhuang Realm cracked inch by inch and then turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>It had a bit of the flavor of an immortal from the Immortal Ruins destroying the world with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>The Desolate God Sect once summoned twelve different desolate gods, slaughtering countless enemy sects and shocking the ancient Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, fewer and fewer desolate gods responded later, and eventually there was no answer at all.</p><p></p><p>Without the descent of the desolate gods as deterrence, the Desolate God Sect was soon besieged by enemies and tragically exterminated.</p><p></p><p>As for the Tianshu Sect, it was one of the top ten immortal sects in the past.</p><p></p><p>But there was very little information about it left to later generations. Li Fan only knew roughly that this sect was the closest to the Great Wizard of the Heavenly Capital in terms of immortal dao. .•°¤*(¯`★´¯)*¤° ６９𝔰𝓗𝔲𝓧.¢𝐨ᗰ °¤*(¯´★`¯)*¤°•.</p><p></p><p>The disciples inside mostly regarded themselves as true inheritors of the immortal dao and were very arrogant.</p><p></p><p>After roughly understanding the relevant information, Li Fan, who was now the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, moved his thoughts and instantly arrived at the core area of the Tianshu Sect, the Tianshu Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He actually crossed a distance of several hundred thousand miles in the blink of an eye, ignoring the various formations and restrictions of the Tianshu Sect, and directly arrived at the most core and hidden area.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his hands, feeling a surge of excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He felt that his spiritual power was almost endless, and even if he used any divine ability, it would not diminish in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when the divine ability manifested concretely in the Xuanhuang Realm, it would be naturally amplified to the limit that heaven and earth could reach.</p><p></p><p>All the techniques in the world, as long as they originated from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>They could all be seen through at a glance, unable to pose any threat to him.</p><p></p><p>"It's a few points better than my control over the Lingmu Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"After all, one is active cooperation, and the other is forced coercion."</p><p></p><p>With a slight sigh, Li Fan slowly familiarized himself with the powers of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Then he strolled in the Tianshu Courtyard, walking towards a shrine-like building in the depths of the center.</p><p></p><p>It was shrouded in a strange energy, the only "blind spot" in the entire Tianshu Sect for the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>The Tianshu Sect cultivators guarding the shrine couldn't see Li Fan's existence at all. 69ᔕᕼᑌ᙭.ᑕOᗰ</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>In front of the shrine, Li Fan's footsteps paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>He sensed a somewhat familiar power.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't familiar to this body of Mr. White, but to Li Fan's original self.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wizard of the Heavenly Capital."</p><p></p><p>A instinctive disgust suddenly rose from his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was like the disgusting feeling of finding a few cockroaches in the kitchen at home. Li Fan immediately frowned.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly calmed his mind.</p><p></p><p>His figure was like water, passing through</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Passing through an invisible barrier, he arrived inside the ancestral hall.</p><p></p><p>Inside the hall, two stone statues were enshrined, one large and one small.</p><p></p><p>The large statue had its eyes closed, head slightly lowered, and a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The small statue was a young boy, standing respectfully behind.</p><p></p><p>"This large statue is the figure that lectured on the Dao in Tiandu. However, according to the information I collected before, it is very likely that the boy standing behind the figure is the true Grand Master of Tiandu." Li Fan's gaze couldn't help but fall on the boy's stone statue.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, he seemed to traverse countless spaces and arrived in a magnificent city suspended in the sky.</p><p></p><p>With a shock to his mind, the illusion disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the boy's statue again, he actually felt a slight stinging in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Humph." Li Fan snorted coldly, suppressing the urge to smash the statue to pieces. He searched left and right for the hidden treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>Without much effort, he discovered a secret formation behind the two statues.</p><p></p><p>After breaking the formation, Li Fan was able to enter the treasure vault of the Tianshu Sect.</p><p></p><p>Different from the imagined scene filled with dazzling treasures, the Tianshu Sect's treasure vault could even be said to be a bit crude. So much so that Li Fan almost doubted he had gone to the wrong place.</p><p></p><p>On a purple-red long table, a stone seal, a wooden box, and a scroll were placed in order.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>That stone seal was naturally Li Fan's target this time - the immortal artifact Huang Shen Seal.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was still in a sealed state at this time, Li Fan still vaguely felt the ancient and vast aura from it that made one's heart palpitate.</p><p></p><p>If it were Mr. Bai, he would naturally only take the Huang Shen Seal and quickly leave.</p><p></p><p>But how could Li Fan ever return empty-handed from a treasure mountain?</p><p></p><p>Even if this place was the Fallen Immortal Realm's illusory world and treasures could not be brought back to the real world.</p><p></p><p>It was still good to broaden his knowledge and feast his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first carefully observed the wooden box. He keenly sensed that the wooden box seemed to be imprisoning some living creature. It was trembling slightly at an extremely small frequency and amplitude. With each tremor, the aura unintentionally emanating outward made Li Fan, now the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate, feel a bit dangerous.</p><p></p><p>What was even more strange was that the creature in the wooden box also seemed to sense Li Fan's presence outside.</p><p></p><p>The trembling became a bit more urgent.</p><p></p><p>As if tempting and urging Li Fan to open the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Faint rustling sounds emerged in his ears, and many illusions also appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a long time and finally suppressed the impulse in his mind with great willpower.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Li Fan was startled to realize that the [Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra], which would automatically circulate in the past as long as he awakened his self-awareness, even in the Fallen Immortal Realm, had somehow become ineffective without him knowing!</p><p></p><p>Without the boost of the Immortal Heart Mantra, resisting temptation relied entirely on Li Fan's own willpower.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had reincarnated through many lifetimes, had broad knowledge and experience, and had extraordinary determination.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he probably would have been unable to control himself on the spot and opened the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan forcibly shifted his gaze to the scroll.</p><p></p><p>The auditory and visual hallucinations brought by the wooden box instantly diminished.</p><p></p><p>"This wooden box is a bit sinister. I don't know if it still exists in the Xuanhuang Realm now."</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to the strangeness of the wooden box, the scroll emanated an absolutely sacred and orthodox Immortal Dao aura.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it not have any warning, but it also involuntarily gave rise to a sense of affinity.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It seems I've seen this scroll somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan examined Mr. Bai's incomplete memories.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was lucky, and a somewhat blurry image instantly flashed in his mind.</p>

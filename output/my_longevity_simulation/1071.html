            <p>Chapter 1069: The Earth Veins Cause Trouble Again</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, someone has successfully reversed the principle of life and death?"</p><p></p><p>"There was actually such a person hidden in the Xuan Huang Realm? How could you not inform me in advance of such important information?"</p><p></p><p>There was some anger in Li Fan's voice.</p><p></p><p>"With the existence of the Reincarnation Mansion, even if more cultivators die, it probably won't pose a threat to the Xuan Huang Realm anymore."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the plan to coerce the Dharma Transmitter Jiang to show himself is going to fail." Li Fan let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou had a somewhat puzzled expression on her face. </p><p></p><p>"You may not believe it if I say it, but we Dharma Transmitters also know nothing about this new Eternal Life Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"I mean, not only us three who have been exiled. Even those who are still in the Dharma Transmitter Council at this moment are the same!" Dharma Transmitter Zhou said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>Having said that, she stared at Li Fan with some suspicion: "This Eternal Life Venerable, he really isn't from your Myriad Realms United Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>"My first reaction at the time was..."</p><p></p><p>"How could that be possible!" Li Fan directly shook his head in denial.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and both saw the shock and doubt in each other's hearts.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Xuan Huang Realm's expansion over these many years runs deeper than I imagined." Dharma Transmitter Wei had a profound look in his eyes and also frowned. "This new Venerable should have also infiltrated the Xuan Huang Realm at some unknown time and settled down here."</p><p></p><p>"However, judging from his style of doing things, over these many years, he has been quietly cultivating and not getting involved in worldly affairs. As long as we don't provoke him, there shouldn't be any major issues."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of the countless frozen corpses in the [Reverse Life and Death Grand Formation].</p><p></p><p>He remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"The sudden appearance of the Reincarnation Venerable was indeed unpredictable. But to say our plan has failed is perhaps still premature." At this time, Dharma Transmitter Huang, who had been silent, suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the others immediately turned to look at Huang.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, we are only one step away from forcing out Jiang."</p><p></p><p>"The mutation of spiritual energy in the Xuan Huang Realm, causing cultivators to become bloodthirsty by nature. This is a big deal that profoundly changes the situation in the Xuan Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Bearing the heavy responsibility of maintaining stability in the Xuan Huang Realm, the Myriad Immortals Alliance must investigate and resolve this matter. As long as we take out all the Immortal Alliance members who come to investigate, sooner or later, Jiang will have no choice but to take action himself."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, now that the phenomenon of cultivators perishing is no longer appearing, even if we make a move, we won't be exposed." Huang said as if it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Dharma Transmitters Zhou and Wei both revealed strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, indicating his agreement.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a viable method."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll have to trouble you all."</p><p></p><p>"However, we can't pin our hopes on Jiang taking the initiative to attack. I will go back and apply to the Assembly to see if a new world-ending plan can be activated."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, without waiting for the other party to respond, he directly cut off the connection with the three Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>"After the appearance of the Reincarnation Mansion, the lives of cultivators can no longer be used as a means of threat."</p><p></p><p>The [Extermination] character technique had already been used once before when facing Dharma Transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Although Dharma Transmitter Jiang seemed to have not retained any relevant memories after going through the reversion.</p><p></p><p>But this time it was just to force him to show himself and then solve Mo Rubin through him.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't truly being hostile to him.</p><p></p><p>So it was still better not to choose the [Extermination] character technique.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He focused his attention on the mutated Dao-One Insects.</p><p></p><p>After a period of reproduction, the Dao-One Insects that released murderous spiritual energy had quietly occupied a vast contiguous area underground in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, under Li Fan's intentional control, apart from normal reproduction and releasing spiritual energy, they did not do anything else out of line.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with their current scale, it would be easy to trigger another great stench in Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Li Fan changed his combat strategy.</p><p></p><p>The enemy target was changed from the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm to the Xuanhuang Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent being hated by the heavens and earth, and to avoid any accidents when falsely borrowing the Dao and absorbing the Xuanhuang's future changes.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent manipulation of the insect swarm was all done by the immortal puppet Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The mutated Dao-One Insects became active in an instant after receiving orders from the Insect Queen.</p><p></p><p>They did not fly towards the ground, but continued to go deeper underground.</p><p></p><p>Following the flow of spiritual energy in the earth veins, they began to gnaw on the branches of the ancient earth vein trees hidden within.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had not forgotten that the ancient earth vein trees had been secretly instigating Lin Ling to rebel against him from time to time before.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Ling was awed by the strength he displayed and finally chose to abandon the dark and turn to the light.</p><p></p><p>But this does not mean that the matter is over.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling is currently serving as a laborer in the alliance to atone for his crimes.</p><p></p><p>Now it's time to settle accounts with this ancient earth vein tree.</p><p></p><p>The ancient earth vein trees are rooted deep underground.</p><p></p><p>The roots are spread all over Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>But its main body is ultimately just a huge tree.</p><p></p><p>The Dao-One Insects underground all went crazy, disregarding their own lives, and gnawed on the ancient tree roots scattered in the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>The ancient earth vein trees have already merged with the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>When the ancient tree roots in a certain area are all eliminated, the direct consequence is...</p><p></p><p>Ground collapse.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying, mountain-flattening and sea-filling ground collapses.</p><p></p><p>Without any signs, some areas of the Xuanhuang Realm began to experience large-scale ground collapse disasters.</p><p></p><p>Even though the cultivators basically all lived in suspended sky cities and were not much threatened.</p><p></p><p>But this matter still immediately attracted the high attention of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The action was much faster than before. On the second day of the ground collapse incident, investigation teams were sent to various places to explore the truth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sent messages to the three Dharma Transmitters, asking them to cooperate in secret.</p><p></p><p>Amazed by the endless methods of the alliance, the three Dharma Transmitters also cooperated very well, each displaying their magical powers and quietly taking down all the investigation teams of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The first wave of staff members all disappeared mysteriously, and the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance suddenly realized that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>So the second time, the ones who came to lead the supervision were actually two Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who received the message, wore the Tianyang Immortal Armor and came to the scene of the confrontation between the Dharma Transmitters as the final combat force.</p><p></p><p>"No traces of the Xuantian Sect's techniques were detected. It seems they have not been possessed by that Dharma King." Dharma Transmitter Zhou secretly transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Persuade them with reason and move them with emotion. If it really doesn't work, we can only suppress them temporarily first. When everything returns to normal, we will release them." Dharma Transmitter Wei quickly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>While the four of them were discussing, the two Dharma Transmitters on the opposite side looked at Zhou, Wei and the others who suddenly appeared, with shocked and furious expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect it was you who were secretly making trouble?"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, it was you who proposed to leave the Dharma Transmitter Council. Even if you are dissatisfied now, you shouldn't commit such a sin!"</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter named Chu said with a face full of disappointment.</p>

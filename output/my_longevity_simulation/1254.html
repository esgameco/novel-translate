        <h1>Chapter 1254</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The golden chains of the Holy Emperor moved slightly, and one of the paper figures was pulled in front of Li Ping. </p><p></p><p>Unlike the others, this paper figure didn't show much fear on its face. Instead, it looked a bit listless and lethargic. </p><p></p><p>Its thick eyebrows were inverted, giving it a rather comical appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking survival?" </p><p></p><p>"If the skin does not exist, where will the hair attach? If the Xuanhuang Realm is destroyed, where can you live!" the Holy Emperor said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The thick-browed paper figure smiled bitterly, "Our Duguo Sect's strength is quite ordinary. If the Xuanhuang Realm is really destroyed, we have no way out, right? We can only accept it."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Your Eminence will blame the mortals of this world for not standing up to save the Xuanhuang Realm? One can only do as much as one's ability allows..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not argue with the Duguo Sect paper figure. The golden chains exerted a slight force again: "Sharp-tongued, unrepentant even on the verge of death."</p><p></p><p>The golden light slowly condensed, going from the thickness of chains to only that of thin threads. </p><p></p><p>It wrapped around the thick-browed paper figure in circles.</p><p></p><p>The other captured paper figures all cried out in extreme horror.</p><p></p><p>But only that thick-browed paper figure sat upright, as if in formal meditation, its expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>It muttered to itself: "Years turn to emptiness, calamities are eternal. Hundreds of lifetimes, thousands of tribulations, forge my golden body..."</p><p></p><p>For the first time, the golden power of the Holy Emperor that had always been invincible lost its effect.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping only felt that the force exerted on the thick-browed paper figure was subtly dissipated by an invisible force.</p><p></p><p>It was even absorbed by the other party, becoming a part of its foundation.</p><p></p><p>The golden threads slowly dissolved. The thick-browed paper figure remained motionless, only the color of the paper figure changed from an old yellowish-white to a brilliant gold close to the essence of the Source power.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet, which had been watching all along, suddenly looked a bit serious: "Be careful, Daoyou. This is precisely the Duguo Sect's ultimate art [Eternal Calamity World], which can transform all the forces of calamity in the world into nourishment for one's own cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sneered: "Just a turtle hiding its head. You want to use my power to cultivate? Then I'll satisfy you!"</p><p></p><p>Dazzling golden flames, like raging fires, burst out from the Holy Emperor's body. </p><p></p><p>The flames were blazing, illuminating the entire Duguo Sect space in a golden hue.</p><p></p><p>The golden flames, seemingly condensed into substance, were all poured into the golden body of the paper figure along the remaining chains.</p><p></p><p>Those many paper figures that were not the main targets of the Holy Emperor, but were merely affected, all let out earth-shattering wails as if being roasted by raging flames. One can imagine how strong the pressure on this golden-bodied paper figure was. It looked distorted, as if it was about to melt.</p><p></p><p>But that thick-browed paper figure still remained unmoved, its expression calm.</p><p></p><p>This scene secretly shocked the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Although they could not recognize their original appearances after transforming into paper figures, there were few in the Duguo Sect at its peak who could remain unperturbed and unscathed under such might of the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet was speculating about the identity of the thick-browed paper figure.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the faceless Holy Emperor did not lessen the torment on the Duguo Sect paper figures.</p><p></p><p>The golden flames burned more and more vigorously. Although they did not completely incinerate the paper figures, they slowly plated them with a layer of indelible gold.</p><p></p><p>Especially the thick-browed paper figure, enveloped by the raging flames, its body glowed with an increasingly dazzling golden light.</p><p></p><p>"The rise and fall of Xuanhuang, you are all responsible!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's voice was like thunder, and the essence of the Source power suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>It illuminated every corner of this space, its brilliance so dazzling that even the stone tablet couldn't help closing its eyes to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>When the light receded, the darkness in the great hall of the Duguo Sect had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>That extremely uncomfortable gloomy aura was also gone.</p><p></p><p>The paper figures, freed from the chains, fell to the ground in a mess.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, they seemed to have gained some vitality.</p><p></p><p>The leading thick-browed paper figure had directly turned into a "little golden man".</p><p></p><p>The golden man still had that listless, dejected look. He sighed, "Your Eminence wasted so much essence of the Source power on us wastes, it's truly a waste of resources!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not worth it at all!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said in a deep voice, "If everything in the world was decided purely by reason, I'm afraid the Xuanhuang Realm would have been destroyed long ago! You wouldn't even be here to chatter!"</p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking, a big "X" suddenly appeared on the face of the golden paper figure, blocking his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the paper figures followed suit.</p><p></p><p>The Duguo Sect's great hall, which had originally been like a vegetable market, instantly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyou Yijue?" At this time, the stone tablet looked at the golden paper figure and asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>The golden paper figure couldn't speak, it just blinked at the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether it was acknowledging or denying it.</p><p></p><p>The two had no time to catch up. After losing the support of the essence of the Source power, the space here slowly became unstable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk after we get out."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping took the stone tablet and the group of mindless paper figures and flashed out of the Duguo Sect.</p><p></p><p>This ancient immortal sect suppressed by the Dharma Seal also revealed its true appearance at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A book unfolded from within.</p><p></p><p>There were no words in the book, only reliefs of mountains and empty buildings.</p><p></p><p>As the book naturally flipped, the scenes presented within it also changed.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's giant hand grasped the Book of Crossing Calamity, and the magnificent mountains and rivers within it were instantly tinted with a layer of gold.</p><p></p><p>"Collect!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor let out a low shout, and the densely packed paper figures piled together, including the thick-browed little golden man, all flew uncontrollably into the Book of Crossing Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pressed his right hand, closing the book.</p><p></p><p>All anomalies disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It's not suitable to stay here for long. Although my method of breaking the Dharma Seal was very ingenious, restoring the seal while breaking it, I can't guarantee that the anomalies here won't be discovered by the Dharma."</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said in a deep voice, his figure had already disappeared from this sealed space.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet followed the Holy Emperor all the way, passing through the spatial passage of the Xuanhuang Realm, and arrived in a boundless void.</p><p></p><p>At their speed, they flew in the void for quite a while before sensing the aura of the world ahead.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Grotto Heaven of the Yishi Sect? Doesn't this indicate that the Eternal Realm expert who used to operate the grotto heaven back then..."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet was still pondering when Hundred Flowers had already come to greet them.</p><p></p><p>After her gaze lingered on the stone tablet for a moment, Hundred Flowers transmitted something to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then Hundred Flowers nodded to the stone tablet before flying back into the Five Elements Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"This place is where I recuperate. Daoyou, what do you think of it compared to the Xuanhuang Realm?" Li Ping brought the stone tablet into the Great Enlightenment Small World.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his divine sense, a general view of the small world appeared in the stone tablet's mind.</p><p></p><p>Even though some places were obscured by mysterious forces and he couldn't know everything, just what was revealed on the surface greatly shocked the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although the Creation Stone Tablet was known for recording all things in the world, this reputation had become somewhat inaccurate. However, the tablet still had a clear understanding of the events that initially occurred within the realm of the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>But compared to this great pioneering small world...</p><p></p><p>It was like being hundreds of years behind, like a whole era.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he also sensed the presence of old acquaintances here.</p><p></p><p>Such as the ancient earth vein tree, and that person from the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>Following all the way to the Holy Emperor's Seat, the tablet's shocked emotions finally began to calm down a bit.</p><p></p><p>"I have carried this stone tablet for so many years, thinking that all the affairs of the world were in my mind. I never thought that what I saw and heard today made me realize that the world's events have long surpassed my expectations..." the tablet said with a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you don't need to be discouraged. Constant change and innovation is the right path. If the world remained stagnant for thousands of years..."</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't it show our incompetence?" Li Ping smiled slightly. </p><p></p><p>The tablet didn't know how to respond for a moment and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Since interacting with this "embodiment of the Dao", the impact it received was really too great.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the scenes he saw now, the Xuanhuang World in his mind seemed like a stage play - a false image purely performed for him to see!</p><p></p><p>This made the tablet feel a bit disoriented.</p><p></p><p>"I knew long ago that the Five Elders Council, the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and other supreme powers in the Xuanhuang World who knew about the existence of this stone tablet behind me, would try every means to avoid being recorded by the tablet. But I never expected that the truth of the world had already developed to this extent..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping vaguely saw through the tablet's thoughts and said slowly, "The Xuanhuang World, the last place of survival in the Darkest Starry Sea. The Xuanhuang Realm itself, remnants of other worlds, survivors of the starry sea, powers outside the high walls..."</p><p></p><p>"They all converge here. Its complexity is such that let alone you, Fellow Daoist, even if it was the Dharma Transmission or the Xuanhuang Dao itself, it would be impossible to know this place like the back of one's hand."</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." The tablet sighed and nodded.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the hidden fishing pond he saw before. </p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang World, how many more treasures were concealed like this?</p><p></p><p>As an ancient remnant of the Xuanhuang World, he now finally experienced a sense of being out of touch with the times.</p><p></p><p>"Things have changed, the story is no more."</p><p></p><p>Scenes from the early days of the Xuanhuang World surfaced in the tablet's mind, causing it to space out a bit.</p><p></p><p>It was the Holy Emperor's voice that interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>"The merging of the realms has become inevitable. There must be a battle between the Dharma Transmission and me. But regardless of who wins or loses, it won't change the fact that the Xuanhuang World will be reborn amidst the ruins."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping didn't mention helping the tablet solve its mental overload, but suddenly said this instead.</p><p></p><p>The tablet's thoughts converged and it looked intently at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"The key issue lies in the new orthodoxy of the Xuanhuang World."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's divine sense locked onto the tablet as he asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The tablet pondered for a moment before answering, "Back when the Dharma Transmission first appeared, our Ten Immortal Sects had investigated. This person was indeed a native cultivator of the Xuanhuang World. His life trajectory from childhood to adulthood was spotless and documented."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter is named Xuanyuan Tuo. From a young age, he lived in a rural village. Because he was weak and sickly as a child, his parents gave him the nickname 'Puppy Egg'."</p><p></p><p>"Before the age of fifty, this person's life was no different from an ordinary farmer's. It wasn't until after turning fifty-one that he suddenly achieved enlightenment and rose abruptly."</p><p></p><p>"It was precisely because of this that the Ten Immortal Sects' initial investigation couldn't find out his origins at all. Because he indeed attained the Dao suddenly."</p><p></p><p>The tablet slowly recounted.</p><p></p><p>Scenes from back then also appeared in the Holy Emperor's Hall.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Tuo." Li Ping watched the somewhat silly-looking youth in the images slowly turn into a taciturn middle-aged farmer, and then gradually transform into a white-haired old man.</p><p></p><p>"For a mortal to suddenly attain the Dao, this possibility indeed exists. But it usually happens in one's youth. For the Dharma Transmitter to undergo such a change, appearing almost when his lifespan was about to end..."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly perplexing and suspicious," Li Ping commented.</p><p></p><p>The tablet nodded, "The Ten Sects had such suspicions at first too. But we used secret techniques and the Dao's verification to confirm that there was no possession or an outsider borrowing his identity."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Dharma Transmitter was indeed exceptionally mysterious. Like an innate knower, even when several elders of the Ten Sects launched sneak attacks back then, he somehow resolved them using unknown methods. After that, he completely exceeded our control. Perhaps if the Ten Sects had struck with full force at the beginning, the outcome might have been different..." The tablet said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>The great hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping suddenly asked, "The Dao's verification... What if the other party's method of stealing an identity surpassed the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>The tablet was stunned.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, this question seemed like an unreasonable one.</p><p></p><p>But as the tablet carefully considered it, it was precisely because the Ten Sects had too much faith in their own methods back then that led to this conclusion they firmly believed for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"At this point, what's the use of questioning the Dharma Transmitter's background?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of dejection, this thought welled up in the tablet's mind.</p><p></p><p>Perplexed, it looked at the Holy Emperor again.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's voice thundered like lightning, reverberating inside the great hall, "As I said before, the key to the reborn Xuanhuang World lies in the two words: orthodoxy."</p><p></p><p>"It's like a brand new body pieced together from severed limbs - who becomes the brain is very important."</p><p></p><p>"As of now, the Xuanhuang Dao still considers itself the Xuanhuang Dao. But before long, that may not necessarily be the case..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's tone was ethereal.</p><p></p><p>The tablet knew that the other party was the embodiment of the Dao and definitely wouldn't speak without basis. Its expression changed, "Please elaborate, Fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"The things you observe on the stone tablet can all be viewed as an outsider, from a third-party perspective. But with the fusion of worlds, the memories seem as if personally experienced, blurring the line between illusion and reality. Over time, one can no longer distinguish between the false, the real, the self and the other."</p><p></p><p>"Especially..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's gaze looked towards the Xuanhuang Realm millions of miles away.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Dao is weak, its power to resist is already negligible."</p><p></p><p>"If one day, the remnant wills of the Daos from the various realms come flooding in like a deluge..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the Xuanhuang Dao wouldn't be able to withstand it and would go mad, losing itself."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's tone carried a hint of self-mockery.</p><p></p><p>"After that, if someone guides and erodes it with a more complete Dao will, they could pull a switcheroo and change the orthodoxy of the Xuanhuang World. At that time, although it would still be called the Xuanhuang Realm, inside and out, it would no longer be the original Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the tablet fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The person the Holy Emperor's words pointed to was very obvious - it was the Dharma Transmitter.</p>

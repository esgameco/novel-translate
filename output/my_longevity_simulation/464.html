            <p>However, soon the person's face calmed down again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, his appetite is getting bigger and bigger. But is what happened on Wansen Island worth so many contributions?" Li Fan looked at the other person's expression and cautiously added, "He has other conditions."</p><p></p><p>"Payment first, then goods."</p><p></p><p>"And he also said that whether we are willing to trade or not depends on ourselves, he won't force us. But he dares to guarantee that the value of this information is definitely worth more than this. He is risking his life, and considering that we are old customers, he offered this price." </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing such outrageous conditions, the person's face was no longer as agitated as before.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, he said, "This is a crucial matter, I will go consult first. You stay here and don't move."</p><p></p><p>With that, the light and shadow on the stone suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan patiently waited in place. In the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the person's face appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Agree to his terms!" he decisively stated.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Li Fan was somewhat shocked by the other party's boldness this time.</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenghao said earlier that the risks involved in this deal are too great, it's not convenient for them to appear directly, so they need an intermediary. If we are willing to trade, we will send the spirit stones to this island. Just say that you are from the 'Universal Alliance', don't worry about anything else. Just give the spirit stones to them." Li Fan provided the coordinates of an island, which happened to be the one where Li Chenfeng and others from the Empire were located.</p><p></p><p>"When he confirms receiving the spirit stones, he will pass the information to us. 69bookshub21.com," Li Fan hurriedly added.</p><p></p><p>"The Universal Alliance, what is this?" </p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." The person's face seemed to realize something and suddenly fell into silence. </p><p></p><p>"At the latest the day after tomorrow, the spirit stones will be delivered. You keep an eye on He Zhenghao, don't let him escape," ordered the person's face.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir," Li Fan responded readily.</p><p></p><p>"This is a high-stakes gamble. If we win, we will surely gain great merit. If we lose..." The person's face muttered to themselves, sounding concerned.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this was the first time the person's face had encountered such a large sum of money and an unreliable manner of trade. They seemed a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, don't worry. Based on my interactions with He Zhenghao during this time, I believe this person is trustworthy," Li Fan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope so. You can go now."</p><p></p><p>After ending the communication, Li Fan hastily returned to Taian Island.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, through his sensing ability, he checked the situation on Li Chenfeng's side.</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator in black clothing, following orders, arrived above the island where the Empire was located and scanned the area.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a woman in green appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Both of them confronted each other, their expressions serious.</p><p></p><p>Following the trade procedure, the man in black reported his identity, "I am a cultivator from the Universal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>With that, he tossed a storage ring over. </p><p></p><p>The woman in green took the storage ring, examined it, and her pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>She was about to say something but found the man gesturing her to stop and then left directly.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the woman in green with an incredulous expression, standing still.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng sensed something amiss and quickly flew over to find out.</p><p></p><p>The woman in green handed him the storage ring, and after examining it, Li Chenfeng also fell into a stunned state.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Teacher, what is this all about?" Li Chenfeng felt puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like our preparations for this time might not be enough," the woman in green said with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders Association is indeed efficient and never procrastinates in their actions!" Sensing how smoothly the trade was going on the other end, Li Fan couldn't help but admire.</p><p></p><p>He then headed to the Luli Island and had tea with He Zhenghao as planned.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan headed straight to the meeting point.</p><p></p><p>Activating communication with the person's face, Li Fan appeared somewhat perplexed and fearful.</p><p></p><p>"What message does He Zhenghao have to convey?" The person's face didn't bother with pleasantries and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"He has already told me quietly," Li Fan said softly, "just one sentence."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pressed his palms on the stone, concentrated his thoughts, and transmitted the words.</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan Locking Spirit..."</p><p></p><p>"Unified?"</p><p></p><p>The person's face fell into absolute silence.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, there were some chaotic sounds coming from the other end, creating a great commotion.</p><p></p><p>"The trade is completed. You continue to lay low. If there are any special circumstances, I will contact you again." Despite showing great restraint, Li Fan could still sense a hint of fear from the person's face through the communication.</p><p></p><p>The stone turned into dust, and the communication was cut off.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qingao" still had a bewildered look on his face as he returned to Taian Island.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he reached the depths of the deserted island defense formation that things returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"With the constraints from the Five Elders Association, even if the Wansen Alliance wants to establish the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array in this era, they might not be up to the task."</p><p></p><p>"We need to observe how things will unfold."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes as his focus returned to the main body on the Wansen Island.</p><p></p><p>After an investigation, Li Fan was released from the dark room where he was held.</p><p></p><p>His account was consistent with the survivors of that time, and there was nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance's main focus was still on Gongsun Qixuan, missing from the scene.</p><p></p><p>It was his deduction that triggered the inexplicably horrifying green light.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had made some deductions earlier, it was apparent that Gongsun Qixuan's deduction ability was even more superior from the actual movements.</p><p></p><p>Clarifying what he had seen at that time became the most important task.</p><p></p><p>Wansen Island was still under blockade.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators who had been interrogated and signed a confidentiality agreement could now freely roam the island.</p><p></p><p>Although they couldn't disclose what happened that day, Li Fan's seemingly miraculous deduction abilities during the events of Jinchu Zhenye's price skyrocketing and the upheaval at the Yanwu Hall were evident to all.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan found himself surrounded by many cultivators eager to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>Unable to enter the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan had no choice but to seek refuge in the Qianli Hall for peace.</p><p></p><p>Ever since it was besieged some time ago, the Qianli Hall had never reopened for business, with its doors tightly shut.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had to use the secret passage to re-enter.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the store, Li Fan found that although Jiao Xiuyuan was inside, his expression was vacant, his eyes devoid of spirit.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Li Fan called out to him, he received no response.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was in a state of loss of control like a puppet when the stone for Dao shattered in the previous life, even more severe this time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed carefully for a moment, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"It should be Lu Xichan's sealing that caused the loss of connection between the puppet and the main body."</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Chief of the Strategy Hall are truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"However, she didn't expect that there is a supreme technique like the 'Extraordinary Profound Spiritual Transformation' in this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit pleased in his heart.</p>

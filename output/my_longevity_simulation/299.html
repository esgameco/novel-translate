        <h1>Chapter 299</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This time, Li Fan keenly sensed the difference from before.</p><p></p><p>In the vast white space, Li Fan originally could not effectively discern the existence of the soul contract, relying only on a vague feeling in his heart to guess.</p><p></p><p>However, after being washed by the countless souls in the "Sea of Resentful Souls", it seemed to have caused some strange changes in Li Fan's own soul.</p><p></p><p>After a series of tests, Li Fan was pleasantly surprised to find that his recognition success rate had leaped from 0.2% to 3%.</p><p></p><p>"This simple and crude method is still more suitable for me. After a few more times, recognizing the soul contract will no longer be a problem." Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Godstone and the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Chant, the risk of the "Sea of Resentful Souls" was almost non-existent for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the feeling after using "Yima" before, Li Fan vaguely felt that his soul had become a few points stronger.</p><p></p><p>This even made Li Fan look forward to the "Sea of Resentful Souls" surf arriving earlier tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just like that, under constant learning, training, and the washing of souls in the "Sea of Resentful Souls".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's success rate in sensing soul contracts steadily increased.</p><p></p><p>All the way from 5%, to 10%, then to 50%...</p><p></p><p>When only eight people were left in the lucky group, this extra special training finally ended.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Fan's level was also fixed at an accuracy rate of 80%.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao's evaluation was that he was in the middle among everyone, barely acceptable, with a promising future.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the application period for the "Sea of Resentful Souls" by the Strategy Formation Hall had expired, and Li Fan no longer had the opportunity to improve by receiving special treatment. In the future, he could only improve through his own training.</p><p></p><p>However, after being washed by the "Sea of Resentful Souls" for so many days and having intimate contact with the souls of countless Five Elders Association cultivators with soul contracts, Li Fan had now vaguely grasped the method of identifying soul contracts.</p><p></p><p>As long as a familiar feeling arose in the soul when it came into contact with the soul waves, then there was an 80% chance that a soul contract mark existed within.</p><p></p><p>After that, the final identification was carried out, greatly increasing the accuracy rate.</p><p></p><p>With the shortcoming disappearing, Li Fan's ranking among these many outstanding disciples in the Dao of Arrays was also steadily improving.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan continued to study at this Huanyu Branch, time came to the 27th year of the Anchor Era.</p><p></p><p>Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The sea area near the deserted island.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng stood against the wind, his bearing already vastly different from before.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and eight azure water swords kept rotating and changing beside him, forming one strange formation after another.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the seawater below, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>A strange cry came from the depths of the sea.</p><p></p><p>The shadow under the sea surface quickly expanded.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it enveloped Xiao Heng.</p><p></p><p>The phantom of a huge strange beast appeared in a flash, opening its huge mouth, about to devour Xiao Heng.</p><p></p><p>A hint of blue light flashed in Xiao Heng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his figure became a little illusory.</p><p></p><p>Disappearing from the original spot, he dodged the strange beast's attack.</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, Xiao Heng looked at the strange beast whose attack had missed, a hint of a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>With a light blow, the surrounding clouds were attracted and gathered towards him.</p><p></p><p>One after another, figures completely made of clouds and bearing an 80% resemblance to Xiao Heng rapidly took shape.</p><p></p><p>Ten, hundred, thousand...</p><p></p><p>In a flash, an army of cloud people had already formed.</p><p></p><p>They wielded sharp swords and flew down to launch an attack on the strange beast below.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, sword lights crisscrossed, and thousands of explosions bloomed on the strange beast's body.</p><p></p><p>"Weak! Too weak!"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Heng, are you tickling me?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the strange beast actually spoke human words. It turned out to be Ye Feipeng's voice.</p><p></p><p>Easily blocking Xiao Heng's attack, Ye Feipeng's huge body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The seawater surged, rolling up hundred-zhang-high terrifying waves.</p><p></p><p>The strange beast soared into the sky, transforming into a bird, rushing up into the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Facing the army of thousands of cloud people, it was completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Charging forward recklessly, its momentum was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng's expression remained unchanged, his figure once again becoming illusory.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, he appeared in another location in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty, having brute force alone, what use is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Your attacks on me are like throwing an axe at the sky. The sky is so high and vast. No matter how high the axe is thrown, it can't even touch the surface of the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"This is one of the four Golden Core methods I have comprehended, the Law of Emptiness!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?" A hint of pride appeared in Xiao Heng's tone.</p><p></p><p>Before, when he was about to form his Golden Core, he received a vague guidance in his heart, leading him to the center of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that transparent building standing in the sky like a dream, Xiao Heng was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Water Heavenly Palace contained countless opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators risked their lives to enter it, hoping to get rich overnight.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>They all ignored that the existence of the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace itself was a miracle!</p><p></p><p>Clouds and water taking form, floating in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Between the illusory and the real, a magnificent sight!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng stood outside the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace for nearly a year, during which countless cultivators came and went, pointing at him and talking.</p><p></p><p>He turned a deaf ear to all of it, only carefully comprehending.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he comprehended the Law of Clouds and the Law of Emptiness by referencing the way this Cloud Water Heavenly Palace existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>Adding on the Law of Sea and the Law of Sword he obtained from cultivating the "Stabilizing Sea Divine Sword".</p><p></p><p>He finally condensed his Golden Core with the four laws!</p><p></p><p>Not long after returning to the deserted island, he encountered Ye Feipeng who had also broken through to the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>With his greatly improved strength, Xiao Heng was naturally itching to spar with him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the previous battle took place.</p><p></p><p>When the two clashed, even though he had made sufficient mental preparations, Xiao Heng was still startled.</p><p></p><p>Actually being able to completely abandon human form and transform into the appearance of a real strange beast.</p><p></p><p>In the Kun form, the body was extremely huge, hidden in the sea, and the speed was also very fast, making it unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>If one was slightly careless, it would leap out from under the sea surface and swallow everything it touched into its mouth.</p><p></p><p>In the Peng form, the speed was even faster. When its wings were fully spread, there would even be a hurricane accompanying it.</p><p></p><p>With both speed and power boosted, the destructive power was also ridiculously high.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng's one hundred and eight Stabilizing Sea Divine Sword Formation at the Golden Core realm had once been directly shattered by it charging into it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the "Law of Emptiness" Xiao Heng comprehended was extremely profound, allowing him to dodge Ye Feipeng's ferocious attacks every time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was the same this time, the little fatty became somewhat enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Heng, the axe is high but can't reach a hair? Xiao Heng, you are too confident!"</p><p></p><p>"Human power is limited, let alone a mere Golden Core cultivator. How can you compare yourself to the real sky!"</p><p></p><p>"If you are the sky..."</p><p></p><p>"Then, I will devour the sky!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the thunderous roar that sounded like thunder, the Kun-Peng's already extremely huge body expanded once again.</p><p></p><p>He flapped his wings, and countless azure winds formed chains, sealing off the sky in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Then, he opened his huge mouth, and a black shadow appeared from within.</p><p></p><p>That shadow seemed to contain boundless suction force, and the scenery of the sky began to distort, moving towards his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng's expression changed slightly, and he wanted to move and change his form again.</p><p></p><p>However, he discovered with some horror that the previously invincible "Law of Emptiness" had lost its effect at this moment!</p><p></p><p>His body flew uncontrollably towards the mouth of that terrifying giant beast, and the spiritual energy in his body stopped flowing under the immense pressure coming from all around his body.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xiao Heng could only helplessly shout, "I give up! I admit defeat!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of blood red flashed in the Kun-Peng's eyes, and it actually showed no intention of stopping.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after a moment, black once again occupied the beast's eyes, and Ye Feipeng finally came to his senses and stopped his actions.</p>

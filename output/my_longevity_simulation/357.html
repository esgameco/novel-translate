        <h1>Chapter 357</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Some are simply vast, boundless spaces with no other existence."</p><p></p><p>"While some are like the roaring abyss, hiding many strange and dangerous things."</p><p></p><p>"But everything is concealed in the vast white mist, and cultivators who enter it are like blindfolded, finding it difficult to perceive the whole picture."</p><p></p><p>"I have supplies that can last for about fifteen days. Whether I can cross this realm of confusion depends on my luck in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Gathering his mind, Li Fan did not continue to move towards the eternal immortal fortress in his senses, but instead marked it as "forward" and flew downwards in the opposite direction.</p><p></p><p>In the usual "white mist barrier," there is land present. However, it is a flat and desolate land, without any traces of other life or buildings, with very few visible undulations.</p><p></p><p>It is said that walking on it will suppress one's instincts and desires for life and may give rise to various impulses towards self-annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The realm of confusion is an independent and entirely new space. Whether it has a "bottom" depends on the specific circumstances of the realm.</p><p></p><p>The abyss roars with no end in sight. Li Fan had to explore this realm to truly understand it.</p><p></p><p>Regarding why he flew "downward" instead of flying out of the realm directly towards the "upward" direction...</p><p></p><p>This was because Emperor Fu Song had told Li Fan before that once you enter a realm of confusion, it is like entering a boundless paradise. </p><p></p><p>It was basically impossible to fly out just by flying when trapped in the realm. The only way to leave was to find the connection point between the realm of confusion and normal space, known as the "exit."</p><p></p><p>Taking the roaring abyss as an example, if a warrior accidentally fell into the abyss and entered its territory, even if they seemed to be at the edge of the abyss and appeared to be just a step away from the eternal immortal fortress, crossing that step could bring them back to safety.</p><p></p><p>However, due to not being in two of the same spaces, even if it was just a small distance, it might be impossible to cross, even if one flew until death.</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of the Immortal City with the severed palm, no cultivator had fallen into the abyss and returned alive.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, generally speaking, the scenery in the realm of confusion would be different. Even if it was covered by white mist, one could still perceive it when approaching, providing hope for Li Fan’s escape.</p><p></p><p>Concentrating his efforts and activating the Violet Heaven Escape Technique, Li Fan continued his descent. After roughly half a day had passed, he suddenly changed his expression.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense detected that not far ahead of him and within arm’s reach, there seemed to be something blocking his way.</p><p></p><p>However, within the devouring white mist, the range of his spiritual sense was greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>By the time he reacted, he couldn't dodge in time and was about to collide head-on.</p><p></p><p>Two black rays shot out from Li Fan's eyes. They were several times faster than his purple light form, dissipating the hidden shadows in the white mist before him.</p><p></p><p>Under the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword, all obstacles turned into nothingness, preventing Li Fan from being knocked out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then slowed his speed, approached cautiously, and let out a sigh of relief when he saw what was blocking his way.</p><p></p><p>It was not a strange creature but a collapsed and leaning building with a large hole pierced through its center by the annihilation sword. However, its original appearance could still be vaguely discerned.</p><p></p><p>The whole massive stone structure, with its decorations and gateways, was still visible.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not rashly enter the fallen building but continued his descent.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he landed on the ground with a creak, as if stepping on something.</p><p></p><p>Upon scanning it with his spiritual sense, Li Fan's heart clenched as he realized it was a living person!</p><p></p><p>With a fierce glare in their eyes and a terrifying expression on their face, the person stared at Li Fan intently!</p><p></p><p>"How come there are living people in the realm of confusion?" This thought flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant, and his body subconsciously reacted.</p><p></p><p>Retreating swiftly, the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword unsheathed again.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was on high alert as if facing a formidable enemy, something utterly unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>The person he had just made contact with, under Li Fan's gaze, did not move. Their body turned into gray particles in an instant, dispersing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? The person wasn't alive, they were already dead?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>With abundant experience in tomb raiding, Li Fan was not unfamiliar with such scenes. Those ancient items sealed for thousands of years would look vivid and lifelike one moment but turn corrupt and decayed immediately upon contact with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The situation in this realm of confusion was even more extreme. They directly turned into smoke and disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this place..."</p><p></p><p>Without lowering his guard, Li Fan carefully searched the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The scenes he witnessed made even Li Fan, who had seen much bloodshed, feel a creeping chill on his scalp.</p><p></p><p>Within a radius of one hundred feet, there were collapsed and damaged building ruins everywhere. In every corner of the ruins, many bodies lay in disarray.</p><p></p><p>They still retained their appearance and expressions from when they were alive. It seemed like they had seen something they deeply hated and feared, their faces filled with despair and resentment.</p><p></p><p>Everything froze at the moment of their death. As if a disaster suddenly struck, everyone in the ruins lost their lives simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>There were no wounds, no bloodstains. Yet they perished in such a way.</p><p></p><p>Just like the time Li Fan unintentionally stepped on a body, once they made contact with the external, they would turn into ashes in an instant and vanish completely.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan fearful was that these people were clearly not ordinary humans. The storage rings they wore and the various treasures they had just taken out but not yet used all indicated their cultivator status.</p><p></p><p>But in front of the unknown entity, they were as powerless as ordinary beings, waiting helplessly for death.</p><p></p><p>Approaching one of the bodies, Li Fan tried to remove the storage ring from their hand, hoping to find clues about these unnamed deceased cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these bodies disappeared in the same way upon his touch. He tried multiple times, with the same result.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no choice but to give up, suppress the chill in his heart, and continue his exploration outward.</p><p></p><p>The scene remained unchanged. The continuous ruins had turned into a giant graveyard, burying countless bodies that had died who knew how long ago. Eventually, even Li Fan became somewhat numb to it.</p><p></p><p>Speeding up his flight, he swiftly flew out of the range of this ruin.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like this is some kind of gathering point; the clothing on these cultivators is similar in some cases and different in others."</p>

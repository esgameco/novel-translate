        <h1>Chapter 1236</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a summary of the excerpt translated into English, being careful not to reproduce the full copyrighted text:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes a scene where a character named Li Ping is confronting a mysterious entity called Qingfeng, which takes the form of a willow tree. As Li Ping pulls on Qingfeng with silver chains, Qingfeng's true form is slowly revealed. </p><p></p><p>Qingfeng seems confused, wondering what has happened over the years and recalling that its true name is Tianyin, not the name Qingfeng given by someone called Xuyuan.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a silver needle shoots out from within Qingfeng/Tianyin, aiming straight for Li Ping's mind. Li Ping barely manages to block it with a golden protective shield. Li Ping realizes the needle is connected to someone from the Tianfa Realm and vows to destroy them for "disturbing the Xuanhuang world." </p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping knows he is not yet a match for his opponent, the "Heavenly Doctor." With a heavy heart, Li Ping releases the silver chains binding Qingfeng/Tianyin and prepares to flee with his stunned companion Sun Luyuan. As he vanishes, Li Ping hears a lamenting sigh: "Where will Tianyin's fading voice fall..."</p><p></p><p>After they disappear, the chaos in the world only intensifies, with lightning and thunder raging as if heralding the apocalypse. A figure as dark as ink descends upon Luoyan Prefecture - someone Li Ping would surely recognize if he were present.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This familiar existence.</p><p></p><p>It was the soul of heaven and earth, Ink Killer!</p><p></p><p>As the ultimate world-ending means of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it decisively descended after Li Ping left.</p><p></p><p>Ink Killer first glanced at the place where Li Ping had left.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, it skillfully transformed into endless ink.</p><p></p><p>To thoroughly eliminate Luo Yan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Ink Killer descended, and this time the speed of its spread was much faster than the Ink Killer's destruction of the sea that Li Fan had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of Luo Yan Prefecture had no time to resist or escape at all.</p><p></p><p>In just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Luo Yan Prefecture, which was originally a bit desolate but still had vitality, had completely turned into a void.</p><p></p><p>The sudden appearance of Ink Killer naturally alarmed many hidden powerful figures within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Luo Yan Prefecture no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>Even if they wanted to find some clues, they were powerless.</p><p></p><p>The impact of the Ink Killer's abrupt annihilation of a prefecture had just begun.</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Dynasty's grand opening, on the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sat upright, the remnant power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao on his body had already let him know what had happened in Luo Yan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this was the action taken by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao to prevent him from being probed and tracked by the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Luo Yan Prefecture was originally a remnant of the Heavenly Law Realm, so the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was very decisive in clearing it.</p><p></p><p>"That woman, named Tian Yin?"</p><p></p><p>"Like the Heavenly Doctor, she has the ability to peek into people's hearts."</p><p></p><p>"She is formless and hidden within the Xuanhuang Realm. In addition to her own abilities, it may also be the enhancement of the Heavenly Doctor's silver needle."</p><p></p><p>"Although the purpose is unknown, it must not be a good thing for the Xuanhuang Realm itself."</p><p></p><p>Although this contact with the Heavenly Doctor also ended in defeat.</p><p></p><p>But it also let Li Ping know the gap between him and the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>"Even stronger than the Dharma Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the road I have to walk is still very long."</p><p></p><p>"However, the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao I borrowed this time was limited. After all, I originally only thought of subduing that woman. If it was really a matter of life and death, the blessing of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao could be dozens of times more."</p><p></p><p>"My Holy Dynasty has also just begun, and there are still unlimited prospects."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Fishing Pond is a supreme treasure, and it may bring me some surprises from outside the high walls."</p><p></p><p>After a brief failure, he immediately began to summarize and seek solutions.</p><p></p><p>"But just these are still not enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally thought of the sealed evil thoughts of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the remnant thoughts of the Cong Yun Sea this time, he had a clearer understanding of the power of the world's will.</p><p></p><p>"If I could devour the Xuanhuang evil thoughts..."</p><p></p><p>"With the Xuanhuang power restored to completeness, I will have a qualitative change again."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this matter must be put on the agenda."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Li Ping was thinking, Sun Luyuan was trembling and hiding under the Holy Emperor's seat, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>Just now, whether it was the Holy Emperor in front of him, or Tian Yin, or the performance of that silver needle, they all greatly shocked Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was also a cultivator who had attained the Dao, in front of them, he was simply like a child, with no power to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think of that woman named Tian Yin?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the voice of the Heavenly Mandate Holy Emperor entered Sun Luyuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shuddered and showed a bitter expression.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

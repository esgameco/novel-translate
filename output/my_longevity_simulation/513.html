        <h1>Chapter 513</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, with the inner disciples secretly practicing cultivation, their progress advanced rapidly from then on.</p><p></p><p>There were consecutive incidents of disciples surpassing their masters in a very short amount of time.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the situation began to change.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the disciples below rapidly progressing in their cultivation, the elders of the Dadao Sect began to feel unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dadao Sect still emphasized hierarchy and seniority to an extent,</p><p></p><p>the law of the cultivation world throughout history, the strong preying on the weak, was hard to change.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the elders relied on their cultivation and positions to firmly control the power of the sect.</p><p></p><p>But they were not yet old, yet they could see the inner disciples catching up to their cultivation levels, or even surpassing them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their dominant position being challenged, how could they remain indifferent?</p><p></p><p>So, the upper-level elders also divided into two factions.</p><p></p><p>One faction believed that the "new methods," while advancing cultivation quickly, were far from the right path. Continuing in this manner would cause irreversible damage to heaven and earth, and it needed to be completely prohibited.</p><p></p><p>However, the other faction believed that the vastness of heaven and earth was limitless and inexhaustible. Although cultivators could plunder endlessly during their lifetime to support their own cultivation, not everyone could reach the realm of immortality. Once they fell, everything they had consumed would return to heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Hence, there was no need to worry about it.</p><p></p><p>Now that the "new methods" had spread far and wide, numerous scattered cultivators rose due to it. The strengths of disciples from other sects also greatly improved due to their practices.</p><p></p><p>If the Dadao Sect did not adapt to the new methods, it would inevitably fall behind.</p><p></p><p>Both factions had their reasons, and neither yielded to the other. But as the faction supporting the new methods secretly cultivated, their long-stagnant powers were boosted, gradually gaining the upper hand in the power struggle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan and Senior Sister Zhao emerged from seclusion, they witnessed this chaotic scene.</p><p></p><p>"Challenging the laws of nature?" Senior Sister Zhao repeated softly, a hint of a strange light flickering in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was extremely fascinated by the new methods, he also felt inexplicably anxious.</p><p></p><p>As if it harbored some kind of immense disaster.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, our cultivation of 'The Exchange of Heaven and Earth' should not be noticeable," Zhao Senior Sister said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what do you think of this so-called 'new method'?" Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao chuckled lightly, "It's just taking advantage of shortcuts. No matter how quickly they progress, can they be faster than our dual cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>"But it should serve as a good cover."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>So, the two of them pretended to cultivate the new methods on the surface, while actually using the power of dual cultivation to seize this rare opportunity and improve their own cultivation realm to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>Another ten years passed.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between the old and new factions intensified. Not only were there internal struggles within the sects, but outside the sects, scattered cultivators formed the "Myriad Immortal Alliance," attempting to challenge the authority of the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>Internal power struggles among family members were one thing, but when outsiders sought a share, it was another matter.</p><p></p><p>To maintain their rule, the Ten Immortal Sects, claiming to be in the same boat, were actually competing among themselves. Several years later, they united once again to form a joint force against the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it was believed that these scattered cultivators, without any foundation, would quickly be defeated under the united attack of the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>But the development of events took an unexpected turn.</p><p></p><p>Starting with direct defeats against the Ten Sect cultivators, the so-called Myriad Immortal Alliance suffered heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>However, their numbers were just too many.</p><p></p><p>Even if a batch was wiped out, a new group of cultivators quickly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with each battle fought, some Myriad Immortal Alliance members managed to escape alive.</p><p></p><p>After surviving each bloody battle, the strength of these cultivators underwent transformations. Even the geniuses of the Ten Immortal Sects found it increasingly difficult to eliminate these individuals.</p><p></p><p>The mortal world was vast, and with the support of the new methods, these mortals could swiftly transform into a potent force for the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the Ten Immortal Sects boasted a sense of pride and dignity, meticulously selecting their disciples.</p><p></p><p>In case of defeat and disciple casualties, it often took several years or even more than ten years to replenish their forces.</p><p></p><p>In this comparative growth, the gap between the two sides became smaller.</p><p></p><p>The battle reached a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with different casualties among the sects, the once united Ten Immortal Sects gradually began to show internal divides.</p><p></p><p>There were even instances where some sects intentionally abstained from fighting to preserve their strength.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that at this point, the rise of the Myriad Immortal Alliance was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Hence, a plan to capture the thief first was developed.</p><p></p><p>The rapid rise of the Myriad Immortal Alliance was largely attributed to those known as "transmitters of methods," and these individuals had a significant role to play.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these transmitters of methods were extremely loyal to the revered leader who transmitted these methods.</p><p></p><p>By defeating this leader, the Myriad Immortal Alliance would lose its spiritual leader and collapse on its own.</p><p></p><p>While the transmitter himself had only reached the Harmony Stage of cultivation, among the Ten Immortal Sects, there were quite a few Strong Immortals.</p><p></p><p>If he could be found and the beheading plan executed,</p><p></p><p>this predicament could be resolved.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Immortal Sects reached an agreement to send out strong internal disciples in teams to pledge to assassinate the transmittor.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the transmitter's elusive nature,</p><p></p><p>to pinpoint his location, elite disciples from the Ten Immortal Sects were sent out to roam the world and gather information.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Senior Sister Zhao were naturally among them.</p><p></p><p>This search lasted for more than twenty years.</p><p></p><p>With the help of dual cultivation, Senior Sister Zhao had successfully ascended to the Transcendence Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, slightly behind, had also broken through to the Nascent Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>Traveling across the realms, they slew numerous scattered cultivators, yet they had not found any trace of the transmitter.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what do you think of this transmitter?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Transmitter of methodsâ€¦" Senior Sister Zhao pondered for a moment and shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Taken aback by her response, Li Fan listened as Senior Sister Zhao continued, "One person's power changing the landscape of the cultivation world. For tens of thousands of years in the Xuanhuang Realm, there has never been such a monstrous figure."</p><p></p><p>"But all these pieces of information are mere rumors. The identity and motivations of this person remain a mystery."</p><p></p><p>"I am afraid seeing him in person may be the only way to get answers."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if our other brothers have had any success."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were chatting, they suddenly received a message from within the sect.</p><p></p><p>After reading it, their faces lit up with excitement.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the "beheading plan," which had made no progress for over twenty years, had been unexpectedly canceled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Senior Sister Zhao exchanged a glance, knowing that something significant must have happened.</p>

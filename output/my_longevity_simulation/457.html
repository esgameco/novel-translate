            <p>"If we can eat up a large portion of Pu Xianzhen leaves in the market in advance, we can force the other party..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like we can easily make several times the profit!"</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant!" After understanding the key point, Jiao Xiuyuan suddenly slapped his thigh and couldn't help but sigh. 新69書吧→69shuxi.com</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao is indeed a business genius!" Li Fan nodded, praising.</p><p></p><p>Not taking Li Fan's compliment to heart, Jiao Xiuyuan's expression changed, furrowing his brows as he carefully pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Although his face showed excitement, it slowly disappeared, and he shook his head, saying, "Friend, your idea is indeed brilliant, but it seems too idealistic."</p><p></p><p>"What if the agreement signed when borrowing Pu Xianzhen leaves includes terms for repayment with equivalent contributions?"</p><p></p><p>"What if the other party risks breaching the contract and refuses to repurchase Pu Xianzhen leaves?"</p><p></p><p>"There are too many uncontrollable factors, and the risk is too high."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan somewhat disagreed, "Isn't there any business without risks in this world? Compared to the profits it can bring, I think it's worth a try."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's expression changed slightly, about to respond, but then heard Li Fan say, "Moreover, I think that even if the other party gives up struggling against us and voluntarily withdraws, the large amount of Pu Xianzhen leaves we acquire will still be profitable." 新69書吧→69shuxi.com</p><p></p><p>"Why do you say that?" Jiao Xiuyuan raised an eyebrow, somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>A hint of smile appeared at the corner of Li Fan's mouth, and he extended his index finger.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, a crystal-clear twenty-faced dice materialized out of thin air upon which continuously spun, reflecting many fragmented images.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of confusion, Jiao Xiuyuan recognized the treasure in Li Fan's hand and exclaimed, "Heaven and Earth Dice?!"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take a closer look at the images on the dice, Li Fan immediately put it away.</p><p></p><p>"I have deduced this matter, and it should be almost certain." Li Fan said with a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan's confident appearance, Jiao Xiuyuan couldn't help but become a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Let me investigate further." After speaking, the puppet in front of Li Fan completely went silent, as if it had lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't in a hurry, standing quietly on the side, patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>This wait lasted for a day and a night.</p><p></p><p>When vitality returned to Jiao Xiuyuan's body, he suddenly opened his eyes and revealed a joyous expression, "There's a chance!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What did you find out, my friend?" Li Fan asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>Approaching, Jiao Xiuyuan lowered his voice, "According to reliable sources, the ones manipulating the price of Pu Xianzhen leaves behind the scenes are several Nascent Gods led by Tan Tai Can of Tianzhoushan."</p><p></p><p>"Their backgrounds are more or less connected to the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"And the Wise Discernment Symbols used everywhere are basically monopolized by them."</p>

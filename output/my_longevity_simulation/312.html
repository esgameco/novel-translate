        <h1>Chapter 312</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Aside from Ji Hongdao casting a surprised glance at Li Fan during a lecture, almost no one knew that Li Fan had already entered the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>However, even if these students knew, they likely wouldn't think much of it. After all, the Golden Core realm was quite common among this group.</p><p></p><p>Compared to cultivation levels, what they valued more was attainment in formation techniques. The closed training for the [Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation] was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>Since personally witnessing the encapsulation of the Heavenly Profound Mirror last time, many students seemed to have gained some insights, making rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>In the final test item, the formation core affinity assessment, they made a comeback.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, Li Fan was slightly distracted due to his concern over the Congyun Sea incident and his own core formation; on the other hand, his innate talent in formations was quite ordinary, so he didn't have any particular insights.</p><p></p><p>The combination of these two factors caused his performance to essentially stagnate.</p><p></p><p>As they say, if you don't advance, you fall behind. Li Fan's ranking in the results dropped significantly.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, in the previous formation structure and soul contract recognition items, his scores were at the top. Overall, he didn't fall too far behind, still ranking above average.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Ji Hongdao announced that the final assessment would take place in a month and a half.</p><p></p><p>It would be the actual deployment of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>Only sufficient formation materials would be provided, without any assistance from others. Each person would set up the formation alone.</p><p></p><p>The final evaluation and ranking would be based on the actual construction of the formation. Naturally, there would be rewards for top performers. However, Ji Hongdao kept the specific prizes a secret.</p><p></p><p>He only said they were extremely precious, even tempting him to personally participate in the competition. Upon hearing this, the students were invigorated and eagerly returned to their respective courtyards to make ample preparations for the final assessment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also about to leave when Ji Hongdao called out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Although the final assessment is coming up soon, rationally speaking, I should temporarily conceal this matter."</p><p></p><p>"But this matter is too significant. I believe you have the right to know." Li Fan instantly understood what Ji Hongdao was referring to. However, he still had to play along.</p><p></p><p>Feigning a slight surprise and a look of ignorance, Li Fan respectfully said, "Senior, please speak freely. I can handle it."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao nodded slightly, "Since that's the case, listen well."</p><p></p><p>"Your hometown, Congyun Sea..."</p><p></p><p>"Is gone..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's response was also on point.</p><p></p><p>Without any particular reaction, he appeared completely baffled, "Gone? What does that mean?" A hint of gloom flashed in Ji Hongdao's eyes, "Gone, in the literal sense."</p><p></p><p>"The entire Congyun Sea has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "Senior, don't joke around. How vast is the Congyun Sea? How could such a large area just disappear..."</p><p></p><p>Halfway through his words, Li Fan suddenly fell into dead silence.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at Ji Hongdao, seeing that he didn't look like he was joking at all. As if struck by lightning, his body slowly trembled.</p><p></p><p>Eyes wide as copper bells, Li Fan disregarded the difference in their cultivation levels and identities. He abruptly stepped forward, grabbing Ji Hongdao's arm.</p><p></p><p>"Is it true? How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..." Seeing Li Fan's instantly frenzied appearance, Ji Hongdao let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>With a finger, he sent Li Fan back to his courtyard and said, "Go back and calm down first. As for the specifics of what happened, you can search for it yourself in the Heavenly Profound Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"The relevant information should still be available."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Fan had already returned to his small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining his earlier expression, Li Fan began searching for information about Congyun Sea in the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Heavenly Calamity Sword was ultimately no match for Ink Slaughter. The current Congyun Sea has completely become a void abyss."</p><p></p><p>"The Yunshui Palace has also vanished without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"This outcome was also expected. Perhaps the Heavenly Calamity Sword's origin is on the same level as Ink Slaughter, but currently it's just a partial remnant sword, even missing the hilt."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover... for such a major event, the discussion heat is surprisingly low. It seems that Venerable is exerting influence again."</p><p></p><p>With such a big incident, it was impossible to completely conceal it.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance didn't choose to block or censor the news, but rather gave it a cold treatment.</p><p></p><p>The initial discussions were very heated. The image of Ink Slaughter's world destruction recorded by Jiao Xiuyuan shocked many cultivators while also arousing their greed.</p><p></p><p>Apart from sympathy for the misfortune of the Congyun Sea cultivators and questioning why Ink Slaughter would use such brutal means to directly destroy a world, the most discussed topic was actually the feasibility of merging with Ink Slaughter.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the number of people discussing the first two topics decreased, leaving only the power enthusiasts persisting.</p><p></p><p>"Just what level of battle power is needed to merge with Ink Slaughter? In my opinion, although the cultivation world is vast, no cultivator is qualified."</p><p></p><p>"I nominate one person, Young Lord Jinglun. Rumor has it that decades ago, he was already at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, with unfathomable strength. He even once resolutely gave up the opportunity to merge with the world's spiritual essence when faced with its temptation, simply because that spiritual essence was too weak!"</p><p></p><p>"Although Young Lord Jinglun is powerful, compared to Ink Slaughter, he still falls short."</p><p></p><p>"Those black particles annihilate everything. Resisting them is extremely difficult. I think if Zhong Shentong advances to the Nascent Soul stage, his endless seven-colored divine light might be able to contend with it."</p><p></p><p>"Zhong Shentong? A Foundation Establishment cultivator? And at such an old age? You really think any trash can step on Young Lord Jinglun's toes? I alone can crush him, without the young lord making a move!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This fellow Daoist talks big. Dare to leave your name and address? This old man will personally visit to exchange pointers!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan browsed this information with a grief-stricken face.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he thought, "Suffering such misfortune, even if my final exam results are a bit worse, it's very reasonable."</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Li Fan remained in his residence and declined all visitors, perfectly portraying a cultivator who had suddenly suffered a great change.</p><p></p><p>As time slowly passed, Li Fan clearly noticed that the memories of Congyun Sea in his mind were constantly fading.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were obstructed, and he almost never actively recalled related matters.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan hadn't specially opened up an area in his mind's Dao stone to record specific things and review them every few days, he would have nearly forgotten about the extinction of Congyun Sea as well.</p><p></p><p>All this happened in just over a month's time. "The power of the Eternal Life Venerable is truly terrifying and awe-inspiring."</p><p></p><p>Once again personally experiencing the Venerable's influence, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, everything returned to normal.</p>

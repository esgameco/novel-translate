            <p>Chapter 1024: Ling Mu Subdues the Medicine King</p><p></p><p>"The more extraordinary Xuan Tian Wang is, the more terrifying his mysterious disappearance seems. New 69 Book Bar 87 SHUX.com"</p><p></p><p>"In this life, Mo Rubin's plan to find Xuan Tian Wang should be able to succeed..."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully he is just severely injured and has gone into hiding. Not truly fallen and reincarnated, as I suspect." Li Fan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>Having collected the two immortal-level formations, "Xuanji, Wanling Guishu" and "Huangluo, Xukong Shenghua", and through the analysis of the Final Dissociation Disc, Li Fan also vaguely guessed the possible use of this complete set of formations. </p><p></p><p>"Creating a world..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's recreating a world experienced in memories or a brand new world, there's no doubt this set of immortal-level grand formations can do it."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, such a realm was too far from Li Fan. At present, he could only catch a glimpse of it through the extrapolation of the Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>With the complete analysis of the formations, Li Fan no longer needed to devote his entire mind. He only needed to split off a thread of consciousness to supervise the operation of the Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then summoned Liu Ruchen and others from the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>"During this time, I've been thinking that it's too much of a pity for Liu Yihang and the others to remain in slumber. Now is the time for manpower, plus your Medicine King Sect's recent performance..."</p><p></p><p>"After comprehensive consideration, I've decided to let them cultivate a new method to restore their combat power as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>While speaking, Li Fan led Liu Ruchen and the others to a building in the Spirit Wood Realm. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Stepping inside, they saw bookshelves that stretched as far as the eye could see. </p><p></p><p>The shelves were filled with jade slips.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually took thirty and handed them to Liu Ruchen.</p><p></p><p>"They're actually all Hua Shen stage cultivation methods?" Liu Ruchen was overjoyed after a glance.</p><p></p><p>Let alone in the current cultivation world where methods cannot be jointly cultivated, even at the height of the ancient cultivation world, taking out thirty Hua Shen stage methods at once would definitely be considered extravagant.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect members thanked the Shangshi repeatedly, and then involuntarily glanced at the endless sea of books behind Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, only Li Fan knew that this seemingly vast Cang Gong Pavilion actually only contained a hundred methods he had just plucked from Mo Rubin, and more than fifty ownerless methods Li Fan had collected in previous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, they were all just illusions created by Li Fan using formations.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's trick was indeed very deceiving.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the qi fluctuations of varying degrees on these Medicine King Sect Hedao, the effect was clear.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly and ostentatiously cast a spell, summoning a row of bookshelves emitting a faint golden light from the depths of the book sea.</p><p></p><p>The jade slips placed on them were all wrapped in white jade-like light spheres, clearly not ordinary items.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan solemnly took one from above, first closing the Cang Gong Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he hand the jade slip to Liu Ruchen. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan being so serious, Liu Ruchen couldn't help but feel a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>After receiving it and probing for a while, his expression changed slightly: "So many elixir formulas?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, it also caused a commotion among the few Hedao elders of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes were all fixed dead on the jade slip in Liu Ruchen's hand, as if looking at some supreme treasure of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Actually, to be honest, the elixir formulas in this jade slip for them</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was truly an unimaginable treasure, because it contained all the pill formulas currently used by the Alchemy Hall of the Wanxian Alliance. It even included detailed pill refining techniques and analyses of various possible situations during the refining process.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was still obtained from Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Although some secret pill formulas were missing, acquiring them was still an easy task. But for the current members of the Medicine King Sect, it was a huge fortune.</p><p></p><p>It was enough for them to catch up with the pill refining standards of the Wanxian Alliance in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the grace of the envoy," Liu Ruchen and the others said sincerely this time.</p><p></p><p>But the surprises Li Fan had prepared for them were far more than this.</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's voice and sensing a force descending upon them, they did not hesitate and let it take effect.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they appeared in an unfamiliar world.</p><p></p><p>This world was even more vast than the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>What was even more exaggerated was that the world was full of spiritual plants and herbs growing wildly. The rich spiritual energy was almost condensed into a tangible form.</p><p></p><p>And in the sky, there was a piece of land floating.</p><p></p><p>After scanning the area, everyone exclaimed in surprise, "How come there are traces of our Medicine King Sect's restrictions on it?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, this place looks a bit familiar. Isn't it the Changsheng Valley?"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, they recognized the origin of this piece of land.</p><p></p><p>They all turned to look at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also looked surprised, "What? So this secret realm originally belonged to your Medicine King Sect?"</p><p></p><p>He then explained, "When our Wanjie Alliance was collecting reserve forces, we happened to discover this... Changsheng Valley. We thought it was ownerless, so we conveniently moved it into this cave heaven."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with a straight face.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Medicine King Sect had various expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen sighed, "It turns out that fate was already destined."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and did not explain further, "As you can see, the Wanjie Alliance is a union of the surviving cultivators from various realms. Naturally, there are some relics from other worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Baihua Daoyou!" At this point, Li Fan called out.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren arrived leisurely at this time and appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng realm?" Liu Ruchen and the others' expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"Let me introduce, Baihua Daoren, from the distant Wansheng Realm. It is because of her care for the spiritual plants here that they are so vibrant. If any of you are also skilled in this field, you can exchange ideas with Baihua Daoyou." Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The few members of the Medicine King Sect all bowed to Baihua Daoren.</p><p></p><p>Although Baihua was a bit weak in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But she was a genuine Changsheng realm cultivator. The Medicine King Sect members, out of their innate reverence for Changsheng cultivators, were very respectful towards Baihua.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren, who had not enjoyed such attention for a long time, couldn't help but feel a little elated.</p><p></p><p>She took the initiative to introduce the distribution and quantity of spiritual plants in the wood-attributed cave heaven to Liu Ruchen and the others, drawing exclamations of admiration.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Fan finally revealed his true intentions and stated his request.</p><p></p><p>"I need a kind of pill that can directly increase cultivation after taking it. Don't consider any side effects, just seek the maximum efficiency in increasing cultivation. The more the better."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words caused everyone to look at him.</p><p></p><p>However, they quickly realized that this pill was obviously not for Li Fan himself to take.</p><p></p><p>This was the first task arranged by Li Fan, and the Medicine King Sect members immediately agreed.</p>

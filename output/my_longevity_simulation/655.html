        <h1>Chapter 655</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The appearance looks like a circular door emitting a blue light, and the demon beasts passing through it only need a moment in the real world. However, during that moment, they will experience countless vivid illusions that are indistinguishable from reality.</p><p></p><p>The content of the test of "Harmonious Unity" naturally tests whether the demon beasts will behave in a way that harms their masters under various extreme circumstances.</p><p></p><p>The creation of this "Harmonious Unity Ring" was not easy, and the Beast Control Sect was only able to produce one in a hurry. Although the time required to complete the test was relatively short, the number of demon beasts in the Beast Control Sect was too many. There were not only the lifebound demon beasts of the disciples but also a large group of ownerless demon beasts engaged in laborious work, responsible for managing the spiritual fields, and guarding the sect.</p><p></p><p>Although they were called ownerless, all these demon beasts were under the slavery of the Beast Control Sect.</p><p></p><p>The one who controls them is the treasure of the Beast Control Sect, the "Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts." It is said that almost all demon beasts in the world are engraved on this wheel. Even if a brand-new species of demon beast is born, it will soon appear on it.</p><p></p><p>When a demon beast is born, its soul is imprinted with the Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts, and it will never be able to escape the control of the wheel for all eternity.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this treasure was brought out by Emperor Sanmao from the Sacred Beast Mountain of the Southern Sea and handed over to the founding ancestor of the Beast Control Sect, "Yong of Ten Thousand Generations." And Yong of Ten Thousand Generations precisely comprehended the "Beast Control True Secret" from the "Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts."</p><p></p><p>However, although the Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts has various incredible powers, it also has many fatal flaws. It must be used on newly born demon beasts. Every demon beast whose soul has been imprinted with it is constantly in great agony under the "Wheel of Suffering." Therefore, their intelligence cannot fully develop, and they can only engage in some simple tasks.</p><p></p><p>To control them in beast battles, there must be a connection of minds. Only then can they be controlled as if they were one's own arms, displaying their maximum fighting strength. It should be noted that in battles against peers, every detail can affect the outcome. If the demon beasts being controlled are not very intelligent, it is almost like cutting off one's own arm.</p><p></p><p>So the disciples of the Beast Control Sect, relying on the "Beast Control True Secret," slowly cultivate their lifebound spirit beasts from a young age. They would never consider directly selecting those demon beasts controlled by the Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts.</p><p></p><p>This also led to a difficult situation for the Beast Control Sect when the catastrophe struck, as they were unable to evacuate safely.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the evacuation operation was personally supervised by Emperor Sanmao, in front of whom, whether human or beast, no one dared to act rashly. The test of the "Harmonious Unity Ring" was carried out in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>By the end of the first day, only about one-tenth of all demon beasts had completed the test. This meant it would take about half a month in total to complete the selection. The demon beasts that passed the screening embraced their masters and entered the "Boat of Ten Thousand Beasts" ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they would board this flying tool and leave the Xuanhuang Realm, heading to an unknown refuge in a small world.</p><p></p><p>As for those who failed the test, despite their reluctance, they were still forcibly separated from their owners. It was said that these demon beasts would be temporarily detained until the entire Beast Control Sect evacuated safely, and only then would they be allowed to leave.</p><p></p><p>When the test reached the seventh day, on that night, Xu Kehu who had been missing the entire day, found Li Fan in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei, something big is happening. You need to leave quickly," said Xu Kehu anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was practicing the "Creation Furnace Technique" with his eyes closed, opened his eyes and glanced at the other person indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Xu Kehu continued, "I'm not joking this time. If you stay here any longer, you'll really be in danger. Forget about me; you need to quietly leave the Beast Control Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan yawned and replied, "This time it's not a joke, if you stay any longer, you really won't make it. Don't worry about me, you need to leave the Beast Control Sect quietly."</p><p></p><p>Xu Kehu was stunned, "You...how did you know?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan answered, "Do you think I eavesdropped on our conversation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Kehu staggered, "You...you eavesdropped on us?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head confidently, "It's obvious just by thinking about it, no need to eavesdrop."</p><p></p><p>"What's more, those demon beasts that didn't pass the test won't be released as promised; they will all be put to death. Isn't that right?" Li Fan spoke first.</p><p></p><p>Xu Kehu was incredulous, "How did you know?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replied coldly, "The demon beasts that failed the test, no matter the number of secrets they know about the sect. The matter of evacuating the Xuanhuang Realm is crucial to the life or death of the Beast Control Sect. If leaked, who can guarantee that the demon beasts won't pursue them to the small world? There will be no escape, just a disaster of annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Sanmao is not a kind-hearted person. He gave the method of enslaving his own kind to humans…” A dangerous look flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In short, these demon beasts must all die!" Li Fan said in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words were resolute.</p><p></p><p>After some time, Xu Kehu finally reacted. He stared at Li Fan in astonishment and asked, "If you figured it all out, why are you so calm? Aren't you afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked straight at Xu Kehu, asking, "What's there to be afraid of? Am I going to fail the test of that 'Harmonious Unity Ring'? You really have no confidence in me?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Xu Kehu was intimidated by Li Fan's momentum, unable to directly look into his eyes. He stammered, "It's not like that. Nothing is absolute; what if..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew up and landed a claw on Xu Kehu's head, saying firmly, "No ifs!"</p><p></p><p>He decisively stated.</p><p></p><p>Xu Kehu hesitated to say more. Although he was extremely anxious, he also knew very well about this stubborn bird's temperament and refrained from further persuasion.</p><p></p><p>After waiting anxiously for three days, Xu Kehu finally saw the day when Xiao Hei (Black) would undergo the test.</p><p></p><p>With all eyes watching nervously, Li Fan stepped into the "Harmonious Unity Ring."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, time seemed to stand still.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Harmonious Unity Ring suddenly burst into a gentle blue light, a sign of a successful test!</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Xiao Hei, you're amazing!" Xu Kehu exclaimed and rushed towards Li Fan, wanting to hug him, only to be ruthlessly kicked away by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Test passed. Next one," Lu Ya exclaimed somewhat surprised, looking at Li Fan before announcing.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, after all the demon beasts of the Beast Control Sect had completed the test of the "Harmonious Unity Ring," the Boat of Ten Thousand Beasts was already fully loaded.</p><p></p><p>They were about to set sail towards an unknown new home.</p><p></p><p>"Luya Senior, aren't you leaving?" On the deck, Xu Kehu looked curiously at Lu Ya standing at the bow, tilting his head and asking.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya reached out and patted Xu Kehu's head, "We still need some manpower. The Ten Sects of Immortals also have face to uphold. If they don't cooperate, it could anger others."</p><p></p><p>Xu Kehu nodded somewhat understandingly.</p><p></p><p>"You go. The future of the Beast Control Sect depends on you." Tying a red cord around Xu Kehu's right wrist, Lu Ya said with a hint of reluctance in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this is the red cord that Mr. Bai used to tie! Xu Kehu recognized the unique way of tying the red cord and its origin.</p><p></p><p>When the children recovered from illness in the broken temple in Ningyuan City, Mr. Bai would tie such a red cord on their wrists to wish them a safe and secure future.</p><p></p><p>Xu Kehu lifted his hand and looked at the red cord in front of his eyes, staring at it for a while.</p>

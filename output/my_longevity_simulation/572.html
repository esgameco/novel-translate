        <h1>Chapter 572</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Master Mi!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's voice was not loud, but it sounded like a thunderbolt in the ears of He Zhenghao and the other two. </p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was first stunned, then his face turned pale: "Master Mi has returned from the border? How come I didn't know?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan was also shocked, with an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But then, Zhou Qing's words slightly eased their tension.</p><p></p><p>"Master Mi has not returned from the border yetâ€¦" Zhou Qing said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"But if some people think their small actions can deceive Master Mi in seclusion, it's a bit ridiculous..." </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's words seemed to have a hidden meaning as he glanced at the two in the room.</p><p></p><p>Feeling guilty, He Zhenghao stammered, "We all know that Master Mi's methods are extraordinary, and there is no way we could deceive him!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan, no longer confident as before, quickly realized the abnormality in Zhou Qing's demeanor after his return and started thinking more.</p><p></p><p>Sweat dripped down his back, feeling extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced for a solution while mechanically agreeing with He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two still stubbornly defending themselves, Li Fan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Then his voice suddenly turned louder as he rebuked, "You two embezzled fundraising capital behind Master Mi's back; while he was away, you acted recklessly, disregarding the laws of the Immortal Alliance, selling titles for profits..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think you can deceive the all-knowing Master Mi?"</p><p></p><p>"How could you be so naive!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt like he was struck by lightning, trembling uncontrollably. </p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan also turned pale, opened his mouth to speak but couldn't utter a word.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, don't be fooled by Master Mi's appearance of only being at the Golden Core stage. You should all understand the true extent of his power."</p><p></p><p>"While he may not physically leave his residence, he knows everything that happens within this small Cloud Sea. How can you deceive his watchful eyes?" Li Fan boasted.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since you, He Zhenghao, misappropriated unclaimed funds, Master Mi has been keeping an eye on you."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's legs went weak upon hearing this, and he sat down heavily on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I..." He Zhenghao wanted to defend himself but found it difficult to speak as bitterness filled his mouth, rendering him speechless.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing sighed lightly, "Although he doesn't care much about such contributions. Since you were the first disciple to follow him after his awakening, Master Mi turned a blind eye to your actions."</p><p></p><p>"Consider it as a reward for your hard work, He Zhenghao."</p><p></p><p>"But your recent actions in the past two years have disappointed Master Mi greatly."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's tone was stern as he continued, "Selling titles for profit, is that wrong? Many in the Immortal Alliance do the same. Master Mi is not ignorant of human nature, so why would he stop you?"</p><p></p><p>"If you were open and honest, and appealed to Master Mi, perhaps he would even help you with this matter!"</p><p></p><p>"But you should not have taken matters into your own hands. By selling various positions, I believe you have accumulated contributions worth not less than a million."</p><p></p><p>"Have you even once reported to Master Mi about these violations of the Immortal Alliance laws? If one day the truth comes out, the blame will surely fall on the highest-ranking official in Cloud City, Master Mi."</p><p></p><p>"It's one thing if you embezzle, but trying to make Master Mi your scapegoat is simply outrageous!" Zhou Qing's voice grew intense.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt extremely aggrieved as he sat on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to argue that before leaving, Master Mi had repeatedly instructed him not to bother him with trivial matters. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there was no reason to report embezzlement to higher authorities. Wasn't it better to be safe than sorry?</p><p></p><p>But even if he could speak out, it would be useless at this point. </p><p></p><p>Reflecting on his actions over the past two years, He Zhenghao felt lost as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>The hard-earned and cherished contributions he used to possess now seemed like mere numbers to him, devoid of actual value.</p><p></p><p>Even spending over a hundred thousand contributions instantly did not make him flinch.</p><p></p><p>With a significant amount of contributions under his control, his mindset gradually shifted unknowingly.</p><p></p><p>Though he initially vowed to follow Master Mi closely, who might ascend to the status of an eternal celestial being, and make a name for himself...</p><p></p><p>Returning to Tianyu Province in glory, reconciling with Heng Ruoshui...</p><p></p><p>As time passed, he became lost in the praise of others and the seemingly endless contributions, forgetting his lofty goals. He only focused on using unethical means to embezzle as many contributions as possible for his enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>There were countless female cultivators in the world, why would he need only Heng Ruoshui?</p><p></p><p>With enough contributions, what kind of female cultivator couldn't he have?</p><p></p><p>At times, such thoughts even crossed his mind.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was deeply trapped and couldn't extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of his past flashed in his mind, making He Zhenghao feel as if he had just been pulled out of the water, soaked from head to toe.</p><p></p><p>"How did I become like this?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was filled with confusion and regret.</p><p></p><p>"Master Mi, will surely not spare me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Shuddering, he seemed to envision himself being punished by Li Fan, meeting a grim fate.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still a glimmer of hope in He Zhenghao's heart.</p><p></p><p>Because once the truth was out and Master Mi decided to punish him, judging from his past actions, he wouldn't let Zhou Qing reveal so much information to him again.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou Qing, who had just sincerely advised him, even mentioned a doubled contribution of sixteen thousand.</p><p></p><p>At this thought, He Zhenghao couldn't help but raise his head and look at Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>After observing He Zhenghao's long silence and desolate expression, Li Fan, with a faint smile in his eyes, finally spoke again, "Although your crimes are unforgivable. But, after all, you were among the first followers of Master Mi."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, Master Mi has decided to give you a chance to make amends."</p><p></p><p>With these words, both He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan's eyes lit up with a hint of hope.</p><p></p><p>"Please elaborate?" Gao Yuan quickly asked with a bow.</p><p></p><p>"As I mentioned before, the battle in Tianlingzhou is coming to its conclusion."</p><p></p><p>"So, Master Mi's intention is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused, "Seize this final opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Seize that chance to amass a large sum once again!"</p><p></p><p>With a resolute tone, Li Fan's voice echoed in the hall, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Both men looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>They glanced at Zhou Qing, their faces showing a hint of skepticism.</p>

            <p>Pei Tuo responded and eagerly entered the [Thousand Rock Heavenly Cave]. </p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, on the other hand, was outside concealing the fluctuations caused by the other party devouring the heavenly cave.</p><p></p><p>After all, this place belonged to the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and now was a time of tense war situation. Although he and Pei Tuo were indeed both members of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, it was still best to be careful and avoid some trouble.</p><p></p><p>Just like the process when Li Fan devoured the Five Elements Heavenly Cave before.</p><p></p><p>From the golden core, the ferocious roots of heaven and earth surged out frantically. </p><p></p><p>With thousands upon thousands of tentacles, they consciously took root in various parts of the Thousand Rock Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Entangling and tightly locking.</p><p></p><p>Eventually enveloping the entire heavenly cave within.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly cave rumbled and transformed into streaks of light particles, merging into Pei Tuo's body.</p><p></p><p>This process lasted for a full three days.</p><p></p><p>After three days, Pei Tuo suddenly reappeared in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Nascent Soul realm on his body surged and remained unsettled for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Long trapped in the Golden Core realm, breaking through in one morning, Pei Tuo was about to let out a long whistle to vent the pleasure in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, he was pulled back to reality by Ji Shaoli's cold reminder: "Let's go, don't linger."</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo's aura instantly stagnated.</p><p></p><p>Although he was now a whole cultivation realm higher than the other party, he did not dare to underestimate Ji Shaoli in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The force behind that [Mutual Aid Society] must be an extremely terrifying one! Dealing with a small Nascent Soul like himself would certainly be as easy as turning his hand over.</p><p></p><p>So Pei Tuo obediently followed behind Ji Shaoli, returning to Congyu Sea in a low-key and swift manner.</p><p></p><p>As for the people of the Mutual Aid Society like Xiang Xin, upon seeing Pei Tuo who was now at the Nascent Soul realm, they were shocked to the core.</p><p></p><p>Finally confirming that Ji Shaoli's words were not false.</p><p></p><p>While regretting why they weren't the first to join, the way they looked at Ji Shaoli also gradually became fervent.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Xiang Xin finally couldn't resist the temptation and asked: "Fellow Daoist Ji, when we break through in the future, will the organization..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled and interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured everyone, as the first batch of veterans of the [Congyu Sea Mutual Aid Society], as long as your realm arrives, an ownerless heavenly cave will be arranged immediately! So your most important task at the moment is to cultivate diligently and improve your cultivation as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>These words instantly gave the several people present endless motivation. </p><p></p><p>They all returned to the Tianxuan Mirror on the Myriad Immortals Island and began to cultivate bitterly regardless of the cost.</p><p></p><p>And when the news of Pei Tuo's breakthrough spread, it caused an incredible shock among the cultivators who had come to attend the banquet that day.</p><p></p><p>For a time, cultivators who came to visit Haixuan Island and wanted to join the [Congyu Sea Mutual Aid Society] came in an endless stream.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Shaoli chose to close the door and refuse all visitors, not seeing anyone at all.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called law cannot be passed on lightly."</p><p></p><p>No matter how they shouted, Ji Shaoli pretended not to hear anything, and started trading materials in the Tianxuan Mirror market again.</p><p></p><p>Although 6 million contribution points seemed a lot, it was not quite enough.</p><p></p><p>Before the Mutual Aid Society developed, he needed to earn more back.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just at the moment when Pei Tuo officially broke through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>A huge amount of feedback cultivation suddenly emerged from Li Fan's dantian.</p><p></p><p>Instantly absorbed by Li Fan, it made his original mid-stage Golden Core cultivation leap forward.</p><p></p><p>"It really works! Using that non-existent [Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal] as an intermediary carrier, the final actual beneficiary is still my true self!" Li Fan took a deep breath, his eyes revealing</p><p>The key lies in the so-called membership oath.</p><p></p><p>The oath essentially states that all brothers within the mutual aid society, under the witness of the Compassionate Immortal, need to help and love each other. And all the conveniences provided by the mutual aid society are rewards from the Compassionate Immortal. The members need to always keep this in mind and so on.</p><p></p><p>"From this perspective, it won't take me long to return to the Nascent Soul realm."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if the Myriad Immortal Alliance has discovered the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven at this point in time."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Li Fan summoned Tian Yang and asked him to make a trip to Tianling Prefecture on his behalf. </p><p></p><p>To see the specific situation there.</p><p></p><p>"Just investigate, prioritize your own safety," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang nodded vigorously, then transformed into a stream of light and left the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With Tian Yang's strength, even if he's discovered, escaping shouldn't be a big problem."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that Nascent Divinity cultivation is ultimately not quite sufficient. After I return to the Nascent Soul stage, perhaps I can consider helping him Merge the Dao."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the figures of several Heaven and Earth Souls flashed by in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, he locked onto a target.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth Souls can almost be considered equivalent to Merged Dao cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Back then, Chiyan, who was just a furnace worker, also forced the Congyu Sea Nascent Divinity cultivators to use all their techniques before barely defeating him.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, the entire Dao Merging process needs to be completed in complete secrecy. Without drawing the attention of other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's assistance, it would probably be a bit of a stretch for Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think of the three from the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it will still take some time before the Medicine King True Cauldron returns."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering where else to get some help from.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Wood Realm suddenly underwent an inexplicable change. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, after Shang Tianci's tireless hard work day and night, the Spirit Wood Realm had transformed.</p><p></p><p>Countless picturesque spirit energy landscapes dotted various parts of the Spirit Wood Realm. Misty spirit energy connected the earth veins below and reflected the sky above.</p><p></p><p>As if connecting into one.</p><p></p><p>The entire world seemed to be undergoing some kind of marvelous metamorphosis, and the most obvious beneficiary was of course the spirit tree at the center of the world.</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, it, which had long ceased growing, grew taller by nearly a third once again.</p><p></p><p>The branches and leaves were verdant and glistening, exuding a rare vitality once more.</p><p></p><p>As if something had been gestating all along.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan instantly locked onto the source of the anomaly through the Spirit Wood Core. </p><p></p><p>It was in the space at the center of the spirit tree that originally nurtured the tree people.</p><p></p><p>Countless green light spots converged, forming a blurry human silhouette.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes as he arrived nearby in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The female chief of the tree people also hurried over at this time.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the increasingly clear human form that was about to take shape not far away, startled at first, then seeming to remember something.</p><p></p><p>She became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is the [Tree Spirit]!" She took the initiative to explain to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Through the female chief's explanation, Li Fan also understood what the so-called [Tree Spirit] actually was.</p><p></p><p>If the tree people were born from the spirit tree to serve as guards,</p><p></p><p>Then the target they needed to protect was to guard the spirit tree until it gave birth to its own spirit intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Li Fan forcibly refining the Spirit Wood Core and seizing it by force, the Tree Spirit was more like the true master of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>A bare body gradually appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the aura emanating from its body was also slowly increasing.</p>

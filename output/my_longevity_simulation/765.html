        <h1>Chapter 765</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"It was as if he had been beaten so much that he had developed a resistance to divine abilities," Li Fan thought to himself in shock. Li Fan's techniques were becoming increasingly ineffective. However, Shuo Feng was growing bolder with each battle. </p><p></p><p>Eventually, Li Fan excused himself by saying he was no match and needed to ponder new divine abilities, then left. He did not go elsewhere, but went straight to the Heavenly Authority Mirror in the Tian Quan State and exercised his level 35 privilege.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to his imagination, instead of directly opening a passage to the main Heavenly Authority Mirror within its mirror space, he was informed of a time and place to go to. Someone would guide him then, and they would not wait if he was late.</p><p></p><p>At the appointed time, Li Fan arrived at a towering lotus-shaped stone mountain outside Tian Quan City. A middle-aged cultivator was already waiting there. The cultivator had a goatee and wore a blue Daoist robe. He looked at Li Fan with some surprise but was very polite, taking the initiative to greet him: "Greetings, fellow Daoist. I am Wang Wan."</p><p></p><p>Based on the inadvertent aura revealed by the other party, Li Fan judged that this Wang Wan had at least formed an immortal spirit. He did not neglect to return the courtesy: "Greetings, Daoist Wang. I am Li Fan."</p><p></p><p>After introducing themselves and nodding slightly, they did not converse further. "A level 35 privilege requires more than just powerful cultivation; one must have various connections within the Immortal Alliance. No wonder he is so polite to me despite my mere Yuan Ying intermediate stage," Li Fan realized.</p><p></p><p>After a while, another female cultivator wearing a white tight outfit arrived at the mountaintop. After greeting Li Fan and the other, she also remained silent and waited quietly. Li Fan learned her name was Deng Mingxi.</p><p></p><p>No other cultivators arrived after that. A whole incense stick's worth of time passed before spatial ripples appeared above the mountaintop. It was as if invisible threads had cut out a transparent door, and a black-robed cultivator walked out from it.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the identities of the three, the black-robed cultivator said solemnly, "Follow me." Without any visible action, the transparent door suddenly expanded, enveloping Li Fan and the other two in a brilliant light. The door then vanished, taking the people inside with it.</p><p></p><p>A familiar feeling welled up in Li Fan's heart. It was just like when he had infiltrated the location of the "Root of Heaven and Earth" in the void of Tian Ling State back then. His flesh, blood and bones seemed to dissolve and transform.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike in the Root of Heaven and Earth, there seemed to be some mysterious force existing in this vast black-and-white space that exerted a suppressive effect on Li Fan, preventing his own lines from subtly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently pondered this faint suppressive force on his body, thinking: "This must be the protective measure of the Heavenly Authority Mirror for us."</p><p></p><p>"After all, we've come to comprehend divine abilities. Without this protection, ordinary cultivators might be completely assimilated by this space in no time."</p><p></p><p>"However, based on my experience in the Root of Heaven and Earth and my comprehension of the similar 'Unraveling Life' divine ability, I should be able to last longer than others."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan surveyed his surroundings. He saw Deng Mingxi and Wang Wan not far away, also transformed into line forms. However, they looked slightly different from their original bodies. Deng Mingxi's body...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The figure was smaller than the two male cultivators. It looked to be around 13 or 14 years old.</p><p></p><p>As for Wang Wan, although his physique hadn't changed much, the vague outward appearance had transformed from the middle-aged goatee cultivator to that of a decrepit old man.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wan seemed to have been here before, dashing forward with familiarity.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingxi was initially a bit confused and fearful. </p><p></p><p>However, her mental fortitude was strong, and she quickly adapted. Following Wang Wan, they flew towards the center of the black and white space.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan followed as well.</p><p></p><p>During the flight, Li Fan realized that this place was different from where the Heavenly Mirror was born in his previous life - it was not as expansive, but more independent. </p><p></p><p>Yet, there was a vague connection.</p><p></p><p>"They are all Heavenly Mirrors, but with different functions," Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before they arrived at the very center of the black and white space.</p><p></p><p>There, a suspended platform was constructed from countless intersecting lines.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingxi and Wang Wan landed on the platform. The lines representing their feet became chaotic, dispersing into numerous black threads that connected to the ground below, like small tentacles.</p><p></p><p>The scene looked rather eerie.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the vision became vividly colorful again. </p><p></p><p>Countless characters cascaded down like a waterfall before forming a few lines of text:</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator [Li Fan] has entered."</p><p>"Please demonstrate the desired technique in your sea of consciousness."</p><p>"Based on Cultivator [Li Fan]'s current cultivation, the power limit of this technique is capped at the [Nascent Soul] level."</p><p>"Remaining demonstration time..."</p><p></p><p>Followed by a constantly ticking countdown - only ten hours.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Heavenly Mirror, he must hold something back. But this opportunity was hard-won, so he also had to maximize his benefits.</p><p></p><p>The shocking and unconventional [Chaos] technique was definitely not something he could demonstrate.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan had made his decision.</p><p></p><p>"This space of the Heavenly Mirror is remarkably similar to the origin of the world."</p><p>"If my guess is correct, it is analyzing the birth process of the world."</p><p>"If that's the case..."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, insights about the [Reverse Five Elements Life-Extinguishing Sword] surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The [Reverse Five Elements Life-Extinguishing Sword] was a technique Li Fan had comprehended based on the Great Five Elements Sword of Extinction, combined with his own understanding of the Dao of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>However, as he was only at the Nascent Soul realm, his comprehension of the Dao of Life and Death was rather superficial, unlike his clone Xu Bai's extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>Since its realization, it had not seen much practical use, mostly just being used as a variant of the Sword of Extinction.</p><p></p><p>As for the "life" creation function, it was currently limited to only being able to shape spirit stones, which was quite trivial.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this can bring me some surprises," Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>He noticed that as he meditated on the insights of the [Reverse Five Elements Life-Extinguishing Sword] in his mind, the lines connecting his feet to the platform began to sway, as if touched by a gentle breeze. The black color of the lines grew more intense.</p><p></p><p>It was as if something was being transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the Heavenly Mirror's response arrived.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, various scenes appeared before Li Fan's eyes. He vaguely saw the birth process of the Five Elements Immortal Realms, and then countless flashes surged upwards, forming a massive tree with innumerable branches.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The mischievous youth chuckled and said, "Just a nobody. However, if you want to come visit our Great Qi, I can make an introduction for you."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan pondered for a moment, then cupped his hands in salute. "In that case, I'll have to trouble you, my young friend."</p><p></p><p>The mischievous youth, who was Ou Shangtian, revealed a meaningful smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on tight."</p><p></p><p>With a cold shout, he instantly approached and placed his hand on Sun Luyuan's shoulder. </p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Sun Luyuan found himself in the endless void.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian was already leading the way, rushing ahead.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>"This young man's flying speed is incredibly fast," Sun Luyuan marveled inwardly. </p><p></p><p>The iridescent glow faintly emanating from his body made Sun Luyuan feel a hint of the same greed he had felt when facing the Essence of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Originally confident about this journey, Sun Luyuan's state of mind had now become somewhat chaotic. After flying aimlessly in the void for a while, a magnificent scene that seemed to be hidden beneath the water's surface suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>A huge sphere of light, its internal details indiscernible. </p><p></p><p>Around the sphere, numerous stars orbited. Shining brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>Each star seemed to be a cave heaven world.</p><p></p><p>Even from a great distance, Sun Luyuan was shocked by the sight before him.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the small world of Great Qi?"</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a large small world?!"</p><p></p><p>While Sun Luyuan was utterly astonished, he suddenly came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>The young man who had been leading the way had disappeared without a trace!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Baihua, I caught a Wanxian Alliance Hedao. Sneaking around suspiciously, clearly up to no good..."</p><p></p><p>He vaguely heard the young man's voice coming from somewhere.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan sensed something was amiss and was about to cry out an explanation.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the scene before his eyes suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The vast world and cave heavens from before vanished. What appeared before him was a magnificent palace resembling a spire.</p><p></p><p>His body had shrunk dozens of times, like an ant.</p><p></p><p>Each step in front of the palace was like a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>The majestic immensity filling his vision made Sun Luyuan hold his breath.</p><p></p><p>What was even more incomprehensible to him was that all his cultivation had inexplicably vanished.</p><p></p><p>Just like a complete mortal.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan calmed his mind and tried to clear all distracting thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, his mind settled and he opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>However, the scene before him remained that grand palace, unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>To his horror, Sun Luyuan found that his body seemed to have shrunk even further. </p><p></p><p>"Is this... a formation?"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Sun Luyuan's mind. He quickly took out Ji Hongdao's Formation Breaking Disk again.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the disk emitted a bright white light.</p><p></p><p>It kept flashing, spontaneously deducing how to break the formation before him.</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Luyuan was waiting hopefully, the disk's flashing frequency increased.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it seemed unable to withstand it, reaching its limit. Cracks appeared on its surface.</p><p></p><p>Then it exploded with a bang, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>When he borrowed this disk from Ji Hongdao, he hadn't mentioned anything about this situation occurring.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, Sun Luyuan realized.</p><p></p><p>This formation was too complex, far exceeding what the Formation Breaking Disk could handle.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case,</p><p></p><p>"I can only try to break the formation with brute force."</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, there were no other changes in the formation except for him.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan took a deep breath, and a dark red phantom floated out from the top of his head.</p><p></p><p>The strongest technique of a Harmonized Dao cultivator is derived from the Essence of Heaven and Earth that they have refined.</p><p></p><p>The Essence of Heaven and Earth that Sun Luyuan had refined was called [Blood Shadow].</p><p></p><p>The moment Blood Shadow appeared, Sun Luyuan's body seemed to be dissolved by it, bizarrely melting, leaving only a layer of skin.</p><p></p><p>And then it completely turned into a blood color.</p><p></p><p>Like gurgling water, it flowed in reverse, surging rapidly along the tall steps in the formation.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the steps of the palace were restored.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the flowing blood water became faster and faster, gradually turning into a crimson ray of light. It no longer needed to climb along the steps, but shot straight towards the top of the palace.</p><p></p><p>However, the palace itself also underwent corresponding changes.</p><p></p><p>The steps multiplied on their own, extending endlessly in both directions.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were at a stalemate, that raging crimson shadow suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>It turned into a sky full of blood rain, and with the help of the dispersing force of the explosion, it no longer persisted in climbing, but escaped in different directions of the space here.</p><p></p><p>Those drops of blood water were like extremely scorching lava, even able to burn the space.</p><p></p><p>Where it scattered, there were holes in the formation space.</p><p></p><p>The tall palace scene began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>The phantom gradually shattered, and the blood water that Sun Luyuan had turned into slowly disappeared through these holes.</p><p></p><p>"Escaped!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With murderous intent surging in his heart, he was about to settle the score with the evil young man who had led the way before, but the voice that came to his ears made him feel like he had fallen into an icy pit.</p><p></p><p>"It was actually broken?"</p><p></p><p>"Master is going to punish me for this. I've worked hard studying for more than half a year, but I can't even trap a mere Harmonized Dao cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>The evil young man's extremely frustrated tone didn't seem to be an act.</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean? Was that terrifying formation set up by that young man? Not the great protective formation of the Holy Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was very skeptical that he had heard wrong.</p><p></p><p>"What does 'studying for more than half a year' mean? Could it be that he is still a beginner? A formation that even the Broken Formation Disc pushed to the extreme cannot find flaws in, is the result of his half a year of work?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Your formation is actually not bad. It's just that your cultivation level is a bit too low. When he fully unleashed his blood fire, I estimate that even Harmonized Dao cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm would not be able to withstand it. It's understandable that your formation couldn't bear it."</p><p></p><p>"Just focus on cultivating. In the Xuanhuang Realm, cultivation level still overwhelms everything. Exotic beasts, exotic abilities, formations, are all just supplements."</p><p></p><p>A gentle female voice sounded beside the young man.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Senior Baihua." The young man responded somewhat dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>In a flash of golden light, Sun Luyuan noticed that he was locked onto by a gaze.</p><p></p><p>And the aura coming from the other party made Sun Luyuan feel like he had fallen into an icy pit.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"A Longevity Mirror cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's mind went blank.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that as soon as he arrived at the Holy Dynasty, he would encounter a Longevity Heavenly Venerate?</p><p></p><p>"Baihua? What kind of inverse reasoning is this? Why have I never heard of it?"</p><p></p><p>"You are from the Myriad Immortals Alliance? What is your purpose in coming to our Holy Dynasty?" Daoist Baihua asked lightly.</p><p></p><p>Invisible golden light had already enveloped Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>With just a single thought from her, she could turn this Harmonized Dao cultivator from the Myriad Immortals Alliance into colored glaze and easily crush him.</p><p></p><p>After all, consuming so much Essence of Origin Force was not for nothing.</p>

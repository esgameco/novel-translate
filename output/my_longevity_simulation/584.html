        <h1>Chapter 584</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On the surface of the spirit stone, the prohibition jointly carved by the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders' Association was something Li Fan couldn't imitate for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"At present, creation is only limited to the spirit stone, a simple object composed purely of spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"If the structure is slightly more complicated, I am powerless."</p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Fan was extremely pleased.</p><p></p><p>Because this meant a good start.</p><p></p><p>As his realm continued to rise and his cultivation improved, it would not be impossible for him to create things out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the Yuanying realm meant a tremendous leap in strength.</p><p></p><p>However, there was now an urgent matter facing Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't make progress.</p><p></p><p>Learning from He Zhenghao's "Mountaineering Judgement" was just a Golden Core realm technique.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Yuanying realm, the feedback in his cultivation progress, like a clear stream, was almost imperceptible.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it was not of much help to him.</p><p></p><p>Although he had accumulated some foundation in cultivation through the Jiéshēn technique, stabilizing the realm he had just broken through, and not being in a hurry to cultivate at the moment, he couldn't delay it too long. Of course, resolving this issue as soon as possible would be better.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had already planned how to handle it.</p><p></p><p>The intermediate strategy was naturally to obtain the opportunity to use the derived artifact "Yàn-Fǎ Jué" through the reward from the Supreme Immortal, Yanfa Jué, to extrapolate the subsequent parts of the "Mountaineering Judgement."</p><p></p><p>However, in the previous life, the Supreme Immortal was ambushed by the Elders at the Five Elders' Association while looking for hidden spies and executing the process of the "Virtual Reality Sovereign Calculation," which led to his imminent demise. 69bookshelf.com 89shux.com</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan couldn't guarantee this event would absolutely occur.</p><p></p><p>So, he also prepared a contingency plan.</p><p></p><p>The "Jiàn Fǎ Yùpái," although extremely precious, was only awarded to cultivators who made great contributions to the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But it was not the only priceless item.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current wealth, if he was willing to spend a huge amount of contribution points, it was not impossible to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>But on one hand, it seemed a bit ostentatious, and on the other hand, it could easily expose his identity and attract the attention of those with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps once he obtained the technique, he would have to flee really.</p><p></p><p>So, it was a last resort.</p><p></p><p>The above mentioned were the intermediate strategy and the contingency plan.</p><p></p><p>As for the best strategy...</p><p></p><p>It all depended on the situation.</p><p></p><p>This was something Li Fan understood himself.</p><p></p><p>Having cultivated the "Mountaineering Judgement" for several lifetimes, in terms of understanding this technique, Li Fan considered himself second-best in the world, and perhaps no one would dare claim the first.</p><p></p><p>In each moment of cultivation and the feedback gained, insights emerged in Li Fan's mind like glimmers of stars.</p><p></p><p>Accumulating bit by bit, Li Fan already had his unique understanding of how to achieve success through "Mountaineering Judgement."</p><p></p><p>With his accumulated foundation, spending some time, he might be able to deduce the next part of the "Mountaineering Judgement" on his own. 69bookshelf.com 89shux.com</p><p></p><p>After all, Yàn-Fǎ Jué's ability to derive techniques depended on the infinite possibility of extrapolation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps for techniques, it could analyze and create with extreme thoroughness and insight.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, it was limited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan himself couldn't reveal all his secrets clearly because he was still under the control of the Transmitter of Law, requiring constant extrapolation every day, and he was a peculiar object that was difficult to maintain physically.</p><p></p><p>"Ultimately, it depends on how things will unfold next."</p><p></p><p>"During this process, I may be able to play a hand again. Wanxian Alliance is looking for a mole, just take advantage of this opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes and calculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he slowly got up.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the realm, the changes in his body were temporarily checked.</p><p></p><p>As for the displayed upper limits of physiological age and psychological age on the 'Hái Zhen' panel, in Li Fan's eyes at this moment, they were trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>As long as his cultivation continued to improve, they would naturally increase along with it, so Li Fan didn't need to worry about them.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only when he faced the huge gap between the Primordial Dao-Immortal realm and the Changsheng Dao-Sovereign realm in the future, would he focus on them again.</p><p></p><p>In comparison to the upper limits of age, Li Fan was more interested in the word "Tian Zeng" marked later on in the panel.</p><p></p><p>After a perception, according to the explanation of 'Hái Zhen,' Li Fan learned that although the theoretical physiological age limit was 999 years, due to the hatred of the will of this world, the actual time a cultivator could live was far less than this number.</p><p></p><p>This was consistent with the current situation of cultivators in the Xuanhuang world as known to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Because with his style of causing turmoil, in any lifetime, he probably wouldn't live up to the average lifespan of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>His true lifespan was actually his psychological age.</p><p></p><p>So, for Li Fan, the most suitable thing was to make the most of his time in each lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Zeng..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking further, he opened his mouth slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan moved all the items from his storage ring into his personal cave.</p><p></p><p>He left only ordinary items in the ring to hide his tracks before quietly leaving the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>Without hurrying back to Congyun, he stayed in Tianlingzhou and investigated the whereabouts of the aforementioned Zhang Debiao he had heard about earlier.</p><p></p><p>Yes, Li Fan also had the idea of investigating the damaged bodies of cultivators on the Tianlingzhou battlefield.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because he had any special preferences, but to unlock new 'Hái Zhen Anchors'.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had previously used a remnant pill to complete a charge for one anchor.</p><p></p><p>However, in the subsequent attempts, 'Hái Zhen' seemed to dislike the quality of the remnant pill and remained indifferent to the fragments he bought from the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan guessed that perhaps the next anchoring required a complete Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>But which Golden Core cultivator would be willing to sell their Golden Core?</p><p></p><p>Such items were not traded in either the Tianxuan Mirror or the civilian market.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan had never had the opportunity to unlock new anchors.</p><p></p><p>But now, it might be a good time.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators had fallen in the Tianlingzhou battle.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were not the main force in the war, there were certainly many fallen Golden Core cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Yuanying cultivators, Golden Core cultivators, without the support of their personal domain in the world, couldn't reshape their bodies.</p><p></p><p>If vital parts of their bodies were suddenly injured, such as the head or heart, and they couldn't react in time to sustain their life with spiritual energy and receive timely treatment, they would die.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the possibility of intact Golden Cores in those bodies was quite high.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Debiao seemed to have made a fortune from dead bodies, and it was clear he was a covetous person.</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be difficult to buy some Golden Cores from him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's calculations rang out, but to his surprise, he encountered difficulties from the first step.</p><p></p><p>He searched Tianlingzhou thoroughly but couldn't find Zhang Debiao.</p><p></p><p>It was said that he had been in Tianling City a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>But in the past few days, no one knew where he had gone, and he hadn't been seen since.</p><p></p><p>According to the underground rumors, Zhang Debiao had recently boasted to his confidants about taking on a big deal.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown if he had gone to do this big business.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

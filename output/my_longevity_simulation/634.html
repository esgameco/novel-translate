        <h1>Chapter 634</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In his opinion, even though the process of refining the soul of heaven and earth was extremely dangerous, he, He Zhenghao, was not a reckless person. He just seized the opportunity. If it really couldn't be done, he would never go to his death in vain. Taking a bit of risk to gamble on the chance of reaching the peak in one step. Why not?</p><p></p><p>However, He Zhenghao would never have imagined that the real soul of heaven and earth was not on the same level as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was limited by his perspective. He Zhenghao, with only a Golden Core cultivation base now, although had traveled widely and had a wide circle of friends, he had never seen with his own eyes, or even learned from the classics, the true power of the soul of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He just knew that such a thing existed.</p><p></p><p>It was just like a farmer imagining the emperor's golden hoe, far from reality. And this seemed to have destined the tragic ending of He Zhenghao in this world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just when the group of cultivators was still discussing the prophecy of Li Fan about the rising underwater cave in the Political Hall.</p><p></p><p>The main character, Li Fan, had quietly arrived at the location of the underwater cave.</p><p></p><p>Over a few hundred miles in length, the seabed was like a steep staircase, forming three major faults. Between each layer, there was a drop of four to five kilometers. Above each fault, due to the intense geological activity, many mountain ranges rose from the seabed. The scene was magnificent and unique, surpassing land mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>It was the location where He Zhenghao formed his Golden Core in his previous life: the underwater three faults.</p><p></p><p>"During He Zhenghao's previous life, although he was somewhat frustrated, he did not lose his ambition. Upon obtaining the 'Mountain and River Hidden Dragon Technique,' he rose strongly like a dragon emerging from the abyss. With the comprehension of the four methods to form the Golden Core, his future was immeasurable."</p><p></p><p>"In this life, although He Zhenghao's power and influence far exceeded the past, he practiced a combined Dao method. However, he was lax in cultivation, only forming the core with a single method."</p><p></p><p>"Given an opportunity, and yet you are not of use."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt somewhat emotional in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After a slight shake of his head, he got down to business.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept over the faulted mountain ranges below, his eyes narrowing: "Chaoyuan Sect..."</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan said earlier in the Political Hall was not a lie. Although Chaoyuan Sect was extremely strange and filled with dangers, when Shaofeng and Su Xiaomei entered it in their previous life and returned safely, all of them had advanced a major realm in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the unexpected factors of He Zhenghao's foundation building in the previous life, this monument was originally supposed to fly out of the Cloud Sea after anchoring for 22 years and head towards Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>Thus, it still remained hidden beneath the faults.</p><p></p><p>Fully inheriting the memories of Medicine King Sect's Dugu Chang, Li Fan searched for a while but did not find any trace of Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, even the Cloud Water Celestial Palace, known as the lord of the Cloud Sea, was the same.</p><p></p><p>All searches yielded no results.</p><p></p><p>"It's strange. Whether it's the Cloud Water Celestial Palace or Chaoyuan Sect, according to the information in the Tianxuan Mirror, both were famous ancient sects. They may not be comparable to the ten major immortal sects, but they were definitely stronger than the Medicine King Sect. Why is it that there is no information about them in the minds of Medicine King Sect's disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they did not exist in the same era? Perhaps the existence of Cloud Water Celestial Palace is more recent?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan couldn't find an answer. Instead, he felt that many clues were conflicting and illogical.</p><p></p><p>He stored these thoughts in his mind, looked at the seabed below, and manifested his newly understood divine ability, the Heart-Defying Sword.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, countless sword lights appeared in the continuous underwater mountain ranges, illuminating the dark seabed. The sound of a loud boom echoed continuously.</p><p></p><p>The mountains cracked, and one huge fissure after another appeared on the seabed.</p><p></p><p>As if being torn apart by countless sword lights in an instant, this wondrous sight on the seabed stretching for miles, with a single thought from Li Fan, completely disintegrated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>And in the midst of this catastrophe, Li Fan finally found traces of the hidden Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Without any blockades, he simply watched as the buildings of this monument rose and emerged from the water.</p><p></p><p>Getting smaller and smaller, it eventually turned into the appearance of a cave and headed towards Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>After the Nascent Soul stage, Li Fan's spiritual perception became even more sensitive. Just at the moment he faced the remnants of Chaoyuan Sect, he even faintly felt a hint of a fatal crisis.</p><p></p><p>"The opportunities in this world are endless. There's no need to take this risk. Let the people of the world explore it first, and only act once the mysteries are completely understood."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought this way as he watched Chaoyuan Sect leaving.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan himself was not concerned, the remnants of Chaoyuan Sect still caused a great stir among the cultivator community.</p><p></p><p>Moments after informing everyone that the chance of an underwater cave was appearing, and before the cultivators had left the Political Hall, this cave emerged.</p><p></p><p>This was too coincidental!</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators even suspected whether this cave was fabricated by Li Fan to once again showcase his mysterious prophetic abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, this notion was soon refuted. The ancient, ancient aura within the remnants of Chaoyuan Sect was unquestionably authentic.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because of the attention it drew, under the joint efforts of the cultivators, the origins of the main hall of the remnants, the Taiyuan Hall, were quickly traced.</p><p></p><p>An ancient immortal sect, Chaoyuan Sect!</p><p></p><p>Even a Nascent Soul-stage cultivator well-versed in ancient cultivation history personally endorsed it, confirming the authenticity of the remnants.</p><p></p><p>As a result, within the Cloud Sea and even the entire Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, many cultivators were tempted by this so-called "opportunity" and followed the remnants.</p><p></p><p>Among them was a person that even Li Fan did not expect.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Political Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going too? This opportunity of Chaoyuan Sect, no matter how you look at it, it can't compare to... right? Or would you first go and observe, then come back soon?" Facing Gao Yuan's farewell, He Zhenghao asked in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe. After I returned, I kept pondering on it, feeling that something was off. After thinking for three days and nights, I finally figured it out." Gao Yuan said somewhat emotionally.</p><p></p><p>"One must be equipped with skills to complete the job. Even though I am highly favored by the master, my strength is only at the Golden Core stage. I can still hold my ground in the Cloud Sea. If the master truly succeeds in the combined Dao, then he will surely have Nascent Soul and Core Formation experts under him. How can I stand out then? In order to better follow in the master's footsteps, I, Gao Yuan, must push myself to the limit!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was not swayed by Gao Yuan's righteous words, looking at him suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me like that." Gao Yuan smiled faintly. "I am not fooling you this time. I have already applied for leave with the master and will be leaving immediately."</p><p></p><p>"What about you, friend He?" Gao Yuan gave He Zhenghao a meaningful glance.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao hesitated for a moment, and ultimately refused Gao Yuan's request to accompany him, citing the need for someone to maintain and be responsible for the affairs in the Cloud Sea.</p>

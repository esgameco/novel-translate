        <h1>Chapter 1308</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A thousand souls shift, a hundred spirits turn."</p><p></p><p>"No blame."</p><p></p><p>The illusory figure's preaching continued.</p><p></p><p>It was not transmitted through sound or spiritual awareness, but directly resounded in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>Even the three people present - the Holy Emperor, the Dharma Transmitter, and the Heavenly Doctor - who were all deeply concerned about the safety of Xuanhuang, were now uncontrollably immersed in the immortal secrets conveyed by the young Daoist.</p><p></p><p>It was not until a chapter of the immortal secrets was fully recited, and the illusory figure of the young Daoist became blurry and indistinct again, with his voice fading in and out, that the three of them came back to their senses in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>They glanced at each other, and with great tacit understanding, they flew backwards and away from the illusory figure of the young Daoist.</p><p></p><p>The illusory figure of the young Daoist did not stop them, as if he had completed his own mission, and let the three leave.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the preaching grew weaker and weaker. Eventually, along with the illusory figure of the young Daoist, it inexplicably disappeared into the void.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the expressions of the three were very subtle.</p><p></p><p>They pondered the reason for the sudden appearance of this illusory figure to preach the Dao, and then slowly disappear.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the three of them were also savoring the immortal secrets they had just heard.</p><p></p><p>Immortal secrets are different from mortal techniques, extremely arduous and abstruse.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the illusory figure of the young Daoist only bluntly recited the contents of the immortal secrets without any explanation.</p><p></p><p>Although the comprehension of the three Holy Emperors could be said to be at the peak of the mortal world, it was still a bit of a stretch to fully comprehend an immortal secret in such a short time. They could only guess a general idea.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a cultivation technique, but a chapter on avoiding calamity. It seems to be mixed with some records about the immortal realm..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's mind turned rapidly, but his actions did not stop as he returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Doctor, he had disappeared at some unknown point.</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently glancing in the direction of the Daoyuan State in the Xuanhuang Realm, the Holy Emperor did not sense the aura of the awakening of the Heavenly Capital.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is about to be destroyed, yet it remains unmoved."</p><p></p><p>"But just now, it actively showed its figure..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the dissipation of the wind disaster?"</p><p></p><p>Despite having many doubts in his heart, now was ultimately not the time to delve into them.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed by, but the Holy Emperor still focused his attention on the current situation in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xuanhuang Realm, there was another endless rain of golden needles. However, the power dispersed by the golden needles after falling to the ground had a subtle change compared to before. The Holy Emperor glanced at it and saw some clues. If the previous one was a heavy medicine during a critical illness, then the current one was a recuperation after the major illness had just been cured. The power of the golden needles had become much gentler and more soothing.</p><p></p><p>Thunder rumbled in the distance, and a light rain fell continuously.</p><p></p><p>It was like the awakening of insects in spring, with all things reviving and thriving.</p><p></p><p>The turbulent Xuanhuang Realm actually presented a scene full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Living up to the name of Heavenly Doctor, he actually used only golden needles in such a short time to forcibly return the Xuanhuang Realms that had already entered the fusion state, making the Xuanhuang world repeat its original appearance. What was even more precious was that the world itself did not suffer any trauma as a result.</p><p></p><p>Healing the world is like healing people, golden needles reverse life and death. To reach such a realm, it is not enough to simply have a high level of attainment. It also requires a thorough understanding of the essence of the world.</p><p></p><p>As a fellow supreme being who once claimed to be the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao and had an incomparably close connection with the world, the Holy Emperor knew in his heart that he definitely could not achieve the same level as the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>"But even someone like the Heavenly Doctor cannot find the mastermind behind the scenes now..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor felt extremely heavy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the outer void of the Great Enlightenment, the Holy Emperor felt an increasingly ominous feeling about Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Before, it was like boiling water in a pot, and now it was only a thin line away from the water boiling.</p><p></p><p>It could undergo a qualitative change at any time.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Doctor also felt it, and they no longer held back, unleashing their ultimate techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the heavenly cities of each state, where the stone statues of the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerated Ones originally stood, regardless of whether the stone statues still existed or not, with a tremor in space, illusory giant figures of the Dharma Transmitter appeared, covering the original ones.</p><p></p><p>Like a series of light spots lighting up one after another, they shone on most of the body of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, five light spots of different colors also lit up on the side of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Six colors, connected into lines.</p><p></p><p>Like the meridians of the Xuanhuang Realm, they shone brightly under the light of day.</p><p></p><p>"Seal the soul!"</p><p></p><p>"Substitute the realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's cold and stern voice resounded through the world.</p><p></p><p>The figures of the Dharma Transmitter once again emulated the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor then appeared faintly above the head of the Dharma Transmitter's dharma appearance.</p><p></p><p>Then, with his right hand holding a seven-colored needle, he solemnly pierced it into the Baihui acupoint of the Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the dharma appearance of the Dharma Transmitter burst out with a dazzling seven-colored light.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if dissolving, it flew like a flowing light towards the meridians of the Xuanhuang Realm that were flashing below.</p><p></p><p>Silently, the moment the seven-colored light entered the meridians of Xuanhuang, it had already circulated a full cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Sealing the soul and substituting the realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Heavenly Doctor temporarily sealing the soul of the Dharma Transmitter and guiding it into the world of Xuanhuang, achieving a brief substitution of the body for the world?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor saw this scene from afar, and his heart was inexplicably shaken.</p><p></p><p>Having once merged with the heavens, the Holy Emperor was able to understand how difficult it was to achieve such a level.</p><p></p><p>Let alone a world, even possessing a cultivator was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm not only had the consciousness of the Heavenly Dao, but also due to the special environmental factors of being outside the immortal ruins and facing the possibility of extinction at any time, it was extremely active.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, someone had even inherited the position of Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerated One.</p><p></p><p>With so many blessings, the Heavenly Doctor and Dharma Transmitter joined forces, yet they were still able to forcibly suppress and seal the original consciousness of the Xuanhuang Realm and substitute their own bodies for it...</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm is unaware of the current crisis, if the Dharma Transmitter replaces it and self-inspects with his own body, he will definitely be able to find the location of the hidden great formation!"</p><p></p><p>This method of suppressing the origin would definitely cause great damage to the Xuanhuang Realm. However, at this moment of crisis, there was no time to care about so much!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was solemn, waiting for the Dharma Transmitter's discovery.</p><p></p><p>When the seven-colored light had circulated more than three thousand six hundred cycles in the meridians of Xuanhuang, the circulation suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>In one location, as if the meridians were blocked by something, a sky-piercing black evil aura erupted.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor suddenly opened his eyes, and his compassionate eyes rarely revealed a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Nine golden needles flew like threads, instantly flying towards the targeted location.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Holy Emperor also reacted.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed and appeared together with the nine golden needles.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding earth had already turned into nothingness in the eruption of the black aura just now.</p><p></p><p>It revealed the hidden void deep below.</p><p></p><p>In the void, there were two figures, one sitting and one standing.</p><p></p><p>The sitting one was no more than seven or eight years old in size, with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>The standing one had an unclear appearance.</p><p></p><p>However, facing the golden needles of the Heavenly Doctor and the furious Holy Emperor in front of him, he was extremely calm.</p><p></p><p>"Again, this familiar feeling..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor felt like falling into an abyss, his heart icy cold.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, the rapidly descending golden needles slowed down.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor seemed to see the figure below slowly uttering a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Immortals descend..."</p><p></p><p>"All things return to the void!"</p><p></p><p>An invisible storm erupted instantly.</p><p></p><p>It blew the Heavenly Doctor's nine golden needles into disarray in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The rapidly flying Holy Emperor was like heavily crashing into a wall. It was not as simple as seeing stars, but his body and soul almost collapsed directly. Fortunately, starlight gushed out and barely repaired the Holy Emperor's injuries.</p><p></p><p>Even with the constant replenishment of the essence of the source power, the Holy Emperor, who was at the supreme realm, could only barely maintain his survival in the surrounding chaotic and violent environment.</p><p></p><p>The void that hid the mastermind had long disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>Even the entire Xuanhuang Realm could no longer be seen by the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Like a terrifying sandstorm, it obscured the sky and the sun, rolling and rising.</p><p></p><p>It enveloped everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's nine golden needles had long been blown away to unknown places in the violent gusts.</p><p></p><p>The auras of the Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Doctor could not be sensed either.</p><p></p><p>All that could be sensed was the surrounding chaos.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's mind fell into a brief blankness, and then an incomparable grief and indignation welled up from his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even though he could not witness it with his own eyes, he knew that the Xuanhuang Realm was disintegrating inch by inch in this terrifying great formation.</p><p></p><p>Everything was beyond redemption.</p><p></p><p>"Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor lost his composure and cursed madly.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding his own safety, he charged recklessly in the chaotic storm, wanting to find that familiar yet unfamiliar true culprit behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>When the power of immortal energy was transformed into a void storm that destroyed everything through the immortal formation, the destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm was already destined.</p><p></p><p>This place where myriad realms converged, the only paradise of the Darkest Star Sea at present, was now being rapidly devoured by this world-ending storm.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tiansi, who was still trying to awaken his mother at the center of the formation, could no longer care about his mother's curses at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly startled awake and saw the Xuanhuang Realm, which had already become riddled with holes in an instant, and was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master?"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Sun Tiansi tried to call out with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>However, the master who would always respond and seemed omnipotent never appeared again.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm was about to be destroyed, and Sun Tiansi not only felt that the power he had just inherited, originating from the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerated One, was rapidly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Due to the huge dereliction of duty, the backlash of the Great Heavenly Venerated One also suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>A nameless fire suddenly burned up from Sun Tiansi's heart.</p><p></p><p>Without any pain, Sun Tiansi only felt that his existence was being burned away by this fire.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, his mother, who had been viciously cursing at him regardless of what was happening in the outside world, gradually seemed to forget about her own existence.</p><p></p><p>She slowly quieted down and stared blankly.</p><p></p><p>"Tiansi, Tiansi..."</p><p></p><p>"Who is... Tiansi?"</p><p></p><p>The myriad of demonic thoughts turned into wisps of green smoke one by one and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only Wu Ninglu's original appearance remained, staring blankly at the empty surroundings.</p><p></p><p>A tear inexplicably fell from the corner of her eye.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu and Sun Tiansi perished together in the heart-burning fire of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerated One.</p><p></p><p>At the center of the immortal formation, Li Fan's clone slowly revealed his figure.</p><p></p><p>He frowned slightly, feeling that he seemed to have forgotten the existence of certain people.</p><p></p><p>However, after some deduction, he confirmed that they were just insignificant chess pieces that helped form the immortal formation, so he shook his head slightly and no longer paid attention.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he focused his attention on the few figures still struggling in the immortal formation.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were marveling in amazement, a world-ending storm suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>Although the two of them could be considered powerful figures in the Xuanhuang Realm, in the face of this world-ending immortal formation, they could only wait for death in despair.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the skull of Mr. White that they carried, which protected them, they would have probably perished long ago.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic storm grew more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>The protective power coming from Mr. White's skull was also slowly weakening.</p><p></p><p>They probably wouldn't live much longer.</p><p></p><p>On the verge of perishing, Xu Ke and Yin Shangren did not have hearts filled with fear like other living beings.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Xu Ke held Mr. White's skull in his arms, staring blankly: "I should have died a long time ago. I only survived for the sake of Mr. White's mission. Now, being able to be buried together with Mr. White is a worthy death..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's eyes were calm, with a hint of madness, as he looked at the storm ahead: "I am originally a specter of the world, an existence that has died once. I don't know what it will be like to die again."</p><p></p><p>Responding to them was the howling, formless wind.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren and Xu Ke were slowly completely engulfed by the chaotic storm.</p><p></p><p>The skull of Mr. White in their hands was also in a precarious state.</p><p></p><p>Just as the skull was about to disappear...</p><p></p><p>Before the storm, a flash of light and shadow flickered, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden needles surrounded, creating a layer of hard protective shell, trying to resist the erosion of the external storm.</p><p></p><p>Indeed quite effective, but under the gradually fierce storm, the golden light protection inevitably slowly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's gaze swept around, seeming a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>As if losing the long-fought goal, he was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his eyes became gloomy again.</p><p></p><p>A hand reached out of the golden light protection, attracting a wisp of the world-destroying storm from the immortal formation.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's hand turned into nothingness in the storm.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, a storm seemed to blow up in the Heavenly Doctor's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Heavenly Venerable recovered from the Dharma Heaven Phenomenon Earth.</p><p></p><p>When the world-destroying immortal formation was activated, he was temporarily possessing and replacing the Xuanhuang Realm through the method of sealing souls. So when the raging world-destroying storm erupted in various parts of the Xuanhuang Realm, it was almost equivalent to directly facing this extremely terrifying disaster.</p><p></p><p>But undoubtedly, it was an undeniable manifestation of immortal power.</p><p></p><p>The Grinding Wind Disaster was just a tiny remnant of power.</p><p></p><p>The original Grinding Wind Disaster's destructive power naturally far exceeded the immortal formation storm.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the immortal formation tribulation erupting in the Xuanhuang Realm was countless times stronger than the remnants of the wind disaster.</p><p></p><p>Even the Dharma Heavenly Venerable of the Supreme Realm, in it, was just like a helpless mortal.</p><p></p><p>The injured body of the Dharma slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror he carried also fell powerlessly.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror emitted a faint dark green light, flickering as if it would be completely extinguished at any time.</p><p></p><p>A transparent figure surged from the dissolving body of the Dharma.</p><p></p><p>It looked a little similar to the Dharma, but was vaguely different.</p><p></p><p>The transparent figure seemed to have extremely strong resistance to the immortal formation's annihilating storm. Even with eyes slightly closed, in a deep sleep, it was enough to temporarily not be invaded by the storm.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of creatures were annihilated the moment the immortal formation erupted.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that there were invisible dark clouds always shrouding the territory of the Five Elders Council. Even if the Xuanhuang Realm disappeared, the dark clouds still existed.</p><p></p><p>It even sheltered countless lives that disappeared in the immortal formation.</p><p></p><p>In the white mist barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Finally came out."</p><p></p><p>The entire Immortal Boat worked together and finally cracked the mystery of that life and death reversal great formation.</p><p></p><p>Finding the eye of the formation, the Immortal Boat successfully broke through the formation.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could find trouble for the Dharma...</p><p></p><p>The world-destroying immortal formation had already descended.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Boat that everyone relied on to survive swayed like duckweed in the wind.</p><p></p><p>The immortal boat shell with many forbidden protections melted quickly like ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Use the True Immortal Seal Characters to counter immortals with immortals!"</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Immortal Boat exclaimed in unison.</p><p></p><p>The fluctuations caused by the True Immortal Seal Characters only slightly shook the immortal formation storm.</p><p></p><p>Then, it was swallowed by the immortal formation in turn.</p><p></p><p>It became the energy to strengthen the immortal formation storm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Boat disintegrated amid the painful wails of everyone's regret.</p><p></p><p>"Using the True Immortal Seal Characters is indeed extremely destructive. But so far, no protective True Immortal Seal Characters have been found. Because when the tribulation descends, the Xuanhuang Boat that can restrain two Supreme Realm experts is so vulnerable..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan did not resist.</p><p></p><p>Just quietly watched his body dissolve in the chaos storm.</p><p></p><p>As the only pure land in the Darkest Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm undoubtedly hid many, many secrets.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the immortal descent, the great formation of all things returning to the void, was really like an extremely fierce storm.</p><p></p><p>Mercilessly uncovering all the secrets shrouded above it.</p><p></p><p>Inside the core of the immortal formation, Li Fan's divine sense attentively watched everything happening in the formation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the source of the formation's power was not provided by him.</p><p></p><p>Unable to see the full picture inside the formation.</p><p></p><p>But just need to focus on those energy nodes that fluctuate violently in the formation.</p><p></p><p>Those were existences that showed everything about themselves without reservation in order to survive, confronting the immortal formation storm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered the scene after seeing the Blazing Flame Burning Sea for the first time that year.</p><p></p><p>The Congyu Sea was evaporated, and countless creatures died.</p><p></p><p>But it also exposed those secrets buried and hidden at the bottom of the sea.</p><p></p><p>The little Qi Refining stage cultivator at that time was able to know the secrets of the Congyu Sea like the back of his hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, watching the Xuanhuang Realm, with the energy fluctuations coming one after another, there were even some unexpected existences.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel: "It seems that the principles are always the same."</p><p></p><p>"Secrets are often revealed after annihilation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense fell into contemplation, unconsciously stroking a flawless skull in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror seems to still have its own spirit, but it can't be taken over..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's divine sense was rapidly turning thoughts and recording all the scenes.</p><p></p><p>As the observer who activated the formation, he suddenly discovered an extremely unusual thing.</p><p></p><p>The annihilating immortal formation that had devoured most of the Xuanhuang Realm and should have continued to spread outward into the void...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, for some unknown reason, there was a trend of the storm gradually extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>This, in principle, was something that was impossible to happen.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>Something stopped this storm!</p><p></p><p>A strong sense of crisis suddenly surged from Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Not only in the divine sense, but also in the true body!</p><p></p><p>"The double protection of the All Things Returning to the Void Immortal Formation and the Tianxuan Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"Even a true immortal can't stop me from returning to reality."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was able to return to reality in front of the true immortal in the Immortal Ruins, was not frightened by the fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Instead, after a calm analysis, he made a decision.</p><p></p><p>After all, the one who could stop the expansion of the immortal formation, near this Xuanhuang Realm, should only be that person...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's guess was soon confirmed.</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in the center of the immortal formation.</p><p></p><p>The raging storm around it slowly subsided the moment it approached.</p><p></p><p>In the chaos storm, the living beings of the Xuanhuang Realm were submerged.</p><p></p><p>But the appearance of this figure was like the sun descending from the sky, illuminating the darkness again.</p><p></p><p>He was so eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>He was so out of place with his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>So much so that the moment he appeared in the immortal formation, Li Fan's divine sense had already noticed his existence.</p><p></p><p>And even had a brief encounter before.</p><p></p><p>It was the true immortal who was sitting outside the Xuanhuang Realm with eyes closed, comprehending the Dao!</p><p></p><p>It's just that, unlike the skeletal appearance seen on the Immortal Ruins land before.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal who appeared this time didn't seem to be the true body descending.</p><p></p><p>Just a virtual image manifesting.</p><p></p><p>Not only did his figure become full again, the shackles binding his body no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal's gaze swept across the immortal formation, slightly frowning.</p><p></p><p>Slowly stretched out his palm.</p><p></p><p>The raging world-destroying storm slowly gathered towards his hand.</p><p></p><p>The immortal formation sensed this existence that wanted to destroy the formation, and its defense was triggered.</p><p></p><p>In the chaos, one after another human-shaped virtual images appeared.</p><p></p><p>They were made up of the immortal formation's power, but they were the appearances of the living beings of the Xuanhuang Realm who died under the immortal formation before.</p><p></p><p>Eyes revealing fierceness, fearlessly surging towards the true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Like rolling waves, mixed with the annihilating power of the immortal formation.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal's figure did not move in the slightest, his posture did not change at all.</p><p></p><p>All the immortal formation power that tried to approach was absorbed into the true immortal's palm without any resistance.</p><p></p><p>No energy gathering was seen, only the true immortal's figure seemed to become more solid.</p><p></p><p>Under the constant absorption of the true immortal's figure, the immortal power driving the All Things Returning to the Void Great Formation rapidly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>All falling into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Inside the great formation, the chaos storm gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor, the Holy Emperor, and other survivors were a little confused at first.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, after a moment, their gazes all focused on the true immortal's figure.</p><p></p><p>As if it was natural, unable to look away.</p><p></p><p>The surviving Xuanhuang Realm beings trembled.</p><p></p><p>After ten thousand years since the immortal path was severed, a true immortal has returned to the world!</p><p></p><p>The survivors all bowed their heads, showing their awe of the true immortal.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal's figure did not speak, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor finally reacted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The anger in his heart was burning, even temporarily offsetting the natural suppression of the true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Xuanhuang Realm had turned into a void, he immediately pointed out the direction of the immortal formation's core that was discovered before.</p><p></p><p>The gaze of the true immortal's figure instantly fell on the void where Li Fan's divine sense was.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the true immortal's figure, Li Fan's divine sense, whose thoughts were almost frozen, came back to life in an instant under the urging of the true body.</p><p></p><p>About to self-destruct, the true body returns to reality.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's divine sense saw a scene that he completely could not understand.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but stop the action of returning to reality.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>The true immortal's virtual image was gazing at Li Fan's divine sense in the core of the immortal formation.</p><p></p><p>But there was another figure, also gazing at Him.</p><p></p><p>And slowly approaching, unnoticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan's divine sense in the core of the immortal formation with a global perspective saw the existence of that figure.</p><p></p><p>It had already quietly arrived behind the true immortal's figure.</p><p></p><p>"Meow"</p><p></p><p>As if finally waiting for the long-awaited prey, the always lazy cat treasure let out an extremely excited cry.</p><p></p><p>Leaping up, it landed on the true immortal's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal's figure was utterly surprised, looking at this cute creature that suddenly appeared on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The cat treasure opened its beautiful big eyes, staring intently at the true immortal's figure.</p><p></p><p>The expression on the true immortal's figure also slowly changed from surprise to fear.</p><p></p><p>"Meow"</p><p></p><p>It instantly swallowed the true immortal's figure into its belly.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>The cat treasure raised its head and looked at the true immortal's true body sitting outside the Xuanhuang void in the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Its body arched, and it leaped up.</p><p></p><p>The figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it appeared beside the true immortal's true body in the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The entire Darkest Star Sea shook slightly.</p><p></p><p>There was also the sound of something collapsing coming from far away.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's mind blankly recalled the scene he had just seen.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he could not associate that cat treasure that could easily devour the true immortal's figure with the cat treasure that always liked to lie on his shoulder and sleep.</p><p></p><p>The cat treasure was fished out of a fishing pond by a subject of the Holy Dynasty unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>Despite having many magical functions, the Holy Emperor never thought that the real prey the cat treasure needed to chase was actually...</p><p></p><p>True immortals?!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's heart was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>And the surviving

        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan instinctively moved back a little. </p><p></p><p>It was only through the Lingmu Zhixin (Spirit Wood Heart) that he ensured he still held the power of life and death over the spirit tree, which made him relax a little.</p><p></p><p>The pressure from the tree spirit continued to rise.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Ying, Hua Shen...</p><p></p><p>It slowly stopped when it was comparable to He Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The giant tree spirit is equivalent to the Dao of Heaven in the spirit wood realm."</p><p></p><p>"If the Dao of Heaven truly has a spirit, the cave world is equivalent to the Yuan Ying realm. The small worlds are equivalent to Hua Shen or He Dao, depending on their own scale."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, with the foundation of the spirit wood realm, it was almost impossible for a tree spirit with the strength of He Dao to be born. But with Shang Tianci continuously transporting the wonders of Xuanhuang, it has also achieved a kind of upgrade to a certain extent."</p><p></p><p>"Just like how Mr. Bai previously created a miniature Xuanhuang realm with his bare hands. However, Shang Tianci did it through pure replication."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was pondering, the green light spots gathered from all directions had stopped converging.</p><p></p><p>A figure almost no different from a human appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Curvy and graceful, just like the tree people's elder, the external sexual characteristics were female.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at her, and with a slight movement of his mind, he clothed her through the Lingmu Zhixin.</p><p></p><p>The tree spirit did not resist.</p><p></p><p>Instead, she looked at the clothes that suddenly appeared on her with some curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Although her eyes looked a bit simple, she was definitely not ignorant.</p><p></p><p>Born as a spirit and inheriting all the memories of the spirit tree, she only lacked some experience in interpersonal relationships compared to ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Although her strength is already above mine, because I refined the Lingmu Zhixin early, she still has to be controlled by me."</p><p></p><p>With this thought in Li Fan's mind, the tree spirit in front of him knelt down gracefully at his will.</p><p></p><p>A He Dao realm being kneeling to a Golden Core realm, no matter where it is placed, it is an extremely insulting thing.</p><p></p><p>However, the tree spirit did not show any anger.</p><p></p><p>"Master." Instead, she naturally said this to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The creatures of heaven and earth are simple by nature. They will not be as treacherous as humans.</p><p></p><p>Especially when they are first born, they will not hide their emotions.</p><p></p><p>After discerning for a while, Li Fan confirmed that the tree spirit's submission was her true thought, and only then did he nod secretly.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have transformed into human form, you should have your own name."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you will be called [Lin Ling]."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Li Fan pointed in the air and tapped on Lin Ling's forehead.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a red mark appeared between her eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master." Lin Ling, who now had her own name, was very happy, and thanked Li Fan again, repeatedly chanting.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, as she grows up and experiences more things in the world, it will be hard to say."</p><p></p><p>"However, it is not an easy task to break the restraint of the Lingmu Zhixin."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully comprehended the faint connection between himself and Lin Ling, and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the next period of time, Lin Ling demonstrated her powerful abilities as the incarnation of the Dao of Heaven in the spirit wood realm to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>She could mobilize all the forces of the small world at will, and always in the most efficient form.</p><p></p><p>With her help, the "transportation" process of Shang Tianci became several times easier.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Ling did not feel that it was a hard task, but instead played</p><p>The young lad, Shang Tianci, was deeply attracted by the innocent and lively expression on Lin Ling's face as she played happily.</p><p></p><p>As a manifestation of the Dao, Lin Ling's beauty was naturally beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Her perfect face had no flaws. Every frown and smile exuded a unique charm.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci couldn't take his eyes off her, unwilling to look away.</p><p></p><p>"S-Senior..." Lin Ling stammered with a blushing face after finishing her work and being told by Li Fan to go play elsewhere. Shang Tianci had found Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, keep up the good work." Li Fan patted Shang Tianci's shoulder forcefully, revealing a meaningful smile.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't make any promises, Shang Tianci was instantly energized as if he had been injected with chicken blood.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I've almost finished replicating the wondrous scenes from the Primordial Realm stored in my Dayjing gourd. So I want to go back to the Primordial Realm to record some other things."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity to try persuading some of the others in Shanhe Xuan to come over," he volunteered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing how proactive he was, Li Fan had no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>However, to be safe, he still gave him a jade pendant as a medium for casting [Formless Killing Intent] before letting him leave.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, he had left the Five Elders long enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also leisurely left the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, when he went out, Lin Ling also wanted to follow along.</p><p></p><p>"You can leave this place?" Li Fan couldn't help but be a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Master. There's no problem," Lin Ling nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>With a free Harmonized Dao helper, Li Fan naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>When the two arrived in the Primordial Realm, Li Fan first observed the changes in her.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, she's still somewhat affected. Her actual combat power is a bit inferior compared to a true Harmonized Dao."</p><p></p><p>"But she's still much stronger than an ordinary Huashen."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Ling, he flew towards Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After flying for a while, Lin Ling suddenly asked, "Master, why don't we travel underground? Flying in the sky is so slow."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Underground? What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling widened her eyes and looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>She opened her mouth, trying to explain. But for a long time, she couldn't come up with a suitable adjective.</p><p></p><p>After a while, she slapped her head and transmitted an image into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, Li Fan understood what Lin Ling meant.</p><p></p><p>"The power of ley lines?"</p><p></p><p>"You can shuttle by borrowing the power of ley lines?" he couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Can't you do it, Master?" Lin Ling was a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan fall silent, Lin Ling pondered for a moment, then comforted, "It's okay, Master."</p><p></p><p>"I seem to be able to take you with me."</p><p></p><p>Sensing it, Lin Ling didn't seem to be lying.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated for a moment and slowly nodded, "Then let's try."</p><p></p><p>"Great, Master. Hold on to me!" Seeing Li Fan agree, Lin Ling was very excited.</p><p></p><p>A layer of green light shield appeared on her body as she grabbed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Then she fiercely entered the ground from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's vision first went black.</p><p></p><p>Then it was like falling into a surging river, surrounded by turbulent earthy yellow energy.</p><p></p><p>The immense pressure even made Li Fan feel a bit suffocated.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Ling seemed to be in her element, not only able to move freely,</p><p></p><p>but also seemingly able to draw from the endless ley line power to strengthen herself.</p><p></p><p>She moved along the ley lines while shouting excitedly.</p>

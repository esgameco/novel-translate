        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Gou Yezhong is quite an interesting person. If there isn't a special reason behind his actions, then he's openly acting recklessly and unscrupulously in front of everyone. This is practically slapping the face of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the time when he met Gou Yezhong during training, he appeared completely ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"If this person still has zero points by the end of the competition, I'll admire him as a man."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint voice of resentment echoed in his ears, but after over a year of being accustomed to it, Li Fan had already gotten used to it.</p><p></p><p>He calmly lit a lamp inside the room, and the eerie black flame illuminated, instantly dispelling the abnormal sounds from the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"This Extinction Luoli Lamp is really useful." Enjoying the rare tranquility once again, Li Fan couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>The Extinction Luoli Lamp was a new sound-suppressing treasure sent by Yandou Hall two months ago.</p><p></p><p>From the distant Western Piaomiao Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After lighting the extinction wick in the lamp, it could emit a black flame that turned all surrounding sounds into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Simple and effective.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other treasures that absorb too much demonic energy and carry the risk of mutation.</p><p></p><p>This Luoli Lamp would not be affected before burning out completely. It could be extinguished when not in use, extending its lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Among all the sound-suppressing treasures, the Extinction Luoli Lamp was considered outstanding.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was said that the key component, the Extinction Wick, required special craftsmanship, had a long production cycle, and was extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, only formations masters like Li Fan and Xuemu would carry it with them at all times.</p><p></p><p>Within the Qingxuan Army, it would only be taken out in times of crisis.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't light the Extinction Luoli Lamp at this moment to flaunt or waste it.</p><p></p><p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Abyssal Maelstrom of Demonic Sound fifteen days ago, the Jiaxu Base here had lost contact with other bases and the Eternal Immortal Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Communication symbols, spell transmissions, and even the Tianxuan Mirror could not connect with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the rankings Li Fan just saw were frozen data from before the outbreak of the Maelstrom.</p><p></p><p>According to the words of the old Qing Xuan soldiers and the Foundation Establishment cultivator Lei Yingyi who guarded him, the power of this Maelstrom once in a hundred years was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>According to Lei Yingyi's experience, the duration of the demonic sound tide was almost proportional to its power.</p><p></p><p>The sudden outbreak of the tide was beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Supplies in the base, including the Black Death Seal that survived in the devouring elemental white mist, were running low and needed to be replenished promptly.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, following his duty, Lei Yingyi led three subordinates, risking falling, back to the Eternal Immortal Stronghold during the silent period after the demonic sound tide to seek supplies.</p><p></p><p>Yet they hadn't returned so far.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was a little puzzled why he encountered the rare Maelstrom once in a hundred years. But judging from the current situation, the base was still relatively safe, so there was no need to panic.</p><p></p><p>It was just that under the influence of the Maelstrom and the white mist, not only communication but even spiritual energy had become chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Unable to focus, forcefully circulating spiritual energy would cause irregular movements within the body and damage the vital energy and blood.</p><p></p><p>Unable to cultivate, Li Fan, who was always diligent, also became idle.</p><p></p><p>He had tried to launch a ritual to enter the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But within this white mist, the connection to the Meteor Immortal Realm was too weak.</p><p></p><p>Multiple attempts failed and only made Li Fan's soul shake, leading to dizziness.</p><p></p><p>So he had to give up.</p><p></p><p>The only way to pass the time was to chat with other cultivators in the base.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, seeing the dwindling supplies in the base and no sign of Lei Yingyi's return, everyone became a little heavy-hearted, and the conversations gradually diminished.</p><p></p><p>The black flame flickered unpredictably, continuously dancing.</p><p></p><p>It cast a somewhat sullen shade on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"Could this world end right here?"</p><p></p><p>After staring blankly for a long time, he couldn't help but occasionally have such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he habitually circulated the Yellow Dao Heart Refining Mantra to suppress those distracting thoughts.</p><p></p><p>With nothing else to do, Li Fan decided to concentrate his mind and sincerely practiced the refining mantra.</p><p></p><p>Since he achieved his cultivation level, although circulating the Yellow Dao Heart Refining Mantra had become a reflexive action, there was still a difference between fully immersing himself in practice and mechanically refining it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, for the first time in a long time, Li Fan earnestly practiced the refining mantra.</p><p></p><p>When he was still a mortal, the Pure Heart Mantra was his hope to break the barrier between immortal and mortal.</p><p></p><p>Hence, he persisted in bitter cultivation for years.</p><p></p><p>Its practical use became apparent.</p><p></p><p>Unable to improve his cultivation, the main function was to suppress and crush the distractions within his heart.</p><p></p><p>In a cultivation world that didn't prioritize mental cultivation, it was almost useless.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan had extraordinary willpower and rarely faced inner demons.</p><p></p><p>So, for Li Fan, the refining mantra was of little use.</p><p></p><p>If not for the intuition in his heart and the fact that the refining mantra was listed as the first in the genuine techniques, indirectly indicating its value, Li Fan might have long abandoned it.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how powerful the Dragon Slaying Art was, if there were no dragons in the world, it would be useless, not worth wasting time.</p><p></p><p>"Refine the heart, refine the heart."</p><p></p><p>"I have mastered the technique, but what should I refine into, what is the ultimate goal, I have no clue."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that's why my progress in refining the heart mantra has been stagnant for so many years."</p><p></p><p>"What am I refining for?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this question was too profound.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who considered his insight to be decent, was momentarily stuck.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly during this process.</p><p></p><p>The effectiveness of isolation was limited.</p><p></p><p>On the thirty-sixth day after the outbreak of the Maelstrom, Li Fan, who was unable to find an answer after much contemplation, temporarily stopped his practice.</p><p></p><p>He simply strolled around the base, listening, observing, feeling, and contemplating.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a few days ago, within a short period, some changes had quietly occurred in the Jiaxu Base.</p><p></p><p>The closed environment, unknown future, occasional attacks from the maelstrom of demonic sound.</p><p></p><p>The gradually depleting survival supplies.</p><p></p><p>While the cultivators in the base felt each day passing like a year, an inexplicable emotion gradually started brewing in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Although they hadn't reached a desperate situation yet, Li Fan, who had insight into people's hearts, was the first to notice this.</p><p></p><p>"Besides me, there are three Foundation Establishment, and six Golden Core cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"I'm the weakest, but if I play dumb and sit back, it shouldn't be a problem in the end."</p>

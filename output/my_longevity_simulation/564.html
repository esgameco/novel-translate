            <p>"But I see that you are a person of understanding and must have your own thoughts. Let's not say anymore," said Sima Changkong after a pause, regaining some of his energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, but he didn't say much either, just looked somewhat distressed, "Brother Sima's words are so heartfelt, making me feel ashamed!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, with friend's attitude like this, it seems like you're really distancing yourself from me!" Sima Changkong jokingly pretended to be angry.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only sigh and remain silent.</p><p></p><p>After a heartfelt exchange, the bond between the two deepened once again.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, Li Fan redirected the conversation back to the Tianlingzhou battlefield, "Brother Sima, what did you see on the battlefield? Your comprehensive understanding of the history of the Xuanhuang world warrants great praise, so it must be something extremely terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong sighed, "You're flattering me. But you're right about the second half of what you said. The weapon that the Wanxian Alliance has unveiled this time is truly formidable."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he activated a drop of blood within him, trying to form a blood screen to show Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, images appeared on the blood screen. However, Sima Changkong's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?!" he exclaimed in shock, his face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, stared at the scenes on the blood screen.</p><p></p><p>He saw countless Wanxian Alliance cultivators surrounded by a tightly packed group of Five Elders' Sect cultivators forming a formation in the center. Despite being outnumbered and encircled, with only around a hundred people, the Wanxian Alliance members displayed no fear and charged bravely towards their enemies, who outnumbered them a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>This seemingly predictable battle, with the winner and loser seemingly predetermined, suddenly took a drastic turn.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Wanxian Alliance group, one person suddenly raised something, and then...</p><p></p><p>Large numbers of Five Elders' Sect cultivators fell from the sky without warning, landing bloodily on the ground, unable to move or make a sound.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance members seemed to have anticipated this scene, swiftly and mercilessly harvesting their enemies' lives.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the sky was filled with falling figures, forming a peculiar and eerie picture.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?" Sima Changkong couldn't believe what was recorded on the blood screen and looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Sima Changkong's strange reaction, Li Fan suddenly thought of something and asked, "But the scene recorded in this blood screen is different from what Brother saw with your own eyes?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!" Sima Changkong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What I saw was that the cultivator held up a small square mirror in his hand."</p><p></p><p>"And the sky was filled with thousands of green threads hanging down."</p><p></p><p>"It was because of these inexplicable green threads that the Five Elders' Sect cultivators lost their resistance instantly."</p><p></p><p>"But why..."</p><p></p><p>After explaining, Sima Changkong still found it hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>For Sima Changkong, who considered it his duty to faithfully record historical events, the inability to record this particular event was a huge blow.</p><p></p><p>"I must find a way to record it," Sima Changkong muttered to himself, still reeling from the shock, looking a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Sima brother, you're mistaken. Even if you can't directly record it with images or words, you can still indirectly describe it to leave a record of its existence," Li Fan reminded him.</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong was suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>Then he exclaimed, "I've been foolish!"</p><p></p><p>He slapped his head and forced out a few more drops of blood to integrate into the blood screen.</p><p></p><p>Twisted words merged with the blood screen.</p><p></p><p>"Green light like silk suddenly descended from the sky..."</p><p></p><p>"Those hit lost their immortal power and fell to the ground..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the script gradually stabilized and was about to merge with the blood screen, a green line suddenly surged from the twisted words.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong's expression turned pale in shock.</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his warning, the green line had already turned into a surging green light.</p><p></p><p>As it disrupted the scenes recorded in the blood screen, it suddenly shrank back into a dot.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>The green dot suddenly burst open.</p><p></p><p>"Not..."</p><p></p><p>The moment the green line appeared, even before Sima Changkong could warn, Li Fan had already activated the Purple Cloud Divine Thunder to its extreme, with bone wings protruding from his back, utilizing the Peng Flying technique on himself.</p><p></p><p>At the fastest speed he had achieved since entering the cultivation world, he fled into the distance.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had clearly not expected such a violent reaction from the Xuan Network this time.</p><p></p><p>It was even more agitated than the one that had erupted in the Wanxian Island's martial hall.</p><p></p><p>As the green dot exploded, the light waves swept around in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Just as the green light was about to touch his body, although he felt reluctant, Li Fan released the remaining "truth."</p><p></p><p>But soon, he swallowed the word "truth."</p><p></p><p>Because he noticed that the protective energy of the "truth" used to shield him remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It turned out to be a false alarm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stopped his retreat abruptly, standing still in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a moment and seeing nothing unusual happening, the surroundings remained calm and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>Inside the crystal palace, everything remained as before.</p><p></p><p>Just eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong remained frozen in place, with his look of horror frozen on his face, not moving at all.</p><p></p><p>"Sima brother?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shouted from a distance.</p><p></p><p>No response.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan cautiously got closer, "Sima brother?"</p><p></p><p>Although he could still faintly sense the "life" aura on Sima Changkong's body, for some reason, Sima Changkong still showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>That sense of life seemed to have solidified.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt something was amiss and started to retreat cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Puff!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Sima Changkong suddenly burst open from the inside.</p><p></p><p>Instead of splattering with red flesh and blood, green viscous liquid splashed around, flooding the crystal palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowly avoided the attack of the green liquid, his face twitching as he watched the lifeless Sima Changkong.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

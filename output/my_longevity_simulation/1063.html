            <p>Chapter 1061: Three Percent Power to Suppress Huang</p><p></p><p>"Huang is slumbering in the deepest part of the Hua Ling Qing River in this Hua Ling Ravine."</p><p></p><p>"The Hua Ling stones that can suppress spiritual energy fluctuations here are formed by the accumulation of water from the Hua Ling Qing River over time."</p><p></p><p>"If Hua Ling stones have such effects, the Hua Ling Qing River is even more terrifying. Even a Dao-merging cultivator, if they stay in it for too long, risks being drowned."</p><p></p><p>"But for Huang, this place is a rare sacred ground for cultivation. With all spiritual energy fluctuations suppressed to the extreme, he can concentrate on tempering his physical body."</p><p></p><p>Zhou's expression was solemn as he opened a protective shield and led everyone to dive into the Hua Ling Qing River.</p><p></p><p>They kept diving deeper.</p><p></p><p>Unlike ordinary river water, which gets darker the deeper you go, the water of the Hua Ling Qing River seemed to be a light source itself. No matter how long they dove, the surroundings remained the same unchanging, disturbing cyan color.</p><p></p><p>The deep cyan water seemed like an isolation zone, gradually blocking out even Li Fan's divine sense, which was stronger than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after asking Tian Yang and learning that his puppet body materials and source power essence were completely unaffected by the Hua Ling River water, Li Fan felt slightly more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Li Fan's uneasiness, Tian Yang took the initiative to lay a layer of protective power on him.</p><p></p><p>This slight energy fluctuation caught the attention of the two Dharma transmitters.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Tian indeed has great methods!"</p><p></p><p>This place was one of the secret realms of the Immortal Alliance. Naturally, it wasn't their first time coming here, and they had long mastered a way to barely move in the Hua Ling Qing River water.</p><p></p><p>However, this Senior Tian from the Myriad Worlds United Association seemed completely unaffected here...</p><p></p><p>Their assessment of Tian Yang's strength rose a bit more.</p><p></p><p>"We're here..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at a vortex below, Dharma Transmitter Zhou said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan looked over and saw a gaunt figure hidden in the vortex.</p><p></p><p>The vortex persisted for a while but suddenly subsided. Then, the direction of the vortex changed, and it began fiercely spewing Hua Ling River water upwards.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan realize that the vortex was formed by the gaunt figure inhaling and exhaling the river water!</p><p></p><p>"So he is Huang..."</p><p></p><p>Almost emaciated to just a skeleton, Huang's appearance seemed to have nothing to do with a strong physique.</p><p></p><p>But the faint golden color of his skin, so eye-catching even in the depths of this cyan river, hinted at the extraordinary nature of his body.</p><p></p><p>"Huang is in deep slumber. If we rashly wake him up, we will inevitably face his stormy attacks." Zhou glanced at Tian Yang and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred. Tian Yang showed a look of arrogance, flew forward, and slapped Huang on the head.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitters Zhou and Wei's eyelids twitched.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, they pulled Li Fan and retreated a good distance upwards.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, a terrifying momentum like a volcanic eruption suddenly appeared from the depths of the river.</p><p></p><p>Instantly locking onto Tian Yang's small body.</p><p></p><p>With golden light flashing in his eyes, Huang looked at Tian Yang standing quietly in front of him and raised his palm high.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The calm, silent Hua Ling Qing River suddenly surged turbulently.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the river water became rapid, and Li Fan's group, who were watching from the side, could only...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He struggled to maintain his form.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The destructive force of Huang's descending palm was firmly grasped by a tender hand.</p><p></p><p>Unable to move an inch further.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Huang's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He tried to break free from the locked grip on his right hand.</p><p></p><p>But even after exerting all his strength, he was still unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>His body shrank in an instant, transforming Huang from a gaunt middle-aged man into a starving child.</p><p></p><p>After losing control of Tianyang, his form rapidly regressed.</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth are you?"</p><p></p><p>In the realm of absolute confidence in his power, he was defeated by this suddenly appearing stranger.</p><p></p><p>The shock in Huang's heart was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>He didn't display the legendary madness at all, but cautiously sized up Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Huang, I really didn't expect to see the day you would be humiliated like this!" </p><p></p><p>The voice of the Dharma Transmitter Wei came from above. Only then did Huang notice Li Fan and the other two observing the battle.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be surprised, Huang. This is Senior Tian from the Multiverse Alliance, whose strength has reached the Longevity Realm. It's normal that you're no match for him." Zhou explained with an uncontainable smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Multiverse Alliance? What is that?!" Huang didn't give a good face to these two former colleagues before him.</p><p></p><p>"How long have I been asleep?"</p><p></p><p>"Only fifteen years?" Huang asked with some disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Zhou then told him in detail everything that had recently happened in the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of Xuantian are stirring up trouble, possessing the Dharma Transmitter. Occupying what's not theirs, they've gained control of the Myriad Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing of such changes, Huang didn't show particular fury.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he pondered very calmly.</p><p></p><p>Constantly asking Dharma Transmitter Zhou about various details.</p><p></p><p>"How much have you found out about the background of this Multiverse Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"We know nothing... Don't look at me like that. This alliance, it's like it popped out of thin air, there's no way to trace its roots or origins. It doesn't match any of the hidden powerhouses on record. If it weren't for the fact that only our Xuanhuang Realm is left in this starry sea, I would really suspect if they were from other immortal cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The three Dharma Transmitters quickly exchanged some information.</p><p></p><p>Then they all looked at Li Fan and Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Senior Tian's intervention, otherwise with Huang's temper upon waking, he would have surely caused a scene and attracted the attention of the Hua Ling Jian cultivators above. Maybe Chen would have noticed something then." Wei cupped his hands, saying with some relief.</p><p></p><p>Huang's face showed displeasure, while Zhou had a grinning expression.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is immense."</p><p></p><p>"I also used thirty percent of my full power to suppress you."</p><p></p><p>Without Li Fan's instructions, Tianyang saw Huang's defiance and spoke to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>Huang's face turned even uglier.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that a powerhouse like Tianyang had no need to exaggerate.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty percent strength..."  Huang suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness and hope in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had been tempering his body day and night for thousands of years according to the Heavenly Venerate's methods.</p><p></p><p>He had already vaguely sensed that he seemed to have reached some kind of limit.</p><p></p><p>As a Dharma Transmitter, he could no longer defy the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>His path also seemed to end here.</p><p></p><p>But the appearance of Senior Tian before him seemed to bring a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>Huang always acted straightforwardly. In front of everyone, he directly started seeking advice.</p>

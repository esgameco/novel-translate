        <h1>Chapter 933</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Which cultivation technique should he practice?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit hesitant for a moment. These were indeed all true immortal cultivation techniques, but...</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloom flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the first illusion he experienced with Senior Sister Zhao, he had practiced the "Heaven and Earth Confrontation Technique" and the "Soul-Severing Divine Illumination Technique".</p><p></p><p>Apart from the inherent characteristics of the techniques themselves, they had another extremely special commonality.</p><p></p><p>Once practiced, they could never be abandoned.</p><p></p><p>Even using the Taishang Sect's secret methods or the Taishang Primordial True Scripture, it was the same.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was an even more fatal point.</p><p></p><p>All of the Xuantian Sect's cultivation techniques seemed to have a special mark. True experts, no matter how they concealed themselves, could be distinguished at a glance by those in the know.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Sect even had a secret technique called "Usurping Heaven's Place" that could not only completely strip away cultivation techniques and realms, but also transfer the realms and power obtained from practicing the Xuantian Sect's techniques, like grafting flowers onto a tree.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was just an ordinary cultivator who had accidentally entered the illusion realm. Senior Sister Zhao had no need to deliberately falsify information about the Xuantian Sect. </p><p></p><p>So it could basically be considered true.</p><p></p><p>The strange part was right here.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan did not find related memories from Ji Yuchen's soul fragments.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the nearly perfect character setting displayed by the Xuantian King...</p><p></p><p>It truly made Li Fan's heart turn cold.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the main reasons why Li Fan had always been suspicious of the Xuantian King's "good person" identity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Ji Yuchen's soul was incomplete, resulting in lost memories.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, Li Fan had to remain vigilant about these Xuantian Sect cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>After all, these were not solitary copies that he personally obtained, but were passed down by the Xuantian King and then taught by Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>With their cultivation realms, if they tampered with the techniques, Li Fan would not be able to detect it at all.</p><p></p><p>"My goal is simply to disguise myself a bit better."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan suddenly had an idea. </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Derivation Jade can be used to derive a cultivation technique with similar external characteristics but a different core."</p><p></p><p>"Doing this may have some risks. But the Sacred Blood Rebirth Technique can be used to recreate a clone to try it."</p><p></p><p>"If it fails, I'll have to take the risk and cultivate it myself."</p><p></p><p>"However, cultivation realms can no longer be retained after the next Zhenxing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's decision seemed to be making a mountain out of a molehill, but he knew very well that when competing in wits and bravery with these old monsters of the Xuanhuang Realm, one could never be too careful no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the gains from this trip to the Great Dao Sect were definitely not small, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not openly cultivate for now, the true immortal techniques had broadened Li Fan's horizons, letting him know that cultivation techniques could actually be so profound and strange.</p><p></p><p>Secondly...</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan's strength slowly grew in the future and he uncovered the secrets of the Xuantian Sect, these cultivation techniques could truly become nourishment for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he temporarily suppressed these few techniques deep in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan directly activated the Sacred Blood Rebirth Technique according to plan.</p><p></p><p>The required materials were left over from when he had scoured the empire last time. Before long, a body that looked extremely similar to Li Fan appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The clone Li Qing did not have any [...]</p><p></p><p>Title: "The Holy Blood Transforms the Fetus"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, as usual, modified the memories and spirit of the holy fetus.</p><p></p><p>With previous experience, his movements became more and more skilled and smooth.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the holy fetus Li Fan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the biggest weakness of the Holy Blood Transformation method was that the transformed holy fetus was only a mortal body, without any cultivation base.</p><p></p><p>It needed to be cultivated step by step from scratch.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't have the shocking talent like Mr. White, it would seem quite useless.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, with the existence of the faceless stone statue, Li Fan could easily solve this problem.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing the holy fetus, Li Fan flashed and arrived in front of the faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>As usual, countless scenes surged like a tide.</p><p></p><p>However, the most intense and sincere among them was not Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>But it turned into He Zhenghao!</p><p></p><p>"Merciful Immortal of the Mortal World above! Please bless me to come up with more content of the 'Xuantian Sealing Soul' formation..." </p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao kept praying in his heart, very devoutly.</p><p></p><p>According to the constantly flashing scenes, Li Fan instantly knew what had happened to him recently.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan had expected, after he used the faceless stone statue to transmit the contents of the Xuantian Sealing Soul Formation into He Zhenghao's mind that day.</p><p></p><p>At the headquarters of the Formation Hall of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, He Zhenghao inadvertently proposed various speculations about the Xuantian Sealing Soul Formation, which immediately aroused great attention.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao also kept reporting the inspirations that occasionally appeared in his mind, in order to gain a higher position in exchange.</p><p></p><p>But problems also followed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's talent in formations was good, but there was still a big gap from being able to deduce a formation of the level of "Xuantian Sealing Soul" on his own.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew the complete structure of the formation diagram, he still had a half-baked understanding of the true essence of the formation and couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was quite shrewd and didn't hand over the complete contents all at once.</p><p></p><p>He only perfected it from time to time, trying to delay as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take the opportunity to thoroughly study the Xuantian Sealing Soul Formation on his own.</p><p></p><p>But as the days passed, He Zhenghao, whose progress was very slow, finally woke up.</p><p></p><p>The gap between him and the "Xuantian Sealing Soul" formation was too wide and too deep.</p><p></p><p>Relying on himself alone, it was simply impossible to figure out the true meaning of the formation.</p><p></p><p>So he placed his only hope on the "Merciful Immortal of the Mortal World".</p><p></p><p>Every day, he seemed to be working hard to deduce the formation, but in fact, he was constantly repeating prayers in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The degree of devotion surpassed all other members of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who understood the ins and outs of the matter in a flash of thought, couldn't help shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, He Zhenghao was a relatively familiar character to him after all, and he still needed him to act as a pawn to attract Mo Rubin's attention, so Li Fan wouldn't ignore him.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a large amount of annotations and discourses about the Xuantian Sealing Soul Formation were continuously transmitted into He Zhenghao's mind.</p><p></p><p>The impact of the data volume was so huge that He Zhenghao couldn't bear it for a while and fell into a daze.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing noteworthy about the other believers, and the holy fetus Li Fan looked at the faceless statue.</p><p></p><p>He began to pray sincerely, like other members of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan felt a mysterious connection being established between the original body and the holy fetus through the faceless statue.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, and in the next moment, a large amount of cultivation base was poured into the body of the holy fetus.</p>

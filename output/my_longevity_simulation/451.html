        <h1>Chapter 451</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Clouds, Water, Illusion, Dream, Skill", "Marvelous, Mysterious, True, Spiritual, Transformation", "Star-Swapping, Sun-Duplicating Technique"...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had also practiced these extraordinary and unparalleled techniques. </p><p></p><p>But compared to the "Heavenly Creation Furnace Technique" he had just acquired in his mind, all the previous techniques were insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the wonderful words, Li Fan felt as if through this technique, he could peer into the true mysteries of the world.</p><p></p><p>He even had a premonition that in this age where there were no restrictions on cultivation, just by mastering this technique, even a person with no cultivation talent could gradually evolve and elevate themselves, eventually transcending the ordinary and achieving immortality!</p><p></p><p>What is the profound mystery of the Great Dao? What is the supreme orthodox law?</p><p></p><p>This is it!</p><p></p><p>Truly worthy of the name "creation."</p><p></p><p>Reading and experiencing the "Heavenly Creation Furnace Technique" eagerly, Li Fan couldn't contain his joy.</p><p></p><p>"To hear of the Dao in the morning and die content in the evening!"</p><p></p><p>Completely immersed in his thoughts, he didn't even know when he returned to Xu Ke's side.</p><p></p><p>After what seemed like a long time, when he finally came back to himself, Mr. Bai had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Myoshu Sect had become as chaotic as it had been in the previous life. The disciples of the Myoshu Sect witnessed their senior comrades being slaughtered mercilessly, filling them with despair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Ke was cautiously avoiding the crazed senior brothers, guiding Li Fan carefully according to the jade token given to him by Lu Ya, in search of Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Peeking into Xu Ke's thoughts, Li Fan was amazed to find that in Xu Ke's memory, there was no scene of him transforming into a mysterious bird, flying to Mr. Bai's side, and receiving guidance thereafter.</p><p></p><p>After a brief thought, Li Fan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>"The innocent carry the burden of guilt. The 'Heavenly Creation Furnace Technique' passed down by Mr. Bai can be called a supreme secret skill. Falling into the hands of a mere Zuo Ji monster like him would surely attract envy from others.</p><p></p><p>Even if the technique was profound, it would be in vain if he couldn't cultivate it. Mr. Bai must have considered this, hence he effortlessly wiped the memories of everyone present. This way, Li Fan would not be endangered because of this technique, and he would have ample time to cultivate slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai's consideration is truly comprehensive!" Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Having seen Mr. Bai in person, Li Fan was now certain that he was not the 'Celestial Physician.'</p><p></p><p>Not only did their appearances have no resemblance, but their temperaments were also entirely different.</p><p></p><p>The beauty of Mr. Bai was unforgettable with just one glance. Most importantly, the kindness and warmth unintentionally shown by Mr. Bai could not be feigned. It was fundamentally different from the lofty and mysterious aura of the 'Celestial Physician.'</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"To deal with myriad beasts as if killing chickens and slaughtering dogs, to understand my cultivation method with just one glance, and to quickly provide the ultimate answer to the technique; effortlessly modifying the consciousness of all beings present. Truly a skill that defies creation."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai's strength..." combining his actions, Li Fan couldn't help but associate him with the four words 'Eternal Life Heavenly Lord.'</p><p></p><p>"In the eyes of the children in Ningyuan City, Mr. Bai is just an ordinary person. Mr. Bai himself has admitted this. In a short time, transcending from an ordinary person to a god. Then from a god to an eternal being."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, perhaps what the orphans in Ningyuan City said about Mr. Bai being the best person in the world, the most skilled in medicine, the most attractive, the most gentle in speech, the most intelligent, and so on, might not be exaggerated nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a flutter of admiration in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But a question immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>Where did Mr. Bai go thousands of years later?</p><p></p><p>Was it one of the two outside of the Three Heavenly Lords of the Five Elders Association? </p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt it was unlikely. The Five Elders and Mr. Bai had completely different styles of doing things.</p><p></p><p>In the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance?</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Extreme Heavenly Lord, who was said to have created the 'Pure Body Spirit Pool Formation' and helped expel the miasma in the bodies of ordinary people, bore some resemblance to Mr. Bai. However, this Eastern Extreme Heavenly Lord had only appeared in rumors. Even Li Fan had only casually come across a mention of him in books when researching.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance cultivators probably didn't know of his existence.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Bai was alive, he would certainly not be so anonymously renowned.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, like the Transcendental Law Heavenly Lord from the previous life, had he successfully freed himself from the constraints of the Xuanhuang realm and transcended?</p><p></p><p>Or maybe...</p><p></p><p>Has Mr. Bai already fallen?</p><p></p><p>Just the thought made Li Fan shake his head and dismiss the idea.</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to believe that someone as talented and outstanding as Mr. Bai would fall so easily.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stayed in Xu Ke's hair, his thoughts spinning around, and naturally began practicing the "Heavenly Creation Furnace Technique."</p><p></p><p>Unlike Li Fan's rough method of forcibly attacking his internal secret, harvesting the overflow of the secret power for cultivation, the improved Furnace Technique by Mr. Bai utilized the resonance of the human body furnace through the induction of the Heavenly Realm, thus transforming secret power under the synchronization of heaven and human, reshaping and cultivating at will.</p><p></p><p>It even prompted the human body furnace to evolve towards the heaven and earth furnace. Its mysteries were infinite and extremely marvelous.</p><p></p><p>At every moment of cultivation, Li Fan felt his bird body undergoing a transformation.</p><p></p><p>It was the loathsome disciple of the Myoshu Sect, Song Yang, who interrupted him from this unspeakably wonderful cultivation process.</p><p></p><p>After his previous failed attempt at scheming, this time he made a comeback, spending a fortune to bring a Golden Dan-stage "Ink Immortal Tiger" to assist him. He vowed to snatch Li Fan away.</p><p></p><p>Roaring with belligerence, the Ink Immortal Tiger showed off its might, but Li Fan was very displeased.</p><p></p><p>The secret power surged in his body, and Li Fan flew into the air. His body swelled, transforming from a small bird the size of a palm into a fierce monster three times the size of the Ink Immortal Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Like catching a chick, Li Fan grabbed the Ink Immortal Tiger with one claw.</p><p></p><p>Before it could struggle, a faint mysterious light emanated from his mouth, generating a suction force. Li Fan swallowed the Ink Immortal Tiger in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was left dumbfounded, while Song Yang, frightened, scurried away.</p><p></p><p>There was still a lingering foul smell in the air.</p><p></p><p>With a snort of disgust, Li Fan didn't bother to pursue him.</p><p></p><p>Retracting the secret power, returning to his original size, he returned to Xu Ke's head.</p><p></p><p>Although the forced transformation seemed to have some toll on his body, as if transforming had slightly worn him out, his body, like a furnace, refined the Ink Immortal Tiger he had swallowed into essential energy.</p><p></p><p>A warm aura spread through his body, and suddenly, Li Fan felt a wave of exhaustion. </p><p></p><p>Unable to control it, he fell into a deep sleep, leaving Xu Ke staring in disbelief, mute and dumbfounded.</p>

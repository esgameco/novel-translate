        <h1>Chapter 790</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after the pause, Xu Bai, who had just advanced to the Huashen realm, made another move. </p><p>This time, it caused Li Fan, who was still immersed in shock, to suddenly have his heart rate accelerate and feel a sense of suffocation.</p><p>As is well known, after the Celestial Venerable established the new Dao in the Xuanhuang Realm, to achieve the Heda realm, one must perform the "Sacrificing the Souls of Heaven and Earth" rite.</p><p>Before this, Li Fan had envisioned the path for the Divine Embryo Xu Bai to step into the Heda realm - </p><p>Crimson Flames, Azure Wind, Black Marsh...</p><p>Or the extremely powerful and world-ending "Ink Slaughter" duty.</p><p>But at this moment, when Li Fan truly perceived what was happening to the Divine Embryo Xu Bai, his understanding was once again completely overturned!</p><p>The Divine Embryo Xu Bai stood still in mid-air, like a stone sculpture, motionless.</p><p>But it seemed that something descended from the heavens and landed upon him!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In Li Fan's mind, flashes of visions appeared instantly.</p><p>A fertile land, full of vitality. The image of a vast lake descended, and then froze for thousands of miles. As far as the eye could see, everything fell into complete stillness.</p><p>The Soul of Heaven and Earth: Resplendent Ice!</p><p>Among the originally jet-black hair of the Divine Embryo Xu Bai, a strand of frost-white suddenly appeared.</p><p>Although it quickly returned to normal, this phenomenon brought Li Fan immense shock.</p><p>Because according to the comprehension from the Divine Embryo Xu Bai's body, in that instant, he had undoubtedly grasped the power of the Heavenly Soul "Resplendent Ice"!</p><p>The Souls of Heaven and Earth are born from celestial duties, each possessing formidable might. Once a cultivator slays and sacrifices them, taking their place, they can instantly usurp and master the original power of Heaven and Earth in a moment.</p><p>This is also the reason why the battle prowess of Heda realm cultivators of the new Dao far exceeds those of the old Dao.</p><p>But now, something that violated the iron rules of the new Dao seemed to have occurred on the Divine Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p>Without slaying the Soul of Heaven and Earth, its power had simply transferred over to him!</p><p>And this was just the first one!</p><p>Silently, a second ripple seemed to traverse millions of miles and descend upon the Divine Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p>Li Fan's vision was filled with another illusion.</p><p>A desolate land for thousands of miles, ravaged by strange beasts, without a single blade of grass. Suddenly, a drizzle fell upon the world.</p><p>Amidst the desperate shrieks, the bodies slowly dissolved, washed away by the rain, becoming fertilizer for the land.  </p><p>The Soul of Heaven and Earth: Obsidian Rain!</p><p>The Divine Embryo Xu Bai's hair seemed to have grown slightly longer.</p><p>Li Fan's heart abruptly stopped beating.</p><p>Because in that instant, the Divine Embryo Xu Bai had also grasped the power of Obsidian Rain.</p><p>In just a short while, he had gained two Souls of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Yet the Divine Embryo Xu Bai was not satisfied. He closed his eyes and stretched out his arms towards the sky, opening his embrace.</p><p>From east to west, south to north, the Souls of Heaven and Earth came flocking.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>Li Fan inwardly cursed and instantly stopped his dazed watching, hastening his actions.</p><p>"At this rate of his Heda realm advancement, I might not have time to set up decoy puppets in every state."</p><p>"I can only choose the states with more cultivators."</p><p>"After completing that, I must hurry back to Longevity Valley."</p><p>While flying towards the nearest Celestial City, Li Fan recalled and observed what was happening to the Divine Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everything, the thoughts were rapidly turning.</p><p>"Without destroying the soul of heaven and earth, there is its power."</p><p>"This is the [Distortion of the Heavenly Principle]..."</p><p>"Even if it is the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, this is a bit too much!"</p><p>"Ordinary cultivators can inherit the power of the soul of heaven and earth through killing, due to the blessing of the Celestial Venerable's new law."</p><p>"But the behavior of Saint Fetus Xu Bai..."</p><p>"It is not to sacrifice the soul of heaven and earth, but to transform his body into the soul of heaven and earth!"</p><p>In an instant, Li Fan understood the plan of Saint Fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>Even with the innate talent of the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, to [defy the principle of heaven and earth] is not something that can be accomplished overnight.</p><p>It is very likely that Saint Fetus Xu Bai cannot attain the realm of immortality.</p><p>But after his resurrection, his opponents will certainly be those Immortal Venerable.</p><p>The difference between Dao Attainment and Immortality is like heaven and earth.</p><p>How can he match their power?</p><p>The only way is to fully unleash the power of Dao Attainment.</p><p>One soul of heaven and earth is equivalent to the power of a Dao Attainment cultivator.</p><p>One Dao Attainment is not enough to contend with the power of an Immortal Venerable, then ten, a hundred!</p><p>Various different powers of the souls of heaven and earth are fused into the body of Saint Fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>With each fusion, his aura rises to a higher level.</p><p>And the scene that Li Fan sensed gradually became blurred.</p><p>From initially being immersed in it, to being separated by a thin membrane, and then to seeing it through the mist.</p><p>Li Fan is losing absolute control over Saint Fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>This means...</p><p>Mr. Bai is awakening!</p><p>Li Fan seized this last opportunity to extract as much information as possible from Saint Fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>"I see..."</p><p>"His mastery of the power of the souls of heaven and earth does not mean that there are no more such souls in the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p>"But through [Distortion], the power originally belonging to the souls of heaven and earth is temporarily transferred to his body."</p><p>"Numerous types ofç•° energies are blending without any rejection."</p><p>"This method, except for the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, no one else can bear. No matter how talented they are..."</p><p>"No, this is not a problem of talent."</p><p>Li Fan also keenly sensed something.</p><p>As the number of [Distorted] powers of the souls of heaven and earth increased, the physique of Saint Fetus Xu Bai was also undergoing subtle changes.</p><p>His height and outline became more like the illusory form of the souls of heaven and earth!</p><p>Fortunately, when Saint Fetus Xu Bai had exhausted all the wandering powers of the souls of heaven and earth, his Dao Attainment movements slowed down.</p><p>Because next, it will be the turn of those souls of heaven and earth that originally did not exist in the world, but only descended at critical moments.</p><p>The sky of Tianling State suddenly darkened.</p><p>A barely perceptible shadow attached to the body of Saint Fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As if his head was hit hard, the hurriedly rushing Li Fan towards the Immortal Valley almost stumbled and fell from the sky.</p><p>The soul of heaven and earth: Umbra!</p><p>Sensing the incoming information, Li Fan's forehead had beads of sweat.</p><p>Not out of fear.</p><p>But because, being in the same body as Saint Fetus Xu Bai, has already exerted tremendous pressure on him.</p><p>In simple terms, it's like "what level are you? Sharing the same body with me?"</p><p>The scene was intermittent, Li Fan sensed that there seemed to be another extremely powerful soul of heaven and earth descending in the land of Tianling State.</p>

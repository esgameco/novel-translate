        <h1>Chapter 1210</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After surviving the catastrophe, Li Fan began to recall the terrifying power within the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the reason for the damage to the Infinite Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>"The feeling it gives me even surpasses those few True Immortal seal characters."</p><p></p><p>"Although what I've seen so far are all imitations of True Immortal seal characters, what's in the Infinite Mirror are just remnants of the aftershocks."</p><p></p><p>"Could the tribulation in the Immortal Realm be related to this?"</p><p></p><p>Despite his myriad curiosities, Li Fan didn't want to delve into it for now.</p><p></p><p>The existence capable of destroying the Immortal Realm was definitely not something he could deal with at present.</p><p></p><p>"It's merely some remnants within the Infinite Mirror. Even if induced and released, it would at most envelop a city."</p><p></p><p>"It may have some use only at critical moments."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder such an esteemed Immortal Artifact ended up being occupied by the remnant soul of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. That annihilating tempest was truly too horrifying."</p><p></p><p>"An Immortal Artifact originally belonging to the Infinite Sect, located in the Xuanhuang Realm, actually underwent such changes..."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that indicate that this tribulation occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"If the aftermath alone could damage an Immortal Artifact, if it truly happened, it's impossible for there to be no traces left behind."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's train of thought paused. He suddenly thought of two events that changed the historical trajectory of the Xuanhuang Realm, which might be related.</p><p></p><p>One was the mysterious disappearance of Xuantian King Xuanyuan Hong.</p><p></p><p>The second was the disappearance of the six top-level Eternal Life Realm cultivators who besieged Chuanfa, who at that time only had the cultivation of Harmonious Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of these people had already stood at the pinnacle of their era."</p><p></p><p>"Within the Xuanhuang Realm, ordinary things couldn't harm them at all. Unless..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>"A power that transcends the mundane."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the Tiandu Great Master who came to the Xuanhuang Realm after the Great Tribulation and had been occupying the Dao Source State without moving ever since he was injured.</p><p></p><p>"Was his arrival back then really a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan couldn't help but be filled with deep doubts.</p><p></p><p>This matter also served as a wake-up call for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even if his perspective could already extend out of the Xuanhuang Realm and reach the other side of the starry sea, there were still existences within the Xuanhuang Realm that he couldn't see through and had yet to reach.</p><p></p><p>No matter what he did, he had to be extremely careful.</p><p></p><p>Amidst his surging thoughts, Sun Luyuan had already hurriedly returned.</p><p></p><p>He refined a large mass of essence blood and several materials, adding them into the essence blood pool.</p><p></p><p>The originally somewhat dim pool water once again became dazzling with flowing light.</p><p></p><p>It almost reverted back to the state before absorbing the fragments.</p><p></p><p>However, since it was more complete after all, Li Fan believed that after waiting for Sun Luyao to wake up, the situation would improve to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan had also briefly glimpsed the more complete Hongmeng Jianfang Grand Formation. Putting aside perfect restoration, doing some repairs and touch-ups shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, this Infinite Mirror Spirit Sun Luyao finally briefly woke up from his coma.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I need some things."</p><p></p><p>After informing him of the materials needed to repair the formation, he fell unconscious again.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked at the list of items his younger brother sent over and hurried off to gather them.</p><p></p><p>And during this time, fearing Sun Luyuan's retaliation if pushed too far, the Chen family of the Medicine Hall had been closely monitoring Sun Luyuan's movements.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Luyuan seemed to have forgotten about this matter, coming and going as if busy with some urgent matter.</p><p></p><p>This left the Chen family somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their backer, the Chuanfa Sect's Changzhe at the Immortal Alliance headquarters, had been out of contact.</p><p></p><p>So the Chen family also chose to hold their troops and not act.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>..., quietly observing the changes.</p><p></p><p>With Sun Luyuan's unsparing efforts to gather resources, everything needed was quickly prepared.</p><p></p><p>It appeared to be absorbed by Sun Luyao, but in fact, it was Li Fan who took action with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>As the shattered core of the formation recovered, the situation with the Infinite Mirror slowly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>After hearing about his younger brother's ordeal, Sun Luyuan furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, do you still remember the ancient ruins where we initially found this mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I thought those ruins were simply ancient remains that had experienced the changes of time. But now that you mention it..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's expression turned somewhat grim: "It seems that place was destroyed by the eroding storm inside the mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it was precisely because of the previous release that we brothers had the opportunity to take advantage of it. Otherwise, with our cultivation level at that time, how could we have subdued this mirror?"</p><p></p><p>As Sun Luyao recalled the past scenes, he slowly realized the implications.</p><p></p><p>"That's a possibility. I still remember that back then, we could hardly find anything of value in the ruins. The only thing that could be recognized by the Tianxuan Mirror gave a very low contribution value for recycling..."</p><p></p><p>"You should focus on recovering. After some time, I will return to those ruins from back then to investigate. The entrance there is extremely hidden, and with only ruins left, there shouldn't be much change even after so many years. Perhaps there will be some discoveries." Sun Luyuan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"And the Chen family..." Sun Luyuan suddenly snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the scene that the Infinite Mirror had inexplicably deduced before.</p><p></p><p>"The force that seems to be locked in a stalemate with the Wanxian Alliance appears to be the Shengchao Daqi that younger brother had previously investigated."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the Tianxuan Mirror's predictions do have some basis."</p><p></p><p>"Two great mysterious objects have both made such predictions..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems it's time to try and make contact with the other party."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Sun Luyuan would not personally go knocking on their door from the start.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shengchao Daqi had not yet openly become enemies with the Wanxian Alliance. Letting his trusted subordinates go and investigate first before making further concrete decisions would be wiser.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Infinite Mirror, which was originally thought to be a supreme treasure but had now become a potential disaster that could erupt at any time, worried Sun Luyuan even more.</p><p></p><p>His younger brother had already become the spirit of the Infinite Mirror, so abandoning it was definitely impossible.</p><p></p><p>After some preparations, Sun Luyuan planned to first return to the ruins from back then to take a look.</p><p></p><p>The incident at Baishi Dongtian let Sun Luyuan know that the Chen family was definitely still secretly monitoring him.</p><p></p><p>To avoid unnecessary trouble, Sun Luyuan directly contacted an old friend.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao!</p><p></p><p>"Old Ji, there's something I'd like to ask for your help with..." Sun Luyuan contacted him through a spirit talisman.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ji Hongdao arrived at the Sun family's doorstep.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Old Sun, the favor I owed you back then can finally be repaid." Ji Hongdao laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that you recently had a conflict with the Yao Tang Chen family?" After entering the house, Ji Hongdao suddenly lowered his voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the treasure that Luyao is inhabiting somehow became known to the Chen family." Sun Luyuan told the truth.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry. Although they have a Dharma Transmitter as a backer, you also have the Mirror Holder supporting you from behind, Old Sun."</p><p></p><p>"With their actions exposed this time, they definitely won't dare to act rashly again anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan solemnly said, "A cornered enemy must not be underestimated. For this trip, I'll have to trouble you, brother."</p>

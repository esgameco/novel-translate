            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Realm. New 69 Book Bar 8590 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing, who had just finished praying and was practicing cultivation beside the Immortal Spirit Tower, suddenly blushed.</p><p></p><p>Her body felt as if it had been brutally pried open by a huge object, and she let out a painful groan.</p><p></p><p>Just as she felt at a loss, this pure spiritual energy that had inexplicably descended into her body, like a melting glacier, burst open with a bang!</p><p></p><p>Howling and running through her body, in just a few cycles, it turned into a power that she could control herself.</p><p></p><p>Obediently, it returned to her dantian!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, her realm was also rising at a terrifying speed that could be seen with the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, she soared from the early Golden Core stage to the perfected Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Due to the limitations of the materials required for breaking through realms with the new method, she reluctantly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Throughout this process, the bottleneck restricting cultivators' cultivation, the "Heavenly Tribulation," did not appear at all!</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing blankly sensed her cultivation realm, her face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Carefully comprehending the source of this spiritual power that helped her break through, Su Yuqing seemed to think of something, and her face changed.</p><p></p><p>She immediately knelt down and began to meditate and thank the "Red Dust Compassionate Immortal" for the blessing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm, in front of the faceless divine statue.</p><p></p><p>An invisible feedback of cultivation suddenly appeared in Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>It was the result of Su Yuqing's continuous breakthroughs brought about by the Zuoxian Jue!</p><p></p><p>After deducting what Li Fan had previously bestowed upon Su Yuqing, back and forth, Li Fan's cultivation had even slightly improved!</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was inexplicably shocked in his heart. New 69 Book Bar 8590 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The generation of feedback cultivation did not actually violate common sense and was still within the operating mechanism of the Zuoxian Jue.</p><p></p><p>Just like if Li Fan did not hesitate to personally consume his own cultivation to help others improve their cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>After the matter was accomplished, he could indeed receive a certain amount of feedback cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, the loss of cultivation generated in this process was too great. It was truly a losing business, not worth the loss.</p><p></p><p>"But now, through this faceless Xuantian Statue, the loss of cultivation transfer has been greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>"Making this kind of behavior actually profitable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood that this was an additional function of this mysterious faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Connecting with disciples, bestowing divine blessings..."</p><p></p><p>"It's really becoming more and more like a religious scam."</p><p></p><p>"So the question is, if there is really a powerful being involved behind this stone statue."</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't he directly contact these 'believers' himself, but instead transfers all these abilities and perceptions to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Has my secret been exposed?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, the answer Li Fan came up with still tended to be no.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the temperament of those powerful experts, if they knew about the existence of "Huan Zhen" in his body, it would be almost impossible for them to play cat and mouse games with him.</p><p></p><p>Most likely, they would directly descend and plunder.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, it's because she has fallen into a deep sleep for some reason."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>After staring at the stone statue for a long time, he finally slowly left.</p><p></p><p>He did not give an order forbidding ordinary people from approaching the faceless stone statue but let everything remain as before as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>As he moved away from the stone statue, the prayers in Li Fan's mind also gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan even more certain of his judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was eager to know more.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was very little information about this ancient mysterious sect.</p><p></p><p>Let alone thousands of years later in the present, even during the era of the Ten Immortal Sects in ancient times, the Xuantian Sect was an absolutely forbidden topic.</p><p></p><p>Only the true core members of each sect were qualified to know about it.</p><p></p><p>Even after many reincarnations, Li Fan only had the fortune to catch a glimpse of the Xuantian Sect through Senior Sister Zhao's dreams.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there is another way."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan thought of the first instance dungeon in the Fallen Immortal Realm - [Ningyuan Picking the Longevity Fruit].</p><p></p><p>His descended body, Li Chen, was the target that the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect would try to possess in the future.</p><p></p><p>"If I lie in wait, would I be able to meet this Dharma King in the Fallen Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel excited.</p><p></p><p>Since only a wisp of divine sense would enter the Fallen Immortal Realm, even if it was assimilated by the Dharma King, there would be no harm to his main body.</p><p></p><p>"When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. When he tries to occupy Li Chen's body and merge with Li Fan, Li Chen is also trying to peek into the memories in his mind."</p><p></p><p>As for whether that Dharma King in the Fallen Immortal Realm could cross the boundary between the Fallen Immortal Realm and reality to influence and harm the real Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>Unless his power surpassed that Fallen Immortal, it would be absolutely impossible to do so!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed as he pondered for a moment, feeling that it was feasible.</p><p></p><p>So he quickly made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered as he arrived at the closed-door cultivation room in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>He skillfully set up the ritual.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I was wary of Mr. White, so I thought that before finding a way to thoroughly resolve the hidden danger of the Unwilling Reincarnation, I would not enter the Fallen Immortal Realm again."</p><p></p><p>"But now, the crisis brought by the Xuantian Sect seems to be more imminent."</p><p></p><p>"As for the risks..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes showed no fear, only unwavering determination: "Hesitation and timidity cannot accomplish great things! How could I, Li Fan, be such a vulgar person!"</p><p></p><p>"Fortune is born, Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently chanted in his heart. The next moment, the surroundings distorted.</p><p></p><p>As expected, he returned to the [Ningyuan Picking the Longevity Fruit] instance dungeon.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother? Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>The familiar voice of Zhang Qianmo came from beside his ear.</p><p></p><p>The strange feeling receded like a tide. Li Fan turned his head to look at Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, what's wrong with you?" Zhang Qianmo's eyes showed some doubt and concern.</p><p></p><p>"It's my first time descending the mountain, so I'm a bit excited."</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan quickly got into character and picked up Senior Brother Zhang's words.</p><p></p><p>Chatting and laughing with him, they soon arrived at Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Just like the predetermined trajectory, Senior Brother Zhang was eager to find his old sweetheart Chi Xia.</p><p></p><p>He handed the task of collecting the longevity fruits to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>After the two parted ways, Li Fan did not do anything out of the ordinary. He directly went to the [Tree of Rebirth] in the center of the city to collect three longevity fruits.</p><p></p><p>Under the leadership of Song Hesong, the city administrator of Ningyuan, Li Fan quickly retrieved the longevity fruits from the seal.</p><p></p><p>According to the "plot", soon after, the Wanxian Alliance cultivators including Chu Liang, who were lurking in the city, would make a move against Senior Brother Zhang's sweetheart Chi Xia, trying to provoke Senior Brother Zhang and then surround and kill him. But in the end, they would be killed instead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked back at Song Hesong, a strange smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>Administrator Song's heart jumped, suddenly surging with an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>Without any warning, Li Fan suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, his face as pale as paper.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shouted.</p>

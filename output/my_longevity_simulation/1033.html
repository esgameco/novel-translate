            <p>Chapter 1031: The Bizarre Outbreak in Congyun</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said these words as if they were a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>However, he also knew that the reason he could so easily upgrade the Xuantian Suo You Formation was entirely due to the benefits of the Separation Disk.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention it was the super version after the fusion of two worlds.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary Dao Formation Master's level, they might not even be able to understand this ancient grand formation.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan withdrew his gaze from the entrance of the Tongyou Tunnel.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre frequent outbreaks in the Xuanhuang Realm should have been something that happened after five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the Xuanhuang Realm in this life would not live that long.</p><p></p><p>"Let me test the power after deceiving the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concentrated his mind and locked onto the thin line associated with the Heavenly Earth Aura Gold Seal.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a slight effort, he borrowed the might of Heaven and Earth to convey a false command.</p><p></p><p>Letting the Gold Seal return to Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Tongyou Tunnel, the Gold Seal seemed a bit puzzled by this inexplicable command.</p><p></p><p>If it left now, there was obviously a risk of a large-scale outbreak of the bizarre for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Earth Aura was a manifestation of the will of Heaven and Earth, so naturally there was no such thing as going against its own will.</p><p></p><p>So after a moment's hesitation, the Heavenly Earth Aura Gold Seal still changed back from the form of a golden chain lock to a human figure.</p><p></p><p>Then it slowly faded and finally disappeared between Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The instant the Gold Seal disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw a large amount of dark Yin energy violently spewing out from the area below that was murky and unobservable.</p><p></p><p>Formless and shapeless, yet as if it were a living thing. Spontaneously spreading to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth also reacted very quickly to these dark substances.</p><p></p><p>A sense of crisis of being discovered suddenly surged in Li Fan's heart. He decisively cut off the connection with the vast web of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he fled far away from the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps busy dealing with the bizarre crisis, Heaven and Earth did not detect Li Fan who falsely proclaimed the Heavenly Mandate and meddled in the matter.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed from afar that after the Gold Seal dispersed, two new Heavenly Earth Auras were about to be born in the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had tried his hand, was very satisfied with his divine ability of "Falsely Deceiving the Heavenly Dao".</p><p></p><p>The level of Heavenly Earth Aura was even higher than that of Heavenly Earth Transformations.</p><p></p><p>Since he could falsely borrow the Heavenly Mandate to mobilize the Heavenly Earth Aura.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there was no problem in deploying Heavenly Earth Transformations within a certain range.</p><p></p><p>"One can even use this method to first create chaos within the Xuanhuang Realm, and then take advantage of the situation to 'create' the Heavenly Earth Aura needed to solve the problem." Li Fan's thoughts ran wild with imagination.</p><p></p><p>Far away from the Congyun Sea, Li Fan kept an eye on the situation after the leakage of the Tongyou Tunnel through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It seemed peaceful and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest anomaly occurring.</p><p></p><p>But before the cultivators realized it, some bizarre things had already begun to gradually appear on the Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>"I must be seeing things. How can the accounts not match this month?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan frowned tightly and recalculated the profits for this month.</p><p></p><p>But he found that he had actually lost money.</p><p></p><p>His Qi and blood surged, and he could hardly control the urge to spit out a mouthful of blood at any time.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan forcibly suppressed the irritation in his heart and carefully checked again.</p><p></p><p>The result was correct.</p><p></p><p>"This is not right. I clearly remember that I should have made a small profit this month. How could I have lost money?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He stopped receiving guests and closed the main door tightly.</p><p></p><p>And then carefully...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He carefully reviewed the transactions that took place on Wanxian Island this month once again.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he discovered the root of the problem.</p><p></p><p>"Right, there's still an outstanding debt that hasn't been collected."</p><p></p><p>"Who was the debtor again?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan muttered to himself. As he continued searching, his expression grew increasingly serious.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that the person who owed him the debt had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Not only was there no trace of memory left in his mind, but there was also no information about this person in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this person had never existed at all.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's first reaction was that he had encountered a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>A hint of anger appeared on his swarthy face.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiao Xiuyuan quickly became puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It's only 10,000 contribution points, is it worth it?"</p><p></p><p>After calming down, Jiao Xiuyuan had already sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>After going out to investigate, he further verified his speculation.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's not just one person who has mysteriously disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes darted around, and he immediately took out a jade slip to record his findings.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre occurrences in the Congyu Sea were not limited to this one incident.</p><p></p><p>On one island, the inhabitants all turned into faceless monsters overnight.</p><p></p><p>Each person saw themselves as normal when looking in the mirror. However, when looking at others, they only saw a faceless visage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they could not understand each other's speech.</p><p></p><p>In extreme terror, the island's inhabitants killed each other, and in the end, only one survivor remained.</p><p></p><p>There was also a fishing boat that had gone out to sea. When it returned to the island after a long time, no crew members appeared.</p><p></p><p>The island's inhabitants curiously boarded the ship to investigate, only to find that the crew members had all turned into skeletons.</p><p></p><p>The interior of the ship also seemed to have aged several hundred years, appearing dilapidated and ancient.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of strange and bizarre occurrences took place.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, the instigator behind all this, clicked his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Each bizarre occurrence should correspond to a specific set of rules. If one can unravel the secrets of these rules when the bizarre events erupt, not only can they survive, but they might even be able to grasp a portion of the power of these new rules."</p><p></p><p>"If cultivators are the representatives of the old laws of heaven and earth, then these new laws..."</p><p></p><p>"They might give rise to a completely new power system."</p><p></p><p>After merging with heaven and earth, Li Fan's comprehension seemed to have improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>He instantly thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>"However, these so-called new laws are merely temporary existences during the process of fusion. Once the Xuanhuang Realm is devoured and the fusion is complete, the old laws will be restored."</p><p></p><p>"These new laws are naturally heretical existences that must be eliminated."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Chuanfa Tianzun and the Wanxian Alliance probably won't allow such powers to exist in the world either."</p><p></p><p>"But I hope that more of these existences appear."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had been observing in secret, saw through the potentially profitable aspects of this calamity.</p><p></p><p>He immediately set out for the Congyu Sea again, attempting to search for creatures that had survived the bizarre occurrences and grasped the power of the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of heaven and earth, those constantly squirming, maggot-like dark entities were very clear.</p><p></p><p>There was no risk of being affected.</p><p></p><p>Wherever Li Fan went, he observed from the periphery.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that it was indeed extremely difficult for ordinary creatures to survive in the midst of the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan passed through more than a dozen locations where bizarre events had erupted, but he couldn't find a single survivor.</p><p></p><p>However, his efforts were not in vain. In the end, he found his target on an island called [Fan Yong].</p>

        <h1>Chapter 278</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haibo had finally sensed their own opportunities, and it was impossible for them to easily give up.</p><p></p><p>With Su Xiaomei's bad temper, once she set her mind on something, she wouldn't listen to anyone.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhang Haibo, he had even more reason.</p><p></p><p>He had not started on the path of cultivation early, being more than a dozen years older than the others who had transcended the mortal realm, already falling far behind.</p><p></p><p>Now they wanted him to wait again, who knows when the next opportunity would appear?</p><p></p><p>It should be known that on the path of cultivation, one step faster means being faster with every step.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haibo had already been many steps slower than others, and really did not want to delay any further.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haibo's eyes were firm, clearly having made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng was also left speechless by these words, unable to find a reason to refute.</p><p></p><p>He could only turn to Su Changyu, Ye Feipeng and the others for help, hoping they could persuade them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng was very casual, not caring at all: "Xiao Heng, don't worry about it."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, I was able to escape from the hands of the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance back then. These two have great fortune and luck, and their cultivation is not weaker than mine."</p><p></p><p>"What danger could there be if they are a little careful!"</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu remained silent, showing no intention to stop Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>With her brother's support, Su Xiaomei became even more complacent.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't wait to set off immediately.</p><p></p><p>The anxious Xiao Heng hurriedly stopped her, and after much persuasion, finally convinced her.</p><p></p><p>Letting the two prepare well before heading to Jiushan Prefecture would not be too late.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Xiaomei glaring fiercely at him, Xiao Heng also sighed, having grievances he couldn't express.</p><p></p><p>He knew Su Xiaomei's temper well.</p><p></p><p>It would be fine if they didn't interact with other cultivators on the way.</p><p></p><p>But once they encountered outsiders, it was almost certain that Su Xiaomei would clash with others.</p><p></p><p>If possible, Xiao Heng also wanted to go along to protect them.</p><p></p><p>But after Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haibo left, the only ones with some combat power left on the desolate island were Xiao Heng and Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng was mysterious and often went out, completely unreliable.</p><p></p><p>If he also went along, if they encountered any risks, then the desolate island would truly have no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>Taking Su Changyu and the others to explore together was even more unreliable.</p><p></p><p>Even if they wanted to go, Xiao Heng would never agree.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Xiao Heng activated the ritual and entered the White Bone Pioneer Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was preparing to seek help from Senior Skull, to see if he could get some assistance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long been aware of the situation here.</p><p></p><p>He was also very interested in the situation of the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that in this world, Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haibo's Golden Core opportunity would be related to the ruins here.</p><p></p><p>It was just the right opportunity to explore the truth.</p><p></p><p>He immediately sent over two random teleportation necklaces, a set of Myriad Immortals Formation Flags, and two "talismans" through the altar.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation necklaces and Myriad Immortals Formation Flags were naturally for the two kids to save their lives.</p><p></p><p>If they unfortunately died when they were about to gain something, then Li Fan's loss would be huge.</p><p></p><p>As for the two so-called talismans, they were actually defensive magic tools engraved with the [Spiritual Communication Shocking God Formation].</p><p></p><p>The defensive effect was secondary.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose was to let Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haibo carry them to enhance the sensing medium.</p><p></p><p>The reason for preparing this was because Li Fan's [Formless Killing Intent] sensing had a distance limit.</p><p></p><p>Now with late Foundation Establishment cultivation, if the distance from the target exceeded one prefecture, the clarity of the sensed image would be greatly reduced and severely affected.</p><p></p><p>The distance between Congyun Sea and Jiushan Prefecture was vast.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Li Fan's avatar went to the Myriad Laws Pavilion to purchase techniques, the group took nearly half a year to arrive.</p><p></p><p>At such a great distance, if there was no [Spiritual Communication Shocking God Formation] as a medium, it would be almost impossible to sense any images, only able to lock onto the location from afar.</p><p></p><p>So to know their situation at any time, these talismans were necessary.</p><p></p><p>With the Formless Killing Intent monitoring, Li Fan could also lend a hand when needed.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these items, Li Fan also passed on the method of [Reestablishing the Dao] to Xiao Heng.</p><p></p><p>After all, the higher Su Xiaomei and the others broke through, the more Li Fan would gain.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haibo had to at least form their Golden Cores with three methods, right?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's wishful thinking was making loud noises.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng, who suddenly received so much help, felt his blood surging and became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>He kowtowed several times in the direction where Senior Skull was slumbering.</p><p></p><p>"Senior has provided so many precious treasures this time, he must have predicted the dangers ahead."</p><p></p><p>"I still need to carefully remind Xiaomei and the others."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng thought to himself, put away the items, left the Pioneer Realm, and distributed them to Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haibo.</p><p></p><p>Then he tirelessly repeated his advice.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei pouted and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>But her attention was focused on the newly received treasures, her eyes showing a hint of delight as she secretly played with them.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haibo first put away the items, then his expression turned solemn, telling Xiao Heng not to worry.</p><p></p><p>With preparations complete and another round of farewells.</p><p></p><p>The two, holding a map that Ye Feipeng had obtained from who knows where, set off in the direction of Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Two companions had rushed towards an unknown fate for the sake of forming their Golden Cores.</p><p></p><p>The remaining people, in addition to reluctance and worry, were also inspired.</p><p></p><p>"I also need to hurry up and form my Golden Core. When Xiaomei returns, I will definitely give her a big surprise." Xiao Heng secretly made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Yin sisters looked at each other and returned to the depths of the desolate island to diligently cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu gazed in the direction where Su Xiaomei had left, his expression becoming more resolute.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng didn't have much sentimental feelings.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Xiao Heng go to the Pioneer Realm and bring back so many treasures, his eyes were spinning.</p><p></p><p>After everyone left one after another, he also imitated and came to the Pioneer Realm to cry and complain.</p><p></p><p>Trying to get some benefits from Senior Skull.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who witnessed this scene, suddenly felt both amused and helpless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the little fatty's heartbroken and pitiful appearance, if Li Fan hadn't been monitoring him all along.</p><p></p><p>Considering how hard he was performing, Li Fan didn't ignore him this time.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan engraved the [Creation Furnace Technique], which he had researched to utilize the hidden potential of the body to strengthen the flesh, onto a jade slip and sent it to Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>A flash of white light passed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that there was actually a gain this time, Ye Feipeng was overjoyed, leaped up, took the jade slip in his hand, and eagerly started reading.</p><p></p><p>"[Creation Furnace Technique]?"</p><p></p><p>The five domineering characters that first appeared stunned him.</p><p></p><p>His pupils suddenly contracted, and he subconsciously put away the jade slip, looking around.</p><p></p><p>After making sure he was the only one in the Pioneer Realm, Ye Feipeng ravenously examined the contents of the technique.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, his face revealed a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"That's it?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling that something was wrong, the unsatisfied Ye Feipeng carefully read it over and over again several times.</p><p></p><p>"No, no. The Creation Furnace Technique, a technique that sounds extremely profound, how could it be so simple?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that it's too profound, and my aptitude is not enough to understand it?"</p><p></p><p>For a while, the little fatty fell into deep self-doubt.</p>

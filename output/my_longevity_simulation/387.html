        <h1>Chapter 387</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Some chose to rest.</p><p></p><p>Others went to support unfinished formations in order to earn more points in the competition.</p><p></p><p>However, secretive places like the Five Elements Grand Sanctuary were still off limits for these young formation masters.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was able to come here thanks to Chief Lu's connection and the sudden change in the void in Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that after two years, the place Li Fan had worked so hard to reach had become accessible to anyone as long as they applied for entry.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this Daoist Li Fan? I've heard so much about you!"</p><p></p><p>A young formation master named Xiang Liu greeted Li Fan warmly.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since two years ago, when Daoist Li's ranking soared to the top three, it caused quite a commotion and discussion."</p><p></p><p>"Although everyone knows about your achievements, there are indeed many Daoists who are not inferior to you in terms of dedication."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, people speculated that you were in charge of constructing formations in some extremely important grand sanctuary."</p><p></p><p>"And as expected!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu looked at Li Fan with great admiration, but there was no hint of envy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Another formation master named Gu Youguang couldn't hide his envy: "I suppose Daoist Li must come from a prestigious background to have the opportunity to be in such a prestigious place."</p><p></p><p>"The points obtained within the Five Elements Grand Sanctuary are more than three times that of the outside world!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cleared his throat, pretending to be weak: "Haha, you misunderstand, my friend. The reason I'm here is merely due to a lucky coincidence and benefiting from Elder Huangfu Song."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, my time is running out, and I will return to heaven soon. What use do points and rankings have for me?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter where I am, it makes no difference to me."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I continue to construct the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xiang Liu and Gu Youguang put away their smiling faces and became serious.</p><p></p><p>"What you have done is truly admirable, Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"That's why, although you are ranked second on the outside, there are various speculations about you, but not many are dissatisfied with you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hadn't expected the points boost within the Five Elements Grand Sanctuary to be so high.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with his continuous hard work for over two years, he managed to rank second in the prestigious competition.</p><p></p><p>"Who is in first place?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Who else could it be but that Guo Yezhong?" Gu Youguang seemed somewhat disdainful, expressing his contempt.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Brother, be careful..." Xiang Liu glanced at Gu Youguang and then explained, "The current first place is the former bottom of the list, Guo Yezhong Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Guo Yezhong..." Li Fan's eyes flashed slightly as he knowingly asked, "How did this person manage to rise from last place to first? And judging by Gu Brother's tone..."</p><p></p><p>Before Xiang Liu could explain, Gu Youguang rushed to say, "What else does he have? He's just lucky. It's said that after the battle in Tianlingzhou, he was the first to propose the idea of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation. Thus, for every Locking Spirit Formation established, he receives a significant points reward."</p><p></p><p>"And with more and more formations built now, naturally, no one can surpass him."</p><p></p><p>Gu Youguang spoke resentfully: "In fact, it's nothing special. After all, he did make a contribution to the formation. What really infuriates everyone is that he relies on the advantages he has gained, lays back to win, and is unwilling to put in any more effort. He treats the efforts of others as a plaything, trampling on the meaning of hard work..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Youguang becoming increasingly unreasonable, Xiang Liu quickly interrupted him: "Actually, Guo Daoist isn't that bad; he can be considered a natural talent. It is said that not only did he propose the idea of the Locking Spirit Formation, but he personally designed and created the prototype of the formation."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, he had zero points before and was only delayed by some urgent matters. It wasn't intentional..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Youguang snorted, "Who would believe that? I heard it was all because he has a powerful father!"</p><p></p><p>"When a Daoist came to him to confront him, he not only felt no guilt but even courageously asked, 'What, you're not satisfied?'"</p><p></p><p>"It's truly shameless. Thinking back to having studied with someone like him truly disgusts me!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu looked at Gu Youguang with a pained expression, shook his head, and stopped trying to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>"Guo Yezhong." Li Fan remembered his encounter with this person at the Universal Academy. "I really misjudged him..."</p><p></p><p>As they caught up with each other, they didn't mention this person again.</p><p></p><p>Just reminiscing about their past years of study together, Li Fan asked them about their experiences in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>After some idle chatter, realizing that it was almost time, the two joined in the construction of formations in the Water Grand Sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu and Gu Youguang weren't any less skilled in formations than Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>With their help, the progress was greatly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were accompanied by many cultivators from the Defense Academy, each carrying a vial-shaped treasure that could release "Divine Glass Light".</p><p></p><p>This mysterious light had a purifying function that was particularly effective against the fused creatures in the Five Elements Grand Sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>With no external threats, the overall progress of constructing the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation was steadily increasing.</p><p></p><p>Four months later, it reached 99% completion.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the process of unifying the Five Elements was nearing its final stages.</p><p></p><p>The gigantic tree hanging upside down in the sky had numerous branches deeply inserted into the azure waters.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, at the beginning, when the elements of water and wood first touched, there were constantly strange creatures being born due to the fusion.</p><p></p><p>But now, as the real fusion of wood and water occurred, these strange creatures no longer appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the green branches tainted by the blue water and saw faint images of incomplete figures again.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Li Fan, it's time to evacuate."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu reminded Li Fan, who was lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, activated his flying shuttle, and headed towards the massive Dust Ferry that had appeared in the sky once again.</p><p></p><p>Their work was no longer needed as formation masters.</p><p></p><p>As numerous cultivators returned to the Dust Ferry, dark figures flew in the opposite direction, heading towards the various key formation nodes that had been built earlier.</p><p></p><p>They would use the "Eternal Gilded Essence" to protect the crucial structures of the Locking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>When everything was ready and the Sky Mirror was set up, the Locking Spirit Formation enveloping the Five Elements Grand Sanctuary would be completely finished.</p><p></p><p>"I hope there are no more oversights." Li Fan thought to himself as he returned to the Dust Ferry.</p>

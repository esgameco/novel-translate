            <p>Moreover, only oneself can see it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan believed that the words of the Du'e Master and his disciples should not be groundless.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the sudden fusion of the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven is due to the Wanxian Alliance exploiting the resources of a certain attribute cave heaven?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced, pondered for a moment, and decided not to wait to die.</p><p></p><p>Even if the real explosion were to occur, it might not be safe on the Dust Crossing Boat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly contacted Qi Buyi using the Duting Record, and told her about the strange scene he had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Qi Buyi, upon receiving the news, remained unruffled.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it turns out to be the 'Time Mirage'! Fellow Daoist is lucky..."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? I remember you only have the Golden Core cultivation level, right? And you can still sense it?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Fellow Daoist has a strong soul, far superior to ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>After some explanation, Li Fan finally understood what the so-called 'Time Mirage' was all about.</p><p></p><p>Just like how the 'Mortal to Divine Wall of Tianyun Prefecture' once left behind the scene of Mr. Bai's mortal-to-divine transformation and reaching the heavens in one step.</p><p></p><p>When specific conditions are met, phenomena like the 'Time Mirage' being recorded and repeatedly appearing at special times on earth also occur.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the Five Elements and the transformation from existence to non-existence make it extremely easy for the phenomenon of the 'Time Mirage' to occur.</p><p></p><p>Several years ago, during the fusion of the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven, a pair of the Du'e sectâ€™s master and disciple passed by.</p><p></p><p>The master was explaining to the disciple.</p><p></p><p>This scene happened to be recorded by the 'Time Mirage'. </p><p></p><p>As countless cycles passed, the fusion of the Five Elements occurred again.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the master enlightening the disciple reappeared, and Li Fan, who had a strong soul due to cultivating the Xuanhuang Refining Heart Mantra, sensed it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Buyi's words explained the origin of the illusion to Li Fan,</p><p></p><p>it did not completely ease his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned and asked, "Senior Qi, does the great explosion mentioned in this mirage really happen?"</p><p></p><p>"Should we take defensive measures?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi replied with a smile, "Don't worry, it's just a small scene. When we first noticed the signs of the Five Elements fusion, we anticipated various possibilities, including this great explosion, all of which are planned."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, just watch with peace of mind."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Tianyun Locking Spirit Array is almost complete now. Why bother adding more defensive measures?"</p><p></p><p>With no response from Qi Buyi on the other end, her words, however, left Li Fan deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Will the Tianyun Locking Spirit be able to ignore the great explosion resulting from the imbalance of the Five Elements?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhang Zhiliang said at the beginning, even the builders of these spiritual locking arrays like Li Fan may not know the true power of the 'Tianyun Lock Spirit Array'.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, in the current Xuanhuang Realm, only a few people know what kind of power a fully activated locking spirit array will unleash.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity to see the abilities of our hard work over the years in advance."</p><p></p><p>For a superficial 'monitoring' formation, Li Fan still had doubts about whether it could withstand the great explosion that would lead everything back into chaos.</p><p></p><p>But since Qi Buyi said so, it meant she would not be reckless.</p><p></p><p>The presence of 'Eternal Age Metal' used to protect the formation also indicated that the Wanxian Alliance had prepared in advance.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan stood at the edge of the Dust Crossing Boat, quietly watching below, waiting for the fusion of the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Great Cave Heaven, like mixed paint, became even more chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The huge roar and collision noises even pierced through multiple layers of space barriers and reached the Dust Crossing Boat.</p><p></p><p>The branches and wild growth of the hanging giant tree spread throughout the blue sea.</p><p></p><p>The roaring flames engulfed everything, giving birth to green wood within the ashes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Bizarre scenes completely opposite to the present world continued to unfold in the nearly doomed Five Elements Great Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time, the fusion of the five elemental cave heavens became even closer.</p><p></p><p>In the sea area, roots spread everywhere, and gold and stone stood tall, twisted, and melted into scorched earth.</p><p></p><p>Then, flames were born from the barren land, and wood met water.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, with the intensification of the fusion of the Five Elements,</p><p></p><p>these bizarre scenes no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>The lower cave heaven was dyed into an extremely abstract painting.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan focused his mind, staring closely at the dying cave heaven.</p><p></p><p>The colors became increasingly dim.</p><p></p><p>The invisible black color, like a fierce beast, devoured the remaining colors.</p><p></p><p>Getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>However, even after the area of the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven was completely transformed into nothingness,</p><p></p><p>there were still many indescribable colors that seemed to still exist.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, these overall greyish existences began to proliferate violently.</p><p></p><p>Like a huge swirling vortex constantly swirling and absorbing the surrounding black.</p><p></p><p>The lower area now looked like a rapidly expanding dye plate.</p><p></p><p>Despite feeling a bit dizzy, Li Fan forced himself not to look away.</p><p></p><p>He had a sense in his heart that observing this great explosion caused by the imbalance of the Five Elements might be very beneficial to him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the abnormality in the lower void also caught the attention of other practitioners.</p><p></p><p>While they brought their friends to watch, they showed no signs of worry.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, they had great confidence in the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The colorful dye plate spun faster and faster, finally reaching its limit at a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>An extremely dangerous aura suddenly burst out from below.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously took a step back.</p><p></p><p>Like the light of creation, it illuminated the dark void.</p><p></p><p>A supreme white light was born, carrying the power to destroy the heavens and the earth, ready to sweep everything around.</p><p></p><p>Just at that moment...</p><p></p><p>A cyan light flashed outside the void.</p><p></p><p>Then, along the nodes of the main line of the Tianyun Locking Spirit Array they built,</p><p></p><p>the speed was several times faster than the white light caused by the explosion.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a crisscrossing network of cyan threads formed, completely shrouding the explosion zone.</p><p></p><p>Before the spectators could react, countless cyan threads spewed out from the main veins.</p><p></p><p>Endless, continuous.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the dazzling white light had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In its place, in front of the onlookers, was a huge cocoon of cyan light.</p><p></p><p>It wriggled for a moment, and the cocoon suddenly shrank a bit.</p><p></p><p>The cyan color on the main line of the Tianyun Locking Spirit Array became brighter.</p><p></p><p>Like a beating heart, constantly transmitting blood.</p><p></p><p>In the astonishment of the onlookers, the cyan cocoon grew smaller.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And the Tianyun Locking Spirit Array, which effortlessly resolved the imbalance of the Five Elements in the great explosion, was radiating its cyan brilliance in the dark void.</p><p></p><p>"So, this is the power of the Tianyun Locking Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>He was very sure that even in the ancient cultivation world teeming with powerful beings, it would be impossible to resolve such a terrifying explosion so easily.</p><p></p><p>But now, relying on the Tianyun Locking Spirit Array, the Wanxian Alliance had effortlessly achieved this.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a chill ran through Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>If the defense was already this strong.</p>

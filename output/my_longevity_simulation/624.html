        <h1>Chapter 624</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The power of the Earth's veins surged and roared, seeming to be much more aggressive than before.</p><p></p><p>Leveraging this force, Li Fan set up the "Earth Fire Returning Array" and placed the quiet Tianyang in the center of the formation.</p><p></p><p>He then added many materials such as "Eternal Spiritual Gold," "Bright Sky Crystal Stone," and "Purple Spirit Crystal Marrow" into the array one by one.</p><p></p><p>Like a giant furnace, under the blazing power of the Earth Fire, these materials slowly fused with the puppet body of Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>During the countless years of Tianyang's dormant state, it was through this formation that he progressed from the mere foundation building stage, broke through his limits, and ascended to become an immortal emperor.</p><p></p><p>However, as Tianyang's sect back then was only a minor one, even though he inherited all the sect's assets, his resources were limited.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of cultivation to reach the realm of an immortal emperor, it had already become his limit.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the puppet body was also limited by the materials used, with a relatively low upper limit. It was manageable when fighting at the same level, but it would be extremely difficult to cross realms like a true genius.</p><p></p><p>However, with Li Fan's help now, everything was about to change completely.</p><p></p><p>With so many precious materials added, even if only creating a simple puppet, it would be enough to compete with ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Combined with Tianyang's indomitable spirit, perhaps he could survive against the ultimate world spirit, the Ink Kill Hand.</p><p></p><p>The blazing light of the "Earth Fire Returning Array" reflected in Li Fan's eyes. After observing for several days, he found that the progress was slower than expected.

Everyone who saw them was shocked by the terrifying power these artifacts could unleash, dispelling any thoughts of provoking conflicts. However, due to confidentiality requirements, the specific effects of these two Revered Artefacts of the World couldn't be disclosed, leaving everyone curious.</p><p></p><p>After the opening ceremony, the highly anticipated competitive stage began on the second day. New 𝟔𝟗 Book Bar 𝟨𝟫𝘴𝘩𝘶𝘹.𝘤𝘰𝘮</p><p></p><p>Dan, Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Each day, only one event was held, with the Ten Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Council each sending three geniuses to compete.</p><p></p><p>The first and most eye-catching event was the "Battle of Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless cultivators from the Ten Immortal Alliance viewed through the Tianling Observation Mirror and witnessed the entrance of the first representative.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his appearance, he was just a ten-year-old boy or girl. Dressed in white with a red ribbon tied around his head, he looked exceptionally attractive.</p><p></p><p>The corresponding explanation promptly appeared on the Observation Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Di Liu Wu." </p><p></p><p>That was the name of the boy before them.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the cultivators were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>The representatives of the Five Elders' Council also had displeased expressions.</p><p></p><p>"What's the meaning of this? Just sending a little kid at such an important event?"</p><p></p><p>"Do they think there is no one worthy in our Five Elders' Council?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators present were extraordinary in their cultivation levels; they could naturally see that the boy called Di Liu Wu had not maintained his childlike size into adulthood. He truly looked like he was not yet ten years old.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was a genius, having lived for such a short time, how strong could he possibly be?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Five Elders' Council all had extremely grim expressions, and immediately, a young man in green took a step forward, filled with indignation and a murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Zhi, don't be careless!"</p><p></p><p>Among the cultivators of the Five Elders' Council, a middle-aged woman who looked no different from a rural woman suddenly shouted.</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged woman seemed to have a special status, and the young man in green named as Xu Gu Zhi nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He then gracefully approached Di Liu Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Please enlighten me!" Xu Gu Zhi narrowed his eyes and pointed his sword directly at Di Liu Wu.</p><p></p><p>Before the major battle could begin, the cultivators of the Ten Immortal Alliance also got a glimpse of the information of the two contenders.</p><p></p><p>Both were at the peak of the Immortal Emperor realm, with Di Liu Wu at nine years old and Xu Gu Zhi at fifty-six years old.</p><p></p><p>"A nine-year-old Immortal Emperor? Am I seeing this correctly?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if he started cultivating from the womb, he couldn’t have advanced so quickly, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this a real existence? Is Di Liu Wu the fastest cultivator in history? How did he achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>"At the age of three hundred and seventy-eight, I'm still hovering at the Yuan Infant realm. The difference between people is truly despairing."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you're already at the Yuan Infant realm. What could a little Foundation Building cultivator like me even say?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Before the battle even began, it ignited discussions among the cultivators, with speculations about the origin of Di Liu Wu.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan was amazed and surprised.</p><p></p><p>It was truly unusual for a nine-year-old at the peak of the Immortal Emperor realm, exceeding all common sense.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a reincarnation technique like Senior Zhang's? Or the possession and rebirth of the Great Mage of Xuantian's teachings?"</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was guessing, Xu Gu Zhi made a move.</p><p></p><p>With a swing of his sword, a huge sword shadow emerged and descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Endless Swords, stretching like mountains."</p><p></p><p>The explanation synced up in the Observation Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer, tens of millions of giant swords surrounded from all directions, all aiming to crush Di Liu Wu.</p><p></p><p>There was no earth-shattering sound, only a continuous stream of sword shadows, as imposing as mountains, bringing unmatched pressure.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the swords surrounding him, Di Liu Wu seemed dumbfounded, motionless and clueless.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the Ten Immortal Alliance cultivators were gripped tightly.</p><p></p><p>Just before the countless swords were about to strike, Di Liu Wu made a move.</p><p></p><p>A silver dragon, flashing like thunder, illuminating the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>It swiftly pierced through the encircling swords.</p><p></p><p>Before all the cultivators could react, it pierced through Xu Gu Zhi's chest.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

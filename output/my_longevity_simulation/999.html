        <h1>Chapter 999</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Lu Xichan's memories of the first half of her life, there was almost only the figure of her master, Lu Xia. The rest was just endless knowledge of formations.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Li Fan, who had transformed into Lu Xichan's master, collided with Lu Xichan's own soul, it did not cause much resistance.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan felt a sense of awe from Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Countless images flickered in Lu Xichan's soul, true and false, false and true.</p><p></p><p>The faces of Lu Xia and Li Fan kept changing, faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only Li Fan's face remained, firmly engraved deep in Lu Xichan's soul.</p><p></p><p>As the silver light power of the True Temptation Fruit completely dissolved, Lu Xichan's body also slowly calmed down after a violent spasm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan retracted his soul power, as the long-term, large-scale transmission of soul power was too consuming.</p><p></p><p>Even with the infinite regeneration of soul power from the [Wuji Yingxu Method], it was still a bit too much to handle at once.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the matter was settled.</p><p></p><p>During the soul fusion just now, Li Fan glimpsed many secrets in Lu Xichan's memories.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lu Xichan's master Lu Xia was actually never very satisfied with Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Until his death, he had no hope that Lu Xichan would be able to inherit his ultimate art of formations in the future.</p><p></p><p>When he accepted Lu Xichan as his disciple back then, including passing on to her the position of the head of the Strategy Formation Hall, there were certain special factors involved.</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Xia never explicitly stated it before his death, Lu Xichan herself speculated that she might be her master Lu Xia's daughter.</p><p></p><p>However, she ultimately didn't have the courage to verify this speculation.</p><p></p><p>And with Lu Xia's body and bones turned to ashes, there was no way to prove whether this speculation was true or not.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan had many more secrets.</p><p></p><p>For example, due to living under her master's high-pressure discipline for many years during her childhood, her psyche had always been under tremendous stress.</p><p></p><p>In the process of trying to relieve the pressure, she discovered a rather effective method.</p><p></p><p>And the reason why she would often come to find Xuan Sushuang was precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's expression changed slightly in a somewhat peculiar way: "So it turns out that Lu Xuejing's masochistic constitution was actually inherited from her mother."</p><p></p><p>"It really is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Lu Xichan's daughter, Lu Xuejing, she was also related to Xuan Sushuang.</p><p></p><p>During one stress-relieving session, Lu Xichan discovered that Xuan Sushuang was somehow already pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Under duress, Xuan Sushuang had no choice but to confess the truth.</p><p></p><p>"The [Art of Living Beings] taught by the Heavenly Profound Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and glanced at Xuan Sushuang on the side.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan pestered Xuan Sushuang and also used the [Art of Living Beings] to conceive and give birth to a daughter.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the human incarnation of the Heavenly Profound Mirror is indeed related to the Mirror Holder Cang."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes and slowly digested the large amount of information he had obtained in a short time.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was recovering his depleted soul power.</p><p></p><p>When he had recovered enough, Li Fan used the same method to invade Xuan Sushuang's soul.</p><p></p><p>As expected of a direct descendant of the Mirror Holder Cang, Xuan Sushuang's soul power and protective formations were much stronger than Lu Xichan's.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, it was only a change in quantity, not quality.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's continuous grinding efforts, coupled with the inclusion of Lu Xichan's soul aura, cooperating with...</p><p></p><p>The True Temptation Fruit.</p><p></p><p>After the line of defense was broken in an instant, it became even easier to have one's perception distorted.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan gained another identity in addition to being Luo Xichan's master.</p><p></p><p>Another incarnation of the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Long ago, when the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate re-established the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the Heavenly Profound Mirror made preparations for a rainy day and created a human avatar for itself.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate was wary of the Heavenly Profound Mirror and discovered this avatar.</p><p></p><p>The avatar was suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Heavenly Profound Mirror lost contact with the avatar.</p><p></p><p>Left with no choice, the Heavenly Profound Mirror had to restart the avatar creation plan.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it reached a cooperation with the Mirror Holder Cang.</p><p></p><p>But what they didn't know was that Lu Xia, Luo Xichan's master and the former chief of the Formation Hall of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, had previously discovered the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's seal by chance.</p><p></p><p>By a twist of fate, he rescued the suppressed avatar.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the avatar of the Heavenly Profound Mirror had been suppressed for too long and was in a critical condition. So, Lu Xia took the initiative to use his own life to save it.</p><p></p><p>Although the avatar survived, it had been suppressed for too long and had changed bodies, losing the authority of the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought he would continue living as the human Lu Xia from then on. However, being at the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance and still having countless ties with the Heavenly Profound Mirror that couldn't be severed, his characteristics as the Heavenly Profound Mirror were still noticed by some people.</p><p></p><p>To save his life, he had no choice but to fake his death and escape.</p><p></p><p>He thought he could live freely from then on, but unexpectedly, a new human avatar of the Heavenly Profound Mirror was born by chance.</p><p></p><p>What's even more deadly is that immortal treasures have spirits, and only one can exist in the world.</p><p></p><p>There won't be a second Heavenly Profound Mirror in the world, and naturally, there won't be two human avatars of the Heavenly Profound Mirror at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Although it was accidentally born due to various errors, this mistake is being corrected.</p><p></p><p>He realized that he was constantly getting weaker.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be long before he completely dissipated between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And the only way to survive is to find and kill the second human avatar of the Heavenly Profound Mirror!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>This is the huge lie that Li Fan fabricated, involving these two female cultivators who had combined their Dao and the human avatar of the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if one thinks carefully, there are many loopholes.</p><p></p><p>But as long as he extracts the information about the human avatar of the Heavenly Profound Mirror from Xuan Sushang's mouth, it doesn't matter even if all of this is exposed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that all the information about the Heavenly Profound Mirror seems to be encrypted."</p><p></p><p>"The soul cannot browse it. Otherwise, there would be no need to go to the trouble of fabricating such lies."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the alteration of perception ended, Xuan Sushang and Luo Xichan slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>The two had different reactions when they saw Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xichan's body trembled, and she subconsciously lowered her head, muttering in a low voice, "Master..."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang, on the other hand, had a complex expression and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Because when this former chief formation master and human avatar of the Heavenly Profound Mirror came to them, he happened to catch them in the act.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan didn't say anything at the time, the two women felt ashamed and embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the deadly silence, Li Fan was the first to speak, "I have already given you a chance."</p><p></p><p>"I am still the second avatar. Who will you choose to help in the end?"</p><p></p><p>With a flash of killing intent in his eyes, Li Fan slowly said, "If it weren't for Xichan's sake, I would have searched your souls long ago. Do you think the little tricks in your souls can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Xichan didn't dare to refute and didn't even dare to breathe.</p>

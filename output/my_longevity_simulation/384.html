        <h1>Chapter 384</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The work in hand continued non-stop, as Li Fan arranged the formation while casting a quick glance at Han Zhen.</p><p></p><p>The consecutive hours of devoted work were not without a cost.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan finally broke free from the immersive state of mind, akin to an epiphany during the formation process, a strong sense of weakness surged up within him.</p><p></p><p>Under the extreme strain, his physiological age rapidly increased.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan had truly reached the end of his life.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to take a rest."</p><p></p><p>This thought involuntarily emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, he immediately treated it as the main material for the "Reverse cultivation of the Dao Mind," pushing all laziness and fatigue down forcefully.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't push myself harder, how can I seek transcendence in this extremely dangerous world of cultivating immortality?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan muttered to himself, then shook off his fatigue, forcing his aging self to burn the last moments of his life and resume the formation work.</p><p></p><p>The expressions and reactions of Yan Hang and others below were all within Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Actually, he didn't even need them to report.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan had just applied to Qu Bi Yi across regions using the Dutian Record, he had already explained his current physical condition.</p><p></p><p>After Qu Bi Yi's unsuccessful persuasion, he swiftly agreed to Li Fan's request.</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance should extend my life. However, nothing is absolute, and I need to be prepared for the extraordinary actions of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have accumulated enough contributions, and there is still a Longevity Fruit left. When necessary, whether by purchase or exchange, I can obtain some life-extending items. I must strive to gain some time to bring closure to this world."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the report from Yan Hang and others was submitted, it was as if a stone had been thrown into the sea, without causing any ripples.</p><p></p><p>While they were puzzled and disappointed, Li Fan himself seemed unaffected, which further impressed them.</p><p></p><p>Thus, amidst all the calm events, half a year passed by.</p><p></p><p>One day, a sudden and drastic change occurred in the tranquil Water Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The azure water world, without any warning, started to violently sway.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, Li Fan had to halt his formation process.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously wanting to observe what was happening around him, he felt as if the entire world was spinning, making him dizzy and disoriented.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Yan Hang and others reacted quickly.</p><p></p><p>The moment the sudden change occurred, they flew to Li Fan's side, took out various protective treasures, and surrounded him in the center for protection.</p><p></p><p>Within the protective shield formed by rays of light, they managed to slightly shield themselves from the external disturbances caused by the great change.</p><p></p><p>It was then that Li Fan could clearly see what was happening in this Water Attribute Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The straight line between Water and Wood elements, at this moment, seemed to be squeezed by tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>Forming a wave-like distortion. </p><p></p><p>The unchanging calm water surface was now producing towering waves.</p><p></p><p>Connecting with the invasively entering Wood Attribute Cave Heaven above.</p><p></p><p>With a tremendous and thunderous friction, the giant upside-down tree above their heads seemed even closer.</p><p></p><p>The pointed and continuous branches kept extending downwards, becoming fragmented and desolate upon touching the Water Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, it only slightly slowed down the growth momentum, still piercing through the boundaries of both realms firmly.</p><p></p><p>The originally pure and tranquil Water Attribute spiritual energy between heaven and earth gradually became chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the others watched with solemn expressions as the great change unfolded in the cave heaven.</p><p></p><p>Although they had become used to working amidst the occasional surging waves and the thunderous roars of friction, for them, these disturbances mostly affected their mental state and did not pose a real threat.</p><p></p><p>After chunks of withered wood debris fell into the Water Cave Heaven, it mixed with the changes of the Water and Wood attributes to form monsters.</p><p></p><p>These creatures, shaped differently, were entirely made of withered wood.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant blue water flowed constantly on the surface of their wooden bodies, resembling blood manifested on the exterior.</p><p></p><p>They possessed high aggression and were extremely sensitive to the auras of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even if separated by thousands of miles, they would seek out the nearest cultivator to attack spontaneously.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance had tried many methods but had not yet found a suitable way to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Hence, battles were inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Although these monsters appeared like withered wood, their texture was unexpectedly tough.</p><p></p><p>Even a full-force blow from a Yuanying stage cultivator could only leave a shallow wound on them.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, their method of combat was quite crude, and their numbers were relatively few.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance often operated in teams of several people and carried out collective actions.</p><p></p><p>Relying on numerical superiority and well-crafted equipment to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>With a bit of time spent, they could eliminate the monsters without any major risks.</p><p></p><p>After each battle, Yan Hang and the others would provide a detailed report on the battle process through the Dutian Record.</p><p></p><p>Having collected a lot of data, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance compiled tactics for battling these monsters and distributed them to every cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Due to the integration of different attributes in each Cave Heaven, different types of monsters appeared.</p><p></p><p>The monster Li Fan and his group encountered, a fusion of Wood and Water, dominated by Wood, was named "Duo Mu" (Fallen Wood).</p><p></p><p>To deal with Duo Mu, two types of spells were most effective.</p><p></p><p>One was a fire attribute technique. With flames burning, the wood would boil and the water evaporate, turning the Duo Mu into ash.</p><p></p><p>The second was a separation technique.</p><p></p><p>Completely separating the flowing blue water on the surface of Duo Mu from its main body.</p><p></p><p>Duo Mu would then fall apart on its own, transforming from a terrifying monster into pure Wood and Water elements in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The separation technique was not only effective against Duo Mu but also outstanding when dealing with other merged elemental monsters.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was too obscure, and only a few cultivators were proficient in it.</p><p></p><p>Most people had to rely on conventional elemental techniques.</p><p></p><p>Summarizing the tactics of the battles, the cultivators were more adept at handling the monsters that emerged in the Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, most cultivators still harbored worries.</p><p></p><p>On that day, another piece of withered wood fell and transformed into a creature that resembled a mix of human and beast, launching an attack towards Li Fan and his group.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, Yan Hang and the rest moved to intercept.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan set up formations and observed the battle between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the first one I saw, these Duo Mu have indeed made significant progress in their combat methods and skills."</p><p></p><p>"These individuals separated from the inverted trees seem to possess a collective consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Watching the intense battle not far away, Li Fan was secretly alarmed.</p>

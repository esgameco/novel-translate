        <h1>Chapter 488</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"It's as if there is some extraordinary treasure inside."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes lit up as he whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not afraid of them, it's better to be polite and avoid conflict, so I just left obediently." Li Fan said, rubbing his chin.</p><p></p><p>"The Garrison Court..."</p><p></p><p>As an elite armed organization only present in several states within the Wanxian Alliance, it was indeed strange for them to block and excavate the remnants of the Medicine King Sect. Could it be that his initial statement of "Tianxuan locks spirits, Xuanhuang unifies" had caused cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance to speculate about the future, leading to the imminent return of the Medicine King True Cauldron to the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>"What is Jiao Dao friend's opinion on this matter? Is it related to the possible opportunity involving the Little Medicine King Cauldron that I foresaw earlier?" After some thought, Li Fan looked at Jiao Xiuyuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>To Li Fan's surprise, Jiao Xiuyuan shook his head in denial.</p><p></p><p>"After returning, I inquired and found out that it is not just the remnants of the Medicine King Sect. The Garrison Court's cultivators have sealed off ancient sect remnants such as the Sky Sword Sect, Tai Shang Sect, and others that were located within the Wanxian Alliance territory."</p><p></p><p>"They don't allow anyone to approach, yet they are busy digging around inside for something."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's tone was somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>"I used a few puppets and sneaked in secretly. I found that they are not so much searching for objects as they are searching for people!"</p><p></p><p>"People?" Li Fan couldn't help but be stunned. "How do you know?"</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators inside the remnants all carry the 'Feeling Spirit Pearl.' This kind of spiritual artifact is extremely sensitive to the aura of life. Even if a cultivator is in a deep sleep with just a trace of vitality left, they can sense it." Jiao Xiuyuan said, then couldn't help but glance at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, "Are you suggesting that they might be searching for ancient cultivators like me who fell into a deep sleep thousands of years ago?"</p><p></p><p>"There is a ninety percent possibility." Jiao Xiuyuan asserted.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed strange..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance would not do anything without purpose. The fact that they are making such a big fuss clearly indicates a specific goal.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, they are certain that there is such an ancient dormant cultivator, but they are not sure of his exact whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"They only know that he is inside the remnants of various ancient sects, so they are searching in such a painstaking way."</p><p></p><p>"This person must be extremely important to the Wanxian Alliance, and..."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the Wanxian Alliance is looking for him must have something to do with my statement, 'Tianxuan locks spirits.'"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Li Fan did not come up with any clues.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Dao friend, did you really not dig out a Little Medicine King Cauldron?" He looked at Jiao Xiuyuan and suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Jiao Xiuyuan chuckled, "I couldn't hide it from you, my friend. Indeed, it wasn't without any harvest."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, my luck was not good. I had just unearthed one, and the Garrison Court's cultivators showed up."</p><p></p><p>"And, due to this incident, the prices of items unearthed recently from the sect remnants have skyrocketed."</p><p></p><p>"Many cultivators have already come to inquire about that Little Medicine King Cauldron, so..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan looked at Li Fan, his eyes filled with three words, "pay more money."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan simply waved his hand, "Since this thing is so sought after, let's forget about it. Jiao Dao friend, just handle it yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan to negotiate the price, he directly gave up.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiao Xiuyuan was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Li Fan friend, are you really not reconsidering..."</p><p></p><p>"A gentleman cherishes the beauty of others and doesnâ€™t take what they value! It's just a small opportunity. Why would I miss it?" Li Fan casually refused Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiao Xiuyuan's shocked expression, Li Fan added, "However, the matter you mentioned about the Wanxian Alliance searching for ancient cultivators has piqued my interest."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe this person could be an old acquaintance of mine."</p><p></p><p>"I know that you are well-informed, so please inquire for me!" Li Fan's gaze was sharp as he looked at Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Little Medicine King Cauldron, let's forget about it. Do you promise not to deceive me on this matter again?" Li Fan glanced at the three characters "Qianli Hall" hanging outside the house and spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, rest assured! I, Jiao Xiuyuan, will not tarnish my reputation!" Jiao Xiuyuan, knowing his fault, reiterated.</p><p></p><p>"In that case..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was about to nod and say something else, a commotion suddenly came from outside the house.</p><p></p><p>The two men exchanged glances and sensed an unusual atmosphere. They silently stopped their conversation and went outside.</p><p></p><p>On Wanxian Island, the towering statue of the Law-Transmitting Celestial Lord was emitting a radiant light, piercing through the sky.</p><p></p><p>The island defense formation was already activated at some point.</p><p></p><p>Outside the protective barrier, a huge purple gate stood tall.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders' Guild?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Jiao Xiuyuan both exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Are they out of their minds? Declaring war on the Wanxian Alliance completely?" Jiao Xiuyuan's tone was full of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this surprise attack by the Five Elders' Guild was extremely secretive, catching even Jiao Xiuyuan, who had eyes and ears all over the cultivation world, off guard.</p><p></p><p>What had happened?</p><p></p><p>Why was the current Five Elders' Guild the first to provoke a war?</p><p></p><p>Their target was not the Five Elements Sanctuary, but this Wanxian Island?</p><p></p><p>In a moment, Li Fan's thoughts shifted.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Dao friend, have the other state cities also been attacked by the Five Elders' Guild?" After a moment, Li Fan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No. Only Wanxian Island, shrouded in clouds, is the target of the Five Elders' Guild this time." After a pause, Jiao Xiuyuan replied, still full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly, feeling somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The two fell silent one after another, just looking up at the battle unfolding in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The two Nascent Divinity Immortal Monarchs of the island had been transferred to the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, indicating the island's defense was somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>They dared not confront the enemy directly but barely held on with the help of formations.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they hoped for reinforcements from elsewhere to arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>However, the Five Elders' Guild seemed well-prepared, not only rendering the teleportation formations ineffective.</p><p></p><p>They seemingly blocked communications, making it impossible to relay messages.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Wanxian Island began to fall into a disadvantaged position, and the cultivators witnessing the battle on the island all had pale faces.</p><p></p><p>Having enjoyed peace for so long, they had never seen such a large-scale battle.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, to everyone's surprise, when the Five Elders' Guild finally gained the absolute upper hand and broke through the defense formation.</p><p></p><p>They did not choose to invade the island but instead set up formations directly in the sky above Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Threads of light descended from the central formation above, then shot towards the edges of the island.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven-and-Earth Shifting Formation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Jiao Xiuyuan exclaimed in surprise once again.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Five Elders' Guild planning to move the entire Wanxian Island?"</p>

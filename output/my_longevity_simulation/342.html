        <h1>Chapter 342</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Hehe, the Five Elders have spent a lot of effort trying to retrieve the remains of the Qinglian Immortal these past few years."</p><p></p><p>"For example, the 'Ceasefire Stele' of the ancient Heavenly Sword Sect. It's said that back then, there were two giant stones erected in front of the sect's entrance. One was engraved with 'Idlers Halt', while the other read 'Arrivers Cease Hostilities'. Just these two giant stones alone were equivalent to endless protective formations for the mountain. Truly an imposing sight."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Divine Treasure Pavilion only managed to collect this 'Ceasefire Stele'. The whereabouts of the 'Halt Stele' are unknown."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but think of his own 'Halt Fragment Stele'. </p><p></p><p>Could it be the same as the Heavenly Sword Sect's Halt Stele?</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was lost in thought, the words of the black-robed cultivator forcefully pulled his attention back.</p><p></p><p>"Right, speaking of the Divine Treasure Pavilion, one must mention the remains of the first cultivator infected by the Mortal Miasma. You may not be aware, but many cultivators are vying to seize these ordinary-looking bones. Their value is sky-high. The skull of his that is collected in the Divine Treasure Pavilion is actually placed in the most central position."</p><p></p><p>"When I first saw it, I thought it was the remains of some ancient powerful being. Tsk, who would've thought it belonged to an unlucky fellow."</p><p></p><p>"I really don't understand those guys, what's so great about collecting such a thing."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator seemed to get a bit excited when mentioning the Divine Treasure Pavilion, and started introducing the various collections inside to Li Fan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi and Ximen Yue listened with great interest and concentration.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's heart stirred. </p><p></p><p>"The remains of the first cultivator infected by the Mortal Miasma..."</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable One's storage ring contains one of his ribs. When Yin Shangren immolated himself, this rib somehow survived."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but become interested in the skull displayed in the Divine Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>When the black-robed cultivator paused in his speech, Li Fan asked: "May I ask senior, if one wants to visit the Divine Treasure Pavilion like that group just now, how should one go about it?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator smiled: "The Divine Treasure Pavilion is generally not open to outsiders. No matter how many contribution points you spend, it's not possible. If you want to apply for a visit to broaden your knowledge, and don't have any background or connections, the simplest method is to pass the assessment like I did before and become a dedicated guide for the Divine Treasure Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned, and exchanged glances with Han Yi and Ximen Yue.</p><p></p><p>"Why does the Divine Treasure Pavilion need dedicated personnel to provide explanations?" Ximen Yue asked in puzzlement. </p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator chuckled: "Why not have guides? Do you think it's enough to just stick a card in front of each exhibit?"</p><p></p><p>"Firstly, inside the Divine Treasure Pavilion, just like that main road you walked past in front of the Guardian Hall, the spiritual energy is in a dormant state. Even divine sense cannot leave the body. All exhibit information only has simple labels. Naturally, if you want to know the stories behind them, dedicated guides are needed."</p><p></p><p>"Also, do you have some misunderstanding about the size of the Divine Treasure Pavilion?" The black-robed cultivator laughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"What's stored inside are the collections of the entire Myriad Immortal Alliance over thousands of years. When I left, the number of exhibits was 384,756,784. Without someone to guide you, if ordinary people go in to visit, it's like finding a needle in a haystack. You simply won't be able to find the exhibits you want to see. And if you want to have a complete, wonderful visiting experience within a limited time, that's just a pipe dream."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, you also saw just now. What kind of people are visiting the Divine Treasure Pavilion? Without guides, what can they possibly glean from it."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator snorted coldly, leaving it at that.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the others all had expressions of having learned something.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the black-robed cultivator continued: "Of course, if you join the Myriad Immortal Alliance system and raise your merit rank to Yan level 30, you get one free visit every ten years."</p><p></p><p>"However, Yan level 30..." </p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator shook his head: "It's too difficult to advance. Even I haven't reached it now."</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked at Han Yi with a half-smile: "Of course, if little Han here cultivates well and breaks through to the Harmonious Dao realm, it won't be so troublesome. I believe you can just report it and enter."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi felt a bit awkward upon hearing this: "Senior is joking. The Harmonious Dao realm, even with a cultivation method, how could it be that easy."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator chuckled deeply and said no more.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the way was spent in silence.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator led Li Fan's group back to the platform where they first arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the task the Immortal Venerable entrusted to me is considered successfully completed. If fate allows, we'll meet again in the future."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then felt a strange force enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was being rejected by the surrounding space and was about to leave the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask how to address senior?" As he was leaving, Li Fan looked at the black-robed cultivator and inquired.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a nobody, what title could I have. When I'm a guide, I'm Guide Ding Yin. When I'm a leader, I'm Leader Black. That's all." The black-robed cultivator shook his head, not answering.</p><p></p><p>As the figure of Leader Black gradually disappeared before their eyes, Li Fan's group found themselves back in the Four Seasons Garden of Tianji Academy.</p><p></p><p>Their location was exactly the same as before they went to the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Han, now that you've been to the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters, do you know where it's located?" Li Fan looked at Han Yi and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi pondered for a moment before replying: "If I'm not mistaken, the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters is very likely located inside the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>However, Ximen Yue objected: "I think the Tianxuan Mirror just serves as a means of teleportation."</p><p></p><p>"If the headquarters is inside the Tianxuan Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"There are so many Tianxuan Mirrors in the world. Wouldn't that mean wherever there's a Tianxuan Mirror, that's where the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters is located?"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, what's the point of Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, Tianquan, and the central region existing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully considered this and felt that both of them made sense, so he played the role of peacemaker.</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, the three of them didn't dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>After thanking Extreme Success Immortal Venerable and bidding farewell, the three of them went to the Debate Tower in Tianquan Prefecture. Han Yi treated them to a hearty meal.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, all banquets must come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the three parted ways.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yue stayed in Tianquan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan and Han Yi traveled together to Yuandao Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a year later.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan finally mastered the entry level of the "Marvelous True Spirit Transformation Scripture".</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that I haven't refined a avatar yet. Now that I've mastered this divine technique, let's see how effective it is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suppressed his excitement, disguised himself, and headed straight outside Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>He dug out a secret chamber and with all the materials ready, Li Fan began the refinement.</p><p></p><p>After a while...</p><p></p><p>A mass of flesh and blood exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Why did it fail?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He then tried again.</p><p></p><p>It failed once more.</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, this situation is..."</p><p></p><p>"There's already an avatar of mine in the world?"</p>

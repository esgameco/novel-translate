Read the full chapter on novel69.com.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly being stared at by these cultivators who had previously ignored him, Li Fan's body also became somewhat stiff in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He stopped the meaningless low growling, slightly shifting his body, trying to escape from the attention of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>But he found that all the cultivators' gazes were following him as well.</p><p></p><p>This eerie scene made Li Fan's already still heart feel somewhat chilly.</p><p></p><p>Which in turn made him ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was becoming ruthless, picked up a stone and fiercely smashed it at the nearest Grand Dao Sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>Although the opponent only had the cultivation level of the Golden Core realm, at this moment, Li Fan's cultivation was completely sealed and was no different from an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't have been a match for the opponent.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivator, facing Li Fan's sudden attack, did not dodge or avoid.</p><p></p><p>Still, the huge stone split open his head.</p><p></p><p>With a thud, the person fell to the ground, fresh blood continuously oozing out from his already deformed skull.</p><p></p><p>But the disappearance of a life did not bring the slightest change.</p><p></p><p>The entire Grand Dao Sect still operated as before.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, come out and see me!" Li Fan roared.</p><p></p><p>Still, only numerous gazes gathered in response.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan went mad, picking up a stone and starting to attack the next Grand Dao Sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>After smashing to death hundreds of people in a row, Li Fan, panting heavily, finally collapsed, exhausted, on the ground. Find chapter 69 on novel69.com.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, lying on the ground, Li Fan was shocked to find that those cultivators who had been smashed into pieces by him had actually come back to life.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were calm, as if Li Fan's rampage just now was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his hands, then at the stone soaked in too much blood and now slightly dark, feeling somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Monsters... they are all monsters."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but murmur softly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, why would they be monsters?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a very familiar and pleasant voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly raised his head, following the direction of the voice.</p><p></p><p>However, what he saw made his scalp tingle and even made him nauseous.</p><p></p><p>Because the voice, no different from Zhao Sister's, was actually coming from a middle-aged, fat-bodied cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was so scared that he kept backing away, continuously moving further.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, don't you think I look beautiful now?"</p><p></p><p>The voice came from behind Li Fan again.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan turned around, this time he saw a young and beautiful female cultivator, with a charming look, staring at him affectionately, slowly speaking.</p><p></p><p>"You used to see my previous face every day. After looking at it for hundreds of years, you must be fed up with it. Isn't it a good change?" Another enchanting older female cultivator approached slowly. She pressed her well-shaped body close to Li Fan, whispering softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned his head and shivered uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Because the face of the other person belonged to Senior Apprentice Sister Qingxi from the Grand Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, have you longed for the taste of the sect leader's wife for a long time? Didn't you ask me to transform into her appearance before? This time, it's me personally accompanying you, junior brother, aren't you moved?" She licked Li Fan's earlobe and whispered softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan trembled slightly, rejecting the other's advances.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan suddenly pushed her away.</p><p></p><p>Fleeing in a panic.</p><p></p><p>But soon, many charming and graceful female cultivators kept flocking towards him.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes all filled with affection, wanting to ascend to Paradise with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>And what they said all carried the seductive tones and teasing of Zhao Sister.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I understand now. Junior brother, do you find playing not exciting enough?"</p><p></p><p>"It's okay; I can let all the female cultivators of the Grand Dao Sect accompany you."</p><p></p><p>"Among them, there are many sisters, sisters-in-law, even mothers and daughters, and master-disciples as well..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan about to be overwhelmed by the ocean of female cultivators made of flesh, he suddenly gave up struggling.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want Madam Qingxi, and I don't want the sisters. I just want my apprentice sister."</p><p></p><p>"Give my apprentice sister back to me..."</p><p></p><p>Like a child who has lost everything, Li Fan was heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>As he wept, the surroundings slowly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the figures of the female cultivators kept disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, after a long time passed, only a figure in white clothes stood alone.</p><p></p><p>She approached Li Fan, squatting down gently.</p><p></p><p>Embracing Li Fan's sobbing and trembling body in her arms.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, you always seem like a child who never grows up."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body suddenly stiffened. He raised his head abruptly and saw the face clearly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Sister..."</p><p></p><p>"Good boy..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hugged Zhao Sister fiercely and began to seek from her passionately.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Sister did not reject Li Fan, regardless of his long entrapment, and the untidiness and peculiar smell on his body.</p><p></p><p>Bodies intertwined, souls harmonized.</p><p></p><p>"The Union of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>"We found four techniques in the ruins of the Xuantian Sect back then."</p><p></p><p>"Besides 'The Union of Heaven and Earth' that we cultivated together, my 'Soul-Splitting Divine Art' that I practiced and your 'Heaven Mourning Earth Wailing Scripture,' combined, make only three techniques."</p><p></p><p>"What is the remaining technique, I just can't remember."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, over these years, I have intentionally or unintentionally overlooked its existence."</p><p></p><p>"Sister, is it because of this technique that you've turned into this appearance?"</p><p></p><p>After a passionate moment, Li Fan's lust suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Turning cold in tone, he suddenly asked, "It shouldn't have been so."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he uttered the name of the technique: "'The Eternity of Myself Throughout the Ages.'"</p><p></p><p>"The Eternity of Myself Throughout the Ages..." Li Fan savored these four words, looking at the numerous people from the Grand Dao Sect reappearing, his eyes filled with complexity.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, is it worth it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Sister sneered, "Worth it? What's wrong with me now?"</p><p></p><p>"One is all, all is one. A thousand people with a thousand bodies, all myriad beings with one heart!"</p><p></p><p>"I've never felt better in this life!"</p><p></p><p>She straightened up, automatically wearing the garments of the Grand Dao Sect's leader.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, she sneered, "I am the only one, and I am the Grand Dao Sect!"</p><p></p><p>As if responding to her call.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Grand Dao Sect, all the cultivators at this moment spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>"We are, the Grand Dao Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a tremor in his heart, but his expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"Since when did this start, Ji Changxi?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"It was him." Zhao Sister nodded lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember when we submitted blood samples when we reported the Celestial Plague?"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, he noticed the traces of the Xuantian Sect techniques we practiced."</p>

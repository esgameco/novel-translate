        <h1>Chapter 656</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But how could Mr. Bai really give ordinary things to children when his casual words were a display of the profound skills of creating the universe?</p><p></p><p>Especially when Li Fan's gaze swept over Xu Ke, slightly releasing the killing intent in his heart, a sense of imminent danger suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood that if he really lost his reason and laid hands on Xu Ke...</p><p></p><p>Then the one who would die first must be himself.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Ke was completely unaware of the preciousness of this red string, feeling very happy in his heart just because it was Mr. Bai's gift.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, it's time." Lu Ya's gaze was profound, giving Xu Ke a last glance.</p><p></p><p>Then quietly flew out of the beast boat, cast a spell.</p><p></p><p>A dark light silently enveloped the flying boat, the beast boat broke through the void, rushing towards the unknown homeland.</p><p></p><p>Just as the flying boat left the mysterious yellow realm, Li Fan, standing above Xu Ke's head, felt that everything around him suddenly fell into absolute stillness in an instant. Then, like a photograph that had gone through the purification of time, the colors gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>It eventually turned into scattered stars, rumbling as it shattered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that it was due to his resolve to deal with the fate of the Xuanvian bird and complete the "Change of the Beast Sect."</p><p></p><p>However, unlike before, Li Fan did not return directly to the real world. But he returned to the distorted transparent bubble he was in after entering the Immortal Fall Realm this time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked ahead, where a new light and shadow emerged.</p><p></p><p>In the rapidly changing scenes, one could vaguely see a giant stone sword standing upright in a huge spiral fissure downward. Thousands of cultivators gathered around it like ants, fervently using the power of the blazing fire to continuously refine various materials.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like a new plot is unlocked. This seems to be..."</p><p></p><p>"'Heavenly Sword Sect', 'Division of the Broken Realm Weapon'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, due to just leaving the Immortal Fall Realm, he seemed unable to enter this brand new scene at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Only can wait for the next time."</p><p></p><p>In the passing glare of light, countless cultivators shuttled back and forth, leaving streaks of light. But the Broken Realm weapon stood toweringly, appearing increasingly majestic as time passed.</p><p></p><p>As if possessing a special kind of magic, Li Fan stared at it for a long time before eventually shifting his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the other two lights, although they belonged to the type that had already been "cleared," they gave Li Fan a slightly different feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Yuan obtains the Life Fruit" was like a brightly shining sphere that radiated pure light all around.</p><p></p><p>While "Change of the Beast Sect" only illuminated a small part, with the majority still hidden in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, "Perhaps Little Black's obsession is also like Senior Brother Zhang's original obsession, just concealed on the surface. The true master of the Time and Space of the Beast Sect may be someone else."</p><p></p><p>The experiences he had in the Immortal Fall Realm were cut and integrated into a complete segment; Li Fan carefully reflected on them.</p><p></p><p>Until the surrounding distorted space became unstable, but still no clues were found.</p><p></p><p>With the bubble shattering, Li Fan returned to the real world. At the same time, a black feather appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The remains of the Xuanvian bird..."</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the feather of the Xuanvian bird, there was a quick flash of memories from the moment.</p><p></p><p>Those were the events that truly occurred with Little Black in the past.</p><p></p><p>Just like what Li Fan did, Little Black had confidence in itself, ignoring Xu Ke's advice and insisting on participating in the "Ring of Unity" test.</p><p></p><p>However, being a demon beast, it did not have the serendipitous experience of carrying the Immortal Heart Mantra within itself like Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Without any miracles happening, the inevitable result was that it failed the test of the "Ring of Unity," where it must never harm its master.</p><p></p><p>Originally, awaiting Little Black was the fate of being collectively put to death like many other demon beasts. However, under Xu Ke's earnest plead, Lu Ya felt compassion. In the end, an exception was made to spare its life.</p><p></p><p>But to prevent leaks, Lu Ya asked Di San Mao to take action, exiling it to a desolate small world, unable to leave for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, we will meet again for sure."</p><p></p><p>With a tearful farewell, Xu Ke said affectionately.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanvian bird also felt sad and let out mournful cries. However, it understood that without the constraints of the True Beast Formula, it truly could not control the violent intentions in its heart. If it insisted on staying by Xu Ke's side, it might end up harming him instead.</p><p></p><p>Forcing itself to stay calm, it reached out its wings and patted Xu Ke's head to console him.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, the next time we meet, it will definitely be a long time later. We have grown up, will you recognize me then?" Xu Ke's expression was somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>Just as Little Black was about to mock Xu Ke for his seemingly foolish worry, it suddenly saw him pat his head and take out a drop of his own blood.</p><p></p><p>Putting it into a brown jade bottle, Xu Ke handed it solemnly to Little Black.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take this. Don't forget about me." Although his young face turned somewhat pale, Xu Ke still smiled valiantly.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanvian bird let out a cry, swallowing the brown bottle into its stomach.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Xu Ke, Little Black was then banished by Di San Mao's spell to a desolate small world.</p><p></p><p>The scene shattered, and the memory stopped there.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the small world where Han Yi had mistakenly entered, a place where many hybrid beings existed.</p><p></p><p>"So, that fallen Xuanvian bird must be Little Black."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Xu Ke's drop of blood is still there."</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline of the Imperial Family, manipulating the power of bizarre beasts..."</p><p></p><p>A plan began to take shape in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>People from the Empire, like Xiao Qing and Li Chenfeng, were very cautious.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time Li Fan intervened, saying that a great war was imminent in the Mysterious Yellow Realm and calling for a pause in trading for a while, they had all withdrawn and vanished.</p><p></p><p>According to the final surveillance footage of Wu Xiang Shaji, it seemed they had temporarily returned to the Empire.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't tried making a clone using a cultivator's blood yet. If Xu Ke's drop of blood is still there, perhaps it could give Xiao Qing and the others a little 'surprise.'"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, but after a while, he temporarily pushed down this idea and carefully examined the "Remains of the Xuanvian Bird."</p><p></p><p>Aside from the feather, the gains from this Immortal Fall Realm also included some memories about Little Black's original life cultivation technique, "The Fate Is Within Me."</p><p></p><p>Although he did not possess the bloodline of the Xuanvian bird, if he were to borrow this feather, it could still produce a certain effect.</p><p></p><p>Placing the "Remains of the Xuanvian Bird" into his body, a familiar feeling surged up in Li Fan, just like when he was practicing with the possessed Xuanvian bird.</p><p></p><p>His perspective suddenly rose, observing his own fortune.</p>

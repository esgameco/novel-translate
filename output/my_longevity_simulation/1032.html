            <p>Chapter 1030: Instant Ascension and Locked Darkness</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was just one step away from finally comprehending that divine ability, yet he remained stuck at this threshold for another half a month.</p><p></p><p>It was to ensure that his state of mind would not be affected by the Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"A gentleman is not born differently, but is good at borrowing from things."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had achieved enlightenment, slowly chanted. His figure flashed and instantly appeared outside the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>With his newly formed divine ability, Li Fan wanted to find a suitable place to test its power.</p><p></p><p>"This 'Borrowing the Dao' technique has a similar ingenuity to my 'Formless Killing Intent'. Both borrow the mandate of heaven for use. Although one can borrow the authority of heaven and earth, there is also the risk of being discovered and suffering heavenly punishment."</p><p></p><p>"For the first test, I must find a place where the Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm is relatively weak."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan's figure turned into a dotted line in the air, heading straight for the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Congyu Sea is an area where the remnants of the Tianfa Realm have not yet completely fused with the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Like a splinter stuck deep in flesh and blood, the Xuanhuang Realm can only thoroughly integrate it through the Chiyan Burning Sea after a number of years, giving it a major cleansing.</p><p></p><p>In the Congyu Sea, the Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm is much weaker compared to the native states.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan arrived at an uninhabited sea area.</p><p></p><p>Standing above the clouds, he held his breath and concentrated, then unleashed this newly comprehended "Borrowing the Dao" technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the world in Li Fan's eyes changed.</p><p></p><p>Just like returning to the "Root of Heaven and Earth", countless horizontal and vertical thin lines formed the myriad things of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the giant net had to follow the rules of the thin lines to operate.</p><p></p><p>That is the existence known as the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's physical body seemed to vanish into thin air. His mental consciousness slowly merged into this giant net.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the pressure from countless vertical and horizontal thin lines almost tore Li Fan's soul apart. In this fleeting moment, Li Fan caught a glimpse of countless fundamental laws of the operation of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He also seemed to see countless events happening within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the fusion with the great Dao of heaven and earth only lasted for that instant. It was actively stopped by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Because if this continued, his soul would be torn into countless pieces due to being unable to bear this tremendous power, and then merge into these countless laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps a Dao Li would be born in the future, but that would no longer be Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After withdrawing from the state of fusion with heaven and earth, Li Fan took advantage of the profound and mysterious epiphany that had not yet faded from his mind, and once again operated the "Borrowing the Dao" technique.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not reach the point of his soul merging with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He only tried to connect those crisscrossing thin lines of laws between heaven and earth to his own body.</p><p></p><p>With each thin line he touched, Li Fan felt as if a huge mountain was pressing down on his head.</p><p></p><p>The Wuji Yingxu along with the Ranhun Method were operated to the extreme to alleviate the burden on his body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept connecting the thin lines of laws into his own body.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan felt that he had reached the limit of what his body could bear, only then did he stop continuing to connect.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the weight of the principles of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan only felt as if he was pressed under the Five Elements Mountain, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Only when personally and practically coming into contact with the magnificence of heaven and earth could one truly feel how terrifying the great power of heaven and earth is.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Life Realm is about taking these mountains..."</p><p></p><p>"Overthrowing and reversing the laws of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm still a bit far from that."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he suppressed this thought for now.</p><p></p><p>He began to sense his own state.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't move, Li Fan's field of vision was now broader than ever before.</p><p></p><p>He could see more and further than when he had used the Canghai Pearl to observe the changes of the Congyun Sea turning from mulberry fields into the sea.</p><p></p><p>From a lofty vantage point, the five states surrounding the Congyun Sea were all under Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The living beings were like ants, all in plain sight.</p><p></p><p>In his ears, many unintelligible whispers arose.</p><p></p><p>They did not come from some unspeakable monster, but from the self-operating mechanism of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The so-called great Dao has no sound.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth are like a constantly running, very precise machine. In the process of the evolution of heaven and earth, it will also continuously emit its own roaring sound.</p><p></p><p>However, ordinary people cannot perceive it at all. Only those who have become a part of the great Dao of heaven and earth, like Li Fan, can hear a little from the chaotic sounds of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Since he was in the Congyun Sea, upon careful discernment, Li Fan found that the vast majority of these whispers were about the evolution of the Congyun Sea's heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious of these was the Chiyan Fenhui (Burning Flame Scorching Sea) that was brewing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also heard the arrangements of heaven and earth regarding Qingfeng Kunjian (Green Wind Trapping Sword).</p><p></p><p>But what surprised Li Fan a little was that the heavenly sound of Qingfeng Kunjian only ranked third among this cacophony.</p><p></p><p>And the second...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cast his gaze towards the source of the indication.</p><p></p><p>It was the dark depths far below Wanxian Island, a place still obscured even from the perspective of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Tongyu Tunnel Entrance?"</p><p></p><p>A term instantly surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th lifetime, the entire Wanxian Island was taken away by the Five Elders Society. The Tongyu Tunnel Entrance below Wanxian Island was exposed as a result.</p><p></p><p>As the acting city lord, he received the task of rebuilding the immortal city. At the same time, under the order of the First Regulation, he laid down the Xuantian Locking Formation to block the Tongyu Tunnel Entrance again.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that with the continuous expansion of the Tongyu Tunnel Entrance, the suppression of Wanxian Island has long begun to slowly lose its effect."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is also the reason why strange phenomena often appear in the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth have already begun to deal with it silently without any cultivators noticing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The style of the Xuantian Locking Formation was extremely similar to that of the ancient Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>According to the relevant information Li Fan searched for in the Tianxuan Mirror, they were indeed inherited from the ancient Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, with Li Fan's current understanding of formations, he could see at a glance that although this formation was unconventional, it obviously had not reached the level of an immortal-rank formation.</p><p></p><p>It was even far inferior to the Life and Death Reversal Formation.</p><p></p><p>"The strange phenomena are born from the fusion of the Xuanhuang Realm with other cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>"During the time of the Xuantian Sect, this formation already existed. It shows that at that time, the Xuanhuang Realm had already begun to capture other worlds using the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation, and strange phenomena had begun to appear."</p><p></p><p>"But the level of the formation also indicates that the strange phenomena were not serious at that time. This rough formation was sufficient to deal with it."</p><p></p><p>"However, with the increasing number of worlds being integrated, this Xuantian Locking Formation..."</p><p></p><p>"Seems a bit stretched."</p><p></p><p>Using the spare computing power of the Separation Disk in his mind, Li Fan deduced a brand new Locking Formation with ten times stronger sealing ability in almost a breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, "After so many years, the Wanxian Alliance is still complacent and treats thousand-year-old antiques as treasures."</p>

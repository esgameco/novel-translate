        <h1>Chapter 415</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the past, Li Fan's bold and ambitious words in the abyss of gambling destiny seemed vividly in front of Emperor Fu Song's eyes. But this cultivator, who was extremely ambitious and seemed to have a strong background, unexpectedly died just like that. </p><p></p><p>Only had time to hurriedly leave behind an incomplete death letter, then vanished suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Emperor Fu Song was first deeply moved, but then couldn't help but feel a wave of doubt.</p><p></p><p>"This guy, doesn't seem like someone who would die so easily..."</p><p></p><p>He squinted his eyes and approached Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>He carefully examined it again.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>"He's really dead."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fu Song's face showed complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Death is not a bad thing. Saves me from having to deal with the complications from above, and figure out what to do with you." </p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the storage ring in Li Fan's hand, recalling the contents of the death letter Li Fan had sent, causing a stir in Emperor Fu Song's heart.</p><p></p><p>"I have cultivated for less than a hundred years, made only two or three true friends."</p><p></p><p>"He Zhaozhao is one, Xue Mu is one, and Emperor Fu Song counts as half."</p><p></p><p>"Even though I'm dead now, I leave behind a million contributions, a lifespan fruit, and several spirit stones and magical instruments."</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, feel free to take what you need."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This kid's fortune is really quite rich and somewhat intimidating."</p><p></p><p>"A million contributions are fine, but that lifespan fruit is really something good."</p><p></p><p>A hint of greed flashed in Emperor Fu Song's eyes, and he started to have thoughts of taking it all for himself.</p><p></p><p>Just then, there was a commotion and crying coming from outside the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li Fan, how could you suddenly die like this! How should I repay the favor from back then!"</p><p></p><p>A figure came to Li Fan's body, after a moment of identification, he confirmed it.</p><p></p><p>He then rushed forward, tightly hugged Li Fan's body, and wept loudly.</p><p></p><p>This person was dressed in the attire of the Guardian Camp, and the other cultivator with him, Emperor Fu Song also knew.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the Guardian Camp in Tianyun Prefecture, Daoist Jingxuan.</p><p></p><p>This person was originally under the command of Lu Junyi.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Junyi was promoted to the total commander of the Wanxian Alliance Guardian Camp, this person also rose rapidly in rank.</p><p></p><p>Although his position was higher than Emperor Fu Song's, the Guardian Camp and the Strategy Hall were not in the same department.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fu Song wasn't afraid of him.</p><p></p><p>Just out of courtesy, he gave a bow.</p><p></p><p>Jingxuan nodded, looked at Li Fan's body, and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>With the interference of the Guardian Camp, Emperor Fu Song's plan to monopolize Li Fan's inheritance fell through.</p><p></p><p>In accordance with the procedure, after several items in Li Fan's storage ring were checked and nothing unusual was found.</p><p></p><p>They were evenly split between Emperor Fu Song and He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>As for Xue Mu...</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fu Song said that this person recently tried to defect to the Wulao Association and was caught and killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Jingxuan investigated and confirmed this.</p><p></p><p>So he didnâ€™t inquire any further.</p><p></p><p>The 1.68 million contributions were Li Fan's lifelong savings.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao got a whole million, while the rest went to Emperor Fu Song.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, the lifespan fruit belonged to Emperor Fu Song.</p><p></p><p>And the many spirit stones and magical instruments were divided among He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Except for a broken formation disc, the rest of the items were not very valuable.</p><p></p><p>Both Emperor Fu Song and He Zhenghao were satisfied with the division of the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing Li Fan's body being cremated, the two went their separate ways.</p><p></p><p>Returning to Tianyun Prefecture, He Zhenghao, who had become rich overnight, felt a bit sentimental and lost.</p><p></p><p>He remembered the contents of Li Fan's will.</p><p></p><p>"... I have something that I have been hiding from my friend."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I am not a cultivator from Yuandao Prefecture, but just a mortal from a small world."</p><p></p><p>"Ha, but I'm sure you wouldn't mind those mortals from back then."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, He Zhenghao couldn't help but blush.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had helped smuggle in more than a thousand mortals from other worlds.</p><p></p><p>And with his personality, how could he care about how those mortals look.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out that Li Fan and I had such a connection."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he has always looked after me so much. Everything makes sense now!"</p><p></p><p>"Just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, He Zhenghao couldn't help but lament with regret, sorrow flooding through.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he remembered Li Fan's dying request.</p><p></p><p>"After the departure of Lishou Prefecture, I hope to be taken care of more."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao looked at the inheritance he had just received, hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, he sighed, took out a large part of it.</p><p></p><p>Took a leave of absence, changed his appearance, and headed straight for Lishou Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng was very vigilant towards the inexplicable arrival of the Wanxian Alliance cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, the many spirit stones and magical instruments sent by the other party were not fake.</p><p></p><p>The person even claimed to be entrusted by the deceased.</p><p></p><p>After much consideration, Xiao Heng thought it might be the legacy of the senior disciple, so he accepted them calmly.</p><p></p><p>As for He Zhenghao's side, according to Li Fan's will, these out-of-world people not only did not join the Wanxian Alliance, but seemed to have joined a mysterious organization.</p><p></p><p>To avoid any connection with them, He Zhenghao just handed over the inheritance and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, in the 41st year, the broken formation jade plate transformed by Li Fan successfully arrived in Xiao Heng's hands through He Zhenhao.</p><p></p><p>None of the out-of-world people were proficient in formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>They had treated it as an ordinary broken formation artifact and kept it in the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng handed the broken formation jade plate and other three artifacts to Han Wuyong as a gift.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyong was extremely fond of the broken formation jade plate, keeping it with him at all times, nurturing it with his heart and blood day and night.</p><p></p><p>In the 46th year, Han Wuyong broke through to the mid Foundation Building stage.</p><p></p><p>In the 51st year, a loud and resentful roar suddenly resounded in the distant Yuanyuan Prefecture, echoing through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Echoing continuously for several days.</p><p></p><p>People were shocked to find out that the owner of the voice was none other than the long-deceased Blue Feather Immortal.</p><p></p><p>After seven days, the voice dissipated. The Blue Feather Immortal did not appear again.</p><p></p><p>In the 55th year, a strange phenomenon occurred.</p><p></p><p>Threads of green lines were densely spread across the sky.</p><p></p><p>It lasted for three months before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>People were fearful but had no idea what was happening.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 928</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The people of the south are skilled in defensive warfare and naval battles, but slightly inferior in other forms of combat. Although there are exceptions of those adept at offensive field battles, they are often special cases and require famous generals to lead and adapt to local conditions.</p><p></p><p>The Du brothers were likely not the choice of famous generals, and the battles in Xinxing and Nanyang commanderies ended very quickly. Not long after Linghu Yanbao led his troops away, Zhao Jingzhi, who had joined the expedition, swiftly returned with news of victory.</p><p></p><p>The elite cavalry of Jingzhou was the first to reach the northern bank of the Han River opposite the city of Xinxing commandery, causing the garrison in the city to be alerted and on guard, urgently transferring troops from nearby forts to help defend the city.</p><p></p><p>When the personnel and horses transporting supplies from Xiangyang arrived, the garrison did not take precautions, but instead mistook them for reinforcements and let them into the city to help defend, naturally resulting in the fall of the city and the demise of its people.</p><p></p><p>After the Xiangyang forces captured Xinxing commandery city, they immediately used boats to ferry the Jingzhou troops across to the south. After the two forces joined, they attacked upstream to Nanyang commandery city and captured it after a brief battle.</p><p></p><p>By the time Zhao Jingzhi returned to report the victory, the situation in the two commanderies had basically stabilized, and the expeditionary forces could return after a few more days of thorough pacification within the territory.</p><p></p><p>Due to this sudden attack and the very rapid conclusion of the battles, many people in the two cities were preserved and not too scattered by the war.</p><p></p><p>According to the household registers found in the government offices of the two cities, there were more than 3,000 registered households in these two commanderies. Even if some had dispersed, the final population obtained would definitely exceed the registered number. This was because the population under the protection of the powerful clans in Southern Liang was no less than in the north, and many of their retainers and subordinates were not registered.</p><p></p><p>When Li Tai learned of this news, he couldn't help but smile from ear to ear. Now his Jingzhou had a hundred things waiting to be done, and what it lacked most was population!</p><p></p><p>Although he had previously lost to Xiao Tong, the emperor's third generation, in a competition of wealth, Li Tai was not poor either. </p><p></p><p>The resources he could mobilize and deploy far exceeded those of Xiao Tong, especially the production bases and commercial networks he had intentionally developed in recent years in Guanzhong, northern Shaanxi, Longyou and other places. Any single one of them, if taken out, would far exceed the value of the floating wealth accumulated by Xiao Tong.</p><p></p><p>Although the Nanyang Basin was now extremely desolate, its natural resources and geographical location had not disappeared as a result, and still had great potential value. To quickly tap into this value, people were necessary.</p><p></p><p>As the end of the year approached, some smaller-scale water conservancy projects had also been completed, waiting only for the flood season next spring to test their effectiveness before acceptance. By then, large tracts of ownerless wasteland would emerge, and the sooner they were reclaimed, the faster the benefits could be reaped.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Tai had a series of policies to be implemented targeting the local powerful clans and their retainers, the staged effectiveness was still unknown, and he naturally hoped to have a definite increase in population.</p><p></p><p>During this period, as the administrative capacity within the territory gradually improved with the elimination of commandery and county officials, Li Tai even wanted to register the barbarians as households and grant them land.</p><p></p><p>But it was not that he was engaging in any kind of racial discrimination. Whether in terms of production skills, social organization, or living customs, very few of the barbarians could meet the standards for household registration.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that household registration meant granting land, which required bearing corresponding rent, taxes, levies, and corv√©e labor. Only by satisfying these could one be considered a qualified equal-field household.</p><p></p><p>The barbarians were unfamiliar with farming and weaving skills in the first place, and the harvest from the allocated fields might not even be enough to feed themselves. The degree of personal dependence on superiors was strong, and even if there was any income, it had to be presented to the chieftains and leaders rather than paid as taxes to the government. Moreover, they were scattered in the mountains and wilderness, and quick to leave. One moment they were registered as households and granted land, and the next moment they would disperse in an uproar, completely making a mockery of it all.</p><p></p><p>Barbarian groups often needed to migrate to the plains for several generations to adapt to farming before they met the conditions for household registration and land allocation. Even if they were registered as households for the sake of short-term political achievements, they would often flee and disperse at the slightest natural or man-made disaster.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the barbarians, it was basically group-based recruitment and employment, and their individual value was not high. Even if there was, they could only be used as slaves and could not undertake more complex social division of labor and production.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the social environment remained stable for a long time, with sufficient production and living resources in the region, coupled with the government's supporting education and guidance policies, the civilizing period of the barbarians could be greatly shortened, and they could quickly become no different from the Han people.</p><p></p><p>However, at present, Jingzhou under Li Tai's governance did not yet have the foundation for large-scale recruitment and assimilation of barbarians, whether in terms of people's livelihood or other aspects.</p><p></p><p>So for now, to increase the registered household population directly under the jurisdiction of the prefecture and commandery governments, it was more reliable to obtain them from the south, through captives of war, attracting them with policies, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the latter required a longer period, but it was not impossible either. Many of the common people between the Yangtze and Han rivers had fled to the other side of the Mian River, and they might not have completely lost their yearning for their ancestral homeland.</p><p></p><p>Although there had been no large-scale military disasters in Southern Liang's territory for a long time, and society was stable and prosperous, this was in relation to the upper...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>For the upper class, the internal contradictions were perhaps even more acute than during the Song and Qi dynasties of the Southern Dynasties. After all, the power struggles at the top were constant in the Song and Qi dynasties, and the ruling class was constantly being eliminated and changed.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Liang had the old Bodhisattva pressing down, and the political environment at the top tended to be stable. The filial sons and virtuous grandsons also grew up strong. Although social productivity was developing and total wealth was increasing, the distribution method was becoming increasingly corrupt. Through a series of financial means such as coinage and taxation to squeeze the people's interests, and the monk groups grew stronger year by year, which also became a heavy social burden.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Hou Jing was able to respond to one call in the Southern Liang territory was also a clear manifestation of the acute internal contradictions to an extreme point. A large number of lower and middle-level soldiers and civilians would rather follow a wolf-hearted southern fugitive garrison soldier than continue to let the Xiao family ancestors and grandchildren draw blood.</p><p></p><p>As a Guanlong military leader who accompanied the rise of the Fubing system, Li Tai may not be a progressive class, but as a time traveler, he is always progressive in his ideas.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the captured population from the Southern Dynasties, he did not follow the previous usual practice of using the captured population as soldiers, slaves, and laborers for production. Instead, he treated them as civilians and directly registered them as households and granted them land.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Zhao Jingzhi returned, Linghu Yanbao and others also escorted the captives from the two counties back. Li Tai had already arranged for the prefectural and county officials to prepare for the registration of these captives. Although he treated these people preferentially, he did not give it to them for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Although the people were innocent, they were also the most blindly obedient. At least let them know that this preferential treatment was hard-earned, and then they would know how to cherish the life they had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when registering these captives, they must be allowed to confess their miserable lives in the Southern Liang and accuse the officials who abused them by name. This step seemed simple, but in fact, it was to break down their old authority in their hearts. If you think your previous life in the Southern Liang was still good, then there is no need to register households and grant land. Come here and continue to find happiness in misery.</p><p></p><p>The registered households were organized into li and lin, and personnel were selected from the previous batch of Fancheng soldiers and civilians to serve as li and lin leaders, responsible for leading these newly registered households to stabilize as soon as possible and prepare for the equal land production. And the previous accusation meetings had to continue, five days for one lin and ten days for one li. Only by attending enough times could they be granted land and issued agricultural tools, grain seeds, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Li Tai also dispatched prefectural officials to randomly participate in these lin and li mutual complaint meetings, recording the dark political events of the Southern Liang that the registered people talked about, and preparing to engrave these events in the villages after the land was granted and the villages were delineated, so that all the villagers could deeply feel the dark politics and miserable life of the Southern Liang. Comparing it with the current situation of farmers having land and stable life, they would naturally feel more emotional. The good life was all created by the Great Commander Li!</p><p></p><p>The rural construction and ideological transformation in Jingzhou were in full swing, but Xiangyang was relatively calm.</p><p></p><p>After the battle between the two cities ended, the Xiangyang side escorted the Jingzhou troops out of the border. Li Tai originally thought that Xiao Zhan would immediately send an envoy to discuss the next step, but he waited until the New Year came, and there was no news from the Xiangyang side, which made people puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What also made Li Tai a little puzzled was the Northern Expedition of the Southern Liang in the north of the Huai River. According to historical time calculations, it should have already had a result. He had specially sent someone to Wang Sizheng to inquire about the news before, but Wang Sizheng was not very clear about it either, only vaguely responding that the two sides seemed to be still in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Tai was resourceful, he ultimately had limited ears and eyes. In places he couldn't see, important things were also happening.</p><p></p><p>Far away in Jiankang City at the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the winter was warm and slightly cool but not harsh. Today, the crown prince Xiao Gang invited the scholars of the Wende Province to a banquet in the Xuanyou Hall of the Eastern Palace.</p><p></p><p>The crowd in the hall was already drunk and excited, showing an increasingly unrestrained demeanor. Various literary songs and chants, and profound discussions were endless. Literature and profound principles were the dominant learning in the Southern Dynasties, and the crown prince was also a master of it. He loved the unrestrained atmosphere in the hall and was not angry even if the scholars were slightly disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an old man strode into the hall from outside, causing the atmosphere in the hall to suddenly turn cold. Even those who were borrowing wine to be crazy and pretending to be unrestrained all sat upright at this time, not daring to be presumptuous anymore.</p><p></p><p>The old man's name was Liu Jin, who was the crown prince's chief counselor and the head of the Eastern Palace. He had a strong and unyielding character. Even the crown prince treated him with respect and did not dare to be disrespectful in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The crown prince was about to order a servant to set up a new seat for Liu Jin, but Liu Jin bowed and said, "There is an urgent message from Jiangling. Please move to another hall, Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the crown prince did not dare to delay. After entering another hall and quickly reading the letter sent by King Xiangdong from Jiangling, it said that King Yueyang Xiao Zhan abused his power and authority and was suspected of massacring the famous Du family in the territory. King Xiangdong earnestly requested the crown prince to support him to lead troops to Xiangyang for a thorough investigation.</p><p></p><p>After reading this letter, the crown prince's face suddenly changed, and he immediately said angrily, "Since the matter is so cruel, it should be reported to the Western Province! The Seven Officials abruptly told me, how can I respond to it?"</p>

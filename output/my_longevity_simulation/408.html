        <div class="content">
            <p>"If we wake them up ahead of time, it shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>"Once I gather enough cultivation methods..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fuchang was muttering to himself when he noticed Xiao Heng and others looking at him strangely.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but stop and ask, "What's wrong, Xiao Daoist friend? Is there something wrong with my plan?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng smiled bitterly, "Li Daoist friend, I'm afraid the current situation in the cultivation world is not as simple as you think."</p><p></p><p>Then, Xiao Heng explained the general situation of Wanxian Alliance and Wulao Hui, two organizations that virtually monopolize all cultivation methods in the world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fuchang's face immediately turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>If these people were not lying, then Wanxian Alliance and Wulao Hui were even more terrifying than the ten major sects back in the day.</p><p></p><p>Suxiaomei hurriedly added, "Wanxian Alliance is not a group of good people. If they know about the current situation of your Yaowang Sect, they will definitely not spare you for so many treasures and cultivation methods."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo also nodded, "The control Wanxian Alliance has over cultivation methods is truly terrifying. Especially the ancient methods you practice, they must be extraordinary. Reaching the realm of the Dao is definitely not a problem. With the style of Wanxian Alliance, they will not let such true methods go to waste. Once they get wind of it, they will definitely send out their Guardian Hall cultivators to retrieve them."</p><p></p><p>Based on their own image of Wanxian Alliance, the three of them vividly described the horror of Wanxian Alliance to Li Fuchang.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fuchang didn't fully believe it, he understood the principle that the innocent bear the guilt, nevertheless.</p><p></p><p>Letting him join Wanxian Alliance and entrusting the lives of hundreds of senior brothers and sisters to others was something he couldn't do.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he respectfully bowed to Xiao Heng and the others.</p><p></p><p>"I have been away from the Xuanhuang realm for thousands of years. The changes in the world are unfamiliar to me in many aspects. For the sake of the future well-being of my Yaowang Sect, I will trouble all of you for your assistance."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng repeatedly said he dared not refuse.</p><p></p><p>After settling matters in the Ding, Li Fuchang and Xiao Heng, along with the others, flew out of the Yaowang Ding.</p><p></p><p>Li Fuchang put away the Yaowang Ding.</p><p></p><p>Then they followed the same route back to Shilin State.</p><p></p><p>On the way, they flew low-key.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the magnificent celestial cities along the way and the many Wanxian Alliance cultivators in the cities, Li Fuchang became even more convinced of his judgment, becoming increasingly cautious.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>The Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>Guided by a leader, Li Fan had already arrived at this magnificent building.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as he was exploring, his steps slightly paused.</p><p></p><p>The guide in front of him looked at him with surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a place to rest here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked apologetically.</p><p></p><p>The guide, dressed in black, looked at the white-haired and elderly Li Fan, showing a look of understanding, then led him to a secluded space.</p><p></p><p>Simple in decoration, yet fully furnished with tables and chairs.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest here."</p><p></p><p>"When you wish to explore again, just contact me through this jade card engraved with the word 'Bingyin.'"</p><p></p><p>Handing the jade card to Li Fan, the guide quietly left.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, digesting the information relayed by Xiao Heng and the others.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Ruins?"</p><p></p><p>He squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It has an extremely strong attraction, devouring everything."</p><p></p><p>"It can even distort space-time. When you get close, a moment feels like a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Is this..."</p><p></p><p>"A black hole?"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, a force very similar to a black hole."</p><p></p><p>"Does the mysterious existence in the sky above Daoyuanzhou have any relation to the Immortal Ruins?"</p><p></p><p>In the process of sorting out the information, Li Fan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>"And the changes in the Xuanhuang realm after a cultivator's death."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, combining the information from Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>All the clues merged into one.</p><p></p><p>A logically consistent conclusion appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>To avoid the fate of the entire Xuanhuang realm being devoured by the Immortal Ruins, a certain level of "weight" needed to be maintained.</p><p></p><p>And cultivators were a crucial part of this "weight"...</p><p></p><p>When a large number of cultivators died, the Xuanhuang realm became lighter.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it was slightly drawn towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"If the number of cultivators in the Xuanhuang realm decreases to a certain extent, the entire Xuanhuang realm will irreversibly..."</p><p></p><p>"...plunge into the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, even the Heavenly Venerables may struggle to avoid the fate of destruction."</p><p></p><p>"This is why Jihong Dao's intimidating power comes into effect."</p><p></p><p>"A mutual destruction."</p><p></p><p>"This is also why 'the number of cultivators must not be too small.'"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced, thinking of Senior Sister Zhao's words and actions. He felt that this judgment was getting close to the truth.</p><p></p><p>But then the question arose.</p><p></p><p>Why do cultivators have this "weight"?</p><p></p><p>It's understandable for Heaven and Earth to have weight.</p><p></p><p>But how can a cultivator's physical body...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, as if a lightning bolt had cut through the fog, Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"But new law cultivators plunder the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>"They absorb the essence of Heaven and Earth, imitate the miracles of Heaven and Earth, peek into the laws of Heaven and Earth, seize the essence of Heaven and Earth, extract the marrow of Heaven and Earth..."</p><p></p><p>"They absorb a part of the world, transforming it into themselves."</p><p></p><p>"And naturally, they obtain the attribute of 'weight' of the world."</p><p></p><p>It's not very noticeable for cultivators below the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>But after reaching the Nascent Soul realm, they devour the "Cave Heavens" originally belonging to Heaven and Earth, transforming it into their own domain.</p><p></p><p>This further explanation was easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>"Cave Heavens..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'weight' of the world..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought of even more.</p><p></p><p>According to the observations of Li Fuchang from the Yaowang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Ruins in the sky above the Xuanhuang realm probably existed even before the spread of the new laws.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the ten major sects of immortality worked together to avoid the fate of being devoured by the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>What did the powerful cultivators who stood at the pinnacle of the cultivation world do back then?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the current situation in the Xuanhuang realm, a bold guess emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"When I first learned of the new path of cultivation from the 'Five Elements Sensing Qi Method,' I had doubts."</p><p></p><p>"How could cultivators plunder the heavens and earth in such a way and the world still endure for so long? It's truly incredible."</p><p></p><p>"After delving into the various secrets of the Xuanhuang realm, I had my doubts."</p><p></p><p>"The various 'Cave Heavens' and small worlds contained within the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"It seemed a bit excessive."</p><p></p><p>"Greater Xuan, detached realms, and countless subsidiary worlds. And one uniquely shaped Cave Heaven after another."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that these places might not have originally belonged to the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"And were 'captured' from the void by the cultivators of the ten major sects to avoid being devoured by the Immortal Ruins."</p>

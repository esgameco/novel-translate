        <h1>Chapter 662</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After the sound of silence, the crimson snowflakes in the world also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Is it just a coincidence, or is it his extraordinary fortune causing these auspicious signs?" </p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, the Scarlet Snow Fairy has always been watching Shao Feng, ensuring he doesn't make a misstep. Seeing him about to enter a dangerous situation, she intervenes?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent, then turned to look at the statue of Han Yishi.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he landed on the ground. Activating the "Fate Domain," he made his way there step by step.</p><p></p><p>His pace was extremely slow because Li Fan was carefully sensing the surrounding power fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>As he was currently very close to the state of being a "Person without Fate," he was particularly sensitive to changes in his own luck.</p><p></p><p>After taking about ninety steps forward, Li Fan suddenly sensed a flaw in the "Fate Domain." Like a cup with a hole in it, his almost non-existent luck was rapidly dissipating. After the last trickle was completely drained, a thick black energy began to swirl above him in Li Fan's vision.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt his heart beating wildly, as if a great calamity was about to befall him at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly stepped back while retrieving the luck stored in the "Fate Feather."</p><p></p><p>Even though his movements were swift, the changes brought by his luck were immediate. As he retreated, Li Fan stumbled and almost fell to the ground. He was a dignified Infant Transformation cultivator, the top tier of those who have condensed their own worlds.</p><p></p><p>How could he stumble while walking?</p><p></p><p>However, this inexplicable event did indeed happen.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not dare to hesitate. While concretely remembering the feeling he just had, he accelerated the rate of replenishing the dissipating luck.</p><p></p><p>By the time he stabilized his figure and retreated to a safe area, Li Fan found that he had expended nearly half of the luck stored in the "Feather of Fate" and only then managed to offset the black misfortune above his head.</p><p></p><p>"Just being this far from the statue consumed so much luck. This Luck Processing Statue is truly terrifying. Even someone like Shao Feng, with outstanding luck, would not be able to withstand it and would be completely drained. No wonder his mother took him away."</p><p></p><p>"It can't be countered by human effort, unless..."</p><p></p><p>"The Luck of the World."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred, suddenly thinking of the world where Xiao Hei fell.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly luck of that strange beast world had obviously been assimilated and integrated by Xiao Hei. But not long ago, due to unknown reasons, Xiao Hei fell. The heavenly luck shattered and scattered everywhere.</p><p></p><p>With Han Yishi's simple cultivation back then being able to absorb and control the wandering heavenly luck, Li Fan, with the "Feather of Fate," would surely be even more adept at absorbing the heavenly luck of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, a drop of Xu Ke's blood seems to be buried there. It seems I must make a trip."</p><p></p><p>"In that small world, there seem to be many powerful beasts hidden. In the past, with my Infant Transformation level of strength, venturing alone, I would have some concerns. But now..."</p><p></p><p>A gleam flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily leaving the Luck Processing Domain, he returned to Changsheng Valley and called for Liu San.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to speak and instruct him to lead some disciples of the Medicine King Sect into the small beast world to sweep and eliminate threats, Li Fan suddenly sensed something amiss and hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what's on your mind?" Liu San looked at Li Fan, feeling somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan retraced memories of the past events and suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>He had unknowingly forgotten about the calamity that befell the Cloud Mist Sea.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the Cloud Mist Sea looks like now, a desolate abyss or dried-up mountains?"</p><p></p><p>As thoughts raced through his mind, Li Fan's face showed a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"This time I went out, I discovered a horrific event."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Li Fan informed Liu San of the forgotten calamity that had befallen the Cloud Mist Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud Mist Sea?" Liu San seemed confused at first, but then remembered, showing a horrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing that due to our move to Changsheng Valley, by coincidence, we escaped that calamity," Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Liu San, however, focused on the fact that he had forgotten about the incident rather than the calamity itself.</p><p></p><p>"Does this new method of Changsheng have the power to make people forget about their worries without them even realizing?" Liu San, who was still stuck in the ancient impressions of the powerful figures in Changsheng Realm, was deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>As one of the strongest combined Dao practitioners of the Medicine King Sect, he had faced off against the Changsheng Celestials of the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>Never did he expect...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the pride in Liu San's heart was shattered layer by layer. The more he thought about it, the more fearful he felt, with drops of cold sweat appearing on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also noticed Liu San's abnormality and immediately spoke to comfort him, "Liu Lao, don't worry. The world changes over time. Although they share the title of Changsheng Celestial, it is evident that the Changsheng of today and the Changsheng of old are no longer of the same caliber."</p><p></p><p>Even though Liu San trusted Li Fan deeply, it took him quite some time to calm down.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, he sighed and then said to Li Fan, "Today, I finally understand the might of the new method of Changsheng. Before, I was just looking at the sky from the bottom of a well."</p><p></p><p>"The gap between the new and old methods is so significant..."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I wish to switch to the new method," Liu San solemnly said to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not surprised by Liu San's decision. He nodded in agreement, saying, "I support you! Liu Lao, your rekindled ambition and competitiveness are also fortunate for our Medicine King Sect. Maybe you will have a great enlightenment, and with the protection of the Changsheng Celestials, our Medicine King Sect will be able to reappear openly in the world."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone shifted, "Since the methods cannot be practiced simultaneously, if you wish to advance further, go against the natural principles, you will need to cultivate a different combined Dao technique."</p><p></p><p>"Firstly, the current techniques are not easy to attain, especially the combined Dao techniques. Secondly, the production of the Changsheng Pill also requires your supervision..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San instantly understood the implication in Li Fan's words. His once bold ambition dimmed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The disparity between his ideals and reality forced Liu San to make a choice.</p><p></p><p>But having been loyal to the Medicine King Sect, after hesitating for a moment, Liu San made his decision.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Young Master. Let's focus on the revival of the Medicine King Sect first," he said with a tinge of desolation.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan smile faintly, "Liu Lao, you've misunderstood me. I fully support your switch to new techniques. Moreover, your advancement in cultivation and the rise of the Medicine King Sect are not contradictory."</p><p></p><p>"It just requires a little time for preparation."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

            <p>Chapter 1051: The Sacrificial Offering, Xuantian Wang</p><p></p><p>"However, this may not be contradictory. The two half-immortal bodies may have both gained inspiration for a breakthrough during their confrontation with each other..."</p><p></p><p>"Both have the hope of truly shedding the shackles of mortals and achieving the status of immortals."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Master of Tiandu imitated the immortals of the Immortal Ruins and resonated with the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"As for Xuantian Wang..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind recalled the fragmented memories from the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"He encountered a mishap during his breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Regarding the end of how the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao instantly overthrew the Xuantian Sect back then, Li Fan had also asked Dan Xuan.</p><p></p><p>But this old fellow was vague.</p><p></p><p>He said he was not clear himself, and only muddleheadedly won the final victory of the war.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the Xuantian Sect also lost in a bewildering manner.</p><p></p><p>"Dan Xuan should be concealing something. But what can be certain is that in the destruction of the Xuantian Sect back then, there was a third force besides the Xuantian Sect and the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao participating in it."</p><p></p><p>"Enticing the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao to rebel, taking advantage of Xuantian Wang's idea of using the opportunity to eliminate the moles, going with the flow. Bringing about this great war."</p><p></p><p>"The final winner appeared to be the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao who obtained the ruling power of the immortal dao in the Xuanhuang Realm. But perhaps Xuantian Wang was their true target."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>Associating it with Mo Rubin's wariness towards the faceless true immortal statue, a bold guess instantly welled up in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that it was done by the fanatical believers of the Faceless True Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Wang who was about to become an immortal was the sacrificial offering they presented to the Faceless True Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>In these years of using the Faceless True Immortal statues to spread [Hongchen Cibei Xian], Li Fan could be said to have personally witnessed the faith of those cultivators slowly becoming firm, from nothing to something.</p><p></p><p>The essence of origin power could transform the decayed into the miraculous, realizing many things cultivators dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>Even in the casually established and not carefully managed Myriad Realms United Association by Li Fan, there was no lack of existences that were truly enchanted by the power of true immortals and offered their absolute loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Let alone in the ancient times when Faceless True Immortal statues were everywhere in the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xuantian Wang later discovered something was wrong and removed the statues from the main altar of the Xuantian Sect, how could the statues in the hearts of the cultivators be thoroughly cleaned?</p><p></p><p>Following a half-immortal whose attainment of the Dao was uncertain, or following a true immortal, and even possibly an existence of the [Nameless True Immortal] level...</p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of cultivators, they would probably choose the latter.</p><p></p><p>"So after Mo Rubin saw the statue I displayed, he lost trust in me."</p><p></p><p>Having restored the possible truth, Li Fan continued to deduce the whereabouts of Xuantian Wang.</p><p></p><p>"There are two possibilities. One is that he has already been devoured by the Faceless True Immortal as a ripe fruit, completely disappearing from the world. The power of the Faceless True Immortal still lingers in the Xuanhuang Realm, in anticipation of the emergence of the next fruit."</p><p></p><p>"The second is that the Faceless True Immortal's devouring failed. Xuantian Wang narrowly escaped. Those fanatical believers were then blamed by the enraged true immortal and disappeared without a trace, with no one knowing."</p><p></p><p>"The second possibility is slightly greater. After all, in the current Xuanhuang Realm, besides my lineage, the dao lineage of the Faceless True Immortal can no longer be found. If the sacrificial event back then had truly succeeded, the Faceless True--</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The immortals bestowed rewards, and having tasted the sweetness, they could not stop.</p><p></p><p>"The reason why Mo Rubin is so persistent in rescuing Tian Xuanjing, even willing to cooperate with me in this play, is probably because he has long been convinced that the Xuantian King is not dead. And Tian Xuanjing must know his whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>"Since they disappeared from the Wanxian Alliance headquarters that day, they have not appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm. The paper men of Duguo Sect have not seen them, and they have not shown up wherever Tian Xuanjing was present."</p><p></p><p>"They directly left the space of Tian Xuanjing's main body and appeared in another location."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems we need to find a way to meet with the Dharma Transmitter Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind once again focused on the white jade statue he had created.</p><p></p><p>Recording the sounds and blurry influences transmitted from the statue.</p><p></p><p>Comparing them with the files of the cultivators in Tian Xuanjing.</p><p></p><p>Trying to find a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the cultivators identified were those on the Wanxian Alliance's wanted list, people who were nominally dead.</p><p></p><p>But after more than ten days of uninterrupted monitoring by Li Fan, he actually found someone who had not been hunted by the Immortal Alliance and still maintained the identity of a normal cultivator within the system.</p><p></p><p>"What a daring move, not afraid of implicating the family..."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan thought so in his heart, after reviewing the life file of this cultivator, he found that this man named You Chisong...</p><p></p><p>might have done it on purpose.</p><p></p><p>You Chisong, a Yuanyuan cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The eldest son of the You family in Tianchen Province.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, he had the opportunity to advance to the Huashen realm.</p><p></p><p>However, his father gave the only "Change of Heaven and Earth" heard within the family to You Chisong's younger brother, You Chibi.</p><p></p><p>Shattering his hope of becoming a Huashen.</p><p></p><p>This move even gained the support of the vast majority of the You family.</p><p></p><p>Simply because You Chibi's aptitude was far better than You Chisong's.</p><p></p><p>It took You Chisong nearly a hundred years to form his Nascent Soul, even with sufficient resources.</p><p></p><p>While You Chibi only took a little over thirty years.</p><p></p><p>But You Chisong would not accept it!</p><p></p><p>Because he was the first to discover this information about the "Change of Heaven and Earth" and reported it to the family.</p><p></p><p>It should have been his, but it was forcibly taken away and given to his younger brother!</p><p></p><p>You Chisong's resentment was born from this.</p><p></p><p>And the bloody purge of the Wanxian Alliance gave him an opportunity to take revenge on his family.</p><p></p><p>By chance, he happened to meet the Dharma Transmitter Zhou rescuing people.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw this group of "rebels", the scheme of mutual destruction emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He immediately knelt down and begged to join.</p><p></p><p>Seeing You Chisong's sincerity, the Dharma Transmitter Zhou also conveniently brought him into his personal small world.</p><p></p><p>Originally, You Chisong indeed planned to confirm his identity as a rebel and then voluntarily report himself to the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, as he interacted with the Dharma Transmitter Zhou and learned about her deeds.</p><p></p><p>And through daily contact with his companions beside him, You Chisong's mentality gradually changed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the great mission of rectifying and purging the Wanxian Alliance, making the Dharma Transmitter return to her original intention, the trivial matter in the family concerning a Huashen cultivator was not worth mentioning at all.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he was blinded by hatred.</p><p></p><p>And now, You Chisong had a more lofty goal.</p><p></p><p>To return a bright and clear world to the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Combining what he heard from You Chisong's conversations these days.</p><p></p><p>And his life information, Li Fan easily inferred his mental journey.</p>

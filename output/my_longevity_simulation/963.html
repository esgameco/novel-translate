        <h1>Chapter 963</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's originally dim and broken eyes suddenly became filled with hope. </p><p></p><p>He said as if he had a sudden realization: "I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>"The only ancient and new dual Heavenly Venerated Ones in the Xuanhuang Realm, such supremely good and beautiful people..."</p><p></p><p>"Must also be extremely intelligent and outstanding individuals!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's voice grew louder and louder: "So that's how it is, so that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, after he successfully went against the principles and was damaged by the Immortal Miasma, he did not perish on the spot. Rather, his power gradually declined."</p><p></p><p>"This period of time was enough for him to arrange many backup plans! All the doubts and confusion may be able to find answers from these backup plans!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be like this!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan's heart stirred: "Mr. Bai's backup plans?"</p><p></p><p>He recalled his experiences in the Fallen Immortal Realm, with every scene related to what Mr. Bai went through back then. Very clearly, this was a kind of guidance. </p><p></p><p>Hidden in the Fallen Immortal Realm should ultimately be the true objective Mr. Bai wanted to convey.</p><p></p><p>And even...</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan thought of the 115th lifetime, just based on the traces he left between heaven and earth, a certain degree of resurrection could be realized.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if the real "Su Bai", through some method, could truly achieve rebirth thousands of years later in the present day?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering, the Yin Shangren in front of him became more and more crazed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed! He is still waiting for me! I must go seek him out!"</p><p></p><p>The central fissure in his body formed from cultivating the Self Foundation Method became more and more obvious. </p><p></p><p>The other body hidden inside Yin Shangren's body seemed eager to move, as if wanting to crawl out from within.</p><p></p><p>And by Li Fan's ears, the sound of pattering rain faintly started to ring out.</p><p></p><p>At first it was very subtle, like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly the rain grew heavier and heavier, like a torrential downpour flooding the earth!</p><p></p><p>In this illusory heavy rain, the originally stone floor of the lab also softened along with it.</p><p></p><p>It even turned muddy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan appeared calm on the surface, but had already floated into the air and continued to retreat back a bit.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the range of the muddy ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the countless arms wriggling and extending out from the ground, Li Fan's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>And Yin Shangren's body also started to twitch bizarrely without end. </p><p></p><p>His voice also became intermittent and unclear.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, those pale white arms, like fish swimming in water, rapidly surged towards Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>At the point of contact between the two, the arms dissolved.</p><p></p><p>Then they drilled into Yin Shangren's body.</p><p></p><p>"Puff..."</p><p></p><p>The sound of a water bubble popping rang out clearly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the myriad pale white arms continued to rapidly surge towards Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yin Shangren's body was like boiling water, continuously churning bizarrely. </p><p></p><p>Even the surrounding space started to distort a bit.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this startling and horrifying scene, Li Fan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Now he could be considered knowledgeable and experienced, with power rivaling Harmonized Dao experts. But at this moment, the strange phenomena occurring to Yin Shangren was something he had never seen before in his many years of reincarnation experiences, and had never even heard of.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and the strange scenes playing out in front of him instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Extremely tranquil, as if they didn't exist at all. </p><p></p><p>Even the clamorous sounds by his ears disappeared along with it.</p><p></p><p>Divine sense was also completely unable to detect it.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes again, the horrifying scenes rushed forth once more.</p><p></p><p>The "water" boiled even more fiercely, yet Yin Shangren at the center of the event had an increasingly peaceful expression.</p><p></p><p>Like a monk who suddenly attained the Dao, pain and confusion completely vanished from him.</p><p></p><p>In this picture, the only thing unchanged was the rib bone belonging to Mr. Bai hidden in Yin Shangren's chest.</p><p></p><p>It was so abrupt, yet also like a rope.</p><p></p><p>Firmly connecting the increasingly illusory Yin Shangren to the real world. </p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren looked at the rib with some reluctance, then his gaze turned resolute.</p><p></p><p>He tossed it towards where Li Fan was.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan caught the rib, and the sound of rain by his ears instantly grew denser.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if reaching some critical point, all sounds disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the absolute silence, a ray of light emerged from Yin Shangren's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, wanting to clearly see the scene within the white light.</p><p></p><p>But even using all his power, besides Yin Shangren, he could only see many faceless figures of varying heights that seemed to be floating in midair.</p><p></p><p>They all seemed to be staring at Yin Shangren, urging something.</p><p></p><p>The light grew increasingly dazzling, finally completely engulfing Li Fan's vision.</p><p></p><p>When the white light faded, Yin Shangren had also completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then arrived at the underground chamber on Yin Yin Island. He discovered the corpses originally placed here had also disappeared along with him.</p><p></p><p>This lifetime, Yin Shangren did not choose to immolate himself.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan's few words on the side attracted his attention. Causing Yin Shangren to not head towards the extreme of self-destruction. </p><p></p><p>But rather...</p><p></p><p>"Chose to return?"</p><p></p><p>The scene in the white light, for some reason made Li Fan think of this word.</p><p></p><p>"Restore my rain..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's body was strange through and through, that rain of countless corpses falling from the sky, Li Fan had also investigated relevant records before.</p><p></p><p>But besides Yin Shangren's side, not a single thread of clues could be found anywhere else.</p><p></p><p>"It's not bizarre, yet is bizarre through and through."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he was just a Foundation Establishment cultivator, without using the 【Chaos】 Talisman, it would be very difficult for me to kill him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the scenes when interacting with the other party, his brows tightly knitted.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>A guess involuntarily welled up in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the 【Patching Heaven Record】, the principles of the world's Heavenly Dao's operation were described and explained in detail.</p><p></p><p>The book had previously mentioned that just like cultivators can absorb spiritual energy to cultivate and raise their realm, the world itself can also strengthen itself by plundering and devouring other worlds, from</p><p></p><p>And achieve its own upgrade.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor calls it the "feeding" of the world.</p><p></p><p>But just as human eating leaves behind food residue, the world's "feeding" also leaves behind things that cannot be digested.</p><p></p><p>Either because certain laws of other worlds are incompatible with the intrinsic world, or they are "foreign objects" that are not conducive to the development of the world and are naturally rejected.</p><p></p><p>They can only exist forever in the cracks.</p><p></p><p>"Ghosts" are different from "anomalies".</p><p></p><p>Anomalies are products of the fusion of worlds. Strictly speaking, they still belong to a part of the intrinsic world.</p><p></p><p>Although they may seem to be at odds with the laws of the intrinsic world, in fact, they are also slowly integrating into the new world with the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>If millions of years later, when the time span is long enough.</p><p></p><p>Then anomalies may not be completely integrated into the intrinsic world.</p><p></p><p>As for "ghosts"...</p><p></p><p>They are existences that are completely rejected by heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if the world is destroyed and time ends, the world will never have a day to eat back the grass.</p><p></p><p>Linking to the ghostly figures he had just seen, Li Fan pondered: "Could it be that this is the collection of world ghosts left behind after the Xuanhuang Realm devoured many other immortal realms?"</p><p></p><p>"The ghosts of the old world do not want to exist only in the cracks of the world forever. They also want to have a day of comeback."</p><p></p><p>"But as the losers, they can only make some small moves in the dark. Perhaps Yin Shangren was chosen by these ghosts through an accident back then."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder ordinary means cannot kill him. But it can be destroyed by messy words..."</p><p></p><p>"Because he is equivalent to the broken rules of the world."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to analyze according to the records of the Patching Sky Record.</p><p></p><p>"For some reason, Yin Shangren still retained the mark of the Xuanhuang Realm before, and the transformation was not complete. He was a half-human, half-ghost existence. But just now, he has completely thrown himself into the arms of ghosts."</p><p></p><p>"Well... as an existence with the same specifications as the Xuanhuang Dao, he does have the ability to peek into various mysteries."</p><p></p><p>No matter what Yin Shangren, who had become somewhat delusional, did, Li Fan would not feel strange.</p><p></p><p>Even Yin Shangren's obsession with Mr. Bai, there may be the influence of world ghosts behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, just some flies and dogs. Not worth fearing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, not taking it to heart at all.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Li Fan is arrogant, but the only time these ghosts can really pose a threat to the Xuanhuang Realm is when the Xuanhuang Realm itself is severely damaged and not far from destruction.</p><p></p><p>Only when the Xuanhuang Realm is weakened to the extreme point will the world ghosts have a little chance to turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>In short, ghosts are like a virus that only erupts and occupies the body before death.</p><p></p><p>By the time they erupt, everything is already meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity for Yin Shangren. This person's comprehension is so high, even higher than mine. I originally hoped that he would help me deduce the method of the Mixed Element Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the island in front of him, Li Fan's eyes flashed, and he instantly destroyed all the monsters cultivated by Yin Shangren on it.</p><p></p><p>In the underground secret room, Yin Shangren's collections were preserved in the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>On the entire island, the only one who survived except Li Fan was the strange little dog that walked with human hands as feet and had eyes all over its belly.</p><p></p><p>This beast's spiritual perception was quite keen. The moment Li Fan had the intention to kill, it immediately ran to Li Fan's front.</p><p></p><p>Sticking out its tongue, trying hard to please.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and spared the dog's life.</p><p></p><p>He also took it into the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Yin Yin Island, Li Fan pondered the gains of this trip on the way back.</p><p></p><p>"As the only ancient and new law double Heavenly Venerate in the Xuanhuang Realm, Mr. Bai's strength is definitely unquestionable."</p><p></p><p>"He may even be the reincarnation of the former Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Emperor Sanmao placed him in the central position of the Museum of Divine Treasures, and no wonder the eternal remnant thoughts remaining on his skull would have such a great attraction to Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"The eternal remnant thoughts must contain the obsessions of his life. I wonder what Mr. Bai's obsession is?"</p><p></p><p>"It can't be to save the Xuanhuang Realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Now that he knew the true value of the skull, Li Fan had already started planning how to get Mr. Bai's skull into his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"The eternal remnant thoughts cannot be brought into Huan Zhen and can only be absorbed on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"However, fortunately, I don't really need to take away Mr. Bai's skull. The purpose is only the eternal remnant thoughts attached to the skull..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I get close to the skull and let Huan Zhen complete the absorption."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the whole process must not alarm Emperor Sanmao..."</p><p></p><p>"It's best to find an excuse to send him away from the Museum of Divine Treasures..."</p><p></p><p>"I think Emperor Sanmao should give some face to the Dharma transmitters."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly sensed that the number of cultivators practicing the "Divine Possession Body" had now reached a very considerable number.</p><p></p><p>It had become a big headache for the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin should have known about this too.</p><p></p><p>Through perceiving the experiences of his believers, Li Fan found that there were indeed several different forces in the investigation teams of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"It seems it's time to take the initiative to contact them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, and a series of commands influenced the thoughts of the believers through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan quietly waited for things to change.</p><p></p><p>While waiting, he took out the "Patching Sky Record" again to study.</p><p></p><p>"The Patching Sky Record is indeed profound."</p><p></p><p>"If it were in the past, I would not have been able to see through Yin Shangren's origin at all. Even in the entire Xuanhuang Realm, there may not be many cultivators who know about the existence of world ghosts."</p><p></p><p>"This is the importance of having a famous teacher to guide."</p><p></p><p>Re-reading the Patching Sky Record, Li Fan had different insights welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It is truly new every time you read it.</p>

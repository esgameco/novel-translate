        <h1>Chapter 289</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that I would have such a strange encounter on this trip."</p><p></p><p>Although he was still some distance away from establishing his foundation, unlike before, he was now filled with the motivation to cultivate. He wished he could quickly complete the Qi Refining stage and establish his foundation as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"After I [establish my foundation], my cultivation speed should be able to catch up with Xiao Heng and my little sister, right?" Su Changyu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Without lingering elsewhere, he identified the direction and flew straight towards the desolate island.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the scenes he had just seen through Su Changyu, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, Su Changyu also ran to Yin Shangren's place and came into contact with the secrets related to [establishing my foundation]. It seems that the guidance I previously realized from the mysterious ways of heaven and earth was indeed true."</p><p></p><p>As for whether Su Changyu in this world could successfully [establish his foundation], Li Fan was quite looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>However, what Li Fan was more concerned about now was Yin Shangren's situation.</p><p></p><p>In the twelfth world, when Li Fan first met Yin Shangren 13 years ago, his hair was still a mix of black and white.</p><p></p><p>Now, 25 years later, after only twelve years, he already had a head full of white hair.</p><p></p><p>This kind of accelerated aging was almost impossible to happen to a foundation establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It indicated that in these years, Yin Shangren's mental state had suffered great damage.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan even more concerned was that the test subjects on Yin Yin Island, as well as the many treasures that Yin Shangren originally cherished like precious gems, were all destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Yet Yin Shangren didn't seem to care at all.</p><p></p><p>Or rather...</p><p></p><p>Those things were probably destroyed by him personally.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the flames that suddenly appeared on the island, and Yin Shangren's increasingly deranged expression.</p><p></p><p>"He wants to commit suicide?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>In order to verify his guess, Li Fan left the Tianxuan Mirror and hurried towards Yin Yin Island.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at his destination, the square building had indeed turned into a pile of ruins.</p><p></p><p>The burning was very thorough.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan searched for a while, but didn't find anything of value.</p><p></p><p>Standing quietly above the ruins, Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"This Yin Shangren should have been researching the secrets of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma in recent years."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly did he discover that made him want to end his life?"</p><p></p><p>You should know that the desire for survival of cultivators is thousands of times stronger than that of mortals.</p><p></p><p>It was rare to hear of a cultivator committing suicide.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really suicide, or was it a last resort?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's somewhat crazy words from before appeared in his mind: "Aren't you curious? Why can a plague from mere mortals infect cultivators? If we can figure out the source of this anomaly, maybe we can solve the Immortal-Mortal Miasma from the root! At that time, I will be a great existence that the entire cultivation world will remember!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression became a bit solemn: "I used to think he was just a foundation establishment cultivator and couldn't possibly make any breakthroughs in his research. So I always ignored him."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, he actually made some progress."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, in the next life, I can 'take special care' of him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Surveying the ruins of Yin Yin Island again, Li Fan was about to leave when he suddenly paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>The sea breeze blew, and in the charred ground, a crystal-clear, fair-skinned glow suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew closer and took out the glowing object.</p><p></p><p>It seemed a bit familiar.</p><p></p><p>A white rib.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be the rib of the first cultivator infected with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, which Yin Shangren valued the most when he was alive.</p><p></p><p>Even though Yin Shangren had turned to ashes in the raging flames, this rib remained intact.</p><p></p><p>It was said to be a good item that many people fought over, and it indeed had some tricks.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually put it into his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Returning to Wanxian Island, he asked the Tianxuan Mirror to appraise it.</p><p></p><p>But he only got the result of "Cultivator's remains, worth 1 contribution point".</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it only has value among specific groups of people." Li Fan shook his head and put the rib away again.</p><p></p><p>He sensed the situation of the various geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Su Xiaomei and the other two are not far from the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time for another harvest."</p><p></p><p>At this time, two Tribulation Bodies had been fully formed in Li Fan's dantian.</p><p></p><p>The phantom of the third Tribulation Body was gradually taking shape.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation contained in these can be converted without loss after I break through to the Golden Core realm. If enough Tribulation Bodies are accumulated, maybe as soon as I enter the Golden Core realm, I'll break through again."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but show the joyful expression of an old farmer.</p><p></p><p>"As for He Zhenghao over there..."</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't there been any cultivation feedback from him recently?"</p><p></p><p>The distance was too far, and the Formless Killing Technique could no longer sense the other party's situation.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan sent him a message asking about his recent situation.</p><p></p><p>But he received an automatic reply: "In closed training at the Garrison Academy, unable to respond, please understand."</p><p></p><p>"So Brother He has already entered the Garrison Academy?"</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, it had been about three years since He Zhenghao took office.</p><p></p><p>"Jing Xuan is indeed reliable, the contribution points were not spent in vain."</p><p></p><p>"After the formation training in Tianyu Province is over, Congyun Sea should be gone. At that time, I'll go directly to Tianyun Province to meet up with Brother He."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was secretly planning for the future.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei and her group of three had already arrived at the Thousand Mile Marsh and the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Finally reaching their destination, Su Xiaomei looked at the rather magnificent group of buildings not far away with some excitement, wishing she could rush into the ruins the next second.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhang Haobo was a bit puzzled: "Didn't they say that the ruins attracted many cultivators to come and explore? Why is it so deserted along the way? Where are the people?"</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng also frowned: "It is indeed a bit strange. But there's no need to think too much, we'll know the truth when we go and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the entrance of the Chaoyuan Sect ruins, it wasn't as lively as the rumors said.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators lingered and hesitated, not daring to enter, yet reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>After a brief inquiry, they learned why the ruins, which had been bustling with noise and excitement not long ago, had turned into this state.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that just seven days ago, something terrifying happened in the Chaoyuan Sect ruins, which everyone had always thought posed no danger.</p><p></p><p>A Golden Core cultivator who came seeking opportunities first disappeared mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>When he appeared again, people found that he had become the same existence as the phantoms that occasionally appeared in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>They could even hear and see the scenes of him running around the Chaoyuan Sect in despair, trying to find a way to return to his original form.</p><p></p><p>But this Golden Core cultivator seemed to have gone to another world. No matter what, he could not interact with the people in reality.</p><p></p><p>He also could not leave the scope of the Chaoyuan Sect ruins.</p>

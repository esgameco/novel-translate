            <p>Chapter 1088: The Void Outside the Xuanhuang Realm</p><p></p><p>Although the Xuanhuang Realm was much stronger than ordinary immortal realms, it might not be able to withstand the raging immortal spiritual power that would spread out in all directions when the immortal artifacts exploded.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if they were detonated within the Xuanhuang Realm, it would inevitably alert those old monsters hidden within.</p><p></p><p>After calming down from his excitement, Li Fan quickly realized this point.</p><p></p><p>"So, you mean to go outside the realm?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>And the urging consciousness of the Xuanhuang Dao in his mind also seemed to confirm his idea.</p><p></p><p>But what made Li Fan a little doubtful was that so far, he hadn't seen where the difficulty of this Xuanhuang Datianzun's test lay.</p><p></p><p>Compared with the previous three scenes, this fourth scene, which was likely to be the final test, seemed to have no difficulty so far.</p><p></p><p>Everything could be done step by step, and anyone could reach Li Fan's current progress.</p><p></p><p>Next, crossing the void and moving away from the Xuanhuang Realm to detonate the immortal artifacts, it seemed that it should not be a difficult task with the blessing of Xuanhuang Tianzun's body.</p><p></p><p>"As for detonating the immortal artifacts, after obtaining the power to transcend the immortal wall, if one really chooses to leave, one will probably lose the qualification to become the Xuanhuang Tianzun. Only by doing the same as what Mr. Bai truly chose in history, going against the will of Xuanhuang Dao and still staying in the Xuanhuang Realm, can one truly succeed in becoming the Xuanhuang Datianzun..."</p><p></p><p>"But is it really that simple?"</p><p></p><p>This was the Fallen Immortal Illusory Realm. Even if one chose to detonate the immortal artifacts and cross the high wall, so what? </p><p></p><p>Outside the high wall was a forbidden area that even the power of Xuanhuang Tianzun had never set foot in, a completely unknown existence. It could basically be confirmed that outside the high wall, just like in that immortal scroll edict, the Fallen Immortal Realm simply could not be transformed.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the real world, one would still be in Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>As long as one was a person with normal thinking, they would not make the choice to leave the Xuanhuang Realm, right?</p><p></p><p>Then where was the significance of this test?</p><p></p><p>With all sorts of questions, Li Fan quietly flew out of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared with a few thousand years later, the attraction of the Immortal Ruins was not so strong at this time.</p><p></p><p>With Mr. Bai's strength far surpassing that of ordinary immortals, resisting the Immortal Ruins and crossing the void was indeed not a particularly difficult thing.</p><p></p><p>Speeding through the void, the image of the Xuanhuang Realm behind him became smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was completely submerged in darkness.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were completely pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Only the pulling force coming from the distant Immortal Ruins reminded Li Fan that all this was not his illusion.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Darkest Starry Sea..."</p><p></p><p>Bone-chilling loneliness and coldness gradually welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there was not the slightest difference.</p><p></p><p>No matter how fast Li Fan flew, the surrounding scenery did not change in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>This also led Li Fan to almost doubt whether he was flying or just turning around in place.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently calculated the time in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Only after flying at full speed for three whole days, feeling that this distance was sufficient, did Li Fan finally stop.</p><p></p><p>In the endless darkness, only Li Fan existed.</p><p></p><p>He took out all thirteen immortal artifacts he had collected.</p><p></p><p>Although he was far away from the Xuanhuang Realm at this moment and had lost the support of the world itself, causing his strength to decline, he could still barely manage to destroy and detonate the immortal artifacts.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his body surged wildly, first pouring into that Desolate God Seal.</p><p></p><p>Like hammers, it fiercely struck...</p><p></p><p>(To be continued)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The violent energy exploded in the void, but before it could travel far, it was devoured by the endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>Not a single ripple was stirred on the water's surface.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan persisted, cracks began to appear on the already fragile surface of the Desolate God Seal.</p><p></p><p>Strands of immortal spiritual power flowed out from within.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spirit trembled as he hurriedly guided the power into his own body.</p><p></p><p>Distinct from his own spiritual power, it could not be absorbed.</p><p></p><p>However, with the enhancement of this power, Li Fan clearly felt the changes happening within his body.</p><p></p><p>The most intuitive point was that...</p><p></p><p>The entire dark starry sea seemed to have brightened a little.</p><p></p><p>His vision seemed to be gradually adapting to the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He could see the small dot representing the Xuanhuang Realm far behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the sign of 'Crossing the Immortal Wall'?"</p><p></p><p>Even in the Fallen Immortal Illusion, Li Fan felt a strange excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He immediately increased his output without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he completely destroyed the Desolate God Seal.</p><p></p><p>After fully absorbing the immortal spiritual power contained within, Li Fan began to swing his spiritual hammer at the second immortal artifact.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan released the seal on it, the Great Sun Golden Bell emitted a scorching, dazzling light, as if it were the real sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It illuminated a large area of the dark starry space.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the terrifying scene of some giant, horrifying creature staring at Li Fan in the darkness did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the light, Li Fan discovered that there was indeed only a void around him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed the same method and began to destroy the Great Sun Golden Bell.</p><p></p><p>A resentful scream echoed in Li Fan's ears, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ignored it, without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Sun Golden Bell disappeared from this world, the immortal spiritual power within Li Fan grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Next was the third immortal artifact, the "Yin-Yang Hook Sword".</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After destroying nine out of the thirteen artifacts.</p><p></p><p>With the excited reaction of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao appearing in his mind, Li Fan knew it was enough.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the starry sea in his eyes was no longer a sheet of darkness.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it presented a kaleidoscopic appearance with various colors constantly changing. The colors that appeared and suddenly disappeared like the aurora were all distorted towards the direction of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>While visually entering a brand new world, his body also felt much lighter.</p><p></p><p>It was like floating on the water's surface; as long as he slightly exerted force and leaped up, he could leave the water.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in this unprecedented novel experience, Li Fan sighed after a long time: "It's a pity that everything is false."</p><p></p><p>"The mission is complete, it's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>The moment he made this decision in his heart, the surrounding scene instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan keenly sensed that although there seemed to be no change in appearance, something different seemed to have happened.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Could it be that this counts as completing Xuanhuang Tianzun's test?"</p><p></p><p>"This is too easy."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, no?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze instantly turned to the remaining four immortal artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was actually the "Great Sun Golden Bell" that he had clearly destroyed before!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, wanting to retrieve those four immortal artifacts.</p><p></p><p>But he was stunned to find that they were nothing but illusory images.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that..."</p><p></p><p>A guess that was a bit unbelievable to him couldn't help but surface in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"I have already returned to reality?"</p>

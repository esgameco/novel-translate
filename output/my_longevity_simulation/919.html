            <p>In the transparent martial arts arena, Li Qing was looked up to by tens of thousands of people in Yi Lv State. However, he didn't even glance at the cultivators below.</p><p></p><p>Instead, with a flick of his finger, he regained control of the thousands of sword techniques that had lost their pursuit targets.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked up at the higher sky and said, "I have a sword, please take a look, Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>His loud voice spread across the field from the sky, causing the cultivators of Yi Lv State to look at each other in shock.</p><p></p><p>"What is he going to do?"</p><p></p><p>"How bold, he actually spoke disrespectfully to the Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, stop him!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>By the time the cultivators reacted and cried out in alarm, it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>Behind Li Qing, the phantom of a black sword suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The moment it appeared, the thousands of sword techniques seemed to receive some kind of fierce stimulation.</p><p></p><p>The sword lights all surged several times over.</p><p></p><p>The brilliance was so dazzling that the cultivators below could hardly open their eyes.</p><p></p><p>And Wan Zailai, who had already been defeated and was at a loss, also raised his head at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his own techniques being further enhanced to such an extent, a glimmer of hope suddenly rose in Wan Zailai's originally dim eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing didn't care about the reactions of the cultivators below at all.</p><p></p><p>With a long laugh, his figure merged with the black sword phantom.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by thousands of sword techniques, like the emperor of swords, leading an army of thousands, he tore through the sky.</p><p></p><p>He shot straight towards the dome of the sky!</p><p></p><p>The transparent circular martial arts arena only blocked him for a moment before it shattered inch by inch under this earth-shattering strike.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the undiminished momentum of the sword light, it seemed to want to split the entire sky apart.</p><p></p><p>In the collision between the sword and the sky, those sword lights exploded and scattered like fireworks, illuminating the sky with a myriad of colors.</p><p></p><p>Only the black sword that Li Qing had transformed into remained firm and persistent.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it flew into a scene of immortal splendor that suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In that fleeting gap, many different figures could be vaguely seen, all staring at the black sword that had abruptly intruded.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions varied.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Alas, this young man is really pitiful. At such a young age, he..."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity for this good-looking body."</p><p></p><p>"A toad really wants to eat swan meat!"</p><p></p><p>"Um, but I heard that he himself repeatedly rejected Senior Sister Zhao's good intentions and proposed to see each other as little as possible in the future. It was Senior Sister Zhao who kept persistently coming to him..."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of discussion in his ears woke Li Qing up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing wake up, the people around him all shut their mouths and left the room one after another.</p><p></p><p>Leaving him alone to calm down.</p><p></p><p>His mind was in a state of confusion. It took a good while before Li Qing figured out the current situation.</p><p></p><p>He was originally from Changfeng Village in Daqing Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, Changfeng Village was massacred by a group of mountain bandits. Only he and Zhao Ruoxi from the village escaped because they were out playing.</p><p></p><p>They saw the village in flames and hurried back.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, they ran into the retreating bandits head-on.</p><p></p><p>The bandits were all attracted by Zhao Ruoxi's beauty and were about to kidnap her. Fortunately, at this time, an immortal master from the Great Dao Sect descended from the sky and killed all the evil bandits.</p><p></p><p>Then, seeing that the two of them were pitiful, he took them back to the mountain gate of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>As a mere mortal, he was fortunate to step onto the path of immortality from then on. It could be said that he had turned misfortune into a blessing.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing's luck was obviously not deep enough, at least compared to Zhao Ruoxi, it was like the difference between clouds and mud.</p><p></p><p>In half a year, she had successfully built her foundation.</p><p></p><p>She became a disciple of the Moonlight Lineage and the Primordial Spirit Immortal, Zhang Wangshuang, became her master.</p><p></p><p>And he, Li Qing, was still stuck in the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>The gap was not small.</p><p></p><p>If it was only this, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>What was most unacceptable to Li Qing was...</p><p></p><p>Feeling the great pain coming from his lower body, Li Qing's heart was like dead ashes.</p><p></p><p>All of this was because of the disastrous beauty!</p><p></p><p>Qin Shou of the Lianshan Lineage fell in love with Zhao Ruoxi at first sight. However, due to the difference in their cultivation levels and status, Qin Shou launched a fierce pursuit of Zhao Ruoxi.</p><p></p><p>But Zhao Ruoxi had already secretly devoted her heart to Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Not only did she come to visit Li Qing in the outer sect whenever she had time, she also secretly brought him many elixirs, including the invaluable Foundation Establishment Pill!</p><p></p><p>This Foundation Establishment Pill was not an ordinary one. It was a [Purple Rhythm Dao Pill] that Zhao Ruoxi specially asked for from her master, knowing that Li Qing had poor aptitude. It could minimize the sequelae of forcibly breaking through with elixirs, and even slightly improve the practitioner's cultivation aptitude.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a divine medicine that could change one's fate against the heavens!</p><p></p><p>That day, after sending Zhao Ruoxi away, Li Qing looked at the divine pill in his arms with great joy.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that extreme joy begets sorrow.</p><p></p><p>His excessive closeness with Zhao Ruoxi aroused Qin Shou's dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He actually sent people directly to the door to teach Li Qing a harsh lesson. And those people were really ruthless, directly crippling Li Qing's root of life. Then they searched and looted, and even robbed the Purple Rhythm Dao Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Shou..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, who slowly woke up from his memories, had endless hatred flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the pain from his lower body brought him back to reality.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing mustered up his courage...</p><p></p><p>Courage, trembling as he reached down to touch his lower body.</p><p></p><p>But he grasped nothing.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's heart instantly turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"My manhood is gone, and so is the hope of breaking through to the Qi Refining stage."</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of living..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes were filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly pushed the door open.</p><p></p><p>Without looking up, just from that familiar body fragrance, Li Qing knew who had come.</p><p></p><p>"Ruoxi..." </p><p></p><p>Halfway through his words, Li Qing suddenly remembered the warning from those evil men when they committed the crime. The pain in his lower body had not yet subsided.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing couldn't help but shudder, and changed his words: "Senior Sister Zhao..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing in this state, Zhao Ruoxi's eyes first flashed with a trace of heartache.</p><p></p><p>Then her face darkened, full of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing trembled all over again, subconsciously covering his crotch.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi instantly understood, and her face also turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping with her spiritual sense, her pink fists clenched tightly. Her eyes surged with overwhelming killing intent.</p><p></p><p>With his defect being seen through by the other party, Li Qing instantly felt like dying.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he was too ashamed, and besides trembling all over, he couldn't do anything else.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing trembling like a little chick, Zhao Ruoxi's pity in her heart grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, it's alright."</p><p></p><p>She comforted him while embracing Li Qing in her arms.</p><p></p><p>"It's just physical damage. When your cultivation is profound in the future, you may be able to reshape your body..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, although my cultivation is not as good as yours, I still know the common sense of cultivation. I haven't even built my foundation, yet my body is already incomplete. This is an innate defect..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid even at the Nascent Soul stage, it won't be easy to make up for it. Let alone, with my aptitude. How can I have hope of reaching the Nascent Soul stage..."</p><p></p><p>The more Li Qing spoke, the more desperate he became, and he couldn't help but cry out in pain.</p><p></p><p>In the end, under the double blow of physical and mental attacks, he fell into a deep sleep in Senior Sister Zhao's arms.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi looked at Li Qing, whose face was covered in teardrops, and her eyes were originally full of heartache.</p><p></p><p>However, when she gently wiped away the tears on Li Qing's face with her fingers, looking at his handsome face with slightly furrowed brows in his sleep, she was somewhat lost in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Then, the expression on Zhao Ruoxi's face became a little strange.</p><p></p><p>Gently putting Li Qing down and covering him with the quilt.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi seemed to be making a difficult decision, her face a little tangled, pacing back and forth in the room.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, she finally made up her mind.</p><p></p><p>Gently kissing Li Qing on the cheek, she then left the room. </p><p></p><p>When Li Qing woke up from his coma again, he didn't get up immediately.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he stared at the roof with dull eyes. His mind was blank.</p><p></p><p>"Living like this is really meaningless. It's better to die."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking about how he would die in his mind.</p><p></p><p>With a heavy smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>She threw the five human heads strung together in front of Li Qing: "I have killed all the perpetrators of that day!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I know they were just following orders."</p><p></p><p>"The one behind the instructions is Lianshan Qinshou."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this name, a glimmer of light appeared in Li Qing's originally gray eyes.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't move him now. Not only is Qinshou's cultivation stronger than mine, his backers are also not something I can shake for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"But I promise you, one day. I will return the pain Qinshou inflicted on you a thousand times over." Zhao Ruoxi said softly, her tone resolute.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing just nodded slightly. He didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I specially found a cultivation method for you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Qing couldn't cheer up, Senior Sister Zhao took out a jade slip and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was a little resistant at first, unwilling to reach out and take it.</p><p></p><p>But after hearing Zhao Ruoxi say that this cultivation method was especially suitable for him, Li Qing hesitated for a moment, but still took it and started reading.</p><p></p><p>"[Nilun Scripture]?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was a little listless at first, but when he read the sentence "To practice this technique, one must first castrate oneself" in the cultivation method, his whole body trembled.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly raised his head to look at Zhao Ruoxi.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi explained softly: "This is a cultivation method deeply hidden in the secret pavilion of the Great Dao Sect. Its origin is unknown, and because the prerequisite for cultivating it is too harsh, few people have inquired about it over the years."</p><p></p><p>"I almost turned the entire secret pavilion upside down to find the most suitable cultivation method for you."</p><p></p><p>As if ignited by hope, Li Qing couldn't wait to read the contents of the jade slip next.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth have no extremes, Qian and Kun have order, Yin and Yang have a way."</p><p></p><p>"This is the natural principle."</p><p></p><p>"However, by inverting Yin and Yang, one can also seize the power of creation and step into true immortality!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just the opening outline deeply attracted Li Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>Forgetting everything around him, he was completely immersed in this extremely mysterious cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"It can reach the realm of true immortality..."</p><p></p><p>"If so, even if I castrate myself, it's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>When Li Qing roughly read through it once, he couldn't help but think so.</p>

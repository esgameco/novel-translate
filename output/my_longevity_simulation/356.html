            <p>"If it weren't for my 'Huanzhen,' I could restart at any time, I definitely wouldn't have made such a choice!"</p><p></p><p>"It really makes one feel uncomfortable!"</p><p></p><p>In the sea of fog, Li Fan displayed the Purple Sky Divine Thunder Escape, transforming into a purple stream of light, swiftly heading towards the Eternal Fairy Fortress. </p><p></p><p>There was a lingering sense of suffocation and depression in his heart.</p><p></p><p>And previously invincible Xuanhuang Heart Refining Curse unexpectedly operated abnormally slowly.</p><p></p><p>It was like a heavy millstone, drawing in his inner thoughts and slowly grinding them.</p><p></p><p>Different from Li Fan's previous incorrect cultivation, where everything was brutally crushed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heart Refining Curse refined these reverse emotions generated from deviating from the dao heart, transforming them into strands of coolness that flowed into Li Fan's body and mind, nourishing him.</p><p></p><p>The cool feeling slightly comforted his restless mood.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the dao heart in reverse was actually a proactive pursuit of the 'Yi Nanping.'</p><p></p><p>This naturally made Li Fan, who had always been willful, extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Curse did not disappoint Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Carefully sensing the effect of the coolness on his body, soon afterwards, Li Fan's mind shook violently.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling..."</p><p></p><p>"It's surprisingly similar to when I ingested 'Yima' before?!"</p><p></p><p>"The previous Clear-Minded Curse could strengthen the divine sense, and the correct cultivation of the Heart Refining Curse can actually strengthen the soul?"</p><p></p><p>A shockwave surged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder its cultivation method is even above the Combined Dao-level technique 'Yunshui Illusionary Dream Technique'."</p><p></p><p>"I have seen a few divine techniques that enhance divine sense in the special exchange list of the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"But to enhance the soul..."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly unheard of."</p><p></p><p>The soul is internal, the divine sense is external.</p><p></p><p>When the soul becomes stronger, the divine sense will naturally also become stronger correspondingly.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense is like muscle, which can be continuously strengthened through postnatal training. </p><p></p><p>But the soul is like bone, with a fixed constitution from birth. Only when one reaches a breakthrough in their own realm which is nearly akin to changing one's life form or by using treasures like 'Yima,' can it be strengthened.</p><p></p><p>Former Divine Transformation cultivator Zhang Zhiliang once said that 'Yima,' which can strengthen the soul, is very precious.</p><p></p><p>Although 'Yima' is good, its enhancement effect is limited.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Curse can strengthen the soul, seemingly without limits!</p><p></p><p>As long as one continues to cultivate the dao heart in reverse, it seems that the soul can strengthen endlessly!</p><p></p><p>It is known that when the soul reaches a certain level of strength, it can be used as a direct means to destroy enemies.</p><p></p><p>For example, the extremely terrifying Thousand-Faced Demon Lord officially announced by the Wanxian Alliance, abandoned the physical body and existed directly as a soul entity.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his mighty soul, he carried out host-seizing acts without restraint.</p><p></p><p>"By practicing the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Curse, constantly strengthening the soul, one day, perhaps even if the Thousand-Faced Demon Lord truly exists, I will still be no match for him."</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Huanzhen' and I are actually one. After each reincarnation, everything in the world reverts to the selected anchor point."</p><p></p><p>"Only my changes still exist."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I choose not to retain anything, it remains the same."</p><p></p><p>"When I was still a mortal, I continued to grow stronger in will through countless reincarnations. Eventually, I could even control the Taiyan Ferry with a mortal body. This is proof."</p><p></p><p>"Will, soul..."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean, all things in the world return to the starting point through my repeated choices." </p><p></p><p>"And my soul keeps getting stronger."</p><p></p><p>"One day, even if I don't choose to retain my cultivation, with just a powerful soul, it will be enough to crush everything?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more Li Fan felt incredulous.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Heart Refining Curse, worthy of being called a heaven-defying divine technique, is actually hidden within the widely known Xuanhuang Clear-Minded Curse?"</p><p></p><p>"What is this actually..."</p><p></p><p>On instinct, Li Fan believed there should be some hidden conspiracy within this.</p><p></p><p>With a mix of surprise and suspicion in his heart, after a struggle, Li Fan decided to continue his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Such a technique right in front of me, I can't possibly give up."</p><p></p><p>"Even if there are any tricks, my soul strengthening is real."</p><p></p><p>"If not, then no matter how many schemes, they are useless before 'Huanzhen'."</p><p></p><p>After making a decision, Li Fan instantly let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The actual effect of the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Curse far exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"The method of cultivating the dao heart in reverse is somewhat torturous."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vaguely felt that it wasn't possible to cultivate by simply saying things that contradicted the dao heart.</p><p></p><p>It required the unity of knowledge and action, and practical actions that reversed the dao heart.</p><p></p><p>Only then could it become nourishment for the soul.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he ventured alone into the white fog.</p><p></p><p>"For others, the combination of the Devil Sound Tide and the Devouring Origin White Fog is indeed extremely dangerous, a place of life and death."</p><p></p><p>"Facing both the white fog and the devil sound, if a deadly danger arises, I still have time to calmly resort to 'Huanzhen'."</p><p></p><p>"Overall, the benefits of this choice far outweigh the risks."</p><p></p><p>"Conversely, the Wanxian Alliance's territory, which seems to have little risk, is fraught with danger if one wants to cultivate the dao heart in reverse."</p><p></p><p>"If one is not careful, they may attract the presence of powerful Combined Dao experts."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered, he continued to fly towards his destination.</p><p></p><p>With the Black Death Seal protecting him, blocking the Devouring Origin White Fog from outside, the only thing Li Fan had to worry about was the occasional sudden attack of the Devil Sound Tide.</p><p></p><p>Whenever murmurs and whispers echoed in his ears, Li Fan would stop flying as a precaution.</p><p></p><p>He would light the Extinction Glass Lamp, waiting for the Devil Sound to weaken before setting off again.</p><p></p><p>Although there were dangers around him, but with Li Fan being cautious, everything was smooth sailing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Fan had been flying in the white fog for over two days.</p><p></p><p>His Five Elements' internal energy was integrated, so there was no need to worry about spiritual power depletion.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's expression slowly became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"If the threat is only to this extent, Cold Yingyi cannot possibly meet with an accident."</p><p></p><p>"He still has not returned, what has he encountered?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan gradually became vigilant, he released his divine sense, probing the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>However, in the sea of fog devoid of the Devil Sound Tide, only silence prevailed.</p><p></p><p>After searching for a long time, he did not find the source of the threat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no choice but to play it by ear and continued flying towards the Eternal Fairy Fortress as sensed.</p><p></p><p>Two more days passed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly coming to a stop while flying swiftly, Li Fan's face turned unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand why Cold Yingyi hasn't returned. It's because of this."</p><p></p><p>At his speed, flying and stopping along the way, he should have been able to reach the Eternal Fairy Fortress within a maximum of two days.</p><p></p><p>But now, it had been four days since Li Fan left the stronghold of Jiaxu.</p><p></p><p>In his sense, the Eternal Fairy Fortress was indeed not far ahead.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Even with just a small distance to cover, no matter how he flew, he could not cross it.</p><p></p><p>"Although it seems to be just a short distance away, it's like a sky trench that I can't cross no matter what. We call these places within the white fog barrier 'Misty Realms'."</p><p></p><p>The words of Huangfu Song suddenly resounded in Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>He temporarily stopped flying, standing in mid-air with an indecisive expression.</p><p></p><p>"Outside of the Abyssal Roar, on the path of Jiaxu's stronghold and the Eternal Fairy Fortress, a Misty Realm was unknowingly born again."</p><p></p><p>"Quietly, with no one knowing."</p><p></p><p>"Cold Yingyi must have gotten lost in this Misty Realm."</p><p></p><p>"And now, it's the same for me."</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead, Li Fan seemed to see a huge greenstone palm right in front of him, but he couldn't reach it.</p><p></p><p>"Close by yet miles away..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>Although inadvertently falling into a desperate situation, Li Fan would not use 'Huanzhen' right away.</p><p></p><p>There are still many unfinished matters in this world. It would be a waste to give up so easily.</p><p></p><p>It also aligns with Li Fan's character of not giving up until he reaches his goal.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan decided to see if he could find a way to cross this newly formed Misty Realm before his supplies ran out.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, a Misty Realm is simply an extremely vast space.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1033: A Righteous Showdown</p><p></p><p>Tears streamed down his face as his round body struggled to kneel on the ground. </p><p></p><p>He begged the immortal master to spare his life.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan finally revealed himself.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that if an outsider intervenes, the rules become invalid. The challenge can only be won by relying entirely on one's own abilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Without wasting words on this round ball, he stared at his opponent, and an invisible force suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>While crushing the more than 100,000 wailing thoughts in the other's mind into dust and turning them into nourishment for consciousness,</p><p></p><p>he also performed a liposuction surgery on his opponent.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, the survivor, who had regained his normal physique and whose consciousness had become so powerful that it could almost rival an ordinary Yuan Ying stage cultivator, slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Nian'er, you residents of Fan Yong Island occupy a place favored by the heavens, yet you do not strive to improve yourselves and neglect the heavenly blessings. Therefore, the heavens have sent down a calamity to bring you this tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"Considering the heavens' virtue of cherishing life, and seeing that you are truly pitiful, I have lent a helping hand to save you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice was like thunder, and his divine sense poured directly into the other's mind.</p><p></p><p>He deeply engraved his words like a brand.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your grace, Immortal Master, thank you for your grace..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jiang Nian'er, who had returned to normal, wept bitterly and kept kowtowing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I only wish to follow by the Immortal Master's side from now on, serving as an ox or horse, to repay the kindness of giving me a second life..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er, whose mind had been easily brainwashed by Li Fan despite being a combination of more than 100,000 mortal consciousnesses, said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond, but only said solemnly, "This is a tribulation, but also a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"You want to become my disciple..."</p><p></p><p>"You are not qualified yet. For now, just follow by my side and be an acolyte. If your future performance satisfies me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er kowtowed to Li Fan again, not daring to raise his head.</p><p></p><p>"He is one of your tests!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed to the immobilized Foundation Establishment cultivator beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators of the world are divided into Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment..."</p><p></p><p>After briefly introducing the cultivation system of the Xuan Huang Realm, Li Fan continued, "This person is a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"You must defeat him with your own strength!"</p><p></p><p>"My patience is limited. I will only give you fifteen days."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er's body instantly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>How could he, a mere mortal, triumph over the power to fly, traverse the earth, and summon the wind and rain?</p><p></p><p>What could be accomplished in just fifteen days?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw Jiang Nian'er's trepidation and smiled, "Don't worry, I won't make you do something meaningless that will send you to your death."</p><p></p><p>Lightly tapping Jiang Nian'er's forehead, Li Fan transmitted a Golden Core cultivation technique and a set of basic formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"With what I've taught you, it's enough for you to deal with him."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you can't digest these contents to some extent within fifteen days..."</p><p></p><p>"Then he will become the lucky one." Li Fan looked at the unknown Foundation Establishment cultivator and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er's heart tightened. He immediately sat cross-legged and began to comprehend the contents Li Fan had imparted.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to control qi..."</p><p></p><p>Starting from the most basic cultivation knowledge, a brand-new world of immortal cultivation gradually unfolded before Jiang Nian'er's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although the strength of his divine sense was already almost on par with a Yuan Ying stage cultivator, Jiang Nian'er obviously still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He hadn't yet adapted to how to utilize this power.</p><p></p><p>Still, like a mortal, he read slowly word by word, as if afraid of missing any details.</p><p></p><p>Until nightfall, he suddenly awoke with a start.</p><p></p><p>Half a day had already passed?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the fifteen-day death deadline, an immense invisible pressure instantly surged in Jiang Nian'er's heart.</p><p></p><p>"No, no. I need to be faster, even faster."</p><p></p><p>It should be said that Jiang Nian'er was indeed the grand winner who emerged victorious among over a hundred thousand people.</p><p></p><p>He quickly learned not only to read ten lines at a glance but also to multitask.</p><p></p><p>While studying the introductory immortal cultivation technique, he also began to ponder formations.</p><p></p><p>Thus, three days later.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed a fluctuation of spiritual energy from Jiang Nian'er.</p><p></p><p>"Refining qi in three days, it seems his aptitude is average."</p><p></p><p>Because the dark and mysterious power had already invaded, the mortal miasma on Jiang Nian'er's body had almost ceased to exist.</p><p></p><p>Although it saved the step of expelling the miasma from his body, completing the introduction of qi into the body in three days was by no means considered poor aptitude.</p><p></p><p>The so-called aptitude was not something Li Fan cared about in Jiang Nian'er in the first place. He didn't take it to heart.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to observe his choices.</p><p></p><p>Not disappointing Li Fan, after successfully stepping into the Qi Refining stage and trying to cultivate for a period of time, he discovered that in the remaining twelve days, he absolutely could not complete the advancement.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Jiang Nian'er used almost all his energy on researching the introductory formation bestowed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The introductory formation taught by Li Fan, in terms of power alone, was more than enough to trap and kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator to death.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had undergone his special simplification, allowing Qi Refining cultivators to use it.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you're not too stupid and forget to accumulate the spiritual power needed to maintain the formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan revealed a trace of an inexplicable smile.</p><p></p><p>In fact, who won or lost between the two was not important to him at all.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the winner would inherit the mysterious power and could not escape his palm, being used by him.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan really wanted to observe were the specific changes that occurred when the mysterious rules took effect and the identity was devoured.</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious rules can actually also be regarded as the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that during the process of world fusion, due to the transition, the principles of heaven and earth that are not recognized by the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao are born."</p><p></p><p>"We cultivators who possess the mysterious power will inevitably suffer the wrath of heaven."</p><p></p><p>"But this thing called the wrath of heaven..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly in his heart, he really wasn't afraid of it!</p><p></p><p>The fifteen days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"The deadline has arrived, let's begin."</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan suddenly spoke, breaking the tranquility on the island.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he instantly released the restrictions on that Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivator had always maintained his clarity, listening to the conversation between Li Fan and the other.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little Qi Refining cultivator who has only cultivated for a dozen days also wants to defeat me?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a disgrace, it must be washed away with your blood..."</p><p></p><p>His eyes turned red, and the moment he gained freedom, he summoned his Foundation Establishment magic item.</p><p></p><p>A straight wooden stick appeared in the sky, instantly locking onto Jiang Nian'er.</p><p></p><p>It was about to launch an attack and crush him.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>He suddenly found his vision blur, and the opponent's figure disappeared for no reason.</p><p></p><p>"What?" The Foundation Establishment cultivator was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He looked around and discovered that he had unknowingly appeared in a sea of bamboo.</p><p></p><p>The previous encounter on the desolate island seemed like his own illusion.</p><p></p><p>Outside the formation, Jiang Nian'er breathed a sigh of relief while struggling to maintain this [Bamboo Sea Dragon Trapping Formation].</p>

            <p>I didn't expect to see [I am invincible], who was in the [Sitting and Discussing] program, in such a situation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was naturally interested.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he left the message and thought of a way to defeat Master Zhang, he had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He had never reappeared until Zhang Qianmo was defeated by Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan originally thought that he had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't realize that he was alive and well.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't he challenge Master Zhang later?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the record of the battle of Sitting and Discussing the Way, and his heart couldn't help but be a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't look like someone who talks big.</p><p></p><p>And.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clicked on [I am invincible] Shuo Feng's previous battle record with Zhang Qian Mor.</p><p></p><p>In the previous battle, Shuo Feng used a flying sword as well.</p><p></p><p>But it was a set of eighty-one golden light sub-mother swords.</p><p></p><p>It was a far cry from the wooden sword he was using now.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a matter of retaining strength, or ......"</p><p></p><p>"Remodeled?"</p><p></p><p>I have practiced the Divine Sword of the Fixed Sea and mastered the divine power of the 28 Swords of the Clouds.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan barely had a certain understanding of sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>He compared Shuo Feng's fight with Zhang Qianmo and Su Xiaomei over and over again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came to the conclusion that the power of this wooden sword is much stronger than the previous set of golden light son mother sword. …Øo…îÀôxn…•s69 bar book 69 new</p><p></p><p>"This wooden sword, it seems to be a heaven and earth oddity?"</p><p></p><p>"And, its grade ......"</p><p></p><p>Before seeing the wooden sword give full play to its power, Li Fan is not in a position to jump to conclusions.</p><p></p><p>However, it should be certain that it is beyond the realm of ordinary human wonders.</p><p></p><p>"Wonders of the Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>On Su Xiaomei's side, she is also very curious about this wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>She launched a continuous questioning attack on Li Fan's behalf.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, the wooden sword you just made is a bit powerful, can I borrow it to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the same as the armor you're wearing, is it some kind of magic treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"You're wearing armor in a fight, you're too much of a rascal."</p><p></p><p>"My armor can't even be broken when I hit it with all my strength! It's really a bully!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng was also a bit headache to this bear child, carrying Su Xiaomei away who was about to hang onto himself, he replied, "This is my foundation building wonder, [Sword]."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not going to show it to anyone unless it's a battle."</p><p></p><p>"As for this Golden Light Treasure Armor ...... on my body," Shuofeng patted his clothes, his face somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>"It was custom-made for me by my mother, Immortal Honorable Crimson Snow. Not to mention your foundation cultivation, even that Yuan Ying Shen Yurou just now may not be able to break through the defense."</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei's eyes widened as she heard this, stretching out her small hand to touch and feel on Shuo Feng's blue clothes, her eyes filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she shook her head, "If you're wearing this, who would normally fight with you?  ùê®ùê¶ What a bore!"</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng also sighed, "My mother's order is really hard to disobey. Along the way, only cultivators who don't know my details like you, little sister, will fight with me. Like that Shen Yurou, even how much I say to stimulate, will not take the initiative to fight."</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong with your technique, why is it so strange? How come you can't take the initiative to fight? That would be meaningless!"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng looked like you don't understand and smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei lingered on for a while, but when Shuo Feng didn't answer, she could only pout and give up.</p><p></p><p>"You've always asked me questions, now it's my turn to ask them. Whose family are you from?" Shuo Feng asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I won't tell you! Su Xiaomei gave him a blank look and snorted.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo, who was at the side, also kept his mouth shut and looked unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng had no choice but to ask again, "Let me guess, you guys are definitely not from Jiushan Prefecture. This time you came here, you must be here for that Chaoyuan Clan relic, right?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei hummed again, but this time, it was a tacit admission.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei tilted her head and looked at Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go then!" She said.</p><p></p><p>Then she took the lead and flew ahead.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng smiled and secretly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Then, he followed suit without slowing down.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the team heading to the Chaoyuan Clan's ruins changed from two to three.</p><p></p><p>There were many quarrels along the way.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, Little Sister and Shuo Feng will compete again.</p><p></p><p>Jiu Shan Prefecture is a vast area.</p><p></p><p>There is still some time before we reach our destination.</p><p></p><p>While Shuo Feng and the others were on their way, Li Fan, on his side, after a few months, had a feeling in his heart that he could enter the Realm of the Meteor Immortal once again.</p><p></p><p>"Fusheng Xuanhuang Heavenly Father!</p><p></p><p>The ceremony was initiated, and Li Fan once again came to the outside of Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan still chose to say the same thing as last time.</p><p></p><p>Convincing Master Zhang to secretly sneak into the city, he then split up and scouted around separately.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan's goal is clear.</p><p></p><p>He borrowed some silver from a rich merchant in the city and poked around for information about Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>It is said that money can make a ghost grind.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan feel a little strange was that, after spending a lot of money, he could not get any useful information about Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>It was as if such a person did not exist in the city.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had to change his mind and asked about the extremely handsome young men in the city.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the strange gazes of the residents, Li Fan gathered three candidates who met the criteria.</p><p></p><p>The first two were ruled out by Li Fan after some probing and meeting real people.</p><p></p><p>They were all ordinary mortals, only a little better looking.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came to the door of the target.</p><p></p><p>A small remote and dilapidated courtyard.</p><p></p><p>According to the descriptions of the residents, the owner of the courtyard was a young man who looked a little sick and weak.</p><p></p><p>This young man is not a local.</p><p></p><p>He came to Ningyuan City two years ago with a wave of refugees from the disaster.</p><p></p><p>He bought this compound with the only silver he had left and settled down.</p><p></p><p>The young man lives in a simple house and doesn't show his face much.</p><p></p><p>It was said that he had a good hand at writing, and that he made his living by teaching in a big house in the city.</p><p></p><p>However, he was born with a good skin, and everyone who met him praised him for his good looks.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The youth's message crossed his mind.</p><p></p><p>Without sensing the aura of a living soul surviving inside, Li Fan made a flash and entered the compound.</p><p></p><p>With a cursory scan of his Divine Consciousness, he didn't find anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan knows that Mr. Bai's house has a stone statue cast by the "Absolute Immortal Stone", which can block the perception of divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Without letting it go, Li Fan pushed open each door one by one and entered it to take a closer look.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the west side of the small courtyard, a room that appeared to be a storage room, Li Fan's steps slightly paused.</p><p></p><p>Throwing the sundries on the ground to one side, Li Fan lifted a thin stone plate on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a dark hole underneath.</p><p></p><p>"Absolute Immortal Slate ......"</p><p></p><p>"This is it!"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Li Fan's mouth surfaced a trace of a smile, and he flew into the secret room below with a vertical leap.</p><p></p><p>When he landed, a faint smell of blood came to his nose.</p>

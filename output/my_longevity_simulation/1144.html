        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1142: The Endless Deduction of Laws</p><p></p><p>Elder Nangong seemed to be taken aback by Li Fan's question, stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then his gaze suddenly became deep and solemn: "If there really is such a person..."</p><p></p><p>"Then it's even more important not to let him get close to Yanfa Jue."</p><p></p><p>"Living alone for hundreds of years, with a stable mood from beginning to end. Either he's a madman or has an extreme temperament..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted him: "I've heard that there are peerless geniuses who can remain focused even after a hundred years of seclusion. Not having a mental breakdown from being trapped, isn't that perfectly normal?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Nangong smiled disdainfully, shaking his head slightly, and said with certainty: "That kind of genius wouldn't come here. Unless he has ulterior motives."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was instantly speechless.</p><p></p><p>Sun Xingyao's expression also looked a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, welcome to the Protector Hall. Next, I will brief you on some special precautions. In addition to the various regulations of the Immortal Alliance, there are more things to pay attention to when interacting with Yanfa Jue."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, you can go back first. Your mission is considered complete."</p><p></p><p>Sun Xingyao was waiting for these words from Elder Nangong, feeling relieved.</p><p></p><p>After a few more reminders to Li Fan, he then took his leave.</p><p></p><p>After rambling on for nearly half an hour, Nangong then took Li Fan and flew out from this space.</p><p></p><p>After completing the employment procedures and receiving the resources as an elder of the Protector Hall,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan changed into the black robe with gold edges unique to the Protector Hall and followed Nangong to the outside of the brightest light spot at the center of the dome.</p><p></p><p>"Once I send you in and complete the final handover, I'll be free." </p><p></p><p>Nangong smiled, and it could be seen that he was genuinely happy.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, one last thing. There are two other elders guarding together with you in the Protector Hall. Unless necessary, don't communicate or talk with them."</p><p></p><p>"Every transmission wave in the space where Yanfa Jue resides will be recorded. And someone will regularly check them."</p><p></p><p>Nangong whispered through transmission, his face expressionless.</p><p></p><p>As if he wasn't the one saying those words.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands in thanks.</p><p></p><p>Then bidding farewell to Nangong, he leaped into the white light spot.</p><p></p><p>What came into view was the scene he was very familiar with, the space where Yanfa Jue resided.</p><p></p><p>A huge sphere composed of countless characters.</p><p></p><p>The characters on the sphere were in endless change at every moment.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, an entire passage of characters on the sphere would pause for a moment, then flash and disappear.</p><p></p><p>And then it began the endless changes and deductions again.</p><p></p><p>Below this huge sphere, a desk was floating in the void.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the text constantly appearing on the desktop, she had a listless look.</p><p></p><p>Just like every time he saw her before.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense someone coming, Yanfa Jue slightly raised her head.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the solemn-faced Li Fan and the black and gold robe he was wearing, she pouted and lowered her head again.</p><p></p><p>"Another ugly one has come."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clearly heard Yanfa Jue's mutter.</p><p></p><p>His body couldn't help pausing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, you'll get used to it later." An elderly voice sounded beside Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was a transmission from Zhang Xu, one of the Harmonious Dao Elders hidden here on guard duty.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Xu." He briefly introduced himself, then fell into silence again.</p><p></p><p>As for the other colleague, he never greeted Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mind either.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>..., flying towards his "work post".</p><p></p><p>The so-called "work post" was actually a special position within this space.</p><p></p><p>Similar to a key node in a formation, being there felt like having a commanding view. One could see all the energy fluctuations in the surroundings at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of time spent guarding the Derivation Orb was passed at this specific location. </p><p></p><p>"This is truly worse than being in prison. No wonder none of the Suns wanted to come over here." </p><p></p><p>Arriving at his post, Li Fan felt a bit emotional.</p><p></p><p>He pretended to observe his surroundings, seemingly familiarizing himself with the work environment. In reality, he was secretly pondering where the loopholes in the surveillance space were.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the constantly shifting light and shadows of the huge character orb, this place always maintained a quiet, even somewhat suffocating atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>And in a short time, Li Fan also had no clue on how to break through the restrictions and quietly contact the Derivation Orb.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, about half a year passed.</p><p></p><p>The little loli who had been working at her desk suddenly straightened her back and raised both hands.</p><p></p><p>She exclaimed excitedly, "Yay! It's break time!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she directly flopped back down.</p><p></p><p>"Six hours."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the voices of Zhang Xu and another guardian Immortal sounded simultaneously. </p><p></p><p>Six hours was the rare break time for the Derivation Orb.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, they had to wake it up on schedule.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Derivation Orb sleeping so sweetly, Li Fan inwardly sighed, "This is a bit inhumane."</p><p></p><p>"It should rest for at least twelve hours."</p><p></p><p>In the half year he had been on watch, for some reason, no cultivators had entered this space using the Audience Jade Tablet.</p><p></p><p>There were almost no chances for the Derivation Orb to slack off.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan still raised the question in his mind to Elder Zhang Xu.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was still within the scope of his duties. Zhang Xu was silent for a moment before replying, "Three years ago, a Five Elders Society spy somehow obtained an Audience Jade Tablet and snuck in here, wanting to commit some misdeed. Although we discovered it and stopped it in time without causing any serious consequences, it still alarmed the higher-ups of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Before the accountability for this matter is completed, audiences have been fully suspended."</p><p></p><p>"It will probably take a few more years before it can be restored."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu said a few simple sentences and spoke no more.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, "Every Audience Jade Tablet is an invaluable reward bestowed by the Immortal Alliance upon cultivators who have made outstanding contributions."</p><p></p><p>"To think it would appear in the hands of the Five Elders Society. And based on Nanggong's previous instructions, the probability of Five Elders Society spies infiltrating is not low. It basically happens once every few decades..."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Five Elders Society is no match for the Myriad Immortal Alliance in direct confrontation, the Myriad Immortal Alliance is somewhat inferior when it comes to these conspiracies and tricks."</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the Heaven Mystery Mirror's heaven-defying abilities, Li Fan knew the ownership of almost all the Audience Jade Tablets currently in circulation.</p><p></p><p>"As one of the three guardians, I am under strict surveillance, so it's not easy to make a move."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can take a roundabout approach and use the Audience Jade Tablets to create opportunities to be alone with the Derivation Orb."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>Twelve hours quickly passed.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The Derivation Orb was still sprawled on the long table, snoring away.</p><p></p><p>There were no signs of it waking up at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vaguely sensed a bit of helplessness from the other two guardian Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, you do it," Zhang Xu transmitted with a smile.</p>

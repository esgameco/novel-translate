        <div class="content">
            <p>Threatening matters naturally come with risks.</p><p></p><p>However, firstly, because of the visions that occur after the death of a cultivator, attempting to secretly kill someone and cover it up is indeed challenging.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Li Fan is now considered a role model in the world, living under the spotlight.</p><p></p><p>Even if Huangfu Song wants to take action, he has to consider the consequences.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song certainly doesn't have the intention and determination to exchange blows with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Compromise is inevitable.</p><p></p><p>So, although this move seems dangerous, it is actually all within Li Fan's plan.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Great Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, closed his eyes, focused his mind, and began contacting Lu Xuejing, whom he hadn't paid attention to since he subdued her.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman's methods were truly mysterious and extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even though surrounded by thick white fog, he could have conversations in his mind with beings located who knows how far away.</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>Feeling Li Fan's call, after a while, Lu Xuejing's timid voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Without contact for a long time, Li Fan did not exchange pleasantries.</p><p></p><p>He immediately asked about her current situation.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the general situation, Li Fan thought for a moment and inquired about her mother's news.</p><p></p><p>Faithful Lu Xuejing truthfully shared everything.</p><p></p><p>"Mother seems to be very busy lately, constantly traveling and inspecting various realms."</p><p></p><p>"They are places I've never heard of. Sometimes we even lose contact for a long time..."</p><p></p><p>Listening, Li Fan slowly began to formulate a plan.</p><p></p><p>In parting the communication, Li Fan comforted and praised the little girl.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing's performance was very excited, her soft voice was quite pleasant.</p><p></p><p>After explaining the things in her plan, amidst Lu Xuejing's extreme reluctance, Li Fan cut off the communication.</p><p></p><p>"It is all up to this plan. Whether it succeeds or not, it depends on my luck."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, Li Fan's luck was good.</p><p></p><p>The next day, as Huangfu Song was about to depart in the Dust Crossing Boat from the Severed Palm Immortal City, Li Fan received a message from Lu Xuejing.</p><p></p><p>A gleam of light flashed in Li Fan's eyes as he swiftly flew onto the Dust Crossing Boat.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, what are you up to now?"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song appraised Li Fan, who had suddenly barged in, with an unfriendly expression.</p><p></p><p>He instructed others to leave and led Li Fan into a secluded cabin.</p><p></p><p>Staring coldly at Li Fan, he awaited his explanation.</p><p></p><p>"In order to compete for rankings, I want to make a strong effort. Other aspects have been arranged, but now I need the senior's help one more time."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Huangfu Song couldn't help but be astonished, "So soon?"</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, he carefully observed Li Fan from head to toe.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly pondering, after a moment, he said, "So be it, what do you want me to do?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke in a deep voice, "I want the senior to change course and swiftly take me to the Spirit Converting Gorge."</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Converting Gorge?" Huangfu Song was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you want to go there?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer but continued to make his request, "And, we need to find a legitimate reason, can't let others see any inconsistencies."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song sneered, "You're quite demanding, kid."</p><p></p><p>Without rejecting on the spot, Huangfu Song fell into a long silence.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly contacting certain people.</p><p></p><p>Staying still, Li Fan patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, with a slight nod from Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>He looked back at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"You're lucky, I have a friend who is currently overseeing the formation construction work at the Spirit Converting Gorge."</p><p></p><p>"The formation construction there is nearing completion."</p><p></p><p>"His next stop is also very close to my mission location."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song explained succinctly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly pleased and bowed, "In that case, I thank the senior."</p><p></p><p>"Don't give me that flattery," Huangfu Song retracted the smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I'm helping you, not for any other reason."</p><p></p><p>"I am genuinely curious to see who is behind you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said seriously, "Senior, you're overthinking. I am a lonely person, where would I have support?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan still pretending to be clueless, Huangfu Song didn't argue further.</p><p></p><p>Just gave a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, senior, how long does this trip to the Spirit Converting Gorge take?" Li Fan asked nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"Fast is two days, slow is seven days. It depends on whether we encounter any unforeseen situations on the way," Huangfu Song replied somewhat impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Be patient. Since I've agreed to help you, I won't deceive you in this aspect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly and thanked him again.</p><p></p><p>Though the sudden change of destination for the Dust Crossing Boat drew some surprise from the cultivators on board, as Huangfu Song was the helmsman, they naturally didn't dare to voice any objections.</p><p></p><p>The Dust Crossing Boat turned into a streak of red light, piercing through the devouring white fog, swiftly advancing.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the barrier of white fog, they first flew to the nearest Quyang Immortal City, then, with the help of a transmission array there, arrived at a place with scorched earth everywhere.</p><p></p><p>They continued to fly towards their target.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Savage Flaming Wasteland, and the Spirit Converting Gorge is deep in this area."</p><p></p><p>"The violent fire attribute spiritual power repels all other energies, even the spatial structure becomes unstable. Hence, a transmission array cannot be constructed."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song, watching Li Fan curiously observing the scenery outside, couldn't help but explain.</p><p></p><p>Even with the formation barrier, Li Fan could still feel the external intense heat inside the Dust Crossing Boat.</p><p></p><p>It was a pure power residue that could incinerate everything.</p><p></p><p>In this world, it seemed only the dark red powerful force remained.</p><p></p><p>The earth cracked, and the sky seemed to be ablaze with flames.</p><p></p><p>Moved by this desolate scene, Huangfu Song sighed deeply, full of emotion.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the uniqueness of the Spirit Converting Gorge, the alliance would have probably long abandoned this region."</p><p></p><p>"What makes the Spirit Converting Gorge unique?" Li Fan followed up on Huangfu Song's explanation.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know?" Huangfu Song was genuinely surprised this time. "Then why are you so urgently rushing here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately put on an innocent look.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's facial muscles kept twitching.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he refrained from acting up due to his self-control.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he once again took on the role of an explainer, "The Spirit Converting Gorge itself isn't particularly unique. It just produces a kind of green stone."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of stone naturally exerts a strong pressure on spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"For us cultivators, if we don't have a special countermeasure and get close to it..."</p><p></p><p>"Our spiritual energy will be suppressed, and we'll instantly become as weak as ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"Based on its characteristics, it's called the Spirit Converting Stone by the alliance."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan suddenly felt that this stone seemed somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>As if he had seen it somewhere before.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he tried, he couldn't recall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately knew it could be related to the inexplicable disappearance of his doppelganger he witnessed.</p><p></p><p>So, he stopped dwelling on it.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan asked again, "I once accidentally saw a substance called the â€˜Ultimate Immortal Stone' from ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have a similar effect to the Spirit Converting Stone you mentioned."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if these two are the same thing?"</p>

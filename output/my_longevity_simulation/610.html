        <h1>Chapter 610</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This conclusion also explains a long-standing doubt of Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>When Xianxu appeared, why didn't it directly swallow the mysterious yellow realm?</p><p></p><p>Instead, the cultivators inside had enough time to constantly capture surrounding caves and small worlds to resist it?</p><p></p><p>From the terrifying suction of Xianxu now, if it was just the initial mysterious yellow world, it should have been extremely difficult to resist.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, capturing small worlds is definitely not something that can be done in a day. The countless Heavenly Realms are probably not just the results of the efforts of the Xuantian Sect and the ten major Dao sects over thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>All of this indicates that the suction force of Xianxu is increasing day by day.</p><p></p><p>As for why the suction force is getting stronger...</p><p></p><p>It is very likely because the mysterious yellow world is getting closer to Xianxu.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, an image instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>On the endless sea of void, many immortal worlds floated like ships.</p><p></p><p>One day, a black hole called [Xianxu] appeared above the sea of void.</p><p></p><p>Its powerful suction continuously swallowed everything around it, forming a whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of Xianxu, the immortal realms in the sea of void were uncontrollable, being continuously pulled closer by [Xianxu].</p><p></p><p>Initially, due to minimal changes, the people in various immortal realms were unaware.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until they started falling towards [Xianxu] at a faster speed that they realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>So, like drowning people desperately clinging to anything they could hold onto out of survival instinct, the cultivators of the mysterious yellow world began using "ropes" to tie down the "reefs" in the far distance of the sea of void, namely the various caves and small worlds, in an attempt to delay their own downfall.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in this process, there were cultivators who wanted to abandon ship and find new "vessels" to escape.</p><p></p><p>But if everyone did so, the mysterious yellow realm would sink even faster.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the helmsmen of the mysterious yellow world, whether it be the Xuantian Sect or the ten major Dao sects, or even the current Wanxian Alliance and Wulao Society, in order to prevent this situation from happening, all chose to keep the true situation of the mysterious yellow world secret.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought that by pulling on these ropes, they could slowly pull the mysterious yellow realm out of the whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>But the reality proved them wrong.</p><p></p><p>"The 'weight' of cultivators probably has something to do with these 'ropes'. Originally, the worlds were directly connected to the caves, but after the cultivators plundered heaven and earth, they became part of the bond themselves."</p><p></p><p>"If a cultivator dies suddenly, it's like a few strands of thread in a rope suddenly disappearing."</p><p></p><p>"Although cultivators still ascend to the heavens and the caves return to the heavens and earth after death, the automatic restoration of the ropes in heaven and earth still takes some time."</p><p></p><p>"If a cultivator falls at a normal speed, it's fine. Once it exceeds a certain threshold..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled in the previous life when Ji Hongdao used the [Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation] to instantly kill a state cultivator when facing Zhao Shijie in Tianlingzhou, as a deterrent to all die together.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of losing many cultivators' lives, even the entire mysterious yellow world trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"These affiliated caves and small worlds are crucial to the life and death of the mysterious yellow realm. The so-called 'ropes' aren't that easy to cut off."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, there will definitely be cultivators following the Xianjie channel to escape to the small worlds and then sever their connection with the mysterious yellow realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's not unwillingness, it's just impossible."</p><p></p><p>"And the small world empire passing through the ten thousand boundary-breaking whales in the void, rather than cutting off the rope, seems more like extending it."</p><p></p><p>"When the extended length, i.e., the distance between them and the mysterious yellow realm, is enough, when the mysterious yellow realm falls into Xianxu and turns to dust. If what was pulled by the other end of the rope suddenly disappears, they might really be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this process takes too long, and the mysterious yellow realm may not be able to hold on for that long."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought, since the mysterious yellow realm could capture caves and small worlds through ropes, why didnâ€™t they tie the ropes to other immortal worlds of the same scale as the mysterious yellow realm in the far distance?</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, complete worlds are definitely more effective than caves.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps they tried before but failed."</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>"They simply couldn't pinpoint the other side's location."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>As ships on the sea of void, other immortal worlds definitely didn't want to be dragged down by those already affected by Xianxu.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the current situation on the sea of void, to prevent themselves from being used as a life-saving straw.</p><p></p><p>They are very likely to take the initiative to hide their own worlds.</p><p></p><p>Caves and small worlds may not be able to do so.</p><p></p><p>But highly developed immortal realms should be able to.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, those who couldn't do this have probably already been affected by many worlds that are falling and are also heading towards Xianxu.</p><p></p><p>In addition, due to the existence of Xianxu, the entire sea of void has been more or less influenced by it. The positions of all immortal realms have undergone relative displacement.</p><p></p><p>The originally fixed [waymarks] are all useless.</p><p></p><p>It would be extremely difficult to find the other hidden immortal worlds again.</p><p></p><p>"The once splendid sea of void has turned dark in an instant. Every world not only needs to worry about being swallowed by Xianxu but also has to hide itself. Preventing it from being noticed by other immortal realms."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly a scene that is despairing just to think about."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan thought so, there was evidently not much fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There was even a trace of a subtle smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of [Hanzhen], amidst the countless possibilities, it wouldn't be difficult for him to find a way out.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since the remains of True Immortals could maintain intact bodies in Xianxu.</p><p></p><p>It means that falling into Xianxu may not necessarily be a dead end.</p><p></p><p>Inability to survive is simply because the strength is not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Li Fan raised his head, his gaze passing through the transparent wall of the Medicine King Cauldron, reaching the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Whether my speculation is right or wrong can actually be easily verified."</p><p></p><p>"Just need to fly out of the mysterious yellow realm again and face [Xianxu] in person."</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years ago, Liu Ruchen flew the Medicine King Cauldron in the void for some time before being pulled by [Xianxu]."</p><p></p><p>"Now that it has been so long since then, once we leave the mysterious yellow realm and lose the protection of the world, we may immediately fall towards Xianxu without much reaction time."</p><p></p><p>"Even, as we get closer to Xianxu, maybe one day we can clearly see the ruins of Xianxu and the True Immortal remnants standing quietly on the heavens."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out his left hand and summoned the control core of the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"In this world before Hanzhen, it should be useful for me."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what's going on."</p><p></p><p>After a surge of thoughts, after a long time, Li Fan put away the diamond-shaped crystal.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I have full control of the Medicine King Cauldron. The life and death of the sleeping people of the Medicine King Sect are just a thought away from me."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, there are still six Harmony Stage and twenty-three Nascent Soul Stage cultivators alive."</p><p></p><p>"And several cultivators below the Yuan Ying stage."</p><p></p><p>"The biggest gain this time, besides these cultivators, is the knowledge of the hidden realm."</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng Valley."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>As a young spy who left home, some of them are even unheard of by him.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Wang Qiupo's words to Xu Bai had earned some of his trust.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he gestured for Xu Bai to wait here.</p><p></p><p>Then he quietly lay back on the rattan chair behind him, as if falling into a deep sleep with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's view, Wang Qiupo's vitality was dissipating at an astonishing speed.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, he seemed to have passed away, resembling a corpse.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed the spy who has remained hidden for eight hundred years without exposure, indeed quite knowledgeable," Xu Bai stared at him for a long time, secretly contemplating.</p><p></p><p>The hut where Wang Qiupo resided also seemed to have some mystical aspects. The disappearance of Wang Qiupo's vitality did not attract attention from outsiders. They continued to line up outside, waiting eagerly.</p><p></p><p>After a cup of tea, a light breeze seemed to sweep through the room.</p><p></p><p>Then, like a withered tree in spring, Wang Qiupo once again restored his vitality.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Bai keenly sensed that this old man, who had lived for eight hundred years, seemed to have stepped closer to death.</p><p></p><p>With a light cough, Wang Qiupo stood up again and walked over to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"I have confirmed with the organization, young man, your words are not false."</p><p></p><p>"The previous few transactions with us do indeed demonstrate the reputation of your Covered Heaven Society. However..."</p><p></p><p>The elderly eyes of Wang Qiupo stared firmly at Xu Bai: "How will you prove that you are a member of the Covered Heaven Society and not someone from the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance trying to strike back upon discovering my true identity?"</p><p></p><p>"What were the contents of our first two transactions?"</p><p></p><p>Faced with Wang Qiupo's consecutive questioning, Xu Bai was not surprised. With a calm smile, he provided the answers.</p><p></p><p>"The first time was the test questions for the entrance exam of the Immortal Alliance. The second time, it was about the true identity of an ancient immortal sought by the Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these two sentences, Wang Qiupo's tensed body suddenly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he said in a deep voice, "The organization has indeed observed signs of the reversal of the laws of nature. However, they have not yet confirmed the true identity of this deity..."</p><p></p><p>"This time, the organization has agreed to the transaction."</p><p></p><p>"However, involving the Longevity Deity, if a contract is signed, it may be sensed vaguely by him. So this time, the transaction can only be verbally agreed upon, relying on the reputation of both sides."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes flickered slightly. (continued below)</p>

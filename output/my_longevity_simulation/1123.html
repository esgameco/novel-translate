            <p>Chapter 1121: Reviving the Immortal Alliance in Prison</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, we can even convert them into believers of the Compassionate True Immortal!" </p><p></p><p>Looking at the countless prisoners around him, wailing in agony under the torment of the formation, Kou Hong empathized with them and pondered.</p><p></p><p>"However, this is a strictly guarded prison after all. To achieve this, we need to plan for the long term."</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong's eyes flashed as he once again used the same angry rebuke to conceal himself.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he deliberately showed an intermittent and listless appearance.</p><p></p><p>As if he couldn't hold on any longer.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, Kou Hong used his superficial complete submission to divert the jailers' attention away from him.</p><p></p><p>While he frantically studied the details of the formations every day and secretly accumulated and improved his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Now he had also realized.</p><p></p><p>The blessing of the Compassionate True Immortal, the inexplicable hot flow appearing in his body, turned out to be the cultivation that cultivators dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>In conventional understanding, it could only be accumulated through day and night bitter cultivation by cultivators, becoming the source of power to improve their realm. But at this moment, it was like water from an inexhaustible source, continuously nourishing his body.</p><p></p><p>And his strength was also rapidly increasing at an unimaginably terrifying speed because of this.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month's time, he had directly broken through to the peak of Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>This made Kou Hong even more convinced that all the incredible miracles happening to him were definitely the blessing of the Compassionate True Immortal!</p><p></p><p>You should know that it took him a full two hundred years to cultivate from a mortal to the middle stage of Golden Core!</p><p></p><p>And now, the breakthrough was just in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Kou Hong thought that the peak of Golden Core was the limit. But what happened next completely shattered his perception and made him understand what true immortal divine power was!</p><p></p><p>As we all know, to break through from the Golden Core realm to the Nascent Soul realm, one needs to devour the Xuanhuang realm's grotto-heaven.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kou Hong was still in the depths of the prison, naturally unable to meet this condition.</p><p></p><p>However, three days later, something that left Kou Hong utterly shocked happened.</p><p></p><p>Because when he circulated his spiritual power and inspected his body, he actually found that in his dantian, a phantom image of a grotto-heaven faintly appeared!</p><p></p><p>Sensing it more carefully, Kou Hong was certain that this phantom grotto-heaven was not an illusion.</p><p></p><p>But truly existed!</p><p></p><p>A grotto-heaven was being born inside his body!</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, this was another blessing from the Compassionate True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong quickly accepted this easily. With the help of this nascent grotto-heaven, he formally broke through to the Nascent Soul realm a month later!</p><p></p><p>The various anomalies caused by the breakthrough were perfectly concealed by the true immortal power surging in his body.</p><p></p><p>It did not arouse the notice of the prison guards.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong looked at his hands, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Compassionate True Immortal, I, Kou Hong, don't know what virtue or ability I have to receive such favor from you."</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely complete your instructions, even if I have to die ten thousand times."</p><p></p><p>In the shadows, Kou Hong looked at the countless towering prisons around him, his eyes gradually becoming firm.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Nascent Soul stage, Kou Hong's strength continued to automatically increase every day. But his main attention had already focused on breaking the formations and rescuing the prisoners in the prison.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on me alone, it's really a bit difficult to accomplish this."</p><p></p><p>"But where can I find help in this prison?"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong quietly observed the "neighbors" around him, selecting suitable partners.</p><p></p><p>Like this, who knows how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan looked at the message sent by Kou Hong and couldn't help but smile slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, he just pretended not to see it and did not give any response.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong tried a few more times without giving up, but in the end, he had no choice but to abandon his efforts.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I misjudged?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be."</p><p></p><p>Just as Kou Hong was in a dilemma, a newly arrived prisoner immediately caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>This person was not a member of the Multiverse Alliance but was imprisoned here for violating the laws of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the crimes he committed, he probably had no chance of getting out in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"Now you insects, you want to die and cancel your sins at the drop of a hat."</p><p></p><p>"How can it be so easy!"</p><p></p><p>"I will make you beg for death but unable to die, and let you rot and worry in this sunless prison for the rest of your life!" The escorting cultivator of the Myriad Immortal Alliance said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>As for that prisoner, he remained silent. Only the eyes looking at the other party were full of disdain and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>However, soon under the suppression of the cruel formation, all turned into miserable screams.</p><p></p><p>When people are in extreme pain, their subconscious words are always closest to their truest thoughts in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After listening to the words of this newly arrived neighbor for several days, Kou Hong was sure that he was indeed a partner he could cooperate with.</p><p></p><p>On this day, after waiting for him to be tortured to the point of exhaustion, he quietly penetrated the formation and delivered a message.</p><p></p><p>It was obviously just a futile effort.</p><p></p><p>After some communication between the two parties, Kou Hong also learned his name.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Fu.</p><p></p><p>The crime he committed was not a big deal, he just embezzled one-third of the annual profits of the Pill Hall in Moling State.</p><p></p><p>In the past, even if such a thing was exposed, as long as he spent some contribution points and found some connections, he could settle it with money. It would have passed.</p><p></p><p>But this time, unfortunately, one of his mortal enemies somehow also learned about this matter.</p><p></p><p>He reported it directly to the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The reaction of the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters this time was also unusually swift.</p><p></p><p>Before Zhang Fu had time to smooth out his connections, the envoy from the headquarters had already arrived. After a simple investigation, the evidence was conclusive, and he was arrested on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Without even going through the re-examination procedure stipulated in the past, he was directly taken to the prison and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Zhang Fu realize that he had been schemed against.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking that he was doomed, he never thought that he would encounter a turning point.</p><p></p><p>"Help release the prisoners in the prison?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a capital crime. Although everyone can be reincarnated now, I heard before I came in that the Myriad Immortal Alliance seems to have reached some kind of agreement with that Reincarnation Venerable. Those who have committed unforgivable sins in the Immortal Alliance will lose the opportunity to reincarnate. Truly die!"</p><p></p><p>"Just like the previous members of the Multiverse Alliance, they all seem to be like this."</p><p></p><p>Without noticing Kou Hong's body trembling violently not far away, Zhang Fu continued to speak to himself: "Although being imprisoned here, with no chance of getting out forever. But it's always better than truly perishing."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe one day, the Myriad Immortal Alliance will grant amnesty to the world?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Fu did not agree at first, and even secretly had the idea of reporting this person with ulterior motives and establishing merit with his crimes.</p><p></p><p>But the other party's next words made him change his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Here, even death is a relief."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe it, just look at the people around you and you'll know."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 446</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Deep within the dormant underwater volcano, hidden from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Based on the "Earth Fire Returning Formation" he obtained from the legacy of Tianyang, Li Fan spent a lot of effort to determine the location of the cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>After activating several protective talismans, Li Fan cautiously entered the cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>The current Tianyang is in a peculiar state of being neither dead nor alive.</p><p></p><p>From the eternal legacy, Li Fan learned that besides Tianyang, all others who initially transformed into the Dao had gone to participate in the ancient battle and never returned.</p><p></p><p>But Tianyang himself firmly believed that the Master and senior brothers would definitely come back.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that they wouldn't find him upon their return, Tianyang remained in the cave mansion in the Dao realm and refused to go out.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, after several years, outsiders intruded into the cave mansion. Tianyang intended to resist but was not a match.</p><p></p><p>Surviving only by the magical treasures left by the senior brothers before departing, he barely saved his life.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the young Tianyang began a wandering life in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Through trials and tribulations, he gradually realized that his talent was far from what the senior brothers had described, and he was not the hope for the revival of the Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>Unable to compare with his senior brothers, he even feared being inferior to ordinary Golden Core cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, the Master and senior brothers still entrusted their last hope to him.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he remembered their words of encouragement - "Tianyang, your talent is unmatched in the world. Get well soon. The revival of the Dao realm relies on you." - Tianyang felt the burden of his own inadequacy.</p><p></p><p>However, reality does not change with one's emotions.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang estimated that if he did not encounter other miraculous opportunities, reaching the Golden Core stage would probably be his limit.</p><p></p><p>To fulfill the trust of his Master and senior brothers, Tianyang decided to make a bold move: to discard his physical body and completely transform into a puppet, defying fate.</p><p></p><p>His remaining life was all dedicated to this goal.</p><p></p><p>Searching for a suitable location to set up the "Earth Fire Returning Formation," gathering materials, refining the puppet...</p><p></p><p>After making all necessary preparations, Tianyang resolutely completed the transformation into a puppet.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he sank deep into the earth's veins, intending to use the power of earth fire to refine the puppet and elevate its status.</p><p></p><p>If everything went as planned, Tianyang would complete his transformation within a maximum of five hundred years, becoming a formidable existence not inferior to Immortal Emperors.</p><p></p><p>But things went contrary to his wishes.</p><p></p><p>During the five hundred years, changes occurred in the world, and the earth's veins shifted, greatly reducing the power of the Earth Fire Returning Formation. Moreover, the materials Tianyang used to make the puppet were merely ordinary.</p><p></p><p>This led to an abnormally slow process of the puppet's advancement.</p><p></p><p>Instead of the intended five hundred years, it turned into several thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Through the ages, even in his slumber, Tianyang's consciousness gradually wore away.</p><p></p><p>Losing most of his subjective thoughts, only the obsession "Tianyang's life is no less than anyone else's" remained.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that it was perhaps the "Sky Overturning Palm" that had shattered the Cloud Mountain Range into the Cloud Sea, which led to Tianyang's plan's failure.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang's life, unfortunate compared to others..." Li Fan shook his head and arrived at the square outside the cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>After careful observation, like a ghost, Li Fan transformed into a thin line and safely passed through the twists and turns without triggering any mechanism or prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Arriving deep inside the cave mansion, he saw a set of child-sized skeletal remains.</p><p></p><p>In actual history, due to Tianyang's congenital deficiency, he had maintained the same size as he did when he was a child.</p><p></p><p>Approaching cautiously, Li Fan suddenly heard creaking sounds coming from underground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart fluttered, and he swiftly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, seventeen black-and-red puppet-like figures emerged and attacked.</p><p></p><p>Activating his Dao techniques, Li Fan shouted loudly, "Junior Brother, don't you recognize me?"</p><p></p><p>However, the puppet mechanisms paid no heed and continued their ruthless assault.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with his sword energy, Li Fan managed to drive the puppets back and kept calling out Tianyang's name amidst their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Fan took out a projection stone, displaying Ling Xiao's work in the air.</p><p></p><p>This caused the puppets to gradually cease their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Raised his head to the displayed words and images in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Two..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior... Brother?"</p><p></p><p>The somewhat sluggish mechanical voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "Junior Brother, after so many years, it's good to see you again, are you well?"</p><p></p><p>"Two... Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>Cracks appeared on the bodies of the seventeen puppets, and just like broken porcelain, they shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>The fragments dissolved and melded on the ground, eventually forming a small Tianyang puppet.</p><p></p><p>It flew over to Li Fan and stared at him curiously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the somewhat unfamiliar man in front of him, Tianyang seemed puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan patted Tianyang's shoulder, saying, "Let's go, junior brother. I will take you home."</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang puppet froze.</p><p></p><p>With a rumble from the depths of the sea, the ground trembled as if something was about to emerge.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "Junior Brother, don't get too excited. There are still many bad people outside in this era."</p><p></p><p>"If others find out, it won't be good."</p><p></p><p>As if understanding Li Fan's words, after a long while, the puppet nodded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the underwater surroundings became calm again.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's help, it took three days for Tianyang to retrieve all his scattered body parts buried underground.</p><p></p><p>As he reassembled them into a whole, he silently followed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Carrying Tianyang's eternal legacy remains, they hurried to the nameless desolate island where people from the previous life resided.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten days, Li Fan opened a cave mansion resembling the one from Tianyang's former Dao sect and set up concealment and protection formations.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Tianyang, Li Fan instructed, "Junior Brother, you stay here and wait for me. I'll be back soon."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang obediently nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan left, he returned to his original room and sat quietly.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Waking up Tianyang a few years earlier is a bit of a flaw."</p><p></p><p>"He hasn't been fully tempered, and there's still a gap from the peak Dao transformation."</p><p></p><p>"But I can help him complete it."</p><p></p><p>After searching and studying, Li Fan bought various rare materials, spending his contributions like water.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, he returned to the nameless island with filled storage rings.</p><p></p><p>"Grey Profound Diamond, Willow Brush Profound Stone, Red Spiritual Bronze..."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, these are materials you can absorb to strengthen yourself."</p><p></p><p>"And, during normal times, stay in the 'Returning Transformation Formation.' It will help in your tempering..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully guided Tianyang.</p>

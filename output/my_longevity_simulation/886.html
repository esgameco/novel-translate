        <h1>Chapter 886</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the faceless deity statue before him, his expression shifting between gloomy and sunny. No matter what method was used to detect it, the result was always the same: this stone statue seemed ordinary and unremarkable, without containing a trace of extraordinary power.</p><p></p><p>But it was this existence that seemed like a mortal object, yet it could shield divine sense perception.</p><p></p><p>It could only be seen with the "eyes".</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the faceless Xuantian deity statue was not as simple as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>In this world, after Li Fan called it the "Red Dust Compassionate Immortal" and used it as a relay station for the Sitting Immortal Jue feedback, all the mutual aid society members who swore oaths to the deity statue, without exception, had an inexplicable feeling of "restraint" in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After some probing by his avatar Ji Shaoli, it was basically confirmed that this was not an isolated incidental phenomenon, but a universal one. </p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the oath of membership designed by Li Fan was just a simple piece of text. There was no additional mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>"And it's not some psychological effect either."</p><p></p><p>"Faced with the oaths of cultivators, the Xuantian deity statue did indeed produce a special reaction."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his gaze falling on the void face of the deity statue.</p><p></p><p>Placing the deity statue in the grand hall at the entrance of the Myriad Worlds United Association, to be revered by thousands of visitors in the future.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was almost certain that there would definitely be unexpected changes!</p><p></p><p>"Will the statue give birth to its own consciousness? Or will it attract the remnants of the Xuantian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan still decisively put down the Xuantian deity statue.</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, the faceless stone statue settled steadily on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then countless white threads appeared around it, which was the core of the Lingmu Realm formation, the Dissociated Disk Body No. 2, quickly using the formation to guard the stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can already crush ordinary Unified Dao. Plus this grand formation spread across the small worlds..."</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Life beings do not enter small worlds, so I am invincible in this Lingmu Realm."</p><p></p><p>A sharp light flashed in Li Fan's eyes: "If they don't come, then so be it."</p><p></p><p>"But if they really dare to seek this place, then let them try my methods!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no doubt that there were still former Xuantian Sect members existing in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, just from what he knew, in the ruins of the Zixiao Sect in Linlang Prefecture, there was a Xuantian Sect Dharma King sleeping.</p><p></p><p>There must be other remnants existing elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, Li Fan did not have much fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"According to the various information obtained before, apart from that Xuantian King at the Half-Immortal realm, the other twelve Dharma Kings of the Xuantian Sect were nothing more than Old Law Eternal Life level in battle power."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly in his heart. The next moment, his figure gradually became ethereal and appeared in the space directly below the Spirit Tree.</p><p></p><p>A separate space that could be cut off from the Lingmu Realm at any time to escape.</p><p></p><p>Outside the space, the Lingmu Grand Formation enveloped in layers. The terminal Dissociated Disk's sub-body was placed here.</p><p></p><p>This was also the place Li Fan prepared for himself to go into seclusion and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Old Law Eternal Life, if I am fully prepared, it's not impossible for me to fight them."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan took out a light sphere shrouded in seven-colored rainbow light from his own Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the light sphere appeared, the Spirit Tree above seemed to sense some fatal crisis.</p><p></p><p>The branches and leaves moved without wind, its figure standing tall between heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>The spiritual wood trembled uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, it attracted the attention of the living beings within the Spiritual Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't expect that the spiritual wood's instinctive sense of life and death crisis would be so strong.</p><p></p><p>Frowning slightly, he released layers of seven-colored divine light around himself, forming another layer of isolation.</p><p></p><p>Only then did it eliminate the fear of the spiritual wood.</p><p></p><p>Not long after returning from the Yin Soul Realm, the gray mold inside the three-eyed skull had almost completely corroded the storage space where it was located.</p><p></p><p>The storage ring could break at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored divine light originally used to wrap it had also become somewhat dull, changing from seven colors to gray and white.</p><p></p><p>Disconnected from Li Fan, even if he wanted to replenish its energy, he couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the destructive power of the mysterious gray mold with his own eyes, Li Fan couldn't help but be secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically speaking, this three-eyed skull can also be considered as my belonging. So this time, when starting over, can I choose to keep it?"</p><p></p><p>"If possible, I should be able to figure out its origins."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan took out an ice-sealed exotic beast that he had plundered from the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>Carefully wrapping it with rainbow light, he merged it with the seven-colored light group in front.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing the breath of life, the gray mold residing inside the three-eyed skull suddenly became a little restless.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan removed the seven-colored divine light around the ice-sealed exotic beast, he clearly observed the gray mold squirming as if it were alive.</p><p></p><p>However, the existence of the skull seemed to be a shackle for it.</p><p></p><p>The mold was about to spread outside the skull but suddenly shrank back.</p><p></p><p>But what disappointed him was that this mysterious pattern didn't move at all.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my guess was wrong? Is this three-eyed skull really dead?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very cautious and manipulated the ice-sealed exotic beast to approach the skull.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold became more and more agitated.</p><p></p><p>It wandered inside the skull, as if it was about to pounce fiercely at any time.</p><p></p><p>But it also seemed to be reluctant to do something, stopping at the most critical moment every time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched this scene, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Under the manipulation of his mind, the frozen exotic beast gradually regained its vitality.</p><p></p><p>The breath of life suddenly became vigorous.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the gray mold couldn't resist the temptation, and a large part of it suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>There was no trace of movement.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the space was directly corroded, forming a cavity like a yellow spot.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the exotic beast that had originally regained its vitality, like a faded photograph, completely dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Then it turned into ashes and slowly fell.</p><p></p><p>Among the flakes of gray, Li Fan keenly saw a new small piece of gray mold!</p><p></p><p>He, who had been waiting for a long time, naturally didn't miss such a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Like a bolt of silk, the long rainbow surged out, instantly sealing and wrapping the newly appeared gray mold in layers.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold, which had finally gained freedom, saw that it was about to be sealed again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed extremely angry and crashed into the seven-colored divine light, as if it wanted to corrode the seven-colored light as well.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who saw through it like a torch, how could he be deceived by its little tricks?</p><p></p><p>Without letting go of its main body that was trying to distract him, he also released endless light, sealing the barely visible small gray spot in the corner of the space.</p><p></p><p>"Playing these little tricks in front of me is really ridiculous."</p>

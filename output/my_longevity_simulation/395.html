        <h1>Chapter 395</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Let's go, with the Falling Star God Sword protecting us on this journey, we will definitely be safe and sound."</p><p></p><p>He summoned the Dust Ferry again, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the conversation between the two in the courtyard just now, Li Fan pondered, "Has the local resistance movement become so serious now?"</p><p></p><p>"Do we really need to ask for protection umbrellas?" Huangfu Song asked.</p><p></p><p>"Don't fear ten thousand, just fear the one in ten thousand. In this remote place, anything can happen," he replied.</p><p></p><p>"If it escalates, and they bundle us together, throw us into the flames amidst the silence, and claim it was an accident."</p><p></p><p>"What can we do then?"</p><p></p><p>"With the Falling Star God Sword related to travel and cultivation, it will be different," Huangfu Song said with a sense of satisfaction. "Don't just look at his cultivation level being at the stage of transforming gods now. Falling from the stage of harmonization to the stage of transforming gods is much more powerful than the ordinary transforming god cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"At least, in Lanlinzhou where there is no Harmony Immortal presiding. With the Flying Sword of Travel and Cultivation, he can suppress everything that does not comply."</p><p></p><p>The chubby man took out the small golden sword again and couldn't help but caress it lovingly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the Falling Star God Sword and could faintly feel a strong and sharp aura emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>He thought back to the lazy appearance he had just seen, feeling somewhat emotional.</p><p></p><p>"A generation of harmony fell to this state just because they didn't see the situation clearly," he thought to himself, then couldn't help but ask about the words of Guanxingxi.</p><p></p><p>"Earlier, Senior Guan said that the old leader passed away, but is it the falling of the Supreme Immortal?" he inquired.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. It was not long ago," Huangfu Song replied. </p><p></p><p>"In the end, he quietly died alongside the willow tree in his own Tianji palace," Li Fan envisioned the old face of the Supreme Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't for He Zhen, I am afraid that not long after, I would end up like him, just waiting for death in fear," he mused.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how high the harmony cultivation is, without achieving immortality, it is all in vain."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly touched by the fall of the old Harmony Immortal, Huangfu Song put away the Falling Star God Sword and sighed, "Perhaps Guanxingxi's despair is also related to this."</p><p></p><p>"Even with the profound heritage of controlling the Ten Thousand Immortals Defense Academy for five hundred years, the Supreme Immortal is still hopeless of achieving immortality. This shows how difficult it is to defy the laws of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Guanxingxi having his cultivation stripped and trying to start again from the stage of transforming gods is even more challenging."</p><p></p><p>"Keep in mind that in order to achieve harmony once more, one must rely on a soul similar to the one before."</p><p></p><p>"Souls of heaven and earth are already rare to encounter. If there are additional requirements for their attributes, it becomes almost impossible."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the casual conversation with Huangfu Song, the Dust Ferry reached the central core area of the Sealing Spirit Array, where the designated position to set up the Tianxuan Formation pivot was located.</p><p></p><p>The formation had not been fully constructed yet and required some time to be completed.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the array master who was also a student of the Huan Yu Academy, the other cultivators were not particularly friendly towards Huangfu Song and Li Fan's arrival.</p><p></p><p>At least, that's how it appeared.</p><p></p><p>However, after Huangfu Song unleashed the Falling Star God Sword, these cultivators had to restrain themselves.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in Shilinzhou, near the former Yunhai and now Congyunyuan.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo looked at the endless void not far away, a look of sadness on his face.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had seen this scene not for the first time, he still found it hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>His former hometown, the vast blue and life-filled ocean.</p><p></p><p>To see it like this upon their reunion, it was hard to bear.</p><p></p><p>"Haobo, be strong," Xiao Heng walked over and patted his shoulder, offering comfort.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened back then? How did such a vast Yunhai suddenly turn into this?" Zhang Haobo couldn't help but ask again.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng shook his head, "I don't know either. When Senior Skull suddenly warned that there might be a catastrophe in the Yunhai, shortly after you all went to Jiushanzhou, I also left the Yunhai."</p><p></p><p>"But Ye Feipeng seemed to know something and insisted on staying behind."</p><p></p><p>"I thought he was hiding another encounter from me, but ever since then, he has never appeared again."</p><p></p><p>"I suspect that he is no longer in this world."</p><p></p><p>"If I had known earlier, I should have advised him further," Xiao Heng said with a tinge of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, he continued.</p><p></p><p>"Over the years, I have tried to investigate the changes that occurred in the Yunhai. However, what I didn't expect was that in less than a year, most cultivators had almost no memory of the Yunhai."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if this region never existed. Even now, I can only remember the existence of the Yunhai when I see this abyss before me."</p><p></p><p>"I too, despite spending nearly a decade in Jiushanzhou, have not a single memory of the Yunhai," Zhang Haobo paused before whispering, "This must be the influence of the Longevity Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng nodded slightly, "Perhaps sooner or later, the memories in our minds of this period will also disappear completely, just like the old Yunhai."</p><p></p><p>The two men gazed at each other in silence.</p><p></p><p>The abyss remained eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>Before long, their contemplation was interrupted by a loud boom coming from nearby.</p><p></p><p>As they turned around, they saw that Su Xiaomei and Su Changyu were sparring again.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei gave a strange smile to Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, dozens of figures with different outfits appeared, surrounding Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>These figures held various weapons but had no faces.</p><p></p><p>Instead, different blood-red symbols circulated on each blank face.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if you can block this move!"</p><p></p><p>These faceless blood-faced figures all laughed in their own eerie tones.</p><p></p><p>The weapons in their hands emitted hints of blood rays.</p><p></p><p>Numerous blood-colored bursts surged, ready to strike Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>Not panicking in the slightest, Su Changyu closed his eyes instead.</p><p></p><p>As the blood light approached him, his right hand emitted a radiant white light.</p><p></p><p>Moving at an incredibly high speed, he instantly created the illusion of a thousand hands appearing simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Each phantom hand grasped the incoming blood light.</p><p></p><p>Then exerted force at the same time.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the blood light was reversed in direction.</p><p></p><p>Instead, launching an attack towards the dozens of faceless blood-faced figures.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The situation reversed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Many figures disappeared as a result.</p><p></p><p>But one of them, despite being hit by the blood light, remained unscathed.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the explosion's light, it quietly approached Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>Its form burst open.</p><p></p><p>A flaming giant net was about to engulf Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>Without changing his expression, Su Changyu opened his eyes abruptly.</p><p></p><p>In each of his eyes, there were two pupils.</p><p></p><p>The four black pupils shrank to as small as pinpoints.</p><p></p><p>The raging flames in front of him were instantly halted.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu then slapped out a palm.</p><p></p><p>However, the target was not the flames in front of him but Su Xiaomei hidden in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Illusory palm shadows emerged continuously, with explosions sounding all around.</p><p></p><p>"You can't hit me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei's voice resonated from all directions, elusive like a ghostly spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Su Changyu's lips.</p><p></p><p>High above the sky, a transparent giant palm had unknowingly formed.</p><p></p><p>Completely covering the battlefield where the two were.</p><p></p><p>Then it descended mightily.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The earth sank, raising dust.</p><p></p><p>And hidden within it, Su Xiaomei could no longer hide.</p><p></p><p>Caught by the ethereal fingers, she was then suspended in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go!"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes turned red, and her clenched fist showed signs of loosening, indicating an impending escape.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu extended his right hand and made a distant grasp.</p><p></p><p>Another illusory giant palm materialized.</p><p></p><p>Superimposed with the previous transparent palm.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei was thus once again suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"I give up!"</p><p></p><p>With Su Xiaomei's roar of anger, an inexplicable scarlet sun appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Under the scorching of the red sun, the phantom palm shadows dissolved into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Freed from the binding, Su Xiaomei did not show any joy on her face. She retracted her own Scarlet Sun Cave Domain.</p><p></p><p>She scratched her head and flew to Su Changyu's side.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, how did you become so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Curious, she asked, "I suppressed my cultivation to the Golden Elixir stage, and now, you are no match for me anymore."</p><p></p><p>She posed a question, somewhat intrigued.</p><p></p><p>"When I left the Yunhai back then, the Ye Yue and Ting Sisters discovered remnants of ancient Dao remnants from the ancient era," Su Changyu explained. "After these years of restoration, I have been able to experience a complete strand of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"When I left the Yunhai back then, the Ye Yue and Tong Sisters discovered remnants of ancient Dao remnants from the ancient era..."</p><p></p><p>As Su Changyu spoke, an identical voice echoed at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Creating a strange dual sound.</p><p></p><p>But as he slowly closed his eyes, the additional echo faded.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, it was barely audible.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu explained that this was due to his unique cultivation technique, and Su Xiaomei and others who had grown used to it didn't find it strange.</p><p></p><p>"I want to comprehend this divine technique too!" She tapped her hands happily upon hearing Su Changyu's words.</p><p></p><p>Even without opening his eyes, Su Changyu could clearly see the long-lost appearance of his little sister before him.</p><p></p><p>Despite already being in the Nascent Soul realm, she still appeared like a child who hadn't grown up.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Su Changyu lovingly patted Su Xiaomei's head.</p><p></p><p>"After more than ten years apart, we are finally reunited."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng, who was watching this scene, couldn't help but feel relieved.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he sensed a slight fluctuation in the bone talisman that had not been used for a long time. His face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Senior Skull warned and saved everyone, putting them to sleep again, he had been in a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was finally waking up now?</p>

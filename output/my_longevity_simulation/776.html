        <h1>Chapter 776</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the small world was in Qiong Jing State. Returning together with that team of cultivators was also a unified cultivator from the Taiyan Sect. </p><p></p><p>This person, as a representative of the Taiyan Sect, visited the Heavenly City of Qiong Jing and publicly raised a question - could the entire Taiyan Sect join the Immortal Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Shufu, the city lord of Qiong Jing City, was also a unified cultivator, he did not dare make this decision himself for such a matter. After temporarily appeasing the other party, he hurriedly went in person to the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance to report the situation.</p><p></p><p>However, the unified cultivator from the Taiyan Sect appeared calm and composed, not the slightest bit nervous. It seemed he had already anticipated the outcome of Meng Shufu's trip.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, soon after, the Immortal Alliance officially issued an announcement. In order to further accelerate the unification of the spiritual and mundane realms, as well as to reduce unnecessary cultivator casualties and lighten the burden on the Underworld Ministry, they welcomed all forces and sects from the small worlds to merge into the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>For those who voluntarily surrendered, the Immortal Alliance would not expel them from their current residences. They only needed to cooperate in completing the "Observing Heaven and Earth" task of the Celestial Profound Treasure Record. The Immortal Alliance would even provide preferential treatment in terms of resources, cultivation methods, and other support.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, cultivators who successfully persuaded forces in the small celestial worlds to surrender would still receive corresponding merit rewards.</p><p></p><p>After the announcement, many cultivators immediately became energized. If fighting didn't work, then carrying the Immortal Alliance's banner and using such advantageous conditions to persuade surrender would be easy, right?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had slacked off reignited their efforts, driven by the winds of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Within Qiong Jing State, Meng Shufu looked at the unified cultivator from the Taiyan Sect across from him and felt a sudden realization. No wonder the other party had never shown any worry from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect was renowned in ancient times for its Expansion Arts. This surrender must have been the calculated result!</p><p></p><p>"The ancient cultivators truly cannot be underestimated." Meng Shufu inwardly marveled as he very politely brought the Taiyan Sect cultivator into the Immortal Alliance headquarters to discuss the specific terms of surrender.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, news spread quickly. Not long ago, the sect leader of the Taiyan Sect calculated that the Immortal Alliance would soon unify the spiritual and mundane realms. After discussion, the entire sect reached a consensus to go with the flow of heavenly timing rather than resist futilely.</p><p></p><p>He had come in person to negotiate. From today, the Taiyan Sect officially joined the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>When this news spread, Immortal Alliance cultivators felt an inexplicable exhilaration. After all, even scattered cultivators had heard of the great name of the Taiyan Sect. Now that they had voluntarily surrendered to the Immortal Alliance, it seemed the day of full unification was truly not far off.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators immediately felt somewhat anxious, vowing to seize this final opportunity to earn as much merit as possible.</p><p></p><p>Within the Long Life Valley, Willow Three coldly laughed, "I once had my disciples investigate the ancient sects, and they all said the Taiyan Sect had been destroyed in the great catastrophe long ago."</p><p></p><p>"Yet I didn't expect they were still alive and well. With the Taiyan Sect's unmatched Expansion Arts, how could they not have prepared for the coming of the great catastrophe?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that they've set aside their former arrogance to voluntarily surrender to the Immortal Alliance. This is a bit unexpected to me. Based on their temperament back then, they would never have agreed unless over half their cultivators died."</p><p></p><p>Willow Three's tone was completely unconcerned.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was clear that he had no great affection for this Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The general trend is unstoppable. What's a little face compared to one's own life? It's not worth mentioning," said Fang Zaiji indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"But this actually gives us an opportunity. Let's see how the treatment will be after we submit to the Myriad Immortal Alliance. If it's truly as the Myriad Immortal Alliance's announcement says, and we can maintain our own survival space and a certain degree of independence, then directly surrendering might not be a bad method," Xu Bai suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>At these words, Liu San, Fang Zaiji, and Jiang Yushan all stared fixedly at Xu Bai, seemingly completely unprepared for him to say such things.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, however, was unfazed and said, "Old Liu, haven't you always wanted to release the other elders and disciples from the Pharmacist King's Cauldron? If the Myriad Immortal Alliance can provide cultivation techniques, then we won't have to worry about them killing each other due to the restriction of not being able to cultivate the same techniques."</p><p></p><p>"We've been keeping them in the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation for so long, which isn't really a good thing," Xu Bai said casually.</p><p></p><p>Liu San opened his mouth slightly, but then inexplicably stopped.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he said with some hesitation, "Isn't this a bit hasty?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai waved his hand, "Old Liu is overthinking it. The Taiyan Sect is adept at divination, if surrendering was truly harmful to them, they wouldn't act this way."</p><p></p><p>"Since they've chosen to surrender at this time, it means there's no major problem. In fact, the earlier they join the Myriad Immortal Alliance, the more benefits they may receive. After all, the Myriad Immortal Alliance needs to set a good example for the remaining small worlds. If they say one thing but do another, it will only backfire and provoke a crazy counterattack from the small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"For the current Myriad Immortal Alliance, unifying the Xuanhuang Realm and completing the upgrade of the Heavenly Mirror is the top priority. Some cultivation techniques are nothing to them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai explained in great detail, and his reasons were quite compelling. Liu San was unable to refute them for the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Great, surrendering is great! To be honest, I've always wanted to say this, but I was afraid the Sect Master would blame me, so I never brought it up," Fang Zaiji said cheerfully, fully supporting Xu Bai's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>"Old Fang, I've long wanted to go and take a look at the Myriad Immortal Alliance. I've heard their forging techniques have progressed far beyond ours back then. I really want to see it with my own eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Yushan, you also wanted to challenge that woman to a competition, right? In the future, you can do it openly."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>She was not originally a disciple of the Pharmacist King Sect, but had stayed within to suppress the Boundless Nether Abyss Qi. As for the Pharmacist King Sect, she didn't have much sense of belonging. So she had no objections to Xu Bai's decision.</p><p></p><p>Liu San sighed inwardly upon seeing this. At the same time, he looked at Xu Bai, and doubts arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's settle this matter for now. After the Taiyan Sect has completely submitted, we'll pay a visit in person to see if what the Immortal Alliance said is true."</p><p></p><p>"I imagine that day shouldn't be too far away," Xu Bai said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Mr. Fang. How is your research on the Termination Stone Tablet going?" He suddenly changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's previous smile instantly froze on his face.</p><p>He quickly looked at Liu San: "Old Liu, how are those little fellows doing? Have any of them succeeded in building a foundation based on my method?"</p><p></p><p>"If there's no result on your end, my research can't progress either."</p>

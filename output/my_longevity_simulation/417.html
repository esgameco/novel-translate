            <p>Using formations instead of heavenly laws, stealing their power.</p><p></p><p>Following like a shadow, overseeing the world.</p><p></p><p>Gathering cultivation to offer to the heavenly mystery.</p><p></p><p>Livestock and sentient beings, the great dao has no limits.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Official documents are circulated widely, condemning the evil of the soul-locking formation, and pointing out that the essence of the heavenly mystery soul-locking formation is actually the supreme treasure of the original Alliance of Immortals, the "Heavenly Mystery Mirror."</p><p></p><p>In order to transcend the Dao, the Heavenly Mystery Mirror requires cultivators of the world as sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan called on cultivators to unite and destroy the soul-locking formation, restoring the clear and vast universe of the Yellow Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Alliance immediately spread rumors, denying the matter and issuing a "Heavenly Punishment Order" against Gu Xinghan.</p><p></p><p>But over the past century, the various strange changes that occurred in the world after the spread of the Heavenly Mystery Soul-Locking Formation were clear to all.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance's vigorous denial could not silence the voices of cultivators from all over the world.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the cultivators were stirred with emotions.</p><p></p><p>However, the Alliance had ruled the Yellow Mystery Realm for thousands of years, and its power was still strong.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who dared to stand up and resist in response to Gu Xinghan's call were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Yet, these scattered rebellions were quickly suppressed by the Alliance's skilled celestial masters.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Xinghan himself had not been captured.</p><p></p><p>His efforts were not entirely in vain.</p><p></p><p>The seeds of doubt had been sown.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators became more cautious regarding the Heavenly Mystery Mirror and the Heavenly Mystery Soul-Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from all over the Yellow Mystery Realm began to secretly research methods to evade the Heavenly Mystery Mirror's surveillance.</p><p></p><p>Internally, the Alliance gradually began to show signs of division.</p><p></p><p>There were constant reports of Alliance officials expressing dissatisfaction with the soul-locking formation in private, followed by their capture and severe punishment as a deterrent.</p><p></p><p>In the year 268, an image was projected onto the green sky of the Yellow Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although it was quickly blocked and the subsequent content could no longer be seen clearly.</p><p></p><p>Just that brief moment of appearance was enough to completely stir up a wave of resistance among the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>A towering wall of unknown location reaching into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were suppressed and dormant within the wall.</p><p></p><p>On the wall, only faces with tightly closed eyes and eerie smiles were visible.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, this is the 'Eternal Immortal Wall.' For a hundred years, missing cultivators have all been locked up here by the Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>The urgent voice abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>Just a glimpse of it, but the dense faces on the "Eternal Immortal Wall" were enough to send chills down the spines of all surviving cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Being immersed in illusion, eternally suppressed, how was it different from death?</p><p></p><p>The Alliance's actions were truly shocking and exceeded the limits of endurance for the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>For a while, voices calling for the overthrow of the Alliance and the destruction of the soul-locking formation echoed throughout the Yellow Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Within the Alliance, the opposition forces that had been hiding since the spread of the soul-locking formation began to act.</p><p></p><p>The flames of war spread throughout the Yellow Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng's "Reviving Immortal" was also a member of several resistance organizations.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou, Xiao Heng, Su Xiaomei, and other former friends from the world outside the realm united and began a war against the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The combined forces of the vast majority of cultivators in the world were undeniably strong.</p><p></p><p>However, the number of Alliance "Celestial Masters" far exceeded people's imaginations.</p><p></p><p>The great battle lasted for three full years.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators dwindled, but the number of "Celestial Masters" remained constant.</p><p></p><p>If the "Celestial Masters" had not tried to capture cultivators alive as much as possible and not exerted their full strength, the cultivators would have been defeated long ago.</p><p></p><p>Despair became evident, and the light of victory could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators gradually fell into defeat.</p><p></p><p>The war slowly evolved into one-sided capture.</p><p></p><p>In the year 273, the "Celestial Masters" discovered the location of the "Reviving Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo and Su Xiaomei fought fiercely and died to cover everyone's retreat.</p><p></p><p>But they could not prevent the destruction of the Reviving Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng, Han Wuyou, and others thus escaped with their lives.</p><p></p><p>In the year 274, Xiao Heng, severely injured, passed away.</p><p></p><p>Before his death, he passed on the legacy of Reviving Immortal to Han Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou accepted tearfully.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the "Heaven Concealing Palm" and the "Furnace of Myriad Forms," Han Wuyou evaded capture and remained at large.</p><p></p><p>In the year 290, there were few surviving cultivators left in the world.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance's captures also gradually relaxed.</p><p></p><p>In the year 304, the Alliance issued a general amnesty, where cultivators around the world who were willing to return to the Alliance would practice the "Heaven-Repairing Record" according to quotas each year and all past grievances would be forgiven.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators began returning from the wilderness to the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the year 315, it was found that the cultivators who had returned were not in life-threatening danger, and more cultivators chose to return.</p><p></p><p>In the year 324, the Alliance began mysterious construction projects in various states. Huge golden obelisks rose from the ground in the central areas of each state.</p><p></p><p>In the year 369, Han Wuyou broke through to the later stage of Yuan Ying. Assuming the alias He Buyou, he returned to the Alliance and went into hiding again.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou discovered that the personnel in charge of the Alliance had all become Celestial Masters.</p><p></p><p>For the surrendered cultivators, the Alliance still provided corresponding cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>However, they now had to undertake more practice of the "Heaven-Repairing Record."</p><p></p><p>In the year 370, Han Wuyou temporarily halted his own cultivation and began to focus on studying the "Heaven-Repairing Record."</p><p></p><p>In the year 393, due to twenty years of unrelenting dedication to practicing the "Heaven-Repairing Record" and contributing a large number of "Heaven Dew Points," Han Wuyou was rewarded by the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He was granted the status of a Level 4 Celestial Master and given the position of "Imperial Immortal Official," responsible for managing and supervising the "Heaven-Repairing" work of over a thousand cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the year 404, across the Yellow Mystery Realm, huge pillars of light shot up from the top of the obelisks, piercing the sky.</p><p></p><p>The earth and the sky trembled.</p><p></p><p>The energy eruption of the obelisks lasted for a full seven days.</p><p></p><p>In the year 412, after nearly forty years of study, Han Wuyou synthesized the understanding of array formations he had gained from the disintegration disc and comprehended the function of the "Heaven-Repairing Record."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mystery Soul-Locking Formation sought to usurp the authority of heaven by stealing it.</p><p></p><p>However, the core of the soul-locking formation, the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, had overestimated its own power.</p><p></p><p>Only by overloading could it barely maintain the normal operation of the entire soul-locking formation.</p><p></p><p>This is why it needed external help to share some of the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators could communicate with the "Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>This was why the Alliance needed cultivators to practice the "Heaven-Repairing Record," a task that the Celestial Masters could not perform.</p><p></p><p>Han Wuyou vaguely saw a hope of subverting the soul-locking formation.</p><p></p><p>However, at the same time, he also felt some concerns.</p><p></p><p>Because if the Heavenly Mystery Mirror transcended and completed its transformation.</p><p></p><p>There would no longer be a need for cultivators to practice the "Heaven-Repairing Record."</p><p></p><p>Without revealing a sound, Han Wuyou kept this matter hidden in his heart and continued to conceal himself, waiting quietly for the right moment.</p><p></p><p>In the year 434, Han Wuyou was tasked to handle a "peculiar" event in Tianpanzhou with a team of Celestial Masters.</p><p></p><p>In a casual conversation, Han Wuyou learned that in recent years, there had been a gradually spreading trend of strangeness in the world.</p><p></p><p>In the year 459, the obelisks once again sprayed pillars of light outward.</p><p></p><p>A resounding roar echoed from the sky.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1091: The Master Wishes to Save the World</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan decided not to continue being mysterious and nodded, "Indeed. How did Fellow Daoist calculate it out?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke chuckled lightly with his slightly deep voice, "For someone who is against the world, where else would my information exist besides the Fallen Immortal Realm and the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly startled, "Against the world? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>This time it was Xu Ke's turn to be a bit puzzled, "Don't you know what I'm sitting on?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head frankly. </p><p></p><p>"Then why did you come looking for me?" Xu Ke stared intently at Li Fan, his expression unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"I sought out Fellow Daoist for two reasons. First, to help the younger generation of the Empire fulfill their lifelong wishes."</p><p></p><p>"Second, to understand the various arrangements left behind by Mr. Bai back then. After learning about his deeds, I was deeply convinced by his righteousness. But I was troubled by the incomplete information obtained in the Fallen Immortal Realm, which were just fragments of memories from different periods. So I spent quite some effort to find Fellow Daoist's hiding place, hoping you could help clear my doubts." Li Fan cupped his hands and said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Li Fan's attitude towards Mr. Bai, Xu Ke's expression immediately softened a lot.</p><p></p><p>"The Empire?" He narrowed his eyes, seeming to fall into recollection. </p><p></p><p>"It's the lineage Fellow Daoist left behind in the fallen world of Chi Jiutou back then," Li Fan spoke up to remind him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..." Only then did Xu Ke remember.</p><p></p><p>"Little Qing, Little Hong..." He showed a reminiscent look.</p><p></p><p>"The two are still well. It's just that the Divine Bird of Heavenly Fate has already fallen in order to search for Fellow Daoist's whereabouts." As Li Fan spoke, he passed over an object.</p><p></p><p>It was the last Divine Bird feather Little Hei left in the Beast Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke took the jet-black feather, his hands trembling slightly. A trace of grief flashed in his eyes. After a long while, he slowly said, "I let it down."</p><p></p><p>"Can... can I have this?" Xu Ke asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's just returning the item to its original owner. If Little Hei knew that the Divine Bird feather he left behind could finally return to Fellow Daoist, he could also rest in peace." Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Xu Ke solemnly put away the Divine Bird feather.</p><p></p><p>Atop the towering stone mountain, absolute silence fell once again in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of this desolate world, it seemed even the wind did not exist. </p><p></p><p>There was only the eternal stillness that had been passed down since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not in a hurry either. He just accompanied Xu Ke in experiencing this heavenly desolation, waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Xu Ke finally spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Due to the effect of the previous combo, his attitude towards Li Fan was now vastly different.</p><p></p><p>"How much do you already know?" Xu Ke asked.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, you and Little Hei went far to Nanming Sacred Beast Mountain, which was actually a task the Beast Taming Sect was instructed with by Mr. Bai. The series of actions that followed were all in order to ultimately cultivate the Void Rending Whales that could infinitely reproduce and open up the void. This was so the mortals of the various small worlds that were forced to migrate due to the birth of the Immortal Miasma could stay as far away from Xuanhuang as possible."</p><p></p><p>"As for the so-called Immortal Miasma, it was also a product of Mr. Bai reversing the principles. He, as the Great Celestial Venerate of Xuanhuang, ultimately ended his own life because of it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You really know quite a lot."</p><p></p><p>"You've put in effort."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, there are still..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"How many people still remember Mr. Bai?" Xu Ke surprisingly bowed to Li Fan to show his respect.</p><p></p><p>"But I have many doubts and things I can't let go of. I hope you can enlighten me, my friend. Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't be able to eat, sleep, or rest at night," Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"As the Great Heavenly Venerable of Xuanhuang, Mr. Bai was already the strongest in the Xuanhuang Realm at that time. Why did he choose to sacrifice himself and use the Immortal-Mortal Miasma to protect mortals?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the Immortal-Mortal Miasma was useful? If the Xuanhuang Realm had never given birth to the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, how would history have developed?" Xu Ke asked in return.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan slowly said, "Without the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, the calamity of incompatible cultivation methods would still exist. In the end, cultivators would still fall into the abyss of mutual suspicion and slaughter. In this process..."</p><p></p><p>"When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat also suffer. In the wasteland of cultivation, where could mortals find a place to survive? It would be fortunate if even one in ten thousand survived. Being infected by the Immortal-Mortal Miasma and then being forced to migrate to a small world, although many people would die in this process, it's almost negligible compared to the fate they would face if they stayed in the Xuanhuang Realm," Xu Ke said, helping Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan slowly nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"So, are you saying that Mr. Bai foresaw the fate of the Xuanhuang Realm for the next several thousand years at the beginning of the great calamity?" Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a difficult matter for Mr. Bai," Xu Ke said as a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case..." Li Fan's tone and expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity of incompatible cultivation methods was caused by the Venerable Who Spreads the Dharma propagating new methods. As long as this culprit is slain, wouldn't it be possible to turn the tide? Why did Mr. Bai choose to retreat instead of fighting?"</p><p></p><p>"He didn't care about his own life, but he didn't have the courage to fight against the Venerable Who Spreads the Dharma?" There seemed to be a strong resentment in Li Fan's voice.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal path ahead cannot be trodden; the Venerable Who Spreads the Dharma is above," Xu Ke sighed slightly after a moment of silence, uttering a lament that Mr. Bai once had.</p><p></p><p>He then explained, "First of all, it's debatable whether Mr. Bai was a match for the Venerable Who Spreads the Dharma, who had already successfully gone against the natural order at that time."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, in Mr. Bai's deduction, even if he killed the Venerable Who Spreads the Dharma, he would not be able to prevent the great calamity from descending upon the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen the beast-like monsters with human bodies and dog limbs in Ningyuan City's underground chamber?"</p><p></p><p>"I have."</p><p></p><p>"Those beasts, with human bodies and dog limbs. Mr. Bai once tried to save their lives. He collected suitable human limbs, wanting to remove their dog limbs and reattach human limbs."</p><p></p><p>"But because the dog limbs had long been integrated with their bodies in daily life, Mr. Bai's multiple attempts invariably failed."</p><p></p><p>"Most of them died directly during the transplant surgery. And even those that seemed successful often couldn't live more than a month after the surgery, dying miserably due to the crazy loss of vitality."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how hard Mr. Bai tried, the result remained the same," Xu Ke explained very calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly started to understand.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, the Xuanhuang Realm is facing the same situation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke sighed, "It's like trying to recover spilled water."</p><p></p><p>"The changes that the Venerable Who Spreads the Dharma imposed on the Xuanhuang Realm have already taken place."</p><p></p><p>"To try to reverse it, the effort required would be ten times, a hundred times more."</p>

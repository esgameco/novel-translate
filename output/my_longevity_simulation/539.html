        <h1>Chapter 539</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The man with a square face came to Li Fan and said in a deep voice. Previously, when Li Fan eavesdropped on the group of people discussing strategies, he heard from Zhou Kebao that this person's surname was Long.</p><p></p><p>Among this group of people, he was subtly in a leadership position.</p><p></p><p>And based on the commercial contract signed with Zhou Kebao, there was only one Long surname cultivator whose name was left on the contract.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan was able to know the identity of the cultivator in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Long Yueyou.</p><p></p><p>The surname Long was not very common.</p><p></p><p>Back when he was in the Tianquan State, he had heard of the reputation of the Tianquan Long family in the Tianji Temple of the Tianquan State.</p><p></p><p>Although not as prominent as the Dantai family, who held high positions in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But the Long family was very united, with family members spread across the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Even though most of them served in grassroots positions, when they united, they could definitely be considered as a force not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>But it was unknown whether Long Yueyou had any connection with this Long family.</p><p></p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, Li Fan pretended not to recognize Long Yueyou and asked, "Who is this?"</p><p></p><p>Long Yueyou smiled slightly without speaking arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>His companions eagerly introduced him to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly as Li Fan had guessed.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard about you! I've heard about you!" Li Fan hurriedly saluted, looking surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, deep down, his evaluation of Long Yueyou had diminished slightly.</p><p></p><p>Long Yueyou nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mind, and the two, accompanied by the crowd of cultivators, followed Zhou Kebao into the floating city in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The protective grand array was not activated, allowing smooth flight within the city.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's first time overlooking the Immortal City of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>With a different perspective, it had a unique flavor.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao introduced many facilities and layouts of the city to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Li Fan could see clearly without much explanation that this Immortal City was indeed the same as the cities he had seen before in the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After visiting various buildings in the city one by one and inspecting them in detail, Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>When the time was almost up, Zhou Kebao took out a token with colorful light and handed it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"This is the control pivot of this cave mansion. By refining it with your blood, you can control the corresponding formations inside the city as you wish."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the basic functions that all Immortal Cities have, we have added many special functions such as long-distance transmission, illusionary mirages, mustard level worlds, and more according to your requests."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you can also distribute some control rights of the cave mansion to other cultivators."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao earnestly demonstrated the power of this Immortal City's cave mansion to Li Fan and also made thoughtful reminders.</p><p></p><p>"Long-distance transmission consumes a large amount of energy. In addition to top-grade spiritual stones, it also requires precious materials like fracture sand, fixed track mysterious crystal, etc., which are expensive in the market. If you have a need, you can come to us for affordable prices," Zhou Kebao whispered, eliciting laughter from the surrounding cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Also, there is one thing to pay attention to. Long-distance transmission requires precise spatial coordinates of the target location. Otherwise, a slight offset in the transmission location is a minor issue, but if it gets lost in the endless void, that would be troublesome," Zhou Kebao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded to show his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, there is the self-destruct function that you mentioned several times," Zhou Kebao's tone suddenly became somewhat tense.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of your request, we have made quite an effort."</p><p></p><p>"When we were constructing the city, we added special materials throughout the city that can trigger the Annihilation Thunder."</p><p></p><p>"Also, we used the method of refining treasures to create this Immortal City's cave mansion. The treasures themselves have the function of self-destruction to harm enemies."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao paused.</p><p></p><p>"According to our estimation, if this cave mansion suddenly explodes, even a combined Daoist wouldn't escape severe injuries without precautions."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the surrounding area fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present, including Long Yueyou, looked at Li Fan with slightly eerie eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, nobody asked for details.</p><p></p><p>Just like Li Fan himself had said, as a former target of an ambush by spies from the Five Elders Council and with a substantial background, he carried this powerful weapon with him for self-defense.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that reasonable?</p><p></p><p>Regardless of Li Fan's true intentions, as long as this Immortal City's cave mansion was sold, and the contributions were obtained, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>If necessary, they would avoid causing trouble for this person in the future.</p><p></p><p>That was the thinking of Zhou Kebao and the others.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan completed the exchange of the remaining contributions, under the witness of everyone, he refined the colorful cave mansion control token.</p><p></p><p>Watching the huge city below, a feeling of being able to command at will emerged within him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, various methods of manipulating the functions also emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Immortal City's cave mansion turned into a tiny light particle and entered Li Fan's dantian.</p><p></p><p>"What a great treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan applauded.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any future needs, feel free to come to us," Zhou Kebao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you have enough contributions, everything is possible."</p><p></p><p>"I'll come bother you all often from now on!" Li Fan looked around, smiling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>This led to laughter in the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few courtesies, citing the imminent completion of the Cloud City and busy official duties as reasons, Li Fan left the advance realm.</p><p></p><p>"This person is quite audacious, and we shouldn't be enemies unless necessary," Long Yueyou evaluated as he watched Li Fan's disappearing figure.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, which normal cultivator would carry such a terrifying weapon with them. If he goes crazy and triggers it in an Immortal City…"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, tsk…"</p><p></p><p>"An ancient cultivator must be extraordinary. It would be strange if he holds a grudge against our Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it doesn't matter as long as we have the contributions. We'll just stay away from him when it's unnecessary."</p><p></p><p>The people present had indifferent expressions as they discussed with smiles.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the cave mansion Immortal City quietly sleeping in his dantian, feeling much more reassured.</p><p></p><p>With this destructive power for self-defense, along with the "Ten Thousand Human Blood" that had been bound in the spatial ring of Tranquil since forever, Li Fan believed that even facing a Daoist, he now had the capital to intimidate.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhou Kebao and the others, whether they would leave any backdoors in this cave mansion…</p><p></p><p>Well, its fate was already sealed.</p><p></p><p>Before the identity of "Ancient Tianji Sect Cultivator Li Fan" completely disappeared, it would also erupt with its last brilliant light within the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Various possible future scenes flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant, and he couldn't help but smirk.</p><p></p><p>With his thoughts settled, before the foundation-laying ceremony of Cloud City arrived, Li Fan returned to the Dust Ferry and sought to see the First Expert.</p><p></p><p>"Sir Expert, after months of hard work, the tasks of the Immortal Alliance are complete. I have carried out the tasks as you instructed."</p><p></p><p>"You see…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan expressed himself very tactfully, but he believed that the First Expert was a smart person who should understand the meaning behind his words.</p><p></p><p>Although the First Expert was concentrating with furrowed brows on the constantly flashing and changing information on the documents, he did not lift his head.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, the Immortal Alliance never fails to recognize those who have contributed."</p><p></p><p>"The corresponding rewards have long been set. Originally, the plan was to have someone from my side announce them at the foundation-laying ceremony. Since you are so eager, take a look at them first."</p><p>The First Expert lightly tapped the table, and a stream of light flew towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Unable to dodge, as the light entered his body, a piece of information suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"On behalf of Cloud Island, Island Lord Li Fan, for working diligently and overseeing the construction of Cloud City, a special promotion as the 'Secret Character Envoy' of Cloud City's Political Hall has been granted. While the Island Lord is absent from the State, has full authority to handle all political affairs."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, a reward of one hundred thousand contribution points and a first-class superior merit have been conferred."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the statement 'the Immortal Alliance never fails to recognize those who have contributed' sounds quite familiar."</p><p></p><p>"But the rewards for this task are commendable compared to the words."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Carefully reading the orders from the headquarters under the Political Hall, Li Fan discovered that the actual power he was about to assume as the 'Secret Character Envoy' was quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>In practice, many matters during the operation of various political affairs were decided by the 'Secret Character Envoys' of the Political Hall.</p><p></p><p>Only for special events reaching a certain level, do they need to be reported to the City Lord for approval.</p><p></p><p>After all, within a state, there were too many trivial matters, and if every matter, big or small, required the City Lord's personal attention, even with several avatars, they wouldn't be able to handle it.</p><p></p><p>At this stage, who wouldn't want to further advance and achieve the Dao?</p>

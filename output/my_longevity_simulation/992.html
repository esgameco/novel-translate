            <p>Li Fan's eyes flickered: "There's actually such a treasure! It doesn't matter if we can't use them for now, let's collect them first. Otherwise, if they fall into someone else's hands in the future, they might be used to break the Xuantian Suoyou Array."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Mo Rubin nodded: "Brother Xingwang makes sense. Such powerful tools indeed cannot be leaked out. When I return, I will start making arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the opportunity to let out a series of low, sinister laughs.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Brother Xingwang. Besides strengthening the Xuantian Suoyou Array, there's another matter I need your help with. It's related to the Xuantian Mirror, and after much thought, I can only feel at ease if you take action." Mo Rubin suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, we're all brothers, why be so polite." Li Fan was a bit displeased and glared at Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>This matter seemed even more important. After thinking for a while, Mo Rubin set up another layer of prohibition around them. </p><p></p><p>Only then did he quietly say: "According to my latest investigation, in the years that the Xuantian Mirror has been controlled by the Wanxian Alliance, it's very likely that it has split off a human avatar. I need you to find this avatar and slay it, completely cutting off its path of retreat!" A hint of murderous intent flashed in Mo Rubin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan also looked very shocked. </p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Mirror split off a human avatar? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin said solemnly: "When I first learned of this, I was also startled. But thinking about it later, it's probably precisely because of factors of being half-forced and half-cooperating that the Xuantian Mirror thoroughly integrated with the Wanxian Alliance. Spiritual artifacts have intelligence and naturally won't resign to being driven forever. Splitting off a human body to try to break the situation is to be expected."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured Brother Xingwang, to prevent the Wanxian Alliance from noticing, the strength of the human body split from the Xuantian Mirror definitely won't be too great. With your cultivation level, as long as you successfully find it, you will certainly be able to slay it."</p><p></p><p>"I'll lend you another magic treasure to guarantee your peace of mind." Saying that, Mo Rubin took out an extremely black metallic little book. </p><p></p><p>"This is the Ink-Stained Evil Book, it has a unique effect against spiritual artifacts and magic treasures. As long as the target is locked, it will release myriad ink-colored lights to pollute it. Brother Xingwang, with this treasure in hand, there is no possibility of failure."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a mere avatar, even without using this so-called Ink-Stained Evil Book, I can slay it." Although Li Fan said this, he still put away the black book magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>However, he then frowned: "The key is where to find the avatar of the Xuantian Mirror? It must be deeply hidden, will there be enough time?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin said with assurance: "The Dharma Transmitters have long been aware of the Xuantian Mirror splitting off an avatar. Therefore, they started secret investigations early on, but there hadn't been any definite gains. However, not long ago, the subordinates of Dharma Transmitter Feng finally found decisive evidence. Currently only I know about this matter, it hasn't been reported to the Dharma Transmitter Council yet."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan put on an interested expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Mirror has always been guarded by the Mirror Holders. If it split off a human body, it would be impossible without a Mirror Holder as an inside man. It has been initially confirmed that one of the Mirror Holders, [Cang], is that inside man!"</p><p></p><p>"Cang's daughter is Feixue Immortal, a figure of some renown in the Immortal Alliance. This woman mysteriously became pregnant years ago and gave birth to a son. I suspect that perhaps it has to do with</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Mirror is involved!" Mo Rubin explained.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that the son of that Feixue Immortal is the incarnation of the Xuantian Mirror?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The image of Shuofeng suddenly flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"That possibility cannot be ruled out. But back then, Feixue first held a martial arts competition to find a husband, causing a huge sensation. Then she suddenly became pregnant, shocking the world..."</p><p></p><p>"It was too high-profile. It was as if she was deliberately putting on a show to attract attention. So it's also possible that it was a deliberate attempt to create suspicion and use Shuofeng to conceal the true incarnation of the Xuantian Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, no matter what, their family must be connected to the Xuantian Realm. Because not long ago, we discovered that among Feixue's data in the Mirror, there was a change in an item that only the Xuantian Mirror had permission to modify, without any record of modification in the Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin explained.</p><p></p><p>"Feixue Immortal... how powerful is she?" Li Fan didn't dwell on the specific reasons and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Her strength is quite ordinary. But she is good at crafting magical tools. Cang is quite fond of her and provides her with unlimited resources, which has allowed her to master the art of crafting magical tools. However, it's ultimately just a minor skill. Brother Xingwang, you are most proficient in soul attacks. If you catch her off guard, she definitely won't be a match for you." Mo Rubin seemed to have a lot of confidence in Sun Xingwang.</p><p></p><p>"I'm proficient in soul attacks..." Li Fan was slightly stunned at this moment, and then he suddenly realized, "Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mo Rubin thought for a while and finally added another sentence: "If Brother Xingwang really doesn't have confidence at that time, just summon the divine demon incarnation that I'm attached to."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I can transmit a portion of my power. If we join forces, she will have no chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>Unlike ordinary major forces with deep roots, there were only Cang, Feixue, and Shuofeng in a single lineage.</p><p></p><p>But just the vast resources they possessed, as revealed in the report, were shocking.</p><p></p><p>"The places where Feixue often appears have all been marked out."</p><p></p><p>"She is extremely fond of her son Shuofeng and summons him to meet every once in a while. And it's often in a cave dwelling outside the Immortal Alliance's Heavenly City."</p><p></p><p>"So it's best to wait until they meet and capture them all in one go," Mo Rubin said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we kill the incarnation of the Xuantian Mirror and cut off its retreat, and then use the Soul Sealing Formation to force it, we can have a talk with the Xuantian Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, that fellow is still very arrogant." There was some displeasure in Mo Rubin's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant." Li Fan recalled the very familiar cold mechanical voice in the Tianxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>The two continued to discuss the details of the action, and only then did Mo Rubin prepare to leave.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave this hidden Dongtian, Li Fan suddenly asked, "After thousands of years, now that we brothers have reunited, why not re-enter the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal Sect?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the phantom of a faceless stone statue slowly appeared in the air.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin looked up, and his body subconsciously retreated slightly.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of hard-to-detect wariness flashing in his eyes, Mo Rubin did not speak.</p><p></p><p>He just shook his head and then disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Before leaving, Brother Xingwang, you might as well take a closer look at this cave dwelling. Perhaps you will gain something."</p><p></p><p>The voice slowly echoed in the cave, and Mo Rubin's figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Fan began to observe the cave dwelling again.</p>

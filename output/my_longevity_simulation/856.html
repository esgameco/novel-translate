            <p>"Fish bite the bait because they want to eat. What do these orbs of light in the endless starry sky seek?"</p><p></p><p>Sitting atop the boundless starry sky, Ji Shaoli pondered this question.</p><p></p><p>"From the fleeting glimpses, it can be seen that within these orbs of light, there should be items, cultivation techniques, divine abilities, combat experiences, and the like."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"This fishing pool may be a celestial tool with a certain threshold, specifically designed to distribute rewards."</p><p></p><p>As his gaze swept over the white, cyan, blue, purple, and orange orbs of light, Ji Shaoli was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The more valuable the things are, the higher the level they belong to. Therefore, the more difficult it is to attract them."</p><p></p><p>"But now, I only have my consciousness remaining. Even if I want to fish up those white orbs, I can only rely on luck. Let alone the higher-level orbs."</p><p></p><p>Despite trying various methods, Ji Shaoli still couldn't add "bait" to the dangling fishing line.</p><p></p><p>And his luck was really bad.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, not even a single white orb was attracted by him.</p><p></p><p>And in this starry sky, there seemed to be a time limit as well.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding starlight grew dimmer, and after layers of ripples dissipated, Ji Shaoli returned to the real world.</p><p></p><p>This time, the fishing ended with an empty rod!</p><p></p><p>Feeling dissatisfied, Ji Shaoli immediately prepared to cast another line. However, he recalled that there was only one chance per day to trigger the power of the fishing starry sky.</p><p></p><p>He could only take a deep breath and wait for tomorrow to come.</p><p></p><p>In the next ten days, Ji Shaoli participated in fishing once a day.</p><p></p><p>He only fished up a total of six orbs.</p><p></p><p>Five white and one blue.</p><p></p><p>The white orbs contained only things like ores and spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Nothing of great value.</p><p></p><p>However, the blue orb opened to reveal a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"'Taikang Geng Jin Sword Qi'?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli carefully read the contents of the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, it's not a product of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>This "Taikang Geng Jin Sword Qi" came from the Sword God Sect of the Taiyi Realm.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Taiyi Realm was roughly the same as in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, there were five great cultivators who had cultivated to the pinnacle but did not ascend to the Immortal Realm. Instead, they transformed their bodies into the Dao.</p><p></p><p>They merged with the Heavenly Dao of the Taiyi Realm and were called the "Five Taiyi Emperors" by the cultivators of the Taiyi Realm.</p><p></p><p>Taikang was one of these five emperors.</p><p></p><p>"How is this only blue quality?"</p><p></p><p>After reading through the contents of the jade slip, Ji Shaoli couldn't help but be a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>When he tried to cultivate this "Taikang Geng Jin Sword Qi," he finally realized.</p><p></p><p>It's all about adapting to local conditions.</p><p></p><p>This sword art was a cultivation technique specifically created according to the specific conditions of the Taiyi Realm. The necessary condition for cultivation was the power of Emperor Taikang.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no such thing as "Taikang" in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, this cultivation technique couldn't be practiced.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for its quality of being in line with the Dao, it would probably be classified as white.</p><p></p><p>"This fishing platform even re-evaluates the value of items based on the environment?" Ji Shaoli couldn't help but be amazed.</p><p></p><p>Although he had almost no gains, Ji Shaoli was not angry.</p><p></p><p>He had observed Zhong Shentong's fishing process over the past ten days.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhong Shentong had been in contact with this fishing platform earlier and seemed to have grasped some tricks.</p><p></p><p>Out of ten chances, not a single cast was empty.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only eight white and two blue, it was still much better than Ji Shaoli!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Ji Shaoli decided not to waste any more time.</p><p></p><p>On this day, after Zhong Shentong had eaten and drunk his fill, he was about to go for his afternoon nap.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, his face changed.</p><p></p><p>A golden light shield enveloped the entire small temple, including the fishing pond.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden snake-like thunderbolts were forming in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>As if they were about to strike down at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" The young disciple washing the dishes was shocked and lost color.</p><p></p><p>"Liuli, quickly come behind me!" Zhong Shentong grabbed the young disciple and protected him behind his back.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he took out a command flag and inserted it into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Earthy yellow energy formed a spherical shield, enveloping the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"There may be some misunderstanding in this!" </p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong said loudly.</p><p></p><p>But Ji Shaoli saw clearly that although he said this, he had already quietly taken out a small wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Even though his realm was higher than the other party's, Ji Shaoli still felt a trace of fatal crisis from this small sword.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli did not show himself, but only said coldly: "Daoist Zhong, if you don't want the matter of the fishing pond to be known to the world."</p><p></p><p>"I advise you not to resist!"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I don't have any malicious intent either."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that as an angler, I'm equally curious about it!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhong Shentong completely lost his composure.</p><p></p><p>His biggest secret had been exposed, and Zhong Shentong's heart was in a panic.</p><p></p><p>His face kept changing expressions, but in the end, he still put away the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, please come out and meet me! What's the point of hiding?" He said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Daoist Zhong, you don't know how many treasures you've gotten from that fishing pond. You have to be careful." Ji Shaoli was not moved by his words.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he asked about the method to fish up higher quality light spheres.</p><p></p><p>"Don't even think about deceiving me, I know everything about your gains in these ten days." Ji Shaoli said in a playful tone.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's heart completely sank.</p><p></p><p>The other party had been watching him for so many days.</p><p></p><p>And he was completely unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to say that the other party's strength must far exceed his own.</p><p></p><p>His strength was already overwhelming, yet he was still so cautious...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong couldn't help but curse inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Left with no choice, he could only tell the insights he had summarized himself.</p><p></p><p>"On the fishing platform, the more times you cast the rod, the stronger the connection with it."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there were other ways to directly increase the connection in the past. But now, we can only rely on the number of times and time to grind it out."</p><p></p><p>"The light spheres seem to have spirituality and can sense the contents of the bait in the intention."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong honestly confessed.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli listened carefully while discerning the truth and falsehood in his words.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have to worry about me deceiving you, you'll know when you try it yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Since the day I discovered the secret of this fishing pond, I knew that I couldn't monopolize it alone forever."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that this fishing pond seems to be integrated with heaven and earth, fixed in this place. It can't be moved or taken away at all."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"I only hope that you will spare Liuli's life. If you want to kill, just kill me."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ji Shaoli finally showed his figure.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Daoist Zhong, you should put away your magic weapon."</p><p></p><p>"I don't intend to monopolize the secret here either."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong heard this and showed a suspicious look on his face.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 798</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This jade plate looked extremely extraordinary at first glance. Touching it with one's hand, it felt even more like the tender skin of a young girl. Originally, Gu Xinghan had planned to turn this object in. But somehow, as if possessed, he actually concealed the fact that he had found the jade plate. </p><p></p><p>The young Gu Xinghan was not someone who would lie. So for several days in a row, he felt guilty like a thief and didn't dare to raise his head to directly face the seniors in the valley. Fortunately, he originally had a more solitary personality, and after the initial chaos, the cultivators in Changsheng Valley were all busy recuperating. So no one discovered his abnormality. Gradually, he put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>A child's curiosity is very heavy. Being very certain that he had dug up some treasure, whenever Gu Xinghan had a gap of free time, he would be busy secretly studying this jade plate. But what made him feel extremely disappointed was that even after many days passed, he still couldn't figure out what was special about this jade plate and what its specific use was. It seemed to really just be an ordinary piece of jade, just more beautiful.</p><p></p><p>But due to the fantasy that exists in everyone's heart, Gu Xinghan didn't abandon it. He just stored the jade plate inside his dantian, nourishing it with his own spiritual energy and carefully taking care of it. As the Medicine King Valley was completely rebuilt, Gu Xinghan's attention was forced to shift.</p><p></p><p>Because the previous sect master Li Fan unfortunately perished in the catastrophe, the future direction of the Medicine King Sect became a big problem. The inheritance of the Medicine King Sect did not rely on bloodline to maintain order in the first place. Li Fan was able to inherit the position of sect master only because of Liu Ruchen's will. And now that Li Fan had died suddenly, the candidate for the next sect master had not been determined at all.</p><p></p><p>If it was simply ranked according to strength, then without a doubt, the sect master should be born from among the three Harmonious Dao cultivators: Liu San, Jiang Yushan, and Fang Zaiji. Jiang Yushan and Fang Zaiji had little interest in power. The most likely possibility was for Liu San to inherit.</p><p></p><p>But... Firstly, Liu San believed that he was Liu Ruchen's servant and was unwilling and unworthy to assume the position of Medicine King Sect Master. Secondly, what the Medicine King Sect was facing now was not only the issue of the succession of the sect master. The bigger crisis came from the thousands of cultivators who were thrown out of the Medicine King Cauldron. </p><p></p><p>They were all ancient method cultivators, and basically all of them cultivated the Medicine King Sect's true teaching, the "Scripture of Saving the World and Eternal Life". Once they awakened at the same time, a killing catastrophe would likely erupt within the Medicine King Sect. Although they had all been forced back into slumber by the joint efforts of the three Harmonious Dao experts, without a supreme treasure like the Medicine King True Cauldron, it could only be maintained temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Considering various reasons, Liu San and the others finally discussed and decided to submit to the Myriad Immortals Alliance, just like the Taiyi Sect. As it concerned the future fate of the Medicine King Sect, Liu San went to observe it personally to put his mind at ease. After returning, the three Harmonious Dao experts unified their opinions. </p><p></p><p>Liu San took the initiative to formally visit the Myriad Immortals Alliance and begged to submit to them. Meanwhile, Fang Zaiji took advantage of this time to distribute the "Final Disc" to some key figures in the sect, especially those young geniuses he had brought back. He explained the usage method to them and warned them never to leak this matter.</p><p></p><p>Although the Medicine King Sect was not as illustrious as the Ten Immortal Sects, because the disciples inside were all kind-hearted and engaged in acts of saving the world and people, even after thousands of years had passed, there were still many legends about them circulating. In terms of fame,</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Medicine King Sect was not below the top ten sects.</p><p></p><p>As the second small world power to actively surrender, and with its overall strength still quite intact, the Medicine King Sect was highly valued by the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>A Harmonious Dao Immortal named [Qing Yun] was dispatched to handle this matter.</p><p></p><p>Led by Liu San, Qing Yun, who had inspected the Longevity Valley, was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Without much commotion, the two sides quickly agreed on the Medicine King Sect's entry into the alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect would still maintain relative independence and freedom. The disciples of the sect only needed to carry the Tianxuan Mirror like ordinary Immortal Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for the fact that many cultivators from the Medicine King Sect had already infiltrated the Immortal Alliance, Qing Yun did not investigate deeply.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the news of the Medicine King Sect joining the Myriad Immortals Alliance spread throughout the Xuanhuang Realm, shaking the world.</p><p></p><p>It accelerated the surrender of more and more small worlds.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance did not break their promise, and various forms of support were quickly put in place.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the first thing to be carried out was the scanning of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Realm and the Longevity Valley were all included in the illumination of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect also received the assistance of cultivation techniques as they wished.</p><p></p><p>When the dormant cultivators were awakened one by one and converted to the new techniques, the crisis of the Medicine King Sect was finally resolved.</p><p></p><p>With the crisis resolved, it was time to look forward.</p><p></p><p>In the current cultivation world, the Medicine King Sect could be considered a major power.</p><p></p><p>However, no leader had emerged for a long time, truly making it a group of dragons without a head.</p><p></p><p>Although they had surrendered and were nominally led by the Myriad Immortals Alliance, under such high autonomy, the power of the sect leader was still immense.</p><p></p><p>They could also directly report to and contact the Immortal Alliance, reaping more benefits.</p><p></p><p>Even Harmonious Dao cultivators would rarely be unmoved by this.</p><p></p><p>Thus, after a period of open and secret struggles, in order to prevent the Medicine King Sect, which had just recovered its vitality, from disintegrating again, it was finally decided through a vote that Liu San would inherit the position of sect master.</p><p></p><p>The young Gu Xinghan was not very clear about the entire process.</p><p></p><p>He only saw many cultivators in strange clothes coming in a daze, and then many elders were awakened.</p><p></p><p>After a period of chaos, the final result was generally good.</p><p></p><p>He had a very deep impression of Liu San, the old man who had personally taught them at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, what did he teach back then?</p><p></p><p>The young Gu Xinghan couldn't help but fall into a confused contemplation.</p><p></p><p>This contemplation lasted throughout the entire sect ceremony.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he still couldn't figure out the reason.</p><p></p><p>Later, when all the sect disciples were required to enter the Tianxuan Sub-mirror and generate their own Tianxuan Mirror, his attention was temporarily diverted.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Xinghan, the Tianxuan Mirror, a treasure with countless functions, was much more interesting than that jade plate.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in studying its various uses, he gradually forgot about the jade plate.</p><p></p><p>Until one day, when he officially started cultivating again, he discovered that something was a bit off.</p><p></p><p>When his little friends began to try [Borrowing the Wonders of Heaven and Earth to Build the Dao Foundation], Gu Xinghan found that he seemed to have already built his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan was a little dazed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare ask others about the abnormality in his body and could only slowly ponder over it.</p><p></p><p>And it was during this process that the jade plate, which had always been silent and seemed like an ordinary object, finally showed a reaction.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1015: Transmitting the Dharma and Leaving the Treasure Vault</p><p></p><p>Ever since Tian Yang appeared in front of him, Qiao Gong Jushi's gaze had never left him.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Jushi sized him up and down, clicking his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"How extraordinary, how extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a perfect fusion of man and object..."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, our Tianji Realm's chief elder, Shangguan Tuo, once wanted to completely control [Zu], so he took a risk and merged his own spirit into the damaged core of [Zu]."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, he didn't succeed, and nearly caused the destruction of the Tianji Realm. Since then, similar attempts have been absolutely forbidden. Although our Tianji Realm's artifact refining techniques are quite impressive, to have such a near-natural, perfect state like this..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Jushi's eyes were filled with surprise and excitement, even gradually revealing an obsessed look.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Yang was wooden, he had long since left the state of being disoriented. He vigilantly sized up Qiao Gong Jushi and quietly stepped to Li Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this is the wonder of the myriad realms of immortal cultivation, each with its own marvels. This method is called Body Transforming into the Dao, allowing one to transform the body into an object, merging the object and self. Qiao Gong, my friend, after observing for so long, do you have any ideas for enhancing Tian Yang?" Li Fan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Ideas, I have too many ideas! I simply..." Qiao Gong Jushi looked as if he had discovered some novel toy, his face flushed red with excitement. </p><p></p><p>"If Fellow Daoist Tian Yang had appeared in our Tianji Realm back then, it would have certainly caused a huge sensation! It might have even completely changed the history of the Tianji Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The Tianji puppets we imitate still have a considerable gap from their prototype, [Zu]. The most crucial point is that material resources are limited, and each time they need to be completely fabricated before being compared. Because there's no way to communicate with the puppets, but if we had Fellow Daoist Tian Yang's assistance..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the many functions of Zu could be realized one by one..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it may require the assistance of Fellow Daoist's Dao Flower power." At this point, Qiao Gong Jushi turned his head to look at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Fellow Daoist Qiao Gong, feel free to proceed." Li Fan gave his word very generously.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Tian Yang's doubts about whether Qiao Gong Jushi was reliable, Li Fan secretly reassured him for a while before finally dispelling Tian Yang's misgivings.</p><p></p><p>Watching Qiao Gong Jushi and Tian Yang disappear together, Li Fan flashed into the central underground secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Can Source Power be used to enhance magic treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan summoned the Terminal Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he did not choose to use the Source Power essence generated by the Faceless Stone Statue. Nor did he use the Source Power gathered from the spiritual power of living beings.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he only used the cultivation base feedback he obtained from practicing the Sitting Immortal Formula.</p><p></p><p>One of the Tribulation Bodies in his dantian shattered.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's guidance, the vast amount of stored cultivation base surged towards the Terminal Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, Li Fan discovered that the vast majority of the Source Power was not absorbed by it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it rebounded back intact.</p><p></p><p>If there was no cultivator to contain it, it would eventually slowly dissipate between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan also keenly noticed that there was still an extremely small portion of Source Power that vanished into thin air during contact with the Terminal Dissociation Disc!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, generating a new Tribulation Body while re-gathering the dispersed Source Power.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it was like panning for gold in the great waves.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the Terminal Dissociation Disc eventually underwent changes.</p><p></p><p>However, just by observing the appearance, it was difficult to discern the true changes.</p><p></p><p>The occurrence of the separation discs. However, the improvement in the speed of the separation disc's extrapolation formation was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>"Some magic treasures, when used by cultivators for a long time, will slowly give birth to spiritual intelligence, be used as easily as one's own arms, and exert even stronger effects. In fact, it's somewhat similar to this process."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the increasingly deep and obvious bond between himself and the Ultimate Separation Disc, Li Fan had a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, every object has its own upper limit.</p><p></p><p>Through the extraction of source power, the ability of the Ultimate Separation Disc was ultimately increased by about one-fifth.</p><p></p><p>After that, the source power was useless to it.</p><p></p><p>"It's better than nothing. I just don't know, after the Separation Disc absorbs the nine discs of this world and undergoes a qualitative change, whether this method can still be used to temper it again." Li Fan secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>What you think is what you get.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Li Fan finally received a message from Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>The meeting place was still that hidden Dongtian, and the nine Separation Discs were already in hand.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan saw Mo Rubin again, he found that there seemed to be some changes in him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? You seem a bit different?" Li Fan asked directly in a very straightforward manner.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin smiled and didn't hide it: "Hahaha, as expected, I can't hide from your Dharma eyes, Brother Xingwang!"</p><p></p><p>"I have worked hard for the Wanxian Alliance, settling one trouble after another. My contributions are evident to all, and the Transmitter Council naturally has rewards bestowed upon me." Mo Rubin said with a hint of pride on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the Wanxian Alliance all yours Transmitters'? You can take whatever you want. What rewards do you need?" Li Fan said half-jokingly, half-sarcastically.</p><p></p><p>"You can't say that. The Wanxian Alliance has always belonged to Senior Transmitting Dharma Lord. We Transmitters, Mirror Holders, and Illusory Truth Sages are just managing it on behalf of the Transmitting Dharma Lord." Mo Rubin said with a righteous face, as if he meant it.</p><p></p><p>Then he laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"But the things in this [Myriad Realms Treasury] are truly extraordinary, one by one. It's an unexpected joy to have a big harvest this time." Mo Rubin didn't say what he had obtained, but instead introduced this Myriad Realms Treasury.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that in this Myriad Realms Treasury, there were many treasures that Transmitting Dharma Lord had plundered from the corpses of those immortal realms that had merged with the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Darkest Starry Sea, only the Xuanhuang Realm survived.</p><p></p><p>Other immortal realms had either fallen into the Immortal Ruins or had been devoured by the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The treasures of all realms were all in this treasury.</p><p></p><p>The name "Myriad Realms" was truly befitting.</p><p></p><p>Those that could be valued by Transmitting Dharma Lord and included in his collection were naturally of great value.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, there was even an image of Transmitting Dharma Lord diligently pulling the remnants of immortal realms in the starry sky, first collecting the treasures inside, and then merging them into Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Myriad Realms Treasury can only be opened by the joint decision of the Transmitter Council. I can't even fill my own pockets. Otherwise, I could have let Brother Xingwang enjoy the benefits too." Mo Rubin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded with a cold face: "They are just external objects. Like these nine Separation Discs, they are all tools. In the end, we still have to rely on ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mo Rubin's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Then he solemnly said, "Brother Xingwang is right. My state of mind has become a bit too elated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly and said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>He only looked at the nine crystal-clear, white-glowing Separation Discs that Mo Rubin casually handed over while talking.</p><p></p><p>He forcibly suppressed the surging desire that suddenly emerged from the Ultimate Separation Disc in his sea of consciousness.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 282</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, she did not directly make a move. </p><p></p><p>Her big eyes turned slightly as she said "Please!", and then stood still on the spot.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Shuo Feng also did not choose to act.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he also stood motionless in place, not moving for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo looked at the two suspiciously, not knowing what they were up to.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, a trace of embarrassment appeared on Shuo Feng's face: "Little sister, didn't you say you wanted to fight me? Why aren't you making a move?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei replied seriously: "My elder brother often teaches me that when walking outside, one must respect the elderly and love the young. You are so much older than me, so I must definitely let you make the first move before I counterattack!"</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng seemed to be stunned by Su Xiaomei's words.</p><p></p><p>Then he said solemnly: "I already know your intention. However, I can barely be considered half your elder, so of course I have to yield a bit to the younger generation."</p><p></p><p>"You should still make the first move!"</p><p></p><p>"No no no, you go first..."</p><p></p><p>"You first!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo watched this bizarre scene of the two mutually yielding in front of him, and his expression couldn't help but turn strange.</p><p></p><p>"This person called Shuo Feng..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of how he had repeatedly provoked Shen Yuruo before, and the trace of disappointment that appeared on his face after seeing that she still did not make a move.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo couldn't help but realize something.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it seems little sister you figured it out. The cultivation technique I practice is a bit special." After a while, seeing that the two were still at an impasse, Shuo Feng did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>He stated frankly: "If I don't receive an attack from someone else, I have no way to make the first move. So, please little sister, you go first!"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei had a look of "as expected", appearing a bit smug.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, she became solemn.</p><p></p><p>A layer of faint red flames appeared on her body, actually using her foundational stage magic item [Spirit Fury Fire] right from the start. </p><p></p><p>The air distorted for an instant, and Su Xiaomei disappeared from her original spot.</p><p></p><p>And beside Shuo Feng, at the same time, six identical figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>They all had Su Xiaomei's appearance, but the expressions on their faces were each different.</p><p></p><p>Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, pensiveness, worry.</p><p></p><p>Along with that, the flames on their bodies were all different colors.</p><p></p><p>The six avatars surrounded Shuo Feng, using fists, palms, fingers, legs, elbows, shoulders, each unleashing close combat techniques.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by colorful flames, they were about to strike Shuo Feng's body.</p><p></p><p>"Flashy and fancy!"</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng's voice rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A flash of white light.</p><p></p><p>Drawing several folded lines in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what happened, but in an instant, all six of Su Xiaomei's avatars were struck.</p><p></p><p>They paused in midair for a moment, then exploded with bursts of air, sent flying out at a horrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this..."</p><p></p><p>Before Shuo Feng could finish speaking, those six flying bodies suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Reappearing beside Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their speed was unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Only the direction changed to charging at Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>Another flash of white light.</p><p></p><p>The six flying bodies were sent flying again.</p><p></p><p>Even faster than before.</p><p></p><p>But it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Just moments later, Su Xiaomei's flying bodies, carrying boiling flames, returned to approach Shuo Feng at an even greater speed.</p><p></p><p>What greeted them was still a dazzling white light.</p><p></p><p>Sent flying again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The speed at which Su Xiaomei's avatars attacked became faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>And the flashing of that white light from Shuo Feng also became more and more frequent.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhang Haobo, who had been observing the battle for a long time, finally saw through it.</p><p></p><p>That white light was a sword.</p><p></p><p>A wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Every time the white light flashed, the wooden sword would appear.</p><p></p><p>Then Shuo Feng would use the flat of the blade to lightly pat Su Xiaomei's body.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of speed..." Zhang Haobo was extremely shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shuo Feng's relaxed appearance, it was clear he was not using his full strength.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the strength he displayed was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo admitted to himself that if he switched places with Su Xiaomei at this moment, he would likely be defeated within these few short exchanges.</p><p></p><p>"However, little sister also doesn't seem to be using her full power..."</p><p></p><p>In the center of the battlefield, Shuo Feng seemed to have tired of this back-and-forth game.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. But it ends here!"</p><p></p><p>His expression turned solemn, and this time when he made a move, he used the edge of his sword.</p><p></p><p>The white light flashed, instantly sweeping across the six avatars in succession.</p><p></p><p>Countless silver lines exploded from within the avatars' bodies.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the avatars were cut into countless pieces.</p><p></p><p>Scattered all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, the expressions of both Zhang Haobo and Shuo Feng did not change at all.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe!"</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As if each had its own consciousness, they squirmed on the ground, moving closer to each other.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, they reassembled into six avatars again.</p><p></p><p>After "reviving", their individual expressions seemed to become even richer.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Surrounded and attacked again, the expression on Shuo Feng's face finally turned a bit serious.</p><p></p><p>Six identical wooden swords instantly appeared around him.</p><p></p><p>Each facing one of Su Xiaomei's six avatars.</p><p></p><p>While blocking the avatars, Shuo Feng swept his gaze around, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, Shuo Feng appeared six zhang to the left, in a seemingly empty spot.</p><p></p><p>He gripped another wooden sword in his hand, lightly waving it forward.</p><p></p><p>A hidden figure was suddenly struck out by Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next second, the smile on Shuo Feng's face disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Because the expression on this hidden figure's face was full of worry.</p><p></p><p>It was not the real body, but the avatar of worry!</p><p></p><p>With one sword shattering the avatar, Shuo Feng looked back at where the six avatars were before.</p><p></p><p>He saw Su Xiaomei's real body mischievously winking at him.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng's face was expressionless as six wooden swords slashed, instantly cutting the six bodies in half.</p><p></p><p>"Where else can you escape to?"</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng looked at the fragments of the total seven figures, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Escape? From the beginning, I've been right here."</p><p></p><p>As if responding to his words, Su Xiaomei's voice rang out behind Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes turned crimson red, and the fragments all over the battlefield suddenly disappeared, returning to her real body.</p><p></p><p>Six different expressions rapidly changed on her face.</p><p></p><p>Finally settling on anger.</p><p></p><p>The redness in her eyes spread, dyeing her hair red.</p><p></p><p>Eight times the power suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei fiercely punched Shuo Feng's body!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>A light flashed across the blue cloth robes on Shuo Feng's body.</p><p></p><p>He himself did not move an inch.</p><p></p><p>Only the corner of his robe fluttered.</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng's expression did not change in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Only, in his eyes, a sword shadow suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Right at this moment, Su Xiaomei sighed repeatedly: "No more fighting! No fun!"</p><p></p><p>Shuo Feng's movement paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he turned his head to look in the direction of Stone Details Mountain where they came from.</p><p></p><p>The world seemed to brighten a bit in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A sword light flew into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>As if colliding with something.</p><p></p><p>The sound of rumbling and muffled groans faintly transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the few peach blossom petals slowly falling in the distance, Shuo Feng snorted coldly and closed his eyes to retract his sword.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, Li Fan, who had taken in this entire battle, couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>"Good swordsmanship!"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"Originally, there was only half a year to prepare. Now, due to the influence of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, the entry examination has been forced to be postponed. It's still unknown when it will be held, but I'm already eager to give it a try." </p><p></p><p>"Ahem." He Zhenghao let out a light cough, his face showing a confident expression.</p><p></p><p>"A blessing in disguise, a blessing in disguise indeed!" The others also sighed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Although you have already taken two rounds of special medicine, you must not let your guard down against the Immortal-Mortal Miasma." At this time, Ji Shaoli solemnly reminded them.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, a quite sensational event occurred. In our Congyun Sea, a cultivator named Wen Yue, relying on the fact that he had been infected with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma and had gained so-called immunity, wanted to test whether the Immortal-Mortal Miasma existing in mortals' bodies would still affect him."</p><p></p><p>"In front of many cultivators, he used mortal blood to irrigate his own body."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, he died on the spot, turning into a skeleton. The scene was truly horrific!" Ji Shaoli sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others were all stunned: "There are actually such foolish people in the world? Joking with their own lives?"</p><p></p><p>Then they were shocked again: "In that case, our immunity to the Immortal-Mortal Miasma is just an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded slightly: "Regarding this matter, the Immortal Alliance has issued an announcement and made an explanation. The existence of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma is the principle of heaven and earth. We can only adapt to its existence, but it will not disappear."</p><p></p><p>"So, in the end, nothing has actually changed. It's just that many cultivators have died in vain?" He Zhenghao couldn't help feeling at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo said hatefully: "Damn it! If I reach the Dao one day, I will definitely reverse this principle!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Pei has great ambition!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone sighed with deep feelings.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Ji Shaoli waved his hand to interrupt them.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine to vent a little. What we can do is just endure and survive."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the mutated outbreak of this Immortal-Mortal Miasma may not be a bad thing for us cultivators who have survived." Ji Shaoli said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How so?" Everyone's eyes focused on Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how many institutional cultivators in Congyun Sea alone have been reduced in this calamity?" Ji Shaoli asked with a rather mysterious smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone's eyes suddenly light up, Ji Shaoli telepathically said a number.</p><p></p><p>"More than five hundred?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. If Congyun Sea is like this, it's even more imaginable what the situation is like in the world."</p><p></p><p>"These positions vacated by the fallen cultivators are all opportunities for us survivors." Ji Shaoli's tone was faint.</p><p></p><p>"When the vast majority of cultivators are still immersed in the pain brought by the Immortal-Mortal Miasma calamity, those with foresight have already begun to operate secretly and quietly."</p><p></p><p>These words made everyone's hearts beat with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji, so in that case, do we still need to take the examination?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, although we have made full preparations, the competition in this examination will definitely be even more intense..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone had different expressions. Ji Shaoli said solemnly, "If there are no surprises, the scale of this examination may far exceed expectations. Not only the number of cultivators recruited, but also the quality of the positions!"</p><p></p><p>"Those positions that used to require decades of training to be promoted, may become..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Those with outstanding achievements can directly assume positions!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps they will leap from a fish to a dragon, defying the heavens and changing their fate!"</p><p></p><p>The eyes of everyone present, especially He Zhenghao, instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, in addition to positions within the system, scarce resources such as cultivation techniques and cave heavens are also very likely to be opened up. In short, the primary task of the Immortal Alliance at present is to spare no effort to restore to the level before the catastrophe," Ji Shaoli added.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji, do you mean that the Immortal Alliance is afraid that the Five Elders will take advantage of this weak recovery period to make trouble?" someone asked.</p><p></p><p>"But it's strange. When the Immortal Alliance was hit the hardest before, the Five Elders surprisingly didn't kick us while we were down."</p><p></p><p>"What's so confusing about this? If the Immortal-Mortal Miasma erupted on our side, how could they remain unscathed on their side? In my opinion, the Five Elders must have also suffered heavy losses. Now it's about who can recover faster, and whoever does will gain an advantage in the game."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, this is indeed a rare opportunity for us ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Silently listening to everyone's discussions, Ji Shaoli did not explain.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had previously sent Lin Ling to make contact with the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>While making a fortune by selling the question bank for the Immortal Alliance's entrance exam.</p><p></p><p>He also secretly investigated the situation of the Five Elders under the outbreak of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Myriad Immortal Alliance at the epicenter, their losses were much smaller.</p><p></p><p>Due to the certain delay in the spread of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, by the time it entered the territory of the Five Elders, they had already received news of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma outbreak in the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They took precautions in advance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Five Elders were ruled by five venerable ones.</p><p></p><p>With orders issued one after another, the cultivators all obediently stayed at home. This greatly slowed down the spread of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was how to deal with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>In fact, compared to the Myriad Immortal Alliance, the Five Elders had more detailed records.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the ancient cultivation world, it was the various cultivation sects that directly confronted the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>The other party did not disclose specific measures.</p><p></p><p>But it was true that the Five Elders did not suffer heavily in this catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that puzzled the Five Elders was that the Celestial Venerable personally issued an edict vetoing the plan to attack the Myriad Immortal Alliance while taking advantage of the chaos.</p><p></p><p>The order of the Celestial Venerable cannot be disobeyed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Beast Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang did not unleash their true strength.</p><p></p><p>They only suppressed their combat power to the Transformation Realm, fighting against the beast races surging like tides.</p><p></p><p>This was naturally Li Fan's order.</p><p></p><p>In addition to collecting beast cores to serve as materials for the Immortal Spirit Pagoda to transform spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was to temper Lin Ling and Tian Yang's actual combat standards through battles.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang was fine.</p><p></p><p>In the previous battle with Moshi, as a newborn tree spirit, Lin Ling's nearly blank combat awareness and completely instinctive attacks were really a bit unworthy of her Harmonized Realm cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan had Tian Yang take her to train in the Beast Realm during this rare peaceful time.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing how many beast races they had slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Under the baptism of endless fresh blood, Lin Ling's originally immature and innocent face had already been stained with a bit of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Her moves became more and more proficient, and images would even spontaneously flash in her mind from time to time, teaching her how to fight more efficiently.</p><p></p><p>Her actual combat power was rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>They looked towards the distant tower.</p>

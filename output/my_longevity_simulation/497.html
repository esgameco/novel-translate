        <h1>Chapter 497</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon seeing the stark contrast between the detailed list sent by the fat man Zhou Kebao, Li Fan instead put away his thoughts of pretending to have an outburst and calmed down for the moment.</p><p></p><p>A slight adjustment resulted in a fifty percent difference in quantity.</p><p></p><p>This could only mean that the actual quantity on the list was much larger than the one he held in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some instances of selfishness, fraud, and embezzlement within the Wan Xian Alliance, everyone at least knew how to pretend and cover up on the surface.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't be so brazen and openly outrageous!</p><p></p><p>The reconstruction of a large fairy city like this, with Zhou Kebao blatantly eating kickbacks in front of him, Li Fan, the acting island lord, and the amount of materials consumed being so high...</p><p></p><p>There was only one explanation, that this group of people secretly creating obstacles were targeting him, Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the process of him becoming the acting island lord might indeed be legal and compliant.</p><p></p><p>But that didn't prevent those who were aware of this news from seizing the opportunity, launching a conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was for Li Fan, or perhaps it was for the substantial contributions on Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, Li Fan had not deliberately concealed his actions of promoting common true leaves and consolidating the contributions of other cultivators for reinvestment. Apart from the transactions with the Empire, every other deal was traceable.</p><p></p><p>With just a rough calculation, one could understand the staggering amount of contributions Li Fan carried at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Interests move the heart, being targeted was also normal.</p><p></p><p>Besides interests, there was also hatred.</p><p></p><p>Dantai Can, who had suffered losses in the process of promoting common true leaves before, might also take advantage of this process to push forward.</p><p></p><p>Usually, actions were planned before being taken, Li Fan's mind raced as he glanced back and forth on the list.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, he nodded slightly and solemnly put away the list.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, pretending casually, he asked, "Friend Zhou, besides this detailed list, is there anything else you have to give me?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing else, nothing else," Zhou Kebao said with a big smile, shaking his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, seeing this, gave a cold snort in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he did not confront him for the time being, just nodded and said, "Reconstructing the fairy city is a major matter. It involves various aspects and is quite intricate. I need to carefully consider how to proceed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated for a moment, pretending to think.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "In that case, I will make some preparations first. When the formal work begins, I will contact you again, Friend Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao patted his chest and promised, "Certainly! Chief Li, if you have any requirements, feel free to mention them. I will definitely cooperate fully and ensure the tasks entrusted by the Economic Son are properly completed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond but stared at Zhou Kebao coldly for a while.</p><p></p><p>Then he left, flying away from the dust boat in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Watching Li Fan's gradually disappearing figure, Zhou Kebao's smile slowly faded, replaced with disdain and mockery in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how you end up in half a year..." With a cold snort, he took out a communication talisman, contacted someone without revealing who it was, and conveyed everything that had happened here.</p><p></p><p>Little did Zhou Kebao, who thought he had Li Fan in his control, know that every move of his was being observed by Li Fan from all angles, under the watchful eye of the unknown assassination mechanism.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed suspicious..."</p><p></p><p>"It looks like we can't count on the assistance from the First Economic Son's side. To rebuild the fairy city, we must rely on the individuals under my control..."</p><p></p><p>After returning to the island from the sky, Li Fan watched quietly as Tianyang stood beside the children of Li Realm, feeling slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"With Tianyang's cultivation, at least it can intimidate some small fry. It shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not enough..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a shining jade token with the word "Ten Thousand" engraved on it and carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>It was the Island Lord's token given to him along with the appointment letter for the acting island lord.</p><p></p><p>Besides symbolizing the position of the Island Lord, the most significant function was to allow him to view and contact all the cultivators under his jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>A network of interpersonal relationships appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan was at the top.</p><p></p><p>Below, depending on the different departments, array hall, martial hall, sky machine hall, as well as island garrison, and external personnel of various departments, were listed accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Each node represented a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>By focusing on a single node, he could view the basic information of the corresponding cultivator and directly contact them.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected there to be so many cultivators under the system of the Misty Cloud Sea..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but marvel slightly.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the common positions, there were also some unusual and peculiar positions he had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>Such as [Ten Thousand Fairy Alliance Misty Cloud Sea Feedback Collection Specialist], [Stone Linzhou Residing Misty Cloud Sea Liaison Officer], [Geomancy Supervisor], and so on.</p><p></p><p>One face after another emerged.</p><p></p><p>Many of these people Li Fan had also seen before. Originally, he thought they were ordinary wandering individuals, only to find out they held the identity of a system cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, the number of cultivators who were still alive was still considerable.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that to rebuild the fairy city, the main force must be selected from this group."</p><p></p><p>"But the quality of personnel varies. I have only superficial relations with them; how can I select suitable candidates?"</p><p></p><p>Furrowing his brows, Li Fan eliminated the cultivators who had already been captured by the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Among the remaining cultivators, he carefully reviewed them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze paused on one of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, he is..."</p><p></p><p>An idea struck Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>In the Misty Cloud Sea, in a secretive cavern unknown to others.</p><p></p><p>High Yuan, who was in seclusion, suddenly woke up from a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>During the attack when the Five Elders Society raided the Misty Cloud Sea and forcibly took control of the Ten Thousand Fairy Island, causing hundreds of cultivators to fall, High Yuan happened to be out on official business, luckily avoiding the catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>However, the terrifying scene witnessed from afar at that time lingered in his mind, becoming his mental demon.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the Ten Thousand Fairy Alliance to be so unbearable, not even showing any reaction when an entire fairy city was taken away..."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, they first sealed off the Misty Cloud Sea and vented their anger on their own people."</p><p></p><p>"I've been conscientiously guarding the gate of the Political Hall for decades..."</p><p></p><p>"I might as well defect to the Five Elders Society..."</p><p></p><p>Wiping the cold sweat from his forehead, High Yuan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the communication talisman within the system that he thought would never be contacted lit up unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>High Yuan's heart immediately began to beat faster, thinking that his thoughts of defecting were quickly discovered.</p><p></p><p>With a trembling hand, he picked up the talisman, carefully examined it, and a mysterious brilliance appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Acting Island Lord, Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>Due to the character limit, the translation is provided in parts.

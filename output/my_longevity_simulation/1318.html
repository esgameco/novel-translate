        <h1>Chapter 1318</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The Remnant Wall...such an anomaly has actually appeared at the edge of the starry sea?" Qiao Gong said in a dazed voice. </p><p></p><p>"No wonder all the extinct worlds from back then have vanished without a trace, they've actually all converged at the foot of this towering wall. The Remnant Wall stretches endlessly - what immense power could have created such a sight?" Bai Hua's face was also full of shock.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had survived from the destruction of the starry sea, personally witnessing countless cultivation worlds turn into desolate wastelands. Therefore, compared to others, they could appreciate the awe-inspiring Remnant Wall that seemed to have no end even more profoundly.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to..." As if recalling some memory buried deep in his mind, Yin Shangren pressed his head, about to speak but stopped himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at him but did not inquire further. Instead, he solemnly added: "Outside the Remnant Wall, there is also a Relic Wall acting as a barrier. These two walls guard the towering wall, echoing each other from afar and forming an array. The journey ahead will be even more arduous than going to the center of the starry sea before, you may even risk catastrophe and destruction..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze swept across everyone: "Whether to go or not is up to you to decide."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you half a year to think it over. Don't blindly pursue higher levels of power. Even if you do nothing more than cultivating the Xuan Huang Evil Thought Returning Art, after the Xuan Huang realm completes its upgrade, you'll still gain more than enough benefits."  His figure slowly disappeared along with his words.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong and the others had varying expressions.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the moment they saw the wondrous sight of the Remnant Wall, they were all shaken to the core and had the thought of witnessing it personally. But Li Fan's words served as a wake-up call.</p><p></p><p>In this starry sea, wonders were often accompanied by immense power. And immense power also meant crisis.</p><p></p><p>It was the same for the Remnant Wall and the Celestial Tombs.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, to stimulate the Xuan Huang realm's ability to devour and digest only required three or four Remnant fragments as catalysts. It did not require everyone to take action.</p><p></p><p>If this journey was successful, there would still be opportunities in the future to help the Xuan Huang realm ascend through other services.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, everyone began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, of course, noticed all the subtle changes in their expressions. Having gone through multiple reincarnations, Li Fan understood the personalities of these people very well. With just a glance, he could guess their general thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"To walk the path of the Dao is the innate nature of cultivators. Yet this path is fraught with peril and hardship. Inner worries, hatred, and fear are obstacles to progress."</p><p></p><p>"How difficult it is to touch the so-called Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Watching Qiao Gong and the others face the choice of life and death, and the pursuit of the Dao, a trace of enlightenment could not help but rise in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Awaiting the fusion of the heavenly spirit embryo and the Dao of the supreme Xuan Huang realm did not mean Li Fan's cultivation would stagnate before then.</p><p></p><p>"Every breath and action is cultivation."  </p><p>"The myriad thoughts of all beings seem like books of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>On the Lecture Platform, in the Great Xuan realm, the thoughts and ideas of countless beings, like twinkling stars, all flowed into Li Fan's mind one after another, perceived by him.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the driving force propelling Li Fan's cultivation wheel forward.</p><p></p><p>His decision to become the Teacher of Heaven and Earth in this life was not a mere whim.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, the Sage Emperor lectured about the concept of "Sounding the Dao for Longevity" when discussing the Dao.  Shuo's reflection of the Dao revealed the true meaning of Sounding the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Through repeated attempts of "making the false real", Li Fan vaguely confirmed the little Loli's speculation about the Sage Emperor's new method.</p><p></p><p>The projection of the Dao from above was indeed easier to touch the essence of the Dao itself.</p><p></p><p>If not a projection, the great Dao is hidden in the deep blue, invisible. One could only rely on cultivation and comprehension to seek traces of the Dao, and then deepen understanding step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dao has myriad paths, for ordinary cultivators to behold the true face of the Dao, how difficult it is?</p><p></p><p>Even the True Immortals of the Celestial Tombs, aided by the "Starving for the Dao" inscription, still sat in meditation for millions of years without a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>If True Immortals were like this, let alone those below True Immortals?</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad beings, Li Fan's situation was extremely special. Possessing the Revert to Truth, he was more like already standing at the end of this Dao, almost able to touch its ultimate form. Hence, the seemingly inconceivable miracle of "making the false real" could be manifested with just the Deity Transformation realm.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the true and false transformations involved in Revert to Truth, Li Fan could previously only gradually comprehend by increasing the "bond" between himself and Revert to Truth.</p><p></p><p>However, after deepening his comprehension of "making the false real", and previously encountering the profound symbol hidden deep within the Abyss race's bodies, Li Fan vaguely sensed that he could use analogies and extrapolation to infer and accelerate the deepening of true and false transformations from other traces of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The projection of the great Dao, from above to below, forms the various realms.  </p><p></p><p>Everything in the Xuan Huang realm - matter, consciousness - can be seen as a projection of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Only that it has already become the furthest end of the projection. To trace the projection of the Dao upwards from below is an almost impossible task to complete.</p><p></p><p>However, as the only surviving land in the starry sea, the Xuan Huang realm has already gathered too many impossibilities.</p><p></p><p>Such as the wondrous existence of the Eternal Lingering Thoughts that resonates with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>In this life, Li Fan had previously visited the Heavenly Sun Palace at the bottom of the Cong Yun Sea and collected the Heavenly Sun remains containing the Eternal Lingering Thoughts.  </p><p></p><p>He tried various methods but was unable to sense the resonance of the Dao within them.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan would not give up studying the resonance of the Dao because of this, instead turning to seek substitutes of a lower level than the Eternal Lingering Thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In the 119th life, Li Fan used the image of the Faceless True Immortal as a guide to create the Net of Compassion of the Worldly True Immortal. Among its myriad believers, only Kou Hong and Dao Xuan Zi's thoughts shone most brilliantly and uniquely.</p><p></p><p>Even within the Net of Quintessence Source Power, they stood out prominently.  </p><p></p><p>They were undoubtedly the most sincere seekers of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan thought this was simply due to their innate virtuous natures, holding no other benefits for him. But now, Li Fan realized that Kou Hong and Dao Xuan Zi's sincere thoughts of seeking the Dao could very likely be the budding of Eternal Lingering Thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if he could guide them to continuously deepen their seeking of the Dao, when Kou Hong and Dao Xuan Zi died, there was a chance the Eternal Lingering Thoughts would be born.</p><p></p><p>"If I cannot utilize the Eternal Lingering Thoughts, can I not use a lower substitute either?"</p><p></p><p>The discovery from Kou Hong and Dao Xuan Zi gave Li Fan inspiration. Combined with relying on the fusion of the supreme Xuan Huang realm's heavenly spirit embryo and Dao, this naturally led to Li Fan becoming the Teacher of Heaven and Earth in this life.</p><p></p><p>On the Lecture Platform, the thoughts of myriad beings converged, like the stars in the sky, shining with varying brightness.  </p><p></p><p>Those that stood out would receive Li Fan's focused attention.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he had yet to discover any existence that could potentially ascend to the Eternal Lingering Thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan believed that when the Lecture Platform eventually expanded to the entire Xuan Huang realm, in addition to Kou Hong and Dao Xuan Zi, he should be able to reap some others as well.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Just wait until the flowers bloom and bear fruit, then we can harvest.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao projects into all realms, and all living beings in the world have some ability to resonate with the traces of the Dao. These are the materials I can use to increase my understanding of the transformation between truth and falsehood."</p><p></p><p>After personally experiencing the power of the truth being false, Li Fan had already decided to raise the priority of promoting this to second highest, only below preserving his life. </p><p></p><p>As for realms, cultivation levels, treasures and such, these were things that could be obtained in every reincarnation cycle, and could not be compared to this.</p><p></p><p>"However, these brilliant thoughts of living beings should be like the eternal lingering thoughts - only able to comprehend the Dao once. I don't know how many people in the whole Xuanhuang Realm can give me a surprise."</p><p></p><p>His divine consciousness swept over the land, watching the endless stream of Daxuan citizens still heading towards the central lecture platform. Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>His form flashed, and in the next moment, Li Fan had already left the small world of Daxuan and arrived in Qingling Province of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The extremely vast underground space was filled with an intangible, bizarre aura. Even with Li Fan's current cultivation, he had still gathered enough primal essence to use as protection before daring to come here.</p><p></p><p>Golden Dao threads formed a protective array, separating Li Fan from the formidable forces within this underground space.</p><p></p><p>"I guessed correctly. This ancient celestial-mortal miasma has also undergone a metamorphosis along with the Xuanhuang Realm," Li Fan concluded after careful observation.</p><p></p><p>In the 119th world, an earthquake occurred in Qingling Province, causing the sealed ancient celestial-mortal miasma here to leak out, resulting in a bloody storm. After gathering in the underground space for thousands of years, this ancient miasma seemed to have undergone some kind of change, becoming even more powerful than the original celestial-mortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>The celestial-mortal miasma was created by the White Lord in defiance of the principles of Heaven and Earth, yet it is also a part of those principles.</p><p></p><p>After this world's Xuanhuang Realm began evolving towards a super Xuanhuang Realm, the ancient miasma in this underground space also began accumulating the power for metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"The mortal can also slay the celestial..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stretched out his hand, and the golden protective array immediately opened a hole. The formless power took advantage of this to invade and begin corroding Li Fan's palm.</p><p></p><p>With a furrowed brow, Li Fan decisively cut off his entire arm after only an instant of perception.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, primal essence reformed the defenses, blocking the invasion of the celestial-mortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>In the time it took to breathe, Li Fan's severed arm had already regrown.</p><p></p><p>As for the original arm left in the ancient miasma, it was devoured by the surrounding formless power until nothing remained, not even a withered bone, only a pile of sand-like residue.</p><p></p><p>Among his bound items was an item called the Essence of Ten Thousand Lives, refined from the blood of tens of thousands of prisoners.</p><p></p><p>Yet the celestial-mortal miasma force contained within the Essence of Ten Thousand Lives was not even a trace of this enhanced ancient miasma.</p><p></p><p>"If the super Xuanhuang Realm completes its final metamorphosis, to what extent will the miasma here be enhanced?"</p><p></p><p>According to Li Fan's deductions, under the combined impetus of the Stellar Restoration Force, the legacy of the Heavenly Lord's celestial spirits, the remnants of other realms in the stars, and so on, it would be possible to elevate the Xuanhuang Realm to a level infinitely close to the celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Or, in a sense, this super Xuanhuang Realm would be the newly ascended celestial realm. It would only be slightly weaker than the ancient celestial realm that had already been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, even if it cannot slay celestials, it may be possible to severely injure them."</p><p></p><p>"More crucially, this ancient celestial-mortal miasma can continuously strengthen as the Xuanhuang Realm strengthens. Its innate nature of slaying celestials determines its indispensable role."</p><p></p><p>"One day, when I have the ability to truly propel the Xuanhuang Realm to ascend to the celestial realm, then this miasma will be a true celestial-slaying weapon!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan's gaze towards the formless power in this vast space became different.</p><p></p><p>From the experience of the Celestial King of Xuantian in the past, and some clues glimpsed from beyond the high walls, it seems that achieving celestial status within the stars may face unimaginable dangers.</p><p></p><p>The birth of a celestial domain may also be eye-catching. But after all, it is not Li Fan's main body, so even if some crisis does arise, it can give Li Fan sufficient buffer time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his own celestial ascension versus propelling the Xuanhuang Realm to establish a celestial domain, which is more difficult?</p><p></p><p>Unless one is insane, they would definitely choose the second option.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, the conclusion was exactly the opposite.</p><p></p><p>"The legacy of the Heavenly Lord and the celestial spirit aura in celestial artifacts are resources I can use infinitely."</p><p></p><p>"Besides this, there are also materials and power from the entire expanse of stars."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it is feasible."</p><p></p><p>"I just need to wait until the end of this world to see how much the super Xuanhuang Realm I helped create differs from the legendary celestial realm, then I can make a judgment."</p><p></p><p>The change in the ancient celestial-mortal miasma opened up Li Fan's thinking.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, there are innumerable manifestations of laws.</p><p></p><p>"The entire Xuanhuang Realm can be seen as my weapon against celestials."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Celestials and mortals are different.</p><p></p><p>But if this mortal has the backing of an entire celestial realm,</p><p></p><p>Then the final result will be another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>"The situation beyond the high walls is unclear."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it is easier to explore using the realm as a base."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully set up formations around this underground space,</p><p></p><p>Preventing others from discovering the sealed celestial-mortal miasma here.</p><p></p><p>"Continue growing. When the limit is reached, that will be the day to forge the sword."</p><p></p><p>After ensuring there were no flaws, Li Fan finally left.</p><p></p><p>"If the plan is feasible, then it's time for me to collect some anchors."</p><p></p><p>"For slaying celestials, the more the better."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan quietly went to the void of the Five Phase Heavenly Realm in Tianling Province.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Five Phase Heavenly Realm had not fully descended yet.</p><p></p><p>It was suitable for absorbing and replenishing anchors: a newborn heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had previously used the Five Phase Heavenly Realm for charging once before, so he didn't know if it would still react this time.</p><p></p><p>With practiced ease, he arrived at the intertwined black and white gestating space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan focused his mind, comprehending the sensations transmitted by the Zhenzhen.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit hard to swallow, but I can force it down."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Li Fan opened his eyes, his expression a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>He calmed his mind, and his divine consciousness instantly enveloped the entire Five Phase Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>After a short moment...</p><p></p><p>The heavenly realm inexplicably disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And the number of anchors Li Fan could use increased by one.</p><p></p><p>A premonition welled up in Li Fan's heart - if he tried again, the Zhenzhen might truly lose its appetite.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the heavenly realms that had already descended before, the current Five Phase Heavenly Realm was still in gestation.</p>

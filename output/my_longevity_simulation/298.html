        <h1>Chapter 298</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the [Ghostly Hairpin] as a unique item, Li Fan's ability to sense souls was greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>The success rate of identification nearly doubled.</p><p></p><p>From one in a thousand to two in a thousand, it was a huge leap!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it is indeed useful. Unfortunately, my original foundation was too poor. To improve to a qualified level, I still need to continue strengthening my training."</p><p></p><p>As he fully immersed himself in the process of comprehending souls, the golden light content in the Soul Gathering Bead rapidly declined.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, when the fifteen lucky ones who had been eliminated all returned to the Huanyu Branch, the second stage of closed training officially began.</p><p></p><p>The students had heard more or less about the "accidental" deaths of Dantai Tao and others, and each had a subtle expression. However, everyone understood that there was more to this matter than meets the eye, and no one discussed it publicly.</p><p></p><p>In addition to learning the inner formation structure of the [Tianxuan Soul Locking Formation] in the second stage of training, they continued to deepen the accuracy of sensing the traces of soul contracts. The requirement was to achieve 100% accuracy.</p><p></p><p>This was a bit difficult for Li Fan and other subpar substitute members. Fortunately, Ji Hongdao also considered this point and "thoughtfully" prepared additional special training for these bottom-ranked students.</p><p></p><p>"You were originally eliminated, but due to some changes, you have returned here again."</p><p></p><p>"This is your fate. Although your talent is inferior to others, your fate is better than those geniuses."</p><p></p><p>"Fate... is very important."</p><p></p><p>"The reason you were eliminated before was basically because your perception of soul contract imprints was substandard. The wasted Soul Gathering Bead indicated that you are not good at this path."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, to ensure you qualify, we can only change the method."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao looked at Li Fan and the others expressionlessly, and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, several golden chains stretched out from the virtual space in all directions, binding their hands and feet.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the somewhat stunned expressions of the students, Ji Hongdao said coldly, "This method is extremely dangerous. If you can't hold on, becoming a mindless idiot is the best result. Destruction of body and soul, or seeking death for relief, are all forms of liberation."</p><p></p><p>"The reason this method was not used before is because the mortality rate is too high for ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of unusual color flashed in Ji Hongdao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Since your fate is good, you should be able to endure it without much problem."</p><p></p><p>With a light clap of his hands, the surrounding scenery suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The sound of surging waves came, and Li Fan and the others were bound by golden chains on the reef stones by the sea.</p><p></p><p>Although their limbs were locked, it did not affect their own perspective.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and looked at the "ocean" in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The aura coming from this ocean made him feel a little horrified.</p><p></p><p>Listening carefully, in the sound of the waves, there seemed to be countless wailing and painful voices mixed in.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan's face slightly changed, as if he had realized something.</p><p></p><p>"What's in front of you is the famous [Resentful Soul Sea] of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"For hundreds and thousands of years, the broken souls of the Five Elders Association cultivators who died in battle in the territory of the Wannian Alliance would be absorbed into this [Resentful Soul Sea]."</p><p></p><p>"Accumulated over time, no one knows how many souls have gathered in this sea."</p><p></p><p>"Each drop of seawater may be a combination of the souls of several or even a dozen cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Since you can't distinguish the soul contract imprints one by one, then let the quantity be greater."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao said coldly, his eyes slightly lowered.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the [Resentful Soul Sea] seemed to be summoned.</p><p></p><p>Waves surged without wind, and billows suddenly formed.</p><p></p><p>Huge waves dozens of feet high suddenly formed and crashed towards Li Fan and the others who were locked on the reef by the sea.</p><p></p><p>The moment they came into contact with the seawater, countless scenes and emotions instantly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether the other party could accept such a huge amount of information in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>The condensed souls spread in Li Fan's sea of consciousness in an extremely crude and eager manner.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly occupying all the blank spaces.</p><p></p><p>The impact of the huge amount of information came suddenly, and Li Fan almost lost his mind and self under the unexpected situation.</p><p></p><p>Cursing inwardly, Li Fan struggled to maintain the existence of his self-consciousness under this wave of souls.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Hua Dao Stone in his mind operated at full power, quickly classifying, archiving, and processing the vast amount of information mixed in the countless souls.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed that due to the danger to his life, the Xuanhuang Heart Refining Chant was also operating at an increased efficiency, which was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing all the negative emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, and fear in the souls.</p><p></p><p>With both working together, it seemed like a long time had passed before Li Fan barely managed to hold on.</p><p></p><p>From the corner of his eye, he looked at the surrounding cultivators. One of them couldn't bear it and his body directly dissolved under the impact of the [Resentful Soul Sea] waves.</p><p></p><p>His soul also became a part of the seawater.</p><p></p><p>Only the occasional movement of black eyeballs indicated that their minds had not been completely erased.</p><p></p><p>There were only two or three people who had recovered from the impact of the soul tide like Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, the hideous expressions on their faces showed the pain they were suffering at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Also putting on an expression of unbearable suffering, Li Fan didn't have time for many thoughts before the second wave followed.</p><p></p><p>Sinking, resisting, recovering, and sinking again.</p><p></p><p>In this cycle, who knows how long it took before the seawater finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The chains disappeared, and everyone fell powerlessly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, your fates are not bad. Out of fifteen people, eleven actually endured." Ji Hongdao said in some amazement.</p><p></p><p>"The way of fate is indeed mysterious. Although invisible, it truly exists. You should know that according to our previous statistics, the survival rate of ordinary cultivators under the impact of the [Resentful Soul Sea] is only one percent."</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" Ji Hongdao seemed very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Today's special training is over. You can go back and rest first!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Continue tomorrow." Ji Hongdao added.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone had lingering fears and looked terrible.</p><p></p><p>They were able to hold on today purely by luck.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if they can persist tomorrow?</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, some people wanted to back out.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to the prospects of the formation path, their own lives were still a bit more important.</p><p></p><p>However, what these people got was only Ji Hongdao's cold words: "Want to quit at this time? It's too late."</p><p></p><p>"The [Resentful Soul Sea] is so precious that it's not easy for our Strategy Hall to apply for it once."</p><p></p><p>"Either endure it or become a part of it."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators whose requests were rejected sat on the ground powerlessly, their faces ashen.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had no fear.</p>

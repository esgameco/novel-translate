            <p>"Just this broken thing?" Dongfang Yao carefully examined the colorful talisman in front of his eyes and was somewhat skeptical.</p><p></p><p>"I have heard of this item before," Li Fan squinted his eyes and recalled, saying, "It seems that when there are compulsory missions issued by the Immortal Alliance, cultivators can use this talisman of exemption to directly ignore the mission requirements."</p><p></p><p>"Right!" Huangfu Song nodded happily, sweeping away his previous frustration.</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of this?" Dongfang Yao muttered softly, still puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song gave him a look, "It may not be useful in normal times, but during critical moments, this can be a lifesaver! For example, in case of a major battle with the Five Elders' Association and the need to summon cultivators to the battlefield. Others can only seek help from their relatives or go to the frontline obediently. But with this thing, we can calmly avoid disasters."</p><p></p><p>"In a sense, this is like a life-saving pass!" Dongfang Yao suddenly realized the preciousness of this item and carefully put it away.</p><p></p><p>"Right, the key is, this talisman of exemption is not personalized. Any cultivator, as long as they hold this item, is considered its owner. If someone offers a high price, we can also trade it away." Huangfu Song added, "To prevent malicious intent, you and your brother should not carry this item with you in normal times, keep it in the Tianxuan Mirror space."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao nodded repeatedly in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, was checking the map in the Tianjian: "Although we have the talisman of exemption as compensation, our Qingxuan points have returned to zero, so it was all in vain. What are your plans for the next step? Continue through the white mist or stop here?"</p><p></p><p>"The curtain has just been raised, how can we give up so easily? Now that we have a map in hand already, we can directly head towards unknown areas, increasing our exploration efficiency significantly," Huangfu Song's choice was obvious, his eyes shimmering with boundless greed.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao naturally agreed with Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clapped his hands in approval, "The more setbacks, the braver one becomes, that's what makes a hero! In that case, let me go and replenish our supplies, and we can set off immediately."</p><p></p><p>"But..." Li Fan looked troubled, "I'm afraid it would be difficult to find a longevity item as cost-effective as the Changsheng Pill again."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>"I can't let you always suffer losses, I'll think of a way," Dongfang Yao took the initiative to share the burden with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The three agreed to meet again in two days and then went their separate ways.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>In the Beast World.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai kept his eyes closed, seemingly asleep, floating in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Seventeen petals of Tianling flowers quietly suspended above his forehead, emitting a faint milky white light.</p><p></p><p>Around Xu Bai, there seemed to be some mysterious power brewing, causing the air to distort. Layers of colorful light rings spread outward, centered around him, expanding towards the outer layer.</p><p></p><p>Looking down from the earth in the Beast World, it seemed as if there was an extra rainbow-like sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Facing this strange scene, countless beasts felt awe and prostrated themselves on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Disciples of Yaowang Sect looked puzzled and engaged in discussions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with Liu San standing by to protect Xu Bai, they dared not say anything too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Several days ago, Liu San had already found Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was very interested in the deal mentioned by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, he insisted on seeing with his own eyes whether the Tianling flower in Li Fan's hands was as incredible as rumored before agreeing to the transaction.</p><p></p><p>With the original body of Li Fan unavailable and unable to contact, Liu San hurried back with Jiao Xiuyuan's communication talisman, intending to report the matter directly to the clone.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in the Beast World, however, Liu San found Xu Bai in a state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to disturb him, Liu San decided to guard him instead.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, the wisdom that the Sect Master has gained this time seems quite remarkable," Fang Zaiji's voice sounded in Liu San's ear.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji himself did not appear, but the voice came from a golden eyeball.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of his research on the Yaowang True Cauldron, creating a set of ninety-nine eighty-one "Eyes of Shared Vision" based on the inspiration of the "Great Dream Early Autumn Formation" that connected everyone's consciousness in the Yaowang Cauldron. Holders of this item could not only communicate with each other but also synchronize and share what they saw and heard, even sensing changes in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth as if they were there.</p><p></p><p>"You could simply communicate with me directly in my mind, but you insist on speaking in my ear," Liu San's face turned slightly unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand, this is called a sense of ritual," Fang Zaiji snorted and retorted immediately.</p><p></p><p>Liu San turned his head and glanced at the golden eye.</p><p></p><p>The golden eye immediately flew aside, "Old Liu, let's talk properly. This thing is not easy to refine..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San was not accustomed to him, and was about to take action, but suddenly felt a sensation in his heart and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Bai, who was in a dream, suddenly raised his right hand. Using his finger as a brush, he waved in the air.</p><p></p><p>Countless light spots gathered towards the sky and after a moment, a vivid painting of a raging river appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Go!" Xu Bai pointed downwards.</p><p></p><p>The painting turned into a stream of light and fell towards the Beast World.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A rushing river came from the sky, appearing out of nowhere, impacting the earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's hand did not stop.</p><p></p><p>Majestic peaks, ancient green pines, cracked gorges...</p><p></p><p>One by one, magnificent landscape paintings appeared, flying to various parts of the Beast World like shooting stars.</p><p></p><p>So the earth kept rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Ancient trees emerged from the ground, mountains and rivers rose, the plains roared and split.</p><p></p><p>Like a creation god, Xu Bai was above the sky, creating things out of thin air, reshaping the Beast World according to his will.</p><p></p><p>Liu San and Fang Zaiji looked at this scene in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Fang Zaiji was unsure.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a change through the integration with the heavenly way of this small world, but rather a miraculous external force, forcibly distorting the writing," Liu San, however, understood. </p><p></p><p>"Although this was done casually, it is indeed due to the clone's main combatant status here. But it's just a enhancement of the power that the clone can access."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't affect the essence of this supernatural ability."</p><p></p><p>A gleam passed through Fang Zaiji's eyes, "So, if you were to perform this move in the outside world, in the Xuanhuang Realm, with sufficient strength, could you also modify mountains and rivers at will like painting?"</p><p></p><p>Liu San's expression became serious as he nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>"To the disciples of the Sect, issue a seal. This matter needs to be kept strictly confidential," Liu San said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>With their knowledge, even in the ancient cultivation world, this was an extremely extraordinary supernatural ability.</p>

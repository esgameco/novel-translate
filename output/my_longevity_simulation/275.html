        <div class="content">
            <p>Finally, a little boy with slightly yellowish hair stepped out and said timidly, "Doggy was turned into this by bad people."</p><p></p><p>"In the wealthy families in the city, they all keep these 'human dogs'." </p><p></p><p>"Human dogs are more obedient, smarter, and stronger than regular dogs."</p><p></p><p>"So they are very popular."</p><p></p><p>"Turning into a human dog requires undergoing immortal magic transformation, which is an extremely painful process."</p><p></p><p>"If one can't endure it, they will lose their mind and become crazy."</p><p></p><p>"Then they will be abandoned and left to fend for themselves."</p><p></p><p>Although the little boy was young, he spoke clearly and logically.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal magic..." Li Fan sneered in his heart. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't see any traces of spiritual power at work on this dog at all.</p><p></p><p>It was just the dog's limbs and human body crudely sewn together.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "immortal magic" was nothing more than a deceptive term used to fool mortals.</p><p></p><p>If Senior Brother Zhang saw such methods, he would surely angrily denounce it as "evil sorcery that everyone should execute".</p><p></p><p>"Doggy is just an abandoned defective product. If it weren't for Little Bai..."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-haired little boy was speaking when he was fiercely kicked from behind.</p><p></p><p>Patting his bottom, he looked a bit embarrassed. </p><p></p><p>The little boy quickly corrected himself, "If it weren't for Mr. Bai's intervention to treat him, I'm afraid Doggy would have been dead long ago."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai?</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had heard of him before in this Fallen Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>The blue crystal in his mind sea flickered with brilliance. In an instant, it retrieved the relevant information from the depths of his memory.</p><p></p><p>In the experience of obtaining the "Purple Empyrean Soul Searching Art", after the two cultivators Zhang Qianmo and Song Hesong had a great battle that turned Ningyuan City into ruins, some beggar children around ten years old suddenly appeared amidst everyone's despair and cried out.</p><p></p><p>Igniting people's hope for survival, they were even able to organize the rescue efforts in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>And the one they obeyed was none other than this "Mr. Bai".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but become interested. He immediately asked, "Who is Mr. Bai?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Mr. Bai was mentioned, the yellow-haired little boy became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>He opened up and chattered on endlessly, "Mr. Bai is the best person in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"He's also the most skilled doctor in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"And the best-looking person in the world too!"</p><p></p><p>The few children behind him also chimed in one after another:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai is the gentlest speaker in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"He's also the smartest person in the world!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Listening to the children's words overflowing with praise, Li Fan couldn't help but find it a bit amusing.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of these children, perhaps this small Ningyuan City was their entire world.</p><p></p><p>However, one could also see that this Mr. Bai indeed seemed to be an extraordinary person, and treated the children extremely well.</p><p></p><p>Could such a character be the owner of this remnant space?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested.</p><p></p><p>"This Mr. Bai is really amazing! Could you introduce me to him?" Li Fan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all five children quieted down.</p><p></p><p>They subconsciously took a step back and looked at Li Fan with vigilant eyes.</p><p></p><p>As if Li Fan was some bad guy with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "Don't be afraid of me. I'm a good person just like your Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>"I just want to meet him, that's all."</p><p></p><p>The children exchanged glances again. In the end, it was still the yellow-haired little boy who spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, we don't know where Mr. Bai lives either."</p><p></p><p>"We live in the small temple in the east of the city. Mr. Bai often comes to see us."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to meet Mr. Bai, you can wait in the small temple."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly and made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>The yellow-haired little boy wasn't lying.</p><p></p><p>He tossed the still sleeping Doggy to the few of them. The yellow-haired little boy took a look and saw that Doggy had indeed just fallen asleep. He let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that Li Fan wasn't some evil person, he finally felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>So, under their lead, Li Fan arrived at a small temple in the east part of Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be an abandoned temple.</p><p></p><p>The stone statue being worshipped had long been broken, with only a small remnant left.</p><p></p><p>There were a dozen more children in the small temple, dressed in similarly tattered clothes, both boys and girls.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all rather thin and weak, each of them was quite spirited, with a glimmer in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the yellow-haired little boy and the other four return, they all gathered around.</p><p></p><p>Chattering, "Luya, who is this uncle?"</p><p></p><p>"How come you came back empty-handed, didn't get anything to eat this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Doggy! What happened to Doggy!"</p><p></p><p>So Luya explained to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also understood why Luya and the other four would inexplicably follow him.</p><p></p><p>It was nothing more than seeing that he was an unfamiliar outsider and wanting to get some silver coins from him to buy something to eat.</p><p></p><p>There were other groups like Luya's that hadn't returned yet.</p><p></p><p>The children in the small temple all looked at Li Fan with vigilant and curious eyes.</p><p></p><p>But none came forward to chat with him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was too lazy to bicker with a bunch of kids anyway. He just waited on the side for this Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>If things went as expected, when Senior Brother Zhang started making his move and turned Ningyuan City into ruins under the hands of the two cultivators,</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai would appear.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for about half a day, seeing that it was about time, Li Fan sent a message to Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful of Steward Song..."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, before long, Senior Brother Zhang's thunderous angry shout rang out in the sky above Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>"Evil demons! Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Purple lightning, representing the majestic heavenly authority, flashed in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, quickly take action!" This was Chu Liang's voice.</p><p></p><p>The battle broke out again.</p><p></p><p>Knowing Senior Brother Zhang's strength, Li Fan didn't pay too much attention this time.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he watched the performance of the children in the small temple with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Quick! Hide in the cellar!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the strange scene in the sky, Luya's face turned a bit pale as he repeatedly directed.</p><p></p><p>The children seemed to be very skilled at taking shelter.</p><p></p><p>Pushing aside the small remnant of the stone statue revealed a hole.</p><p></p><p>They crawled in one after another in a hurry but orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, you should also come and take shelter!" </p><p></p><p>When only Luya was left in the temple, he turned his head and said to Li Fan, "Immortals are fighting outside, it's too dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, "Don't worry about me, you go down and take shelter first."</p><p></p><p>Luya hesitated for a moment, then nodded. His small figure then disappeared into the hole.</p><p></p><p>The stone statue slowly returned to its original position, covering the hole.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan slowly walk to the front of the stone statue, revealing a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when this group of children pushed aside the stone statue, revealing the secret chamber below, Li Fan was also a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, this seemingly ordinary stone statue can actually block my divine sense?"</p><p></p><p>Slowly stroking this aged stone statue, his internal spiritual power surged out.</p>

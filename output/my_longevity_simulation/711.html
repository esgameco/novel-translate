        <h1>Chapter 711</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Huangfu and Dongfang, who narrowly escaped death, both had pale faces and cold sweat on their foreheads. They stared blankly at the long void not far away, silent.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan had been a little slower just now, the three people on the PuXian Zhen boat might have been completely crushed into powder by now!</p><p></p><p>Struggling to swallow his saliva, Huangfu's legs went weak, almost falling directly onto the boat board.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is that..." Dongfang Yao's courage seemed to surpass, recovering from the shock, suppressing his fear, and looking out towards the boat.</p><p></p><p>The destructive power of the black light column was extremely terrifying. After a long time, the pierced devouring white mist still hadn't recovered.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the black light seemed to contain a strange erosive force, even though the light column had already dissipated. When looking at that empty and desolate space from a distance, everyone felt a sense of impending danger. Just now—</p><p></p><p>"I say, should we move further away? If there's another one coming, we're done for," Dongfang Yao whispered after observing for a while.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan, who still appeared relatively composed, spoke: "Not good! We should adapt to change. Although we don't know the origin of this black light column, the possibility of being struck again in this direction...is not small."</p><p></p><p>"Big..." Before he could finish saying the word "big," Li Fan's expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>Running his spiritual energy to the extreme, he infused it into the PuXian Zhen boat, causing it to suddenly accelerate and soar a distance upwards in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, a terrifying black light column attacked from the depths of the white mist.</p><p></p><p>This time it was more dangerous than before, and the PuXian Zhen boat narrowly escaped. It seemed like one could feel the suffocating, annihilating power of the black light even through the hull. Just now—</p><p></p><p>Under the shock of continuous scares in a short period of time, Huangfu eventually couldn't bear it and sat down heavily.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, who was humiliated in an instant, cursed inwardly as well.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his will was firm. He suppressed the thought of "escaping quickly" and did not run around, insisting on staying in place.</p><p></p><p>After that, seven more black light columns erupted from the depths of the white mist, almost sweeping across the entire misty area.</p><p></p><p>The enduring devouring white mist seemed to be greatly diminished by this destructive force.</p><p></p><p>This magnificent and shocking scene left all three people on the boat in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"The world-restraining artifact, this is the Immortal Alliance's world-restraining artifact [Sky Splitter Cannon]..." as if recalling something, Huangfu Song exclaimed after a moment.</p><p></p><p>These words immediately caught the attention of Li Fan and Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>"A world-restraining artifact?" Li Fan's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "world-restraining artifact" was the term used by Xuanhuang Realm cultivators for powerful and extraordinary treasures that could change the tide of war between sides.</p><p></p><p>During the previous exchanges between Wanxian Alliance and Wulao Club, each side displayed one such artifact, reportedly causing many frontline cultivators to change their positions.</p><p></p><p>The existence of world-restraining artifacts was considered confidential within the Wanxian Alliance, and ordinary cultivators rarely got to see them.</p><p></p><p>It was unexpected that Li Fan and the others would encounter it here!</p><p></p><p>And it seemed like they were fighting against something with full firepower. Just now—</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they're fighting with the Wulao Club again?" After a moment of silence on the PuXian Zhen boat, Dongfang Yao couldn't help but speculate quietly.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be..." Although Huangfu Song said so, it was evident that he still harbored such concerns. After taking out a communication talisman and contacting someone, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be suspicious; it's the Immortal Alliance's warriors cleaning up the maze. We just had bad luck and happened to run into it," Huangfu Song retorted Dongfang Yao with a roll of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of maze would require the use of such a deadly weapon? And without any warning! If it weren't for Brother Li's quick response, we would all be dead here. It's really gambling with lives!" Dongfang Yao burst out in anger.</p><p></p><p>"Let's stop here," Huangfu Song quickly intervened.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, gazed deeply towards the densely pierced white mist, though far away, he could still vaguely sense the spiritual energy fluctuations coming from there.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while to confirm the end of the [Sky Splitter Cannon] attacks, the three of them drove the PuXian Zhen boat swiftly out.</p><p></p><p>"While en route to the city for supplies, what items have you two decided to exchange for?" Huangfu Song, once again, opened up the item list on the Quantity Sky Mirror, looking delighted as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm interested in the method that nourishes the physical body through eating. Although my constitution is unique, as long as the injuries aren't too severe, I can recover instantly. But I always feel like there might be hidden injuries accumulating. Normally it's not a big deal, but I fear it might become a hindrance when breaking through into a higher realm," Dongfang Yao was quite sincere, explaining his plans straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I've set my eyes on the Heavenly Profound Qi Separation Disc. There are still six left now; if we act fast, there's a chance," Huangfu Song smiled but didn't mention the reason for choosing it.</p><p></p><p>"What about you, Brother Li?" Dongfang Yao curiously asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think a bit more, no rush to make a decision," Li Fan replied steadily.</p><p></p><p>However, upon returning to the nearby Tianyu City, the three friends, who had been relaxed a moment ago, suddenly became urgent.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the decree of the Wanxian Alliance had been officially issued.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators all over the world were stirred into action. Groups of three to five friends gathered, and one PuXian Zhen boat after another from various corners of the Xuanhuang Realm rushed headlong into the white mist.</p><p></p><p>The era of great exploration had officially arrived!</p><p></p><p>Although these cultivators without any backing or background had lost the advantage, falling behind in exploration progress, their sheer numbers made a difference. Who knew if among them there might be one or two extremely lucky individuals.</p><p></p><p>If they were fortunate enough to encounter a place as crucial as the Life-and-Death Maze, it would be an instant addition of thirty thousand Qingxuan Points.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Fan and the others were currently struggling to accumulate just over twenty-one thousand points!</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this meager early advantage was nothing compared to real Celestial Heirs!</p><p></p><p>So, after replenishing essential supplies, they hurriedly plunged back into the mist. Just now—</p><p></p><p>It is worth noting that the same "cheap" and extremely effective Elixir of Eternal Life that Li Fan "accidentally" purchased is now suddenly available in the Immortal Alliance market as the era of great exploration dawns.</p><p></p><p>It could be bought at every Thousand Li Hall in each city.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder whose work this Elixir of Eternal Life is; they don't need to explore any white mist like us. They're making a fortune just with one type of elixir," watching the crowds flocking outside the Thousand Li Hall to purchase the Elixir of Eternal Life, Huangfu Song said with a hint of bitterness, sighing.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

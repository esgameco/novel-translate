            <p>"Time passes, with increments and decrements in order. Is this the change within the Primordial Yellow Realm itself, or is it caused by external forces?" Li Fan subconsciously thought of the elusive Primordial Celestial Venerable, who was known for his disappearance.</p><p></p><p>There was no other explanation. If a cultivator within the Primordial Yellow Realm could easily change the sky and earth, then it must be the creator of this new law.</p><p></p><p>"However, if the speculation is correct, and the Primordial Yellow Realm is about to fall into the Immortal Ruins, why is the Primordial Celestial Venerable not fleeing but instead continuously transforming the world for thousands of years?" Li Fan couldn't help but speculate as he remembered the Primordial Celestial Venerable leaving the Primordial Yellow Realm in the previous life after several years.</p><p></p><p>As various thoughts flashed through his mind, Li Fan temporarily suppressed his doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ximen, you truly are a gifted individual who can see the essence of the world from the subtle details. I think even the accomplished Daoists might not be comparable to you!" Li Fan praised.</p><p></p><p>Then he changed the subject, "For such groundbreaking research, I wonder if you have detailed writings? So that I can study them all night long!"</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu was initially pleased, but when Li Fan inquired about his writings, he hesitated and looked embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>After repeated questioning by Li Fan, Ximen Yu reluctantly revealed the truth. [Link to website removed]</p><p></p><p>It turned out that he had almost finished writing the entire "Ancient and Modern Examination of Mountains and Rivers" and was planning to publish it to gain eternal fame. However, he received a warning from the Ten Thousand Immortals League. The League officials believed that there were many inappropriate contents in the book that needed to be revised, but they did not specify which parts were taboo.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, Ximen Yu had to delete a portion and resubmit it for approval, but it still didn't pass. In the end, he drastically cut down the thick work, leaving only one surviving long article.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, since then, I have become disheartened and just relied on what I have learned to earn some contribution points. I also changed my research direction."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I am currently focusing on the study of the flow of earth veins. If you are interested, we can exchange information." Ximen Yu said somewhat nostalgically.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan whispered, "I wonder if you have a backup of the original manuscript of the book?"</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu chuckled, "The 'Ancient and Modern Examination' is what I have learned throughout my life and is deeply engraved in my mind. Why would I need a backup?"</p><p></p><p>"However, I cannot transmit the complete version through the Tianxuan Mirror. If you really want to read it, you can come to the Qihong Island in Leyangzhou."</p><p></p><p>Leyangzhou was located in the central-eastern part of the Ten Thousand Immortals League, about a dozen states away from the Misty Cloud Sea. However, the transmission would not take long.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Brother Ximen, those locations that I asked you to find but couldn't locate, do you think they might be within the range of the White Mist Barrier?"</p><p></p><p>"Can you mark their possible positions on the map for me?" Li Fan asked before the communication was cut off.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu was a bit surprised by the question, "Could it be that you want to explore the White Mist? But that's risky, as no one would willingly venture into such a dangerous place."</p><p></p><p>"But if one day, when my life is about to end, maybe I'll have the possibility to explore it." Li Fan smiled without admitting, intrigued by the idea.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, I thought I encountered another madman." Ximen Yu muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Another madman? What do you mean by that, Brother Ximen?" Li Fan was curious and asked immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Well, nothing special really. It's just that when I surveyed the terrain before, I saw a crazy cultivator running in and out of the White Mist Barrier multiple times."</p><p></p><p>"At first, he looked like a young man. But later, he had become old. I don't know if he's still alive."</p><p></p><p>"I advised him, but he wouldn't listen and just kept saying there were great secrets within the White Mist Barrier..."</p><p></p><p>"That's nonsense, one must have the fate to study it." Ximen Yu sneered, sounding disdainful.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he sent a map with several marks indicating the locations.</p><p></p><p>"I'll think of a way for the remaining locations in these few days. If I can't solve it, I won't contact you anymore." After that, the communication ended.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully examined the map and found scattered marks throughout the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortals League. The locations he had chosen initially were concentrated in neighboring states, according to what he remembered from Linghu Chang's recollections.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Ximen Yu's research was reliable.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Primordial Yellow Realm had been torn apart and reshaped.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the map, Li Fan remained silent for a long time. After a while, he completely deleted the map.</p><p></p><p>"For now, I should purchase materials for refining the Longevity Pill from the Tianxuan Mirror. Once I have accumulated a batch, I'll send Liu San to explore the depths of the White Mist. Perhaps we can make some discoveries."</p><p></p><p>"If that fails, I can consider planting in the Wood-Attribute Terra Realm within my Five Elements Sanctuary."</p><p></p><p>Currently, Li Fan's Five Elements Sanctuary was still in its early stages, lacking the scale and richness of spiritual energy compared to the previous one that sparked the fierce battles between the Ten Thousand Immortals League and the Five Elders Council. Nonetheless, the potential was infinite.</p><p></p><p>"Planting spiritual plants will also help perfect the laws within the Wood-Attribute Terra Realm. But one should specialize in their craft..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered the Foundation Establishment cultivator Chen Ying from the Misty Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Since he was reassigned to the Five Elements Sanctuary, Chen Ying had been absent without any news.</p><p></p><p>Unlike in the previous life, due to Li Fan's warning, he hadn't fallen yet, just out of contact.</p><p></p><p>"He should still be inside the Five Elements Sanctuary, who knows what he's busy with." Li Fan recalled that in the last life, shortly afterward, due to the massive extraction of resources from the Five Elements Sanctuary resulting in the imbalance of the Five Elements and their destruction.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Ten Thousand Immortals League will repeat their actions in this life." Li Fan wasn't clear on why the League extracted resources so excessively from the Five Elements Sanctuary. However, since Chen Ying had not returned yet, it seemed that the League's operations in the Five Elements Sanctuary had not stopped.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan shook his head slightly and stopped thinking further.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to return to the Island of Embodiment, he suddenly received a notification from the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The former Island Lord of Wanxian Island, the Nascent Divinity cultivator, and the Immortal Lord Hongxi, who had been assigned to the Ten Thousand Immortals League headquarters for several years, had finally returned.</p><p></p><p>He ordered Li Fan, the "Secret Envoy," to go see him immediately.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1047: The Real and Fake Deception</p><p></p><p>Above the city of Wei, Li Fan remained silent. </p><p></p><p>According to the memories of the mortals in the city, the avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror disappeared on the second day after the disturbance in the four states.</p><p></p><p>After searching around, no traces left by the other party were found.</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, Li Fan didn't give up and went to the hidden grotto heaven where he had previously met Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>There were no traces of any cultivators ever visiting.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"That Mo Rubin directly ran off with Tian Xuan Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>This thought suddenly popped up in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The blue light of the Hua Dao Stone flowed as Li Fan quickly reviewed the entire plan from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't bring in his own perspective. Instead, he purely observed from the perspective of an outsider.</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning of rescuing Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Then pretending to be crazy and foolish, disguising himself as Sun Xingwang to gain Mo Rubin's trust.</p><p></p><p>The two made a plan to obtain information about Xuan Tian Wang from Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The first few steps of the plan seemed to be very successful. Until the last step, it was unknown what went wrong.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene flashed quickly in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his seemingly flawless performance, and Mo Rubin who cooperated with his act, Li Fan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already vaguely determined in his heart that he might have, possibly been played by Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan still held a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Lingmu Realm, he forcibly interrupted Qiao Gong Jushi's research and handed over the ancient plain bronze mirror that Mo Rubin had given him.</p><p></p><p>"A realm...realm artifact?" </p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Jushi's expression instantly became very strange.</p><p></p><p>He secretly glanced at Li Fan, and then carefully organized his words: "Forgive my poor eyesight, this seems to be..."</p><p></p><p>"What seems, isn't it just the most ordinary bronze mirror? Look at this bronze rust, goodness knows where it was dug up from." Fang Zaiji of this life had not yet seen Li Fan's might, so he spoke very boldly and straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. Sorry to trouble Qiao Gong Daoyou." Li Fan's face showed no joy or anger as he disappeared in a flash in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, wasting our time..." Fang Zaiji was very dissatisfied with Li Fan's interruption and was about to complain more, but was directly interrupted by Qiao Gong Jushi.</p><p></p><p>"You should say less. The Supreme Envoy's mood doesn't seem to be very beautiful." Qiao Gong Jushi whispered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the underground secret room of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Realm artifact..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>With a bang, Li Fan exerted a little force and crushed the bronze mirror to dust.</p><p></p><p>"In so many years of reincarnation, this is the first time I've been played by someone."</p><p></p><p>At this point, even if Li Fan was unwilling to admit it, he could no longer deny this fact.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps from the very beginning, Mo Rubin never truly believed Li Fan's identity as the Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect. But during their interactions, he discovered that Li Fan's strength might be worth using. So he went along with the pretense and used Li Fan's power to release Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Poor Li Fan had always thought he acted very convincingly. </p><p></p><p>But now looking back, there were indeed many loopholes that couldn't be explained by the craziness caused by the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>For example, besides being able to recall some past events, Li Fan's speech and behavior were vastly different from the real Sun Xingwang, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>For example, the amazing formation abilities Li Fan displayed at many critical moments.</p><p></p><p>And for example...</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it was the contact with Tian Xuan Mirror's avatar that</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This ultimately led to my cover being blown."</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xuantian Mirror was the Xuantian Sect's most prized artifact back then. As the most important figure in the sect, one of the Twelve Dharma Kings couldn't possibly be unfamiliar with the Xuantian Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"These are two people from the Xuantian Sect, colluding together to deceive me, an outsider."</p><p></p><p>"Very good. No wonder you were chosen by the Xuantian King to bear the shared responsibility of saving the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Very good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't fly into a rage from embarrassment at being deceived.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>Because he finally felt things were getting interesting.</p><p></p><p>His past experiences of continuous reincarnation made Li Fan increasingly indifferent towards the living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>He treated them like NPCs in a game that could be constantly reset and refreshed.</p><p></p><p>After grasping enough information, he could even predict their reactions upon hearing certain words.</p><p></p><p>Even those like the Heavenly Doctor, the Dharma Transmitter, the Immortals of Xianxu, and the Faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just regarded them as slightly stronger bosses.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Heavenly Doctor who abruptly read his mind, the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King Mo Rubin also taught Li Fan a good lesson.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm are not so easily fooled!</p><p></p><p>Because they are truly living beings!</p><p></p><p>"No matter. You may deceive me in this lifetime, but can you deceive me life after life?"</p><p></p><p>Without any frustration from failure, Li Fan's eyes burned with eagerness to try again.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, we're not done in this lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Li Fan closed his eyes and began to ponder countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>The first thing to figure out was what exactly happened that day at the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Even after such a long time, it remained a tightly sealed mystery.</p><p></p><p>And without the Dharma Transmitter as an inside connection, Li Fan was back to being blind.</p><p></p><p>He knew absolutely nothing about the movements and information of the Wanxian Alliance's upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I must grasp certain channels in my own hands. Relying on others still won't do."</p><p></p><p>"I still need to have my own Dharma Transmitter..."</p><p></p><p>"But fortunately, I've obtained enough information in this lifetime. I can start trying gradually from now on."</p><p></p><p>Having deeply experienced the benefits of having a Dharma Transmitter as an inside connection, Li Fan naturally wouldn't give that up.</p><p></p><p>However, that was a matter for after this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>At present, there was no way to further inquire about the information. So Li Fan chose the method he used most often.</p><p></p><p>In a word, wait!</p><p></p><p>Many secrets cease to be secrets with the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Although it was an absolute secret that couldn't be investigated now, it might not necessarily be so after some time.</p><p></p><p>The level of confidentiality would decrease, plus with Wuyou Tianzu's divine power.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that as long as he offered a high enough price when the time came, he could definitely find out the truth of the matter from those who personally experienced the event.</p><p></p><p>What he needed to do was wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't idle during the waiting period.</p><p></p><p>The various matters in the Lingmu Realm proceeded as planned, but the spread of the Wanjie Alliance and the Faceless True Immortal's teachings was halted.</p><p></p><p>It was best to remain vigilant before finding Mo Rubin and the Xuantian Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Although the events at the Alliance headquarters that day still couldn't be clarified, judging from how Lu Xichan and Shuo Feng's entire family had disappeared, the Wanxian Alliance had evidently carried out a purge of possible traitors internally.</p><p></p><p>Many people vanished just like that without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly collected a list of these missing personnel.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he constantly kept an ear out for possible survivors of the event that day.</p><p></p><p>Five years later.</p>

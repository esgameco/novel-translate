        <h1>Chapter 995</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that this item is too conspicuous, and it can't be exchanged for something else." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed, and then turned his gaze to the Ink-Stained Evil Book.</p><p></p><p>The moment he took it out and placed it in front of him, the Hua Dao Stone and the Dissociation Disc in his consciousness sea simultaneously conveyed emotions of disgust and a trace of fear.</p><p></p><p>"There must be some tricks to it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared straight at this extremely black metallic little book. </p><p></p><p>It was unknown what material it was refined from, and it emitted a dark black glow on its surface.</p><p></p><p>This black light seemed to have vitality, constantly drifting on the exterior.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the ink color Li Fan had seen on Mo Sha before, the ink of Mo Sha was a pure aura of destruction.</p><p></p><p>However, this Ink-Stained Evil Book seemed to exude a strong stench, causing people to feel nauseated and uncomfortable with its ink color.</p><p></p><p>"It's like the garbage produced during the operation of heaven and earth. It's not tolerated by the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, it's somewhat similar to the world [Youhun] where that Yin Shangren belongs to."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Immortal Alliance's standard Nascent Soul mirror magic treasure called Luzhu Huan to test it. When Li Fan manipulated the Ink-Stained Evil Book and released myriad black lights to envelop it,</p><p></p><p>It was like a white paper splashed with ink.</p><p></p><p>The original brilliant green light of Luzhu Huan instantly dimmed, and its aura also immediately ceased.</p><p></p><p>Even though the black light was released by his own hands, Li Fan still slightly frowned and distanced himself a little.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the Ink-Stained Evil Book, it took a full half-day for the black color lingering on Luzhu Huan to gradually dissipate.</p><p></p><p>A slight discomfort was transmitted from the ancient tree in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The ink-stained black light doesn't disappear out of thin air, but requires the world to spend a certain amount of time to purify it. If the quantity is large and exceeds the upper limit of what can be handled, even the world can be thoroughly polluted."</p><p></p><p>"Although it can't achieve the effect of destroying the world, it can make the world become foul-smelling and unsuitable for cultivators to live in."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>He picked up Luzhu Huan that had been soaked in the black light for a long time. It had already lost all its functions as a magic treasure. Using only the strength of his physical body, with a light pinch, Luzhu Huan shattered inch by inch and scattered all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a special attack against magic treasures."</p><p></p><p>"With this, the effect of Xuan Sushang's protective battle armor will also be greatly reduced. Mo Rubin is indeed considerate enough..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put away the Ink-Stained Evil Book and secretly praised.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and it was getting closer and closer to the predicted time point when Shuo Feng and Xuan Sushang would meet.</p><p></p><p>Without Li Fan sending someone to monitor, Mo Rubin had already sent over the intelligence of those few possible cave abodes.</p><p></p><p>Five locations, two of which were ruled out as possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Because in the remaining three cave abodes, cultivators had already begun to prepare in advance.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan family had a revered identity and was used to living a good life. Wherever they went, although there was no need for special instructions, the subordinate cultivators had to arrange everything in advance to avoid causing the master's displeasure.</p><p></p><p>In any case, for the Xuan family, the consumption of these resources was just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Having been in the upper echelons of the Immortal Alliance for many years, they may not have even thought that someone would dare to make a move against the Xuan family.</p><p></p><p>The so-called confidentiality work was only done symbolically, almost equivalent to none.</p><p></p><p>"You can't blame them. Perhaps Xuan Sushang herself disdains the so-called security."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, and a fierce light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He summoned Tian Yang, Lin Ling, and Baihua Daoren, and told them the target of this attack.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to cooperate with me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan taught them a set of formations and let them familiarize and practice during the waiting period.</p><p></p><p>"The four of us joining hands to deploy this formation is enough to block off an entire area."</p><p></p><p>"No entry or exit. Severing internal and external, unable to communicate."</p><p></p><p>"Those targeted by the formation will also suffer oppression equivalent to the sum of our divine soul power, greatly discounting their strength."</p><p></p><p>"This operation is not highly dangerous and needs to be done quickly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said simply.</p><p></p><p>"This formation used by the Envoy is indeed extraordinary. Even among the remnants of our realms back then, it would be hard to find a match." Baihua Daoren couldn't help but exclaim in amazement after the initial practice and testing the power of the formation.</p><p></p><p>A hint of awe also flashed in Lin Ling's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Only Tian Yang still looked dull-headed and unimpressed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just smiled in response.</p><p></p><p>How could they imagine that this seemingly all-powerful formation was just tailor-made by the End Separation Disk in the more than ten days of waiting here, based on the intelligence from Xuan Sushang and Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready to go, and Li Fan also got in touch with Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>The divine demon avatar he occupied also came outside the Tianquan State to join them.</p><p></p><p>For the three Hedao following Li Fan, Mo Rubin only paused slightly on Baihua Daoren, and then closed his eyes with an unconcerned look.</p><p></p><p>"If they meet in the Immortal Alliance Heavenly City, it would be a bit tricky."</p><p></p><p>"But they disliked the cave abodes in the city as too simple and were used to living in natural cave abodes outside the city..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, extravagance and dissipation, already having the way to court death."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance, aren't they all like this."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma transmitter you possess is even more so."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded with a strange laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like it's time to give the Myriad Immortal Alliance a warning." Mo Rubin snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>In the last two days, based on the changes in the cultivator personnel outside the three cave abodes, they finally locked onto the target.</p><p></p><p>In a thousand-mile bamboo sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's group lurked in the air, looking at the green stretching to the horizon below, with varied expressions.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren perhaps recalled his own destroyed homeland, a hint of gloom flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>While Lin Ling looked around, trying to find if there were existences like her, spiritualized, in this bamboo sea.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin and Li Fan still sneered: "Really know how to enjoy."</p><p></p><p>"This place is perfect for burying them."</p><p></p><p>Just in the gap while waiting in ambush for Xuan Sushang's arrival, a small episode occurred.</p><p></p><p>A devout prayer voice suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And Mo Rubin seemed to have sensed something, glanced at Li Fan, frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No matter." Li Fan put on a look of understanding, indicating Mo Rubin to rest assured.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he checked the scene in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was Dao Xuanzi, a member of the Myriad Realms United Council in this world, who had not been seen for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan had revealed to them the general whereabouts of the Canghai Pearl, and after years of waiting and searching, they finally found it.</p><p></p><p>Using the method of re-establishing the Dao, they rebuilt the foundation of the extraordinary Dao of Earth.</p><p></p><p>That strong wave of faith fluctuation just now was Dao Xuanzi's sincere gratitude to the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal after successfully establishing his foundation.</p>

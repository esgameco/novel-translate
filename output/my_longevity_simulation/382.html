            <p>"And it can draw on external spiritual power as an energy source, without worrying about self-consumption. In this spirit-rich Five Elements Cave Heaven, the effect is even more outstanding."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Buyi spoke, the black and gold Run Tian Shuttle in her hand shimmered for a moment. In the blink of an eye, from it, split replicas that looked completely identical.</p><p></p><p>Transformed into black fine threads of light, flying in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The wonders of the Run Tian Shuttle, you can explore it yourselves later."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held the flying treasure in front of him, feeling a cool sensation.</p><p></p><p>As his consciousness touched it, a crisp mechanical voice suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Authorization confirmed."</p><p></p><p>"Zero Sixteen sub-body has been activated."</p><p></p><p>"Current controller: Li Fan."</p><p></p><p>At the moment the Run Tian Shuttle was activated, information about its usage methods and various precautions appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but brighten his eyes, praising it inwardly while also feeling somewhat regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Good treasure, in terms of speed alone, it may even be faster than the Seven-Colored Divine Light Salvation Technique of Zhong Shen."</p><p></p><p>"But it's only a sub-body, all functions need to be controlled."</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, I'm afraid the operation conditions of the Run Tian Shuttle, location information, and everything happening inside the shuttle will be monitored."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated to himself.</p><p></p><p>Before everyone could fully grasp this Run Tian Shuttle, Qi Buyi took out dozens of rectangular jade pieces and distributed them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took them, but a black dot appeared on the palm-sized jade piece.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Buyi."</p><p></p><p>Upon contact with his consciousness, he immediately sensed these three words.</p><p></p><p>Then functions such as "communication," "marking," "transmission," "sharing," and so on popped up.</p><p></p><p>"This is the [Tian Du Record], tailored for convenient cooperation and specially equipped for everyone within the alliance."</p><p></p><p>"The complete map of the Five Elements Cave Heaven has been already drawn inside it."</p><p></p><p>"After registering your information on the Tian Du Record, you can synchronize and share real-time locations."</p><p></p><p>"Anyone holding the Tian Du Record can check at any time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi explained carefully to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, if you encounter special situations, you can mark your location on the map in real-time for information exchange."</p><p></p><p>"When you need to contact a specific member individually, you can also do so through the Tian Du Record."</p><p></p><p>"Now, please register yourselves first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then his consciousness pierced into the jade piece.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a small black dot representing "Li Fan" appeared on the screen of the jade piece.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, other cultivators around me also appeared on the Tian Du Record screen.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan manipulated and shrunk the screen.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the complete map of the Water Element Cave Heaven appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Besides the black dots representing individuals, there were blue markings for rare material locations, red markings for dangerous areas, and one or two "X" marks for strictly forbidden forbidding areas.</p><p></p><p>There were even golden markings constantly moving.</p><p></p><p>Those were the powerful primitive beings in the Water Element Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan eagerly synchronized all the map information into the crystal of his mind that stored the information.</p><p></p><p>"This map's mode..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was secretly taking the secrets of the Alliance, suddenly felt familiar with the map before him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he reacted.</p><p></p><p>Because of the incident involving "Black Bull Cart, Master Teaching," leading to the unexplained deaths of dozens of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As the sole survivor, he underwent the investigation of the Tian Ji Hall.</p><p></p><p>There, he had seen similar maps marked with countless secrets of the Misty Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Du Record. It seems that it's not just the Misty Cloud Sea and the Five Elements Cave Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps such maps are also drawn for each domain under the Alliance's jurisdiction."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered, Qi Buyi had already begun the mobilization work.</p><p></p><p>"The situation is urgent, and there isn't much time for everyone to rest. Later, I will sync the Locking Spirit Formation construction plan of the Five Elements Cave Heaven with everyone."</p><p></p><p>"The specific responsibilities for each person will be allocated very clearly."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if anyone can complete the tasks beyond expectations, that would be even better."</p><p></p><p>"As you all saw on the Tian Du Record map, besides our Alliance, there are still some primitive beings in this Water Element Cave Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Although they are powerful, they do not have high intelligence. Basically, they stay in fixed locations and do not attack proactively."</p><p></p><p>"Just avoid them. If you encounter danger, use the Run Tian Shuttle to escape."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After giving instructions, Li Fan received his mission objectives.</p><p></p><p>Because the Five Elements Cave Heaven is about to reunite, the Locking Spirit Formation plan is slightly different from other areas.</p><p></p><p>The main formation is arranged outside the Cave Heaven's void.</p><p></p><p>Within the Cave Heaven, only corresponding connecting formation units are built at critical nodes. Subsequently, they are protected with special materials to ensure that even if the Five Elements unite, the formation remains intact.</p><p></p><p>The protective material is said to be the [Eternal Void Essence Gold] that can withstand the chaos annihilation test.</p><p></p><p>Such treasures naturally require key figures to deploy them personally.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan needed to do was no different from what he had done in the Abyss of Dominance and the Spirit Transformation Gorge before.</p><p></p><p>Just act as the labor to build the foundation structure of the formation.</p><p></p><p>However, without many words, after Qi Buyi announced the start of the operation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out the Run Tian Shuttle and silently commanded.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the black and gold object seemed like a living thing, flowing around Li Fan's body like a liquid.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a water droplet-shaped armor formed around Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's command, enveloped by the Run Tian Shuttle, he transformed into a black stream of light.</p><p></p><p>Cutting through the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Almost negligible spiritual power consumption for myself. As long as there is some spiritual energy outside, I can maintain this speed endlessly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan experienced the feeling of driving the Run Tian Shuttle.</p><p></p><p>During the flight, the black and gold fluid around him gradually became transparent, allowing Li Fan to observe the surrounding scenery unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>Frictional resistance and even sound were all isolated from the outside.</p><p></p><p>There was no feeling of rapid flight.</p><p></p><p>Only constant shifting and distortions in the view due to the fast speed.</p><p></p><p>This proved Li Fan's current flying speed.</p><p></p><p>Extreme speed and extreme silence, both conflicting situations occurring simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Li Fan feeling slightly uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>However, soon the Run Tian Shuttle sent a signal to adjust the external volume.</p><p></p><p>After reducing the sound at his ears to a minimum, not complete silence.</p><p></p><p>The discomfort he felt immediately disappeared.</p>

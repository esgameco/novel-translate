        <h1>Chapter 971</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Oh? So you're saying, Jiang, you're preparing to personally take action and capture this petty villain?"</p><p></p><p>In the world of neon lights, the voice of a seven or eight-year-old child was heard, full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Not preparing. Already have."</p><p></p><p>The cold voice of the Dharma Transmitter Jiang echoed in this pale space.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the shocked expressions on the faces of all the other Dharma Transmitters were not concealed in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiang has personally taken action?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, it seems he's really intrigued by this divine demon intention."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. Speaking of which, this is the first time Jiang has left his [Ruins World] since the establishment of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the other party is in for a treat."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, pay close attention to the latest real-time footage. I can't wait to see Brother Jiang display his prowess!"</p><p></p><p>Like a boiling pot, the pale space instantly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Those Dharma Transmitters, who were originally calm and composed, now all showed excited and eager expressions.</p><p></p><p>In one of the small worlds that appeared to be a mortal city, Dharma Transmitter Feng, also known as Mo Rubin, felt a shadow cast over his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was controlling millions of divine demons.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the divine demons sent out a faint warning.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who was in control of the overall situation, did not ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his expression instantly became extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Mo Rubin?"</p><p></p><p>"He didn't show up in person, but secretly gave a warning."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan deduced the possible reason for the change.</p><p></p><p>"A powerful enemy is coming!"</p><p></p><p>While the alarm bells rang in his heart, Li Fan showed no panic at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he was a little excited.</p><p></p><p>After all, the power he now possessed could rival that of the Eternal Celestial Venerable. If it were to dissipate without a grand spectacle, it would be a bit of a pity!</p><p></p><p>"Let me see who exactly can make the Dharma King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect so nervous."</p><p></p><p>With a flash, Li Fan arrived in front of the faceless true immortal stone statue in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was still shrouded in a layer of golden rope woven into a garment.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Body elongated, forming a protective shield that enveloped Li Fan's true body.</p><p></p><p>"Like this, I can be said to be in an invincible position."</p><p></p><p>"If I truly lose, I'm afraid the entire Mysterious Yellow Realm will have to be buried with me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly and sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Quietly waiting for the arrival of the place.</p><p></p><p>"It should still be the same as Mo Rubin, tracing back to my sea of consciousness through the divine demon avatar."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have the help of millions of cultivators, how could I fear him?"</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a moment, and his mind instantly connected to that towering ancient tree in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tempering day and night without stopping, Li Fan's control over the Spirit Wood Realm was approaching completeness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind merged with the ancient tree, as if he was residing in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>His mind intertwined with the heaven and earth of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan was the Spirit Wood Realm, and the Spirit Wood Realm was Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>"With millions of cultivators and a miniature immortal cultivation realm."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, unless a Dharma Transmitter personally arrives..."</p><p></p><p>Having made all these preparations, a cold light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Poised and ready.</p><p></p><p>With his divine sense as clear as fire, soon after, Li Fan keenly detected a hint of abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had anticipated, a certain existence occupied...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After destroying one of the divine demon avatars, he slowly traced back along the connections in the web of consciousness, gradually approaching Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>On Li Fan's side, he had already mobilized the power of all the remaining millions of demon gods, waiting for the other party to reveal their form before launching a thunderous strike.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not choose to make a move!</p><p></p><p>"You are..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes, looking at the other party.</p><p></p><p>A gentle and weak young man, with a trace of delicate beauty that had not yet disappeared from his face. The young man's eyes were full of innocence and curiosity as he surveyed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had always been cautious in his actions, still did not make a move, allowing the young man to observe the scenes in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling..." A strange and indescribable feeling welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the young man in front of him, it seemed as if he was looking at himself.</p><p></p><p>No... It seemed that this young man was clearly himself!</p><p></p><p>His head felt dizzy, and countless memories suddenly surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Originally a child from an ordinary mortal family, he was fortunate to meet the Dharma Heavenly Venerable. Receiving his teachings, he later voluntarily spread the new dharma...</p><p></p><p>These were the memories he had lost due to his injuries...</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. I am Jiang, the spreader of the dharma."</p><p></p><p>"Could there be any secrets between oneself and oneself?"</p><p></p><p>Thoughts like these suddenly welled up in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's guard slowly lowered, and the fierce appearances of the myriad demon gods also softened.</p><p></p><p>The young man strolled leisurely in Li Fan's sea of consciousness, as if taking a casual walk in his own home.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Each divine demon is formed from a thread of consciousness," the young man remarked with a nod of amazement.</p><p></p><p>"They can occupy the bodies of other cultivators and even devour their divine consciousness to strengthen their own power."</p><p></p><p>The young man was slightly startled, and then his eyes flashed as he observed Li Fan more closely.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the True Immortal cultivation technique is truly formidable!" the young man exclaimed, clapping his hands after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that to achieve the goal, it's still lacking a little bit," the young man said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also nodded slightly, "Indeed. I don't know what happened with Mo Rubin. We had previously agreed that as long as he represented the Myriad Immortal Alliance to resolve this matter, I would cooperate and have all these divine demons self-sacrifice, allowing him to establish great merit..."</p><p></p><p>"But this fellow has been slow to come, there must have been some changes."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance truly has unfathomable foundations."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, nodding and pondering.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's words, the young man's expression finally changed slightly, a hint of solemnity flashing in his eyes. He continued, "What should we do then?"</p><p></p><p>"If the millions of divine demons continue to rampage, there might be a risk of losing control if this goes on. It's better to contact him first and clarify the reason properly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, revealing a grim smile, "Hehe, it doesn't matter. Even if he is exposed and dies, it won't have much impact on me."</p><p></p><p>"You see, the power we can control now is so immense! Losing control? What's that! It's not even worth mentioning!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face was full of confidence, "If things truly become unmanageable and the Myriad Immortal Alliance can't resolve it, all the better."</p><p></p><p>"With the importance the Dharma Heavenly Venerable places on the Xuanhuang Realm, it might even force him to show himself."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, with the power of the divine consciousness of millions of cultivators, plus the integrated heavenly consciousness of the Lingmu Realm, I might be able to directly confront him!"</p>

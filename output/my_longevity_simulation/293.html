            <p>"But each activation of a formation pivot in the [Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation] requires the personal guidance of a formation master. Moreover, to ensure the accuracy of the formation, the formation master needs to debug and calibrate it periodically."</p><p></p><p>"And this is the reason why you have all gathered here for training."</p><p></p><p>A golden orb suddenly appeared in Ji Hongdao's hand, which was the item distributed to everyone along with the clothing earlier.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Soul Gathering Bead, made from Yin Spirit Jade. As the name suggests, it has the effect of gathering and imprisoning souls."</p><p></p><p>"Do you see the golden light inside?"</p><p></p><p>"Those are the souls of the Five Elders Society cultivators we captured!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ji Hongdao said this, the cultivators present all changed color.</p><p></p><p>Through the on-site test of extracting souls just now, everyone knew that the golden light in the souls of the Five Elders Society cultivators was a trace of the [Soul Contract].</p><p></p><p>But in each cultivator's soul, the golden light only accounted for a mere trace.</p><p></p><p>To condense so much golden light that seemed almost tangible, just how many souls were needed?</p><p></p><p>Thousands? Or tens of thousands?</p><p></p><p>The more they thought about it, the more horrified they felt.</p><p></p><p>Some formation prodigies had been immersed in the study of formations since they started cultivating, and rarely came into contact with such a cruel side of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they couldn't help but turn a little pale, feeling uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao said in a deep voice, "What? Are you scared? Do you think we're too cruel?"</p><p></p><p>"But you should know, in the battle of Tianling State alone, the number of cultivators from the Myriad Immortals Alliance who died in battle was hundreds and thousands of times more than the number of souls in the Soul Gathering Bead in your hands!"</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the various wars, big and small, that have broken out over the past few thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Mercy to the enemy is true cruelty."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao looked deeply at the many young cultivators in front of him, stopping at that and not delving further into this topic.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to introduce the golden Soul Gathering Bead.</p><p></p><p>"What you need to do is to perceive the traces of the Soul Contract by constantly observing and coming into close contact with these souls."</p><p></p><p>"Ultimately reaching the point where you can distinguish the differences without relying on external forces."</p><p></p><p>"This way, when constructing the [Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation], you will have the ability to debug and calibrate the formation pivots."</p><p></p><p>"This process of comprehension will consume souls, so it's best if you can achieve this before the souls in the Soul Gathering Bead are depleted."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao's voice turned cold, "We will deem you incapable of constructing the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation. Not only will you be expelled from this Vastness Courtyard, we will also collect training loss fees from your recommenders."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the faces of the cultivators all turned a bit unsightly. </p><p></p><p>If they failed to meet the requirements and were driven out like this, it wouldn't just be a matter of losing face.</p><p></p><p>They would likely have their future prospects ruined and be cut off from the Dao of formations forever.</p><p></p><p>These prodigies who were recommended here couldn't help but feel immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"However, rest assured. To reduce the difficulty for you, we have already processed the souls of these Five Elders Society cultivators using special methods."</p><p></p><p>"The vast majority of memories within the souls have been completely cleared."</p><p></p><p>"Pure soul bodies, without facing the impact of memories and emotions, are much easier to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you're not a complete waste who's purely here to pad your resume, there shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Ji Hongdao's tone changed again as he began encouraging the young prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he set out everyone's study plan for the period ahead.</p><p></p><p>During the day, the cultivators would follow Ji Hongdao to learn how to construct the [Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation].</p><p></p><p>At night, they would each return to their respective courtyards to comprehend the Soul Contract imprint.</p><p></p><p>Every month, there would be an assessment to check everyone's learning progress.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just like that, Li Fan began his advanced studies at the Vastness Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation was indeed worthy of the Myriad Immortals Alliance pinning their hopes on it to turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>It was incredibly profound and complex.</p><p></p><p>Just the outer structure of the formation had as many as 36 million formation patterns.</p><p></p><p>Each basic pattern was composed of various different and numerous basic formations.</p><p></p><p>Even the simplest kind incorporated over ten thousand different formation units.</p><p></p><p>To fully grasp the formation structure of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation was no easy feat, even for these geniuses selected from various states.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had the [Transforming Dao Divine One] secret technique to assist him.</p><p></p><p>Everything he learned, saw, and even did and thought was recorded in the blue Transforming Dao Stone in his sea of consciousness without the slightest discrepancy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mastery of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation progressed by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>He was at the forefront among the many prodigies.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to this was Li Fan's ability to perceive the Soul Contract.</p><p></p><p>When about a quarter of the gold in the Soul Gathering Bead had been consumed, Li Fan was still the same as when he started, with almost no progress at all.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan took it in stride, without any pressure.</p><p></p><p>Things like being expelled from Tianyu State and demanding fees from his recommender couldn't threaten Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, by that time, Zhang Zhiliang would probably have already returned to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan still maintained an ordinary state of mind, comprehending at his own pace without being arrogant or impatient.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed by like this.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan once again extracted a soul from the Soul Gathering Bead and was about to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Two immense cultivations suddenly surged from within his body.</p><p></p><p>Like a surging river, flowing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, it filled half of his third Calamity Body.</p><p></p><p>And the feedback cultivation was still continuously increasing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart rejoiced as he slightly sensed, "Is this Ye Feipeng and Xiao Heng both breaking through to the Golden Core realm?"</p><p></p><p>He subconsciously wanted to activate the Formless Killing Mechanism to see the situation over there.</p><p></p><p>But the distance was too far, and he couldn't tell what had happened to the two of them.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan feel a bit uncomfortable and unaccustomed.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the amount of feedback cultivation, the two of them are at least Triple-Law Golden Cores."</p><p></p><p>"Such a wonderful scene, yet I can't witness it. It's a bit of a small regret."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I need to find a way to upgrade my Formless Killing Mechanism."</p><p></p><p>Calming the faint joy in his heart, Li Fan's divine sense skillfully rushed into the blank soul in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had entered a vast, boundless white space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shuttled through it, trying to find traces of the golden Soul Contract.</p><p></p><p>But just like before, he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Contract imprint was deeply hidden within the soul, like a drop of water merging into the ocean, extremely difficult to detect.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly extracting the soul to observe it was equivalent to boiling the ocean, forcing the Soul Contract imprint to show itself.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly taking the soul was no different from killing.</p><p></p><p>To identify on a large scale, it was simply impossible to use this method.</p><p></p><p>One could only enter the soul through divine sense and come into close contact with it.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend the existence of the Soul Contract imprint.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1103: The Reincarnation Rivers of Xuanhuang</p><p></p><p>Changji, disregarding the strange looks from the crowd, respectfully bowed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then, he transformed into a beam of light and flew away.</p><p></p><p>The words he spoke before leaving immediately caught the attention of the cultivators who were interested.</p><p></p><p>After some investigation, people finally discovered that this Changji was supposed to have died completely a year ago.</p><p></p><p>During the exploration of a wild sect's ruins, he unfortunately triggered a protective formation and died on the spot, leaving no intact corpse.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen people who were with him at the time could testify to this, and it could not be faked!</p><p></p><p>And now, this Changji had actually been resurrected!</p><p></p><p>The place of resurrection happened to be the nearest large river to the place where he had fallen.</p><p></p><p>This somewhat horrifying discovery quickly spread throughout the entire Wanxian Alliance in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Changji's friends from his previous life came to find him one after another, wanting to confirm the truth of his disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Changji himself did not deny it, but openly admitted that he had been resurrected.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the divine power of the Celestial Venerable!" He did not forget to say very devoutly in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when cultivators in the Wanxian Alliance spoke of the Celestial Venerable, they must have been referring to the Dharma-transmitting Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, everyone knew that the one Changji spoke of was the Longevity Celestial Venerable who had reversed life and death quietly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his friends and relatives were still somewhat skeptical, Changji directly invited everyone to enter his Tianxuan Mirror space.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knows, the Tianxuan Mirror space is bound to the cultivator, and only the cultivator himself can open it.</p><p></p><p>With the Tianxuan Mirror as proof, everyone finally completely believed in Changji's true identity.</p><p></p><p>To die and be reborn, and it was definitely not an isolated case.</p><p></p><p>This shocking news soon became known to everyone.</p><p></p><p>And in the following days, the appearance of more and more cultivators who had died and been reborn was also a verification of its authenticity.</p><p></p><p>After summarizing, on the side of the Wanxian Alliance, the cultivators who were resurrected invariably reappeared from the nearest large river to their place of death.</p><p></p><p>In the territory of the Immortal Alliance, there were fifty-four reincarnation rivers.</p><p></p><p>As for the Five Elders Council's side, there seemed to be a corresponding fifty-four as well.</p><p></p><p>These one hundred and eight rivers in total constituted the reincarnation rivers of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The length of time it took for cultivators to be resurrected seemed to be related to their strength during their previous lives.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the realm, the longer it took to be resurrected.</p><p></p><p>The first batch of resurrected cultivators were all, without exception, only at the Foundation Establishment stage and below.</p><p></p><p>As for how long it would take for cultivators of higher realms to be resurrected, it would need to be slowly verified in the future.</p><p></p><p>After resurrection, they always appeared naked. The items carried on the body before death, even those hidden in the soul, would not appear together. However, it was already a great blessing to be able to get back a life. No one paid too much attention to these external possessions.</p><p></p><p>However, after detailed measurements, it was found that the resurrected body seemed to be one year younger than before the fall.</p><p></p><p>Not only cultivators but all living beings within the Xuanhuang Realm would be reborn from the river after death.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, people could always see the wonder of creatures constantly coming ashore from the water in the reincarnation rivers.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a miraculous power in the river water that protected the newly resurrected creatures from drowning in the river water as soon as they were resurrected.</p><p></p><p>But this power disappeared quickly after leaving the reincarnation rivers. Even if one re-entered the river water, one could not find its traces again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The various wonders of death and rebirth became the hottest topic of discussion among the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Some people were grateful that there would be no more worries about falling in the future.</p><p></p><p>And some cultivators</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>People began to worry that if no new lives were born, the future of the Xuanhuang Realm would not be optimistic.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a discovery quickly dispelled this concern.</p><p></p><p>In some states of the Wanxian Alliance, new lives were still being born even after the Heavenly Venerate reversed the principle of life and death. However, the numbers were extremely low, with no more than fifty per year across the entire Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But at least the nurturing of life had not completely stopped.</p><p></p><p>Even if life would not completely disappear from now on, an increase of fifty cultivators per year was not a big problem for the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' attention quickly shifted to other key issues.</p><p></p><p>For example, could one be resurrected again after dying once? How long would a second resurrection take? Was there really no limit to the number of times?</p><p></p><p>Was there an upper limit to the age reduction of one year for each death?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The mysterious Heavenly Venerate never came forward to explain from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>All of this had to be explored by the cultivators themselves.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the cultivators attached great importance to this, as it would become a rule that must be followed in the future.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the orders of certain beings, some cultivators who had just been resurrected were forced to sacrifice their lives again to explore the mysteries of rebirth.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, knowing that they could die and be reborn, and being promised generous rewards, these cultivators who were used as test subjects did not have too many complaints.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had already died once.</p><p></p><p>They had no conscious awareness after death anyway.</p><p></p><p>They could obtain rewards that they could not earn in a lifetime even if they were alive, so why not do it?</p><p></p><p>It would probably take some time before the secrets of rebirth were analyzed.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the news, Li Fan personally went to one of the rebirth rivers to investigate for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he still could not see any clues.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the Netherworld I experienced before, the reversal of life and death in this life is obviously more complete."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to nurture life out of thin air from rivers..."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>The principle of reversing life and death had completely merged with the Dao of Xuanhuang Heaven, making it difficult to distinguish separately.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who was proficient in formations, could not detect any traces of the "Reversal of Life and Death Grand Formation" he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>Worried that this inexplicably appearing Heavenly Venerate would affect his grand plan, Li Fan secretly contacted the Dharma Transmitter Zhou, trying to gather some inside information from her.</p><p></p><p>But to his disappointment, the Dharma Transmitter Zhou still gave the same answer as before, claiming to know nothing about it.</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, your Wanxian Alliance has an organization called the Zhangtian Department that specializes in monitoring the principles of the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth. This Heavenly Venerate has successfully reversed the principles for so long, yet you insist that you are completely unaware of it... Daoist Zhou, this is a bit hard to justify, isn't it?" Li Fan questioned in an unfriendly tone.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter Zhou smiled, "Your Wanxian Alliance's information network is indeed well-informed."</p><p></p><p>"Even the secret existence of the Zhangtian Department in the Immortal Alliance cannot be hidden from you. However, I was not trying to brush you off, I really don't know about this."</p><p></p><p>The smile on Zhou's face gradually faded, and his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Generally speaking, for a Dao-merging cultivator to successfully reverse the principles, it is a gradual process."</p><p></p><p>"During this process, the traces of the principles of heaven and earth being distorted and changed are quite obvious, which is why the Zhangtian Department was able to detect the signs of an impending Eternal Life Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"But this Rebirth Heavenly Venerate is different."</p><p></p><p>"The speed at which he appeared..."</p><p></p><p>"Was a little too fast."</p>

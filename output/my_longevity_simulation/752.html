        <h1>Chapter 752</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"This pearl is called the 'Spirit Crystal Marrow'," the Princess said, a trace of pride flashing across her face. "It is the latest research achievement of the Empire."</p><p></p><p>"Over a hundred years ago, we discovered nuclei within certain demonic beasts that cultivators could absorb and refine spiritual energy from."  </p><p></p><p>"Shockingly, the flesh and blood of these demonic beasts could generate crystallized spiritual energy within their bodies. Although the purity of this spiritual energy was low, this phenomenon still caught the attention of the previous Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"After over a hundred years of persevering research, we have preliminarily mastered the technique of synthesizing spiritual energy. Although it requires a huge amount of flesh and blood as fuel, the purity of the spiritual energy crystals we cultivate is now very close to that of the top-grade spirit stones in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a look of surprise flashed across Xu Bai's eyes. Carefully examining the 'Spirit Crystal Marrow' before him, he slowly nodded. "Impressive. With such means, given enough time, I think it may not be impossible for you to transform this minor world into one suitable for cultivator habitation. But even so, it would not be of much help to the overall situation. Not to mention our Alliance of Myriad Realms, any formidable force in the Xuanhuang Realm would not lack spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>The Princess seemed to have expected Xu Bai's reaction. "Naturally, I know that. If the 'Spirit Crystal Marrow's' function was merely to provide spiritual energy, I would not have ranked its importance after the Orbit-Stabilizing Instrument."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the main function of the 'Spirit Crystal Marrow' is to transfer the abilities of demonic beasts to humans without any side effects." A red light flashed, and a spherical bead surrounded by what seemed like flickering flames appeared in her palm.</p><p></p><p>"This is a 'Spirit Crystal Marrow' made from a demonic beast called the 'Fierce Flame Tiger' as the raw material. You can try out its effects first." The Princess handed the red bead over with full confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Inheriting the demonic beasts' supernatural powers?" In that instant, Xu Bai thought of the demonic treasures that Dongfang Yao had mentioned before, which had a similar effect of awakening one's ancient bloodline abilities.</p><p></p><p>Grasping the red Spirit Crystal Marrow in his palm, Xu Bai applied a bit of force. Like a glass bead, it instantly shattered. In a flash, countless red flames like raging fire dragons drilled into Xu Bai's body along his arm.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Before his eyes appeared a ferocious demonic tiger made of flames, letting out an enraged, unyielding roar.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai gave a cold snort, and the illusion shattered in an instant. A surge of heat circulated through his body before finally disappearing at his brow.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai closed his eyes to sense it. After a moment, a red flame appeared in his palm, flickering constantly and distorting the surrounding air with its heat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's expression turned solemn, because this flame did not require channeling any spiritual energy or supernatural powers. It was like breathing - an innate ability of his body that could be activated with a thought.</p><p></p><p>The flame morphed into different shapes according to Xu Bai's intentions. As he continuously manipulated the flames, memories on how to use this fire ability surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Bai master the demonic beast's abilities so skillfully after absorbing the Spirit Crystal Marrow for the first time, even the Princess seemed extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>As if afraid Xu Bai would misunderstand, she quickly added, "In reality, inheriting a demonic beast's powers through the Spirit Crystal Marrow does not have a 100% success rate."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It's not just related to one's personal qualities and innate talents, but also the power level of the special abilities. According to our research, the more powerful and rare the ability, the harder it is for humans to master. And if the inheritance process fails, the probability of succeeding next time will be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>"There is also a limit to the number of special abilities a cultivator can inherit. The more abilities one has already mastered, the lower the chance of inheriting new ones."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai grasped the core of the problem: "How difficult is it to manufacture the [Spirit Crystal Marrow]? How many mutant beasts are required to produce one [Spirit Crystal Marrow]?"</p><p></p><p>The Princess suddenly stopped her endless chatter.</p><p></p><p>A faint blush appeared on her face as she said with some embarrassment, "It takes the flesh and blood of nearly a thousand mutant beasts to manufacture one [Spirit Crystal Marrow]. However, the Empire's cultivation techniques have become quite mature. As long as the resources are sufficient, the production of [Spirit Crystal Marrow] won't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly, "This can indeed be considered a formidable bargaining chip. The power of mutant beasts is almost equivalent to a weakened version of divine abilities. In a life-and-death struggle, if used unexpectedly, it can have a remarkable effect."</p><p></p><p>"Besides this, is there any other surprises?" Xu Bai asked further.</p><p></p><p>The Princess hesitated for a while before slowly saying, "This technology is not yet mature..."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, the Alliance values potential. If the prospects are truly boundless, we will not be stingy with our support," Xu Bai assured.</p><p></p><p>The Princess did not immediately respond, but turned her gaze to the young girl, Small Qing, outside the treasury.</p><p></p><p>After Small Qing nodded in silent approval, the Princess took a deep breath and led Xu Bai to the deepest part of the treasury.</p><p></p><p>There, a massive metal furnace was placed. Thousands of different mutant beasts were carved lifelikely on the furnace.</p><p></p><p>Despite the lack of raging flames, the temperature of the furnace seemed extremely high. Even with Xu Bai's current cultivation, he could faintly feel the scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>Violent collisions could be heard from within the furnace from time to time, and faint cries of countless intertwined mutant beasts could be vaguely heard, sending chills down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>The Princess seemed to be quite wary of this furnace, standing even further away from it than Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>She whispered an explanation, "This is called the [Myriad Phenomenon Furnace]."</p><p></p><p>"Its origin is a speculation, or perhaps a fact."</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient past, all the demonic beasts and mutant beasts once belonged to the same body."</p><p></p><p>"That was the origin of all demonic beasts, containing unimaginable power."</p><p></p><p>"Over countless years, countless individual entities have separated from its body."</p><p></p><p>"Then, can we go against the flow and refine them back..."</p><p></p><p>"Into that original entity?" The Princess's eyes shone with unfathomable light.</p><p></p><p>"Even if we cannot know all the demonic beasts that have ever existed, as long as we can find enough varieties, we can forcibly fuse them into a weak amalgamation."</p><p></p><p>"It should be possible to do so."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, ten years ago, we briefly fused a terrifying demonic beast."</p><p></p><p>"Its might seemed even more terrifying than the nine-headed bird beneath our feet. All the people present at the time, including the Blue and Red Sacred Masters, were frightened to the point of losing the ability to act."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it did not survive for long and dissolved and disappeared on its own."</p>

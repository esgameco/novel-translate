        <h1>Chapter 447</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He taught him how to use the "Return to Origin Formation" to temper and strengthen himself, which indeed cost Li Fan some effort.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Tianyang was quite compliant with Senior Brother Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even the most clumsy student, after continuous attempts, slowly learned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Tianyang's gradually proficient movements, Li Fan felt a wave of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"If someone comes to disturb you, Junior Brother, do not kill them. Catch and imprison them, and I will deal with them when I return."</p><p></p><p>"If you encounter someone you can't defeat, Junior Brother, don't be reckless. Slip away quietly and we'll discuss when we meet up."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After instructing Tianyang a few sentences, Li Fan flew out and closed the cave residence.</p><p></p><p>"The highest combat force on the surface of the Misty Cloud Sea is just the few Nascent Soul Immortal Sovereigns."</p><p></p><p>"Now with Junior Brother Tianyang backing me up, there is much more I can do."</p><p></p><p>Overlooking the unnamed island below, Li Fan smiled faintly. "From now on, you shall be called Body Transformation Island."</p><p></p><p>"After Tianyang completes his self-repair, I can also let him help refine mechanical puppets."</p><p></p><p>Under the condition of no lack of materials, refining some Nascent Infant combat power puppets should not be a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Although mechanical puppets cannot be compared to genuine Nascent Infant cultivators, they don't fear consumption and can pile up numbers to overwhelm enemies.</p><p></p><p>The more Li Fan thought about it, the more joyous he felt.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he gradually calmed down and removed Tianyang's bones from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>He still received the prompt that "Absorption" could absorb, but the hunger feeling no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan ultimately chose not to absorb it.</p><p></p><p>"I have already obtained everything I can from Tianyang's remains. Absorbing it again would not serve much purpose."</p><p></p><p>"Better to keep it, it might come in handy in the future."</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the Huanghuang Realm surely have methods to utilize the Eternal Remnant.</p><p></p><p>However, even when he reached the Authority Level of "Derivation Thirty" in his previous life, he never found related information.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Eternal Remnant, Li Fan couldn't help but think of the skull of the first cultivator infected by the Immortal and Mortal Poison that he saw in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, it was because it was attached to the Eternal Remnant that it was placed right in the center of the Divine Archive Museum."</p><p></p><p>His thoughts converged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not return to the Immortal Island, instead quietly arriving outside the Luli Island.</p><p></p><p>He found the giant Luli Fish, concealed his aura, and descended to the seabed.</p><p></p><p>Without directly taking action, he waited for something.</p><p></p><p>Minute after minute passed, when the time came to the node when Li Fan returned to the Immortal Realm in his previous lives and used the Non-Phase Killing Machine to kill the giant Luli Fish.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then replicated the actions, obtaining the Exquisite Luli Bead.</p><p></p><p>With an ample supply of Enlightenment Pills now, the role of this Luli Bead became less significant.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not slaughter the giant Luli Fish for this item alone but to ensure that the Lingwu Grass Island was attacked and a series of subsequent chained events happened.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did not act earlier at the 8-year mark was to avoid the effects brought by the deviation in the time node.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the world is constantly evolving, interconnected with each other.</p><p></p><p>By entering the Huanghuang Realm one year early, Li Fan had already influenced many affairs like a stone falling into a pond.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could not guarantee that the experiences of his previous lives would not change in this life.</p><p></p><p>What he could do was to minimize the deviations as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"The speculation of the Lingwu Grass event is crucial to the Great War of Tianlingzhou, the bounty for reaching the Extreme Immortal, and the appearance of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation."</p><p></p><p>"There is no room for error."</p><p></p><p>"If it really can't..." </p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the giant Luli Fish was no more, and a thread of fresh blood floated upwards.</p><p></p><p>A hint of ferocity flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Having done this, Li Fan made another round, acquiring two Blue Blood Coral plants.</p><p></p><p>Although the point contribution was inconsequential to the current Li Fan, he could use this task to get acquainted with the Nascent Infant cultivator from the Yantang who would visit the Five Elements Grand Immortal Realm next.</p><p></p><p>As long as he monitored him with the Non-Phase Killing Machine, he would know immediately when the Great War of Tianlingzhou erupted, thereby seizing the opportunity to fish in troubled waters.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan chose to submit the mission.</p><p></p><p>"Merely with a main medicine, you could deduce the elixir I intend to refine? Could it be that Daoist is also adept in this area?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed piqued by curiosity, Chen Ying inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I don't understand alchemy, just a bit of divination." Li Fan replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I intend to explore the Falling Immortal Realm and feel that the elixir Daoist intends to refine might be of help. Hence the inquiry."</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying exclaimed, "The art of divination is indeed so mysterious..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, are you the Ancient Tianji Sect cultivator who awoke from a deep slumber?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, seeing Li Fan's name, Chen Ying recalled something and asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's me. It's just an empty title, Daoist need not take it seriously!" Li Fan humbly replied.</p><p></p><p>However, Chen Ying was thoroughly intrigued and insisted on meeting Li Fan in person, offering to give a few Icy Heartbreak Pills to Li Fan for free.</p><p></p><p>Falsely declining, Li Fan could only reluctantly agree.</p><p></p><p>The two arranged to meet at the Immortal Island at Chen Ying's residence.</p><p></p><p>It was widely known that cultivators could purchase cave residences to live on the Immortal Island.</p><p></p><p>However, the prices were exorbitant.</p><p></p><p>None of the Cultivators Li Fan befriended in his previous lives were as extravagant.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhang Zhiliang did not bear to buy a residence, preferring to enjoy his life.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that alchemy has more money-making prospects than formations."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan arrived at Chen Ying's cave residence.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's arrival, a green door suddenly opened with a bang.</p><p></p><p>Though the appearance looked simple and small from the outside, it revealed a different world upon entering.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if walking into a valley, where various herbs and spirit plants of different kinds grew in the continuous Ling Field.</p><p></p><p>The concentration of Spiritual Energy within the valley wasn't very high, and Li Fan didn't see anyone nurturing them.</p><p></p><p>Yet, all these spirit plants and herbs were flourishing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that it might be related to the layers of different colored restrictions covering the Ling Field.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Daoist Li Fan, you finally came!" Chen Ying's hearty laughter could be heard from afar.</p><p></p><p>Looking over, Li Fan saw him emerging from a group of crops taller than the others.</p><p></p><p>Despite his somewhat disheveled appearance, Chen Ying flew directly towards Li Fan without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Octagon Grass... but compared to ordinary ones, it doesn't seem this tall."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that while Chen Ying excels in alchemy, he is also very skilled in cultivating spirit plants. Today's meeting confirms his reputation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spirits lifted.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Chen Ying, I have long heard of your name!" he greeted warmly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed as he stared fixedly at Chen Ying.</p><p></p><p>Sensing something amiss, Chen Ying felt his own face. "What's wrong, Friend Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's defensive expression, he couldn't help but ask, "I sense that a great disaster may befall you in a few days!"</p>

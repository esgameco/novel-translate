        <h1>Chapter 845</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The beasts in the Beast Realm gradually sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Although the two invaders only displayed the cultivation level of Hua Shen, they stood firm like rocks, undefeated in the face of the endless beast attacks. They even grew stronger as the battle went on!</p><p></p><p>Desolate beast howls echoed throughout the entire Beast Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the wind and clouds changed color. Above the central black tower, a huge vortex formed.</p><p></p><p>Within the vortex, the silhouette of a black mystic bird could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang and Lin Ling's expressions turned solemn for the first time.</p><p></p><p>But that was all.</p><p></p><p>Just like how Elder Liu of the Medicine King Sect swept through this realm in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Even though they mobilized the remnant phantom of Little Black and summoned the will of the Beast Realm to fight the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Under the joint efforts of the two Dao Unification experts, it was still quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>As per Li Fan's instructions, after killing the strongest few beasts and extracting their beast cores.</p><p></p><p>They also sectioned off a piece of land and centrally penned the remaining beasts.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two began their next step.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, they moved the entrance passage of the Beast Realm into the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the previous experience of relocating the entrance of the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, this time it was a smooth process and the task was quickly completed.</p><p></p><p>When designing the headquarters of the [Myriad Realms Alliance], Ou Dao Zi specifically allocated a vacant area.</p><p></p><p>It was used to house the entrances leading to various realms.</p><p></p><p>At this time, it was not yet on a large scale. Only when more small worlds were connected in the future would it live up to the name of [Myriad Realms Alliance].</p><p></p><p>Of course, safety was also a necessary consideration.</p><p></p><p>The more passages there were, the greater the potential loopholes.</p><p></p><p>Ou Dao Zi considered a spatial nesting scheme, planning to slice the area with the entrances to each realm into a relatively independent, disposable nested space.</p><p></p><p>If misfortune truly struck, it could be abandoned like a lizard detaching its tail to survive.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still in the conceptual stage.</p><p></p><p>Even though Tian Yang had devoured the [Ink Stone], to freely slice space still required some time to master.</p><p></p><p>There was an order of urgency to matters.</p><p></p><p>After the Beast Realm and Spirit Wood Realm were connected, Tian Yang first went to the Boundary Realm according to the location Li Fan specified.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the beast cores in the "Immortal Spirit Pagoda" left by Li Fan had been depleted.</p><p></p><p>Without spiritual energy output, the cultivation of the Boundary Realm people gradually fell into a desperate situation.</p><p></p><p>The exploration of the Fire World was still in its initial stages.</p><p></p><p>Left with no choice, Su Yuqing sought help from Li Fan through a communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>When he appeared, the oppressive might of a Dao Unification cultivator made the entire Boundary Realm seem as if shrouded by a thick layer of dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>The ignorant people showed fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>Only Su Yuqing was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Facing the respectful Su Yuqing, Tian Yang did not say much.</p><p></p><p>He only silently helped restore the operation of the Immortal Spirit Pagoda, and then connected the Boundary Realm with the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"When the Immortal Spirit energy is exhausted again in the future, you can go to the Beast Realm to hunt and replenish the required beast cores."</p><p></p><p>"The Beast Realm is not like the Boundary Realm. You still need to improve your own cultivation as much as possible. For the required rare items and cultivation methods, you can apply to the Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang said concisely.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Actually, at the beginning, Li Fan had the idea of directly infusing the spiritual energy of the Spirit Wood Realm into the Boundary Realm.</p><p></p><p>But after careful consideration, he vetoed it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the majority of small worlds lacked spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Wood Realm could nourish one realm,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What if there were ten or a hundred of them?</p><p></p><p>It would be more appropriate for all realms to slowly transform through the Spirit Tower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this would require an astronomical supply of beast cores.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan planned to go to the Empire with Tian Yang after his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Realms Union was thriving and developing steadily.</p><p></p><p>Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ji Shaoli predicted.</p><p></p><p>With the release of the latest announcement from the Immortal Alliance, an unprecedented large-scale recruitment exam was about to be held.</p><p></p><p>Compared to previous sessions, the positions provided this time were more than double.</p><p></p><p>Even the overall treatment of cultivators within the Immortal Alliance system had a significant increase.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators eagerly applied, hoping to change their fate against the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, He Zhenghao, who had already made ample preparations and was full of confidence, seemed a bit restless.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao didn't seem to hear what he was thinking about.</p><p></p><p>He turned a deaf ear.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist He!" Ji Shaoli couldn't help but frown and called out again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did He Zhenghao come back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Daoist He, you are hiding something from us." Ji Shaoli laughed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's abnormality started two days ago, after he returned from a trip to Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Because they shared a common secret, the cultivators present at the mutual aid meeting realized something upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>They all stared intently at He Zhenghao, their faces showing displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Misunderstanding, misunderstanding!" He Zhenghao gave a bitter laugh and quickly explained.</p><p></p><p>"It's not what you all think. The reason why I've been absent-minded lately..."</p><p></p><p>He hesitated for a moment, and finally with a helpless look, took out a painting album.</p><p></p><p>His old face turned red: "The culprit is this thing."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli appeared calm on the surface, but his heart sank.</p><p></p><p>He took the painting album and flipped through the first few pages, then abruptly put it away.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get this from?" Ji Shaoli asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>What was recorded in the painting album was the wonderful and sensual events of [One Heart Heavenly Venerate].</p><p></p><p>Although it was not as nearly real as the illusion Li Fan had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>But it had a different kind of allure that could sway a cultivator's mind.</p><p></p><p>No wonder He Zhenghao had been so distracted in the past few days.</p><p></p><p>"I got it from a Daoist friend who I'm close with. He was being all mysterious, saying it was some good stuff. He insisted and it cost me five hundred contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"Although this painting book is indeed not bad."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao muttered in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing He Zhenghao say this, the crowd became even more curious.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli only showed the front part of the painting album to everyone.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators originally mocked: "Daoist He, you are at least a Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet you were actually bewitched by this thing?"</p><p></p><p>But when He Zhenghao retorted and told them the true identity of the protagonist in the painting album.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded, and their eyes looking at the painting album in Ji Shaoli's hand instantly changed.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli snorted coldly, and with a few words, pulled them out from their wild imaginations.</p><p></p><p>"The hearts of the masses... become one?"</p><p></p><p>"Indulging in those thoughts could lead to assimilation?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's faces turned pale.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was even more stunned on the spot, his body trembling slightly non-stop.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, you haven't fallen in too deep."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist He, you go into seclusion immediately and eliminate all distracting thoughts from your mind." Ji Shaoli ordered in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The panicked He Zhenghao just subconsciously followed Ji Shaoli's instructions.</p><p></p><p>After locking He Zhenghao in a small dark room for self-reflection and reassuring the crowd, Ji Shaoli started to investigate.</p>

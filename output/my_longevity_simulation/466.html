        <h1>Chapter 466</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Don't look at me like that. I originally intended to pay, but no matter how I called for you, you didn't respond."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shrugged, "And when you woke up, before I could say anything, you exploded on your own. Can you blame me for that?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan looked at Li Fan with a face full of innocence, and his face twitched.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, since the other party didn't seem like someone who took without asking, he could only pretend generously, saying, "Forget it, it's just a puppet after all, it exploded! I have many more puppets!"</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao is magnanimous!" Li Fan applauded and praised.</p><p></p><p>"I remember the scene depicted in the painting should be from the ancient days of the Heaven Sword Sect. Is Friend Li reminiscing about the past?" At this moment, Jiao Xiuyuan suddenly eyed Li Fan, inexplicably asking.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Jiao Xiuyuan, his thoughts racing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan shook his head, sounding confused, "Heaven Sword Sect? Friend, you must have gotten it wrong. Although I lost some memories during my thousands of years of slumber, I do have some recollection of the two stone tablets 'Halt' and 'Halt Warfare' in front of the gates of the Heaven Sword Sect. The sect gate in this painting doesn't quite resemble it!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan slapped his head, "Hehe, look at my memory, probably losing a puppet just now caused a confusion in my memory."</p><p></p><p>"Too Superior Sect, it should be the Too Superior Sect!" Jiao Xiuyuan said again.</p><p></p><p>"Too Superior Sect..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes, seeming to be recalling something.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he slowly shook his head, "No, I once visited the Too Superior Sect. The thirty-three floating peaks within the sect, also don't match with the scenery in the painting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Jiao Xiuyuan with suspicion, "Friend Jiao, you..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan dryly laughed a few times, hastily saying, "Wrong again! Um, let me think..."</p><p></p><p>"It should be the Crossing Calamity Sect! This time, there's absolutely no mistake!" he confidently declared.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing Calamity Sect?" A glint of realization crossed Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's two deliberate attempts to test had failed, and this time, the mention of the Crossing Calamity Sect should not be false.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, outside the Five Elements Grand Heaven, when the five elements converged, Li Fan had once glimpsed a Mirage Time of the Crossing Calamity Sect's master and disciple.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at that time, among the cultivators on the Crossing Dust Boat, only he could see it.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought it was due to his strong spirit, different from an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>But if the scenes he saw at the Abyss Ruins back then also came from the Crossing Calamity Sect...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled that back then, while staring at the abyss's bottom, there was a moment when he was bewitched by the abyss's power.</p><p></p><p>Almost losing his sanity, wanting to explore the abyss before completing the recharging of the True Form.</p><p></p><p>And at that critical moment, a brilliant light suddenly emanated from the abyss's bottom.</p><p></p><p>The words "The Dao of Immortality is Dead" were then vividly displayed, bringing him back to normal.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that it saved his life.</p><p></p><p>"It looks like the Crossing Calamity Sect is intricately connected to me in various ways. Odd..."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while and retracing past experiences, Li Fan couldn't find the reason for this connection.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing Calamity Sect. I've only heard of its name, but it seems I've never been there. Friend Jiao, how much do you know about this Crossing Calamity Sect?" Li Fan turned to ask Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>"For some reason, I strangely feel familiar with the scenery inside the Crossing Calamity Sect. Could it be that my memory is also in disorder?" Li Fan looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Li Fan's playful tone, Jiao Xiuyuan said with some surprise, "Is that so? That's quite extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How so?" Li Fan quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you are likely the 'Destined One' left by the Crossing Calamity Sect cultivator who initially painted this picture!" Jiao Xiuyuan said solemnly, his gaze towards Li Fan becoming profound.</p><p></p><p>"'Destined One'?" Li Fan repeated the term several times in his mouth, "What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Just as the name suggests. The practitioners of the Crossing Calamity Sect cultivate by 'crossing calamities.' Their technique, 'Eternal Calamity Eternal World,' is about drawing strength from various calamities. With each calamity crossed, their strength undergoes a qualitative leap."</p><p></p><p>"The stronger the calamity, the more feedback strength they receive upon overcoming it."</p><p></p><p>"However, for their next advancement, they need to aim for even more dangerous calamities."</p><p></p><p>"But in the world, calamities are countless. Even the heavens and earth could face destruction in the face of calamities. How can the Crossing Calamity Sect practitioners be absolutely certain of crossing each calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"When they realize they may not survive the next calamity, they use secret techniques to hide temporarily in the world."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, leaving behind various means, waiting for someone to appear who can solve this calamity."</p><p></p><p>"These people are called the 'Destined Ones'!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan slowly explained to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan furrowed his brows deeply, "There is such a technique? So you're saying I might have caught the attention of a Crossing Calamity Sect practitioner? Friend Jiao, do you have a way to break this?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan waved his hand, "Don't be so nervous! Thousands of years have passed. Who knows if the Crossing Calamity Sect practitioner who left behind this painted form is still alive?"</p><p></p><p>"And even if they are, you have nothing to worry about, Friend. Before crossing the calamity, they absolutely won't harm you. And if you help them cross the calamity, they owe you a great favor. At that time, they must repay this kindness. This is a rule passed down by the Crossing Calamity Sect. Otherwise, who would play such games with them?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, think about it. You can solve the calamities that they can't. It's very likely that your strength will surpass theirs by then. If they don't want trouble with you, they should thank their lucky stars. How could they dare to clash with you."</p><p></p><p>Regarding Li Fan's worries, Jiao Xiuyuan didn't take it seriously. Instead, he looked at Li Fan with renewed interest.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li Fan, being sensed by the Crossing Calamity Sect practitioner as the 'Destined One,' your future is truly boundless!"</p><p></p><p>After Jiao Xiuyuan's words, Li Fan felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>But a thorn had grown in his heart.</p><p></p><p>From the previous help the other party provided at the Abyss Ruins, it was evident that the Crossing Calamity Sect practitioner must still be alive in the world.</p><p></p><p>Although the practitioner couldn't monitor Li Fan's every move all the time, with continuous spying, who can say if they would discover something eventually.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to find an opportunity to resolve this hidden worry," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, your knowledge is extensive, and you're well-versed in the secrets of ancient sects. Admirable! Admirable!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how much contribution does this painting require, I'll buy it. Can't let you make an unprofitable deal, Friend!"</p>

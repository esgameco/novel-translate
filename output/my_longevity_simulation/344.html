        <h1>Chapter 344</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Fallen Immortal Realm can be entered again. While there's still some time, we can explore it once more."</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, let's first take a look at the major events that have occurred in the past six months."</p><p></p><p>Knowing things in advance was his advantage. Every piece of valuable information could mean a great opportunity in the next life.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally wouldn't neglect this. He immediately started searching in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Numerous strange events and stories flashed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, two things caught his attention the most.</p><p></p><p>First, the old fisherman who hadn't appeared for a long time showed up again. This time, he stayed in Tianchen Province. But unlike in the past when he was alone, there was actually a seven or eight-year-old girl beside the old fisherman. Dressed like the old fisherman, wearing a straw raincoat, she carried the fish basket that the old fisherman usually carried on her back, which was almost as big as her. It looked quite comical.</p><p></p><p>Some bold cultivators tried to get close to this little fisherwoman, but they were scolded by her in an old-fashioned manner.</p><p></p><p>Although she appeared to be only at the Foundation Establishment stage, she used a tone of teaching juniors even when facing Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the old fisherman had wandered for a long time, appearing and disappearing mysteriously, and no one had ever been able to follow him.</p><p></p><p>This little girl immediately aroused the curiosity of many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators speculated about the identity of this little fisherwoman, but there were various opinions and no conclusion was reached.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan saw this news, for some reason, he suddenly thought of the Stealing the Heavens and Swapping the Sun Token he had traded to the old fisherman.</p><p></p><p>"Si Kong Yue?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes, guessing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When he first obtained the Stealing the Heavens and Swapping the Sun Token and learned about the origin of that token, he had a vague guess.</p><p></p><p>The forger of this token, Si Kong Yue, the 38th generation inheritor of the Stealing the Heavens and Swapping the Sun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps through some secret method, she transformed herself into a token in order to seek survival in the extremely bloody era of the Great Darkness.</p><p></p><p>When later generations of cultivators tried to cultivate the Stealing the Heavens and Swapping the Sun Jue using the token, with both their body and soul merging with the token.</p><p></p><p>She could secretly absorb power and eventually achieve "stealing the heavens and swapping the sun" to resurrect.</p><p></p><p>So all along, Li Fan had been very wary of this token.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining it, he always left it in the corner of his storage ring and didn't provoke it.</p><p></p><p>When the old fisherman asked for this item, he handed it over without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that his premonition might have been correct.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what method the old fisherman used to awaken her. But after sleeping for thousands of years and finally being resurrected, only to be forced to act as a follower and little fisherwoman, I guess the feeling won't be pleasant." Li Fan thought to himself, and then pondered the second thing that he was very concerned about.</p><p></p><p>In the past year, there have been rumors spreading throughout the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the Five Elders Association, which had been silent for a long time, made a move again.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator who specializes in the Dao of souls has reportedly quietly infiltrated the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator's cultivation is unfathomable, and it is said that he was already at the Harmonious Dao realm a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he has abandoned his physical body and only exists as a soul.</p><p></p><p>His soul is so powerful that it is no different from an ordinary entity.</p><p></p><p>He can even freely enter the bodies of other cultivators, perform possession, and replace them.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, a tragic case occurred in Lietu Province.</p><p></p><p>The garrison of Zhupi City suddenly had a drastic change in personality and slaughtered all the mortals under his rule.</p><p></p><p>He even falsely reported that "there was an infiltration by spies who committed a bloody case" and used the excuse of "investigating the scene details" to lure dozens of cultivators from the Martial Hall of Lietu Province into Zhupi City.</p><p></p><p>He then erupted with strength completely inconsistent with his original self, annihilating the Martial Hall team led by Nascent Soul cultivators in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Before the cultivators of Lietu Province could react, he left with his head held high.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only a city of blood, shocking and angering the cultivators who rushed there later.</p><p></p><p>After this, more than a dozen incidents occurred where cultivators suddenly had drastic changes in personality and then committed wanton slaughter as if they didn't recognize their relatives.</p><p></p><p>But the culprit was never found.</p><p></p><p>People connected these tragic cases with the previous news of a Harmonious Dao Immortal from the Five Elders Association infiltrating.</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone believed that the reason those cultivators had drastic changes in personality was that they were possessed by the Harmonious Dao Immortal from the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the slaughter incidents continued to occur, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance also developed a sense of fear.</p><p></p><p>After all, no one could guarantee that they wouldn't become the next target of possession.</p><p></p><p>They also had to worry about their close friends suddenly stabbing them in the back.</p><p></p><p>As negative emotions accumulated, the result was that the voices criticizing the Martial Hall for being incompetent grew louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>And the calls for the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation to be popularized as soon as possible also became stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>The effect of the Soul-Locking Formation has been clearly demonstrated in Jiushan Province.</p><p></p><p>Although the Myriad Immortal Alliance rarely announced an explanation that the light beam lock-on of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is only applicable to cultivators below the Harmonious Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the cultivators, having an effect is always better than having no countermeasures at all and just passively waiting to be slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Besides, formations can be improved and strengthened.</p><p></p><p>If it can't deal with Harmonious Dao cultivators now, it should be possible after continuous improvements, right?</p><p></p><p>In short, due to the existence of this Five Elders Association spy called the "Thousand-Faced Demon Venerable" by the cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, the public's attitude towards the popularization of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>It changed from initial opposition to later acquiescence, and then to the current hope and support.</p><p></p><p>The popularization of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation has now become an unstoppable trend.</p><p></p><p>Not only is the official attitude resolute, but the masses are also eagerly welcoming it.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some dissonant opposing voices in the face of this overwhelming wave.</p><p></p><p>But they were resolutely suppressed before attracting attention.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the incompetence of the Martial Hall in the face of the invasion by the Thousand-Faced Demon Venerable also aroused considerable dissatisfaction among many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators believed that the current Martial Hall could no longer adapt to the increasingly fierce struggle with the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to follow the example of the existence of the Central Hinterland Guard Academy and re-establish a new military organization to protect the safety within the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This idea also received a very strong call for support.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance officials also issued a statement saying that they would fully consider and respect the opinions of the vast number of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Relevant matters are under negotiation, and specific measures will be announced soon.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance's rare active response made many cultivators excited.</p><p></p><p>They believed that this change might be a sign of good days to come.</p><p></p><p>But cultivators who truly glimpsed some clues, such as Li Fan at this moment, could only remain silent in the cold of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"It's really a wonderful move."</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the Thousand-Faced Demon Venerable not only greatly accelerated the popularization of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation."</p><p></p><p>"Even after the formation is fully established, it will have wonderful uses."</p><p></p><p>"There will always be a day when the spies are all caught."</p>

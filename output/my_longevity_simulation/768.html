        <h1>Chapter 768</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"From the mirror space of the Heavenly Mystery, the Deng Mingxi that was seen had the appearance of only 13 or 14 years old. This should be her actual age."</p><p></p><p>"Though young in years, she must have been well protected by her clan members. Thus, despite being able to read minds, she currently lacks much guile," Li Fan pondered inwardly. </p><p></p><p>"She only has the Golden Dan cultivation level, yet can sense my thoughts..."</p><p></p><p>"It should not be due to her cultivation method. Perhaps it has to do with the strange object she used to establish her foundation. The ability to read minds is already rare in the Xuanhuang Realm. To be able to transcend cultivation realm disparities to this degree, it may already be considered a semi-heavenly wonder."  A strange light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his cycles through the worlds, apart from the heavenly wonders of the "Cultivation Bead" and the "Sword", Li Fan had also encountered many cultivators possessing semi-heavenly wonders.</p><p></p><p>There was He Zhengdaughter's "Dao Compass", the Celestial Maiden of the Void's "Yin-Yang Jade", and Sun Qi's "Unity of Qian and Kun".</p><p></p><p>But none had stirred Li Fan's heart like Deng Mingxi's mind-reading strange object.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the human heart is inscrutable. This was even more so in the cultivation world where methods could not be practiced together. No one could guarantee that a so-called cultivation brother walking beside you was not actually harboring malicious intentions.</p><p></p><p>If one could master the ability to read minds, even if only for a few critical moments, it could greatly reduce the various risks encountered in the cultivation journey.  </p><p></p><p>Not to mention, it could also serve as a way to gauge one's strength to some degree. If one suddenly lost the ability to read minds, it meant the other party was someone not to be provoked.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I could even deduce a way to prevent my thoughts from being read by others."</p><p></p><p>With his strong determination, Li Fan immediately returned to the Heavenly Mystery Mirror in Heavenly Rights City to inquire about information related to Deng Mingxi.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he could not find any valuable information about her. </p><p></p><p>It was as if Deng Mingxi had appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan changed his approach and instead searched for the "Elder Brother Qingyu" that Deng Mingxi had mentioned, along with the arrogant and vengeful personality described by Wang Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He almost immediately got a match.  </p><p></p><p>However, Deng Qingyu's backing was not from the Deng family, but rather the Heavenly Rights Royal Family.</p><p></p><p>"So he's an adopted son. But the Royal Family treats him as their own, even better than their direct descendants."</p><p></p><p>"It's probably because of the grace of his sister," Li Fan nodded to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Rights Royal Family could not be considered top-tier nobility in the immortal sects, ordinary people still could not afford to offend them. Many of the family's cultivators served in the mysterious Guardian Hall.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the head of the Royal Family was even entrusted with safeguarding the "Cultivation Bead"...</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw this information, Li Fan had already made up his mind.  </p><p></p><p>He vowed to become friends with this Royal Family for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>However, after searching for more information, Li Fan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that not only Deng Qingyu had a bad reputation, but the entire younger generation of the Royal Family, including the elders, had no good reputation.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Immortal Alliance, there was not a single cultivator willing to speak up for them. Whenever the Heavenly Rights Royal Family was mentioned, people would spit in disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Is it to avoid suspicion?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had experienced the official circles before, was not unfamiliar with such tactics.</p><p></p><p>"The Cultivation Bead..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, and the search ended here. He did not further search for more related content.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Mirror had already completed its upgrade, and if Li Fan paid too much attention to these sensitive contents, he might be marked by it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had already been on guard against the Heavenly Profound Mirror, naturally did not want to cultivate within it.</p><p></p><p>Now, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance were searching the mountains and seas, looking for the entrances to the small worlds. Digging deep and secret chambers in the wild had also become unsafe.</p><p></p><p>"The hidden danger from Liu San's side has not been eliminated yet..."</p><p></p><p>For the moment, although the world was vast, Li Fan could not even find a safe place to seclude himself and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"This is the consequence of the Heavenly Profound Mirror becoming powerful, just like the Mysterious Net from the previous world."</p><p></p><p>After weighing the options, Li Fan still chose to rent a separate courtyard in the Lun Dao Pavilion in the Tian Quan City, and set up multiple formations as protection.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he feel a little at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Although there are no reckless actions, all my movements and plans seem to still be under my control. But in this world, I inexplicably feel a sense of difficulty in taking every step."</p><p></p><p>"This is the oppression of the great trend. With cultivation power too low, I can only follow the flow of the situation. Once I go against the trend, even a slight carelessness will lead to being crushed to pieces."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can consider the 'Zhen Ru' technique."</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, there are a few things I must do."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Dao Crystalline Stone in his sea of consciousness absorbing too much data, Li Fan felt a slight dullness in his thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take it step by step, first completely master the 'Wuji Yingxu Technique'."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and the blue crystal in his mind, as if overstuffed, struggled to emit a faint glow, slowly analyzing and processing the data of the divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Tian Liang City.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly received a message from Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, good news. Among the new disciples Master Fang recently accepted, someone has successfully established their foundation!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Xu Bai was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to the understanding of the 'Establish Foundation with Me' technique, now that Yin Shang had passed away, there were almost no cultivators in the world who could surpass him. How could it be possible that someone succeeded in such a short time?</p><p></p><p>What is Liu San...</p><p></p><p>For a moment, many thoughts flashed through Xu Bai's mind. He fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Liu San's next words slowly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not the 'Establish Foundation with Me' technique, but a young man named Jie Lin, who felt that this foundation establishment method was too difficult. He unexpectedly self-taught a method to establish his foundation using other things in heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"At first, I didn't pay much attention. In the blink of an eye, he successfully established his foundation using a thousand-year-old Fulong Grass from the Longevity Valley."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, in that case, this Jie Lin can indeed be considered an extraordinary talent. Since he has already successfully established his foundation, there is no need to force him further. Just take him out separately and prevent the true foundation establishment method from spreading among the disciples."</p><p></p><p>The laughter of Liu San also came from the other side: "Hehe, I have already done so. This kind of talent with extraordinary natural aptitude, in the ancient times, would have been snatched up by the Ten Immortal Sects long ago. How could it be our Medicinal King Sect's turn. The times have indeed changed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai also instructed again, "You can use Jie Lin's successful foundation establishment as an example to further motivate the others. Perhaps it can inspire more geniuses."</p>

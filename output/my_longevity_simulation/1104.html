            <p>Chapter 1102: Gathering the Essence of the Masses in One Body</p><p></p><p>The research on the power of darkness by the people of the Heavenly Mechanism Realm was not going as smoothly as imagined.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, it was, after all, a power level comparable to the essence of the Source Power. No matter how talented one was, completing research from scratch would definitely require a lot of time. Fortunately, Artisan Qiao and the others were all research fanatics. Once the research began, they were completely immersed in it, with no distractions.</p><p></p><p>All Li Fan needed to do was wait patiently and then reap the benefits.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Li Fan had already quietly begun his plans for the two Immortals.</p><p></p><p>In the underground chamber of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred strangely shaped puppets stood still.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan solemnly carved formations on them personally.</p><p></p><p>"Bait puppets, two in a group, seventy-two groups in total. One from each group will fly into the Immortal Ruins, while the other will be placed in various corners of the ley lines in the Xuanhuang Realm. When the seventy-two bait puppets fly towards the Immortal Ruins, the grand formation on their bodies will be activated, drawing the attention of the Immortals in the ruins."</p><p></p><p>"This formation is derived from the Dissociation Disk, already infinitely close to the Immortal-level grand formation. It is called 【Bewildering, Gradually Confusing Flowers】. When in seclusion, suddenly sensing a threat, one will instinctively react. Thus tracing back to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"And near these bait puppets left in the Xuanhuang Realm, I will use the essence of the Faceless True Immortal's source power to lay out an alert network. Once the power of the Immortals from the ruins triggers it, it will attract the attention of the Faceless True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens..."</p><p></p><p>"Once these two unimaginable powers come into contact with each other, the Xuanhuang Realm will probably be destroyed in an instant. So I falsely inform the Dao that the action of extracting Xuanhuang is about to change, and preparations must be made in advance."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Stone in his mind emitted a flashing blue light.</p><p></p><p>The upgraded Dao Stone's ability to derive had been greatly enhanced. This bold move involved many aspects. Even with countless threads and frequent variables, the Dao Stone had no significant burden.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only because, in the derivation, the Faceless True Immortal and the Immortals from the ruins only had the abilities that Li Fan had preset.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very self-aware. With his current strength, it was nothing but a pipe dream to try to derive the actions of a True Immortal. What he could do was to seek a glimmer of hope based on the reality he had already experienced.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortals from the ruins shake the True Immortal's net."</p><p></p><p>"I will take the opportunity to activate Huan Zhen and break free in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this is the ideal state. As the saying goes, 'plan for defeat before victory.' I also have to consider that if my plan fails and the power gap between the Immortals from the ruins and the Faceless True Immortal is too large to shake the restraint of the True Immortal's net..."</p><p></p><p>"Then I will immediately return to the depths of the Youkai Realm, activate Huan Zhen, and escape the crisis."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have mastered a few things that can at least slightly affect the True Immortal, I can still delay for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan examined outside his own soul.</p><p></p><p>The silver light protection given by the Heavenly Doctor, the golden essence of the Source Power, and the seven-colored divine light wrapped in gray mold...</p><p></p><p>Various forces maintained a delicate balance.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only someone like Li Fan could maintain complete composure in this situation. He even felt a sense of reassurance.</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing force to fight force, maneuvering freely. In essence, it is still self-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"My personal strength is too weak. But is it so easy to cross the threshold of immortality?"</p><p></p><p>"Geniuses like the Xuantian King, Chuanfa, and Tianyi were all blocked outside, unable to advance an inch."</p><p></p><p>"Let alone me? If it weren't for possessing Huanzhen, I'm afraid I would have long given up on this seemingly unrealistic fantasy." Li Fan said with a hint of self-mockery.</p><p></p><p>"But since I have been fortunate enough to encounter the miraculous object [Huanzhen], then no one can stop my path to immortality..." A cold gleam flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was a clumsy imitation by later generations.</p><p></p><p>So for a long time, Li Fan had never given up on in-depth research of these three types of true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a copy of a copy, the more similar the imitation, the stronger the power.</p><p></p><p>Even immortals could comprehend the Dao by relying on just one of these characters. It could be said that any one of these three would take Li Fan almost a lifetime of effort to fully understand.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's comprehension was limited. But he could borrow from external objects.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the unparalleled talent of his avatar Li Qing, the geniuses of the Xuanhuang Realm who had recently been deceived and won over to [Shanhe Xuan] also became Li Fan's nourishment.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Sect's technique he obtained from Senior Sister Zhao, the Heaven and Earth Mutual Conquest, could balance and harmonize the talents and comprehension of any target.</p><p></p><p>After Li Qing made some progress, he began to look for suitable targets.</p><p></p><p>Claiming to the outside that he was sending them out to carry out the secret missions of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, they had actually been secretly controlled to extract their talents.</p><p></p><p>Of course, due to the mutual conquest and balancing, these geniuses also gained half of Li Qing's talent enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's talent was not inferior to theirs, so the geniuses of Shanhe Xuan, including Shang Tianci, did not notice anything unusual. They were just amazed at the wonders of the [Using Me to Build Foundation] method.</p><p></p><p>Having gained the talent boost of more than a dozen geniuses, Li Qing's comprehension had reached a shocking level.</p><p></p><p>He even noticed that Li Fan's true body had removed some of his own memories.</p><p></p><p>But after all, he was just an avatar, with no difference between him and the true body. He firmly carried out the task of comprehending the true immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>The three types of true immortal seal characters kept appearing in his mind, as if they were living things.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing seemed to see a blurry figure in front of his eyes, performing the act of transforming the Dao into characters.</p><p></p><p>"Engraving the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"An existence even more powerful than the Faceless True Immortal. Perhaps that is my ultimate goal."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was secretly preparing for the final grand plan of this world.</p><p></p><p>The Life and Death Reversal Venerable, who had previously appeared out of nowhere, finally manifested His influence on the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because people discovered that since the descent of this Venerable, cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm had no longer given birth to new offspring.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the entire human race was like this.</p><p></p><p>At first, people could not be sure it was the influence of this Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But when a previously fallen cultivator returned in a way no one had ever thought of before, everyone instantly connected everything.</p><p></p><p>Lancang River, the largest river in the southwestern border of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>One day, a cultivator named Chang Ji suddenly emerged from the river, completely naked.</p><p></p><p>This abnormal scene naturally attracted the attention of surrounding people.</p><p></p><p>But Chang Ji didn't care at all, and instead looked at his own body with ecstatic disbelief, muttering to himself, "I came back to life again?"</p><p></p><p>"Reversing life and death, reversing life and death, the Venerable did not deceive me!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 694</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After all, no one knows how many worlds the Xuanhuang Realm has absorbed in these years to delay the fate of being devoured by the Immortal Ruins. Even the Xuanhuang Realm itself has undergone earth-shaking changes, as if it has expanded a circle. Not to mention the White Mist Barrier, this seemingly blending region of worlds.</p><p></p><p>However, for Li Fan, although there are dangers lurking in the white mist, the actual level of danger may not necessarily exceed that of the Xuanhuang Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are too many hidden monsters in the Xuanhuang Realm. Since his reincarnation, Li Fan has encountered the Tianyi, Ruomu, Mysterious Sky Master, and other existences, almost escaping danger each time. Who knows how many powerful beings are lurking in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>While the dangers in the white mist are indeed dangerous, the vast majority of risks come from the devouring nature of the white mist itself. Even if encountering some eerie and terrifying beings, it is not comparable to the powerful beings in the Xuanhuang Realm, preventing Li Fan from even using the chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the Xuanhuang Realm, the white mist is like a corpse of the dead cultivation world. Living people are often scarier than the dead."</p><p></p><p>"After arranging the back part of the 'Sitting Mountain Art,' with the clone Xu Bai present, there should be no loopholes. The main body is going to investigate the white mist to see what the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is up to."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan collected his thoughts and prepared to procure useful items in the Heaven Mystery Mirror based on his experience from the previous life. Such as: the "Eight Directions Tranquil Formation" that can temporarily block the attacks of the white mist and buy crucial breathing time at critical moments. And the necessary item for resisting the devouring effect of the white mist and moving in the white mist, the "Black Death Symbol." And many miraculous pills to quickly replenish the spiritual energy in the body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly noticed that the prices of these items had clearly shown an upward trend in recent times. Especially the "Black Death Symbol," its price had doubled quietly. It seems that quite a few people had already known about the upcoming exploration of cultivators in the white mist by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and were now quietly scheming for profit at this critical juncture.</p><p></p><p>Among all the supplies, the prices of the life-prolonging treasures were shockingly increased, generally tripled or quadrupled. Life-prolonging items were already rare and expensive in the world.</p><p></p><p>After a cultivator uses one type, they need to find another kind. This often leads to them being in demand but unavailable in the market.</p><p></p><p>Now, as the era of white mist exploration was approaching and facing the threat of the devouring white mist, these life-prolonging treasures were almost equivalent to life-saving items.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, Li Fan was trapped in the white mist and forcibly broke free. But in the end, because he had stayed in the white mist for too long, upon returning to the eternal immortal fortress, he had aged significantly. If he had the longevity pill at that time, he could have avoided this situation.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the world did not have the opportunity to continuously reset like Li Fan. Therefore, it was only natural for them to prepare more life-saving items for their own safety.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the more than one hundred longevity pills that Liu San had prepared for him with no contribution shortage, Li Fan naturally did not sell them. Instead, he planned to use them in critical situations.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, at this time, Zhong Shentong's reputation is still not established. I have been inquiring for a long time but haven't been able to find his whereabouts. If I could learn his technique of the Seven-Colored Divine Light, it would be much more convenient. As for his incomplete 'Life and Death Mysterious Practice,' let's talk about completing it in the future if the opportunity arises."</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Li Fan, Huangfu Song, and Dongfang Yao met again.</p><p></p><p>As promised, Li Fan took out the purchased batch of supplies and handed them over as planned.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, brother, you are indeed generous!" Dongfang Yao immediately laughed heartily, happily accepting the storage ring filled with items.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song looked at the ring and couldn't help showing surprise on his face: "Brother Li is truly extravagant!"</p><p></p><p>"Since we agreed to explore the white mist together, we naturally have to make thorough preparations. Some wealth is nothing compared to the importance of our lives, brothers." Li Fan waved his hand, seemingly indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, besides this, I have also prepared this." Li Fan's expression turned serious as he took out two jade bottles and handed them over.</p><p></p><p>After Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao received them and opened them, they saw three pills emitting a green light inside each bottle.</p><p></p><p>The tempting pill fragrance wafted over, almost making them unable to resist swallowing the pills immediately.</p><p></p><p>Both of them had a slight change in their expressions and said in unison, "Life-prolonging pills?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, lowered his voice, and said, "I went to great lengths to obtain these. They are called Longevity Pills. Each pill can extend life by two hundred years, and the wonderful thing is, they can be used repeatedly. Although the effect diminishes gradually, it is said that within ten pills, it can still guarantee a lifespan extension of a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao immediately realized the value of these longevity pills.</p><p></p><p>They carefully put away the jade bottles, looking at Li Fan with emotion and said, "Brother Li..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, raised his hand to interrupt them.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's expression changed constantly, and in the end, he gritted his teeth, as if he had made up his mind about something.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, wait for a moment, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan's response, Huangfu Song quickly left the discussion room at the Dao Building. Those who didn't know might think he was fleeing with the supplies.</p><p></p><p>However, neither Dongfang Yao nor Li Fan showed such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>They patiently waited in the room with a calm demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Having known Huangfu Song for many years, Dongfang Yao naturally had a clear understanding of his character and had no such concerns. However, Li Fan's ability to remain composed in this situation was truly admirable.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, my judgment is really good. Brother, you are indeed worth befriending!"</p><p></p><p>"In the white mist, there are many dangers. If we cannot trust our companions, what's the point of traveling together?" Li Fan said calmly, displaying his unique demeanor.</p><p></p><p>However, after waiting for a long time, Huangfu Song did not return, and there was no response when trying to contact him through communication talismans. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>This made even Dongfang Yao inevitably mumble about it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan remained calm and composed as always.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao couldn't help but admire him.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Li Fan could remain so calm was not only because he was very familiar with Huangfu Song and knew that he was not shallow-minded. But more importantly...</p><p></p><p>To Huangfu and the others, these seemingly "precious" supplies were not worth mentioning in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a little while longer, deep into the night, Huangfu Song returned quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Since Brother Li is so sincere, I have made up my mind as well."</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, please take a look..."</p><p></p><p>He sealed the room's door and set up an array around them to prevent eavesdropping.</p><p></p><p>Then, Huangfu Song solemnly took out a quaint square small mirror from his bosom and placed it in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Dongfang Yao was confused.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled, his eyes fixed on the mirror in Huangfu Song's hand.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 481</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The sect master, Chu Youhong, disregarded the lives of the disciples in the sect and, carrying the treasured item "Painting Sky Brush" along with many other treasures from the sect's treasury, directly disappeared into thin air.</p><p></p><p>Although in a certain sense, this also attracted a lot of firepower from the Point Painting Sect, as a sect master, it was truly a lack of responsibility.</p><p></p><p>This made the surviving and still fiercely fighting calligraphy and painting sect cultivators feel extremely resentful.</p><p></p><p>If the other party had not been so ruthless and merciless, they would have probably surrendered on the spot and joined the Point Painting Sect instead.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, apart from Chu Youhong and a few lucky ones who managed to escape with their lives, almost all the members of the Calligraphy and Painting Sect perished.</p><p></p><p>Although the Point Painting Sect failed to seize the Painting Sky Brush, they did absorb a large portion of the Calligraphy and Painting Sect's land and resources, greatly increasing their power. They leaped to become one of the top sects in the neighboring area, gaining a renowned reputation.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Youhong, he seemed to have disappeared entirely from the world along with the Painting Sky Brush.</p><p></p><p>Twenty years later, some surviving cultivators from the Calligraphy and Painting Sect who had encountered Chu Youhong angrily questioned him as to why he had disregarded the lives of the sect members and escaped alone.</p><p></p><p>Chu Youhong, however, showed no remorse and spoke some words that had been passed down through the history of the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Even if all of you had died, it wouldn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I am alive, the Calligraphy and Painting Sect is still here."</p><p></p><p>"Before his death, the master handed over the Calligraphy and Painting Sect to me, and I must not let it be destroyed in my hands."</p><p></p><p>Chu Youhong looked completely justified.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were left dumbfounded. They wanted to refute him, but when they opened their mouths, nothing came out.</p><p></p><p>The vengeance they had decided on was forgotten, and they simply let Chu Youhong leave in a state of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Due to the outrageousness of his words, they quickly spread within the cultivation world at that time.</p><p></p><p>Some laughed at it, some suddenly realized and considered it a profound statement.</p><p></p><p>There were even those who couldn't stand Chu Youhong's behavior and wanted to teach him a lesson in person.</p><p></p><p>However, after that incident, he seemed to have evaporated from the world, and no one had seen him since.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the calamity of heaven and earth descended later on that the Point Painting Sect inexplicably collapsed overnight.</p><p></p><p>Some began to suspect if it was his doing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Prioritizing personal interests over public good is indeed a behavior difficult for ordinary people to understand."</p><p></p><p>After carefully pondering for a while, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the spy within the Point Painting Sect had already reached the position of the senior brother, but still chose to betray and resort to violence, and that could be the reason."</p><p></p><p>"Realizing the true nature of their master, they must have felt that inheriting the Painting Sky Brush through normal means would be out of reach. So, they resorted to this plan."</p><p></p><p>"Meeting such an eccentric person, there may not have been a better way."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and searched for the words "Nan Ming."</p><p></p><p>He indeed found some fragmentary information about the "Nan Ming Demon Mountain."</p><p></p><p>However, when he tried to delve deeper, he found that his authority level was insufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Mountain..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have some connection with the surviving demons in the world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes sparkled as he made a mental note of it.</p><p></p><p>As time passed by, ten years flew by in a blink.</p><p></p><p>That year, other than occasional minor friction between the border provinces and the Five Elders' Council, the rest of the states remained peaceful and uneventful.</p><p></p><p>The same went for the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>As a special contracted steward of the Enchanting Martial Hall, Li Fan didn't have to carry out specific tasks.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to spare time to visit the hall, have tea, and report his presence.</p><p></p><p>If he was too busy, he could also contribute some contribution points and have other cultivators handle tasks on his behalf.</p><p></p><p>So, he lived a quite leisurely life.</p><p></p><p>After transferring the two hundred and thirty million contribution points from the third recruitment, along with accrued interest, to He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao stared blankly at the astronomical contribution points, staying still for quite some time before snapping out of it with red eyes.</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed by before he regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, He Zhenghao couldn't help but have the fleeting thought of embezzling and fleeing with the money.</p><p></p><p>But upon remembering the rightful owners of these contribution points, a shiver ran down his spine, making him instantly sober.</p><p></p><p>Unless he defected to the Five Elders' Council, there was no escaping from the consequences of betrayal.</p><p></p><p>Regaining his composure, He Zhenghao began to contact the individuals who had been involved in the investments, returning the contribution points one by one.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had benefitted from these returned contributions were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>However, what He Zhenghao said next left them somewhat regretful and dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao sighed faintly, saying, "Everyone, please go back! When the rumors die down, Master Li will decide to re-initiate the recruitment, and I will notify everyone."</p><p></p><p>His words were ambiguous.</p><p></p><p>But the more ambiguous the words, the easier they stirred up people's unfounded thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Inevitable factors? When the rumors die down?</p><p></p><p>This Master Li was someone who could stack money to kill even Yuanying-stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Now he had to reluctantly halt the recruitment.</p><p></p><p>"It must have harmed someone's interests indeed."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present couldn't help but reveal expressions that showed they understood. After exchanging glances, they fell silent, feeling angry that they couldn't hitch a ride to prosperity, and at the same time, feeling indignant on Li Fan's behalf.</p><p></p><p>"Once everything returns to normal, be sure to inform me first."</p><p></p><p>Privately, they all conveyed similar messages to He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Having received numerous gifts and acquired a small fortune, He Zhenghao naturally agreed with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's temporary suspension of the contribution recruitment was due to the rapid expansion of the total contribution, which was somewhat getting out of control, and he wanted to temporarily slow down for this reason.</p><p></p><p>However, he also received warnings from within the Ten Thousand Immortals' Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Well, let's stir up their appetite first. When the time comes close to the Crimson Flame Sea, we can restart the plan."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't particularly concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivators profited from the fourth investment began to spend contribution points to enhance their own strengths.</p><p></p><p>A surge of feedback surged into Li Fan's dantian, constantly appearing without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Even without cultivating, his cultivation level steadily increased every day.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Li Fan's almost continuous enlightenment and comprehension of the Double Life Dan had not stopped for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In just a year, he could rival several decades of cultivation for an ordinary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt that his Golden Pill completion was in sight, and it wouldn't be long before he could prepare for the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the year, every three months, he made a trip to the Form Transformation Island to extract some Kunpeng essence from Ye Feipeng for research.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of the Kunpeng bloodline power gradually deepened.</p><p></p><p>During the same period, Li Fan once again entered the Celestial Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Under the commission of Lu Ya, he had to deliver a wooden box to the Nan Ming region.</p><p></p><p>This wooden box was extremely important, as it was sealed with various powers.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even sensed the breath of the Divine Beast Emperor Sanmu on it.</p><p></p><p>So, from then on, Li Fan and Lu Ya traveled together on the Qing Luan Bird towards Nan Ming.</p><p></p><p>The Nan Ming region seemed incredibly far away from the Mystic Beast Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, even as time ran out, they had yet to reach their destination.</p><p></p><p>They had to reluctantly abandon the journey to the Celestial Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the time came to the eleventh year.</p><p></p><p>That year, the long-forgotten Cloud Water Heaven Palace would reappear in the world.</p>

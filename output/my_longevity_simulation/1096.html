            <p>Chapter 1094: The Yazi Revenge Formation</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou was very pleased to see Li Fan agree so quickly: "Alright, let's meet at this location then."</p><p></p><p>With that said, he transmitted the location coordinates.</p><p></p><p>After ending the communication, Li Fan began to prepare.</p><p></p><p>The "latest developed technology" he mentioned before was not a lie. It was the result of the evolution of the Terminal Dissociation Disc over the past year.</p><p></p><p>Since mastering the two immortal-level grand formations, "Xuanji, All Spirits Return to Numbers" and "Huangluo, Flowers Bloom in the Void", and devouring the nine newly born sub-discs to achieve metamorphosis, the formation analysis ability of the Dissociation Disc had been increasing at an unimaginable speed with each passing day.</p><p></p><p>At every moment, it seemed that endless new formations were being derived by it.</p><p></p><p>The Dissociation Disc was just like the Yanfa Jue, wanting to derive all the formations in the world!</p><p></p><p>Even without the deliberate manipulation of its master Li Fan, it had accumulated an extremely vast formation database over a year.</p><p></p><p>By adding a few conditions and searching slightly, Li Fan found what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>The name of the pseudo-immortal level formation was "Yazi, Revenge for Grievances".</p><p></p><p>The effect of the formation could be glimpsed from this name.</p><p></p><p>By maintaining the operation of the formation, it could automatically search for targets around the formation who had grievances with oneself, and realize marking and tracking.</p><p></p><p>The coverage was about the size of one state of the Wanxian Alliance, and once locked by the "Yazi" formation, as long as one did not leave the formation's range, they would always be tracked.</p><p></p><p>The formation had specificity, that is, one formation could only designate one grievance target.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tested it for a while. The locking method of the Yazi formation was completely beyond his current understanding, already approaching the level of "Immortal".</p><p></p><p>But last time, Mo Rubin's performance was truly daunting.</p><p></p><p>So just a formation was not enough!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a small jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>Inside the bottle were three medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>They moved at high speed inside the bottle without any regularity, the trajectories were chaotic, yet revealed some strangeness.</p><p></p><p>"Soul Separation Pill."</p><p></p><p>"After taking it, in the eyes of others, the soul will be in a state of dissociation and extreme chaos. But in fact, one can still maintain control over the body. It has a miraculous effect in resisting soul possession. Mo Rubin's possession technique is similar to Transmitter Jiang's, the same as my transformation."</p><p></p><p>"But facing a chaotic entity, how can he possess and influence it?"</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Li Fan's eyes: "Even if it can't completely stop him, it can at least greatly slow down his possession process."</p><p></p><p>"Three pills make up one set. The Medicine King Sect produced more than 200 sets in the first batch..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With everything ready, Li Fan took Tianyang to the agreed location for the appointment.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he also changed his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou was already waiting in advance, and with her were thirty-seven people.</p><p></p><p>Compared to those Li Fan had seen before, even their eyes were extremely hollow.</p><p></p><p>Rather than cultivators, it was better to say they were puppets without their own thoughts and would only complete the orders they received.</p><p></p><p>Of the remaining two factions, one stood with Transmitter Zhou, two Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>The second, however, was a bit special.</p><p></p><p>Unlike humans, they were short in stature, only as tall as seven or eight-year-old children.</p><p></p><p>They had no heads, with facial features all squeezed on the chest.</p><p></p><p>Their entire bodies were jet black, looking a bit comical yet hideous.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"To enter the Desolate Land this time, we still need the [You] tribe people as guides." Transmitter Zhou glanced at Tianyang, who stood behind Li Fan with his eyes closed and said nothing. He first bowed slightly and then spoke to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"You?" Li Fan looked at this group of strange people with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Let's walk and talk. Here are the precautions after entering."</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of Transmitter Zhou, the You tribe people stood together in a circle, holding hands, and began to dance a strange dance.</p><p></p><p>Like a ritual, with their chanting in unison, a faint and obscure sense of confinement quietly descended upon them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just Li Fan's feeling.</p><p></p><p>In fact, whether observed with the naked eye or with spiritual consciousness, there was no actual change in front.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in first."</p><p></p><p>However, the subsequent actions of the crowd proved that Li Fan's premonition was correct.</p><p></p><p>When the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance flew towards the space above the You tribe people, it was as if they were suddenly swallowed by darkness.</p><p></p><p>They just disappeared into thin air.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance entered one after another, and Li Fan finally followed and flew into it as well.</p><p></p><p>Light was stripped from the world.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding him was a thorough and endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>It was slightly different from the extremely dark starry sea outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Similarly dark, the darkness of the starry sea gave a feeling of deathly stillness, emptiness, and vastness.</p><p></p><p>And here...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance who had entered earlier seemed to have collectively disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the dark Desolate Land, it seemed that only he was left alone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously tried to observe the surroundings with his spiritual consciousness, but found that it was useless here.</p><p></p><p>After leaving his body, it was as if he was enveloped by endless darkness, and he could not perceive anything else.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also tried to illuminate the surroundings with light, but failed again.</p><p></p><p>Light also seemed unable to survive in this desolate land.</p><p></p><p>Just then, without any warning, a hand suddenly landed on Li Fan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>His hair stood on end, and Li Fan was about to counterattack in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, through the contact of their bodies, spiritual consciousness could be transmitted to each other.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan "hear" the other party's words.</p><p></p><p>He first introduced his own identity.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter, Yan.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he explain to Li Fan: "In this dark Desolate Land, spiritual consciousness and sound have lost their use. Only by connecting through limbs, like the You tribe people, can we communicate with each other."</p><p></p><p>"We entered together and did not disperse. Everyone should be around here, let's gather first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This dark Desolate Land was indeed a bit strange. Even the connection between himself and Tianyang was cut off.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Tianyang did not go far, and it didn't take much effort to find him again.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan quietly transformed Tianyang into a celestial puppet battle armor and attached it to himself, unnoticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>"The Yazi Formation is also greatly weakened here. The coverage sensing range is probably only about three zhang around the body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but be shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that this was an existence infinitely close to a true immortal-level formation.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that in the Xuanhuang Realm, there would still be such a dangerous place. What did Mo Rubin come here for?"</p><p></p><p>Just like the You tribe people who held hands before entering.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance and Li Fan also achieved a gathering through this method.</p><p></p><p>After counting the number of people and finding that three were missing, the group did not go to look for these three.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they directly issued an order to kill them.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they advanced towards the depths of the darkness.</p>

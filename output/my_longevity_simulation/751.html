        <h1>Chapter 751</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the Empress's earnest response and her utterly resolute expression, Xu Bai almost laughed out loud: "So this is your plan?"</p><p>"To pin your hopes on a vague, insubstantial great hero whose appearance is uncertain?"</p><p>Xu Bai shook his head repeatedly: "It seems the organization has overestimated your worth."</p><p></p><p>Facing Xu Bai's disdain, the Empress did not get angry. Instead, her eyes flashed with firm determination: "The savior we have awaited and yearned for thousands of years will eventually appear!"</p><p>"Before the Xuanhuang Realm falls into total ruin."</p><p>"This is the devout belief passed down from the Holy Emperor. No national policy of the imperial dynasty can go against it."</p><p></p><p>As soon as she said this, Xu Bai, who originally intended to mock her, suddenly remembered something and fell silent abruptly. </p><p>Without a doubt, the only one who could make Xu Ke believe so firmly was Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying Mr. Bai foresaw that some years later, a celestial being would descend and save the Xuanhuang Realm from the fire and flood?"</p><p>Xu Bai couldn't help feeling a sense of absurdity in his heart.</p><p>Yet he also recalled the ever-lingering Duekuzu Sect that seemed to be connected to him.</p><p>Perhaps...this was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>At least the "chosen one to overcome the catastrophe" selected by the Duekuzu Sect pointed to himself.</p><p>Xu Bai couldn't help but furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>"From Mr. Bai cultivating a new breed of Cracked Realm Whales to enable many mundane small worlds to move away from the Xuanhuang Realm, the Empire's ultimate plan is actually consistent with other mundane worlds."</p><p>"The only difference is that the Empire has stronger subjective agency, allowing it to move farther from the Xuanhuang Realm, while the other worlds only passively accept it without understanding what is truly happening."</p><p>"This difference stems from the connection between Xu Ke and Mr. Bai. Perhaps this was the task Lu Yisheng entrusted to Xu Ke before his death."</p><p>"The question now is, could Mr. Bai and the Duekuzu Sect really have predicted my existence and that of [Haozhen] thousands of years ago?"</p><p></p><p>Just a moment later, Xu Bai dismissed this conjecture.</p><p>With a single thought, [Haozhen] could turn truth into falsehood, reality into illusion, returning everything in the world to its original anchor point.</p><p>Even the legendary True Immortals would surely pale in comparison to such an ability.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Bai and the Duekuzu Sect could truly foresee [Haozhen]'s existence, why would they need to wait for a savior? With their own abilities, they should be able to resolve the troubles of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Duekuzu Sect should be similar to Senior Zhang's - they only turn their attention once certain conditions are met. They may even be casting a wide net. The so-called chosen ones are probably not just me alone."</p><p>"As for Mr. Bai..."</p><p>Xu Bai fell silent.</p><p>He still did not know what made him so certain that someone would emerge to save the Xuanhuang Realm a thousand years later.</p><p>It couldn't just be because he harbored hope, could it?</p><p></p><p>"The infinite future holds infinite possibilities. This also means that no matter how small the possibility, under the premise of 'infinity', everything is bound to happen." The words [Di Yi] once said suddenly surfaced in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the countless futures Mr. Bai deduced, there was indeed a possibility of the Xuanhuang Realm being saved, just like in the previous life when I..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What I've seen through my physical transformation, although the Xuanhuang Realm has experienced the withering of all things and the collapse of civilizations, in the end, it still welcomed the reviving sunlight. Even though it's not yet clear what exactly happened in between. But in a sense, if the Empire can hold out until that time, perhaps their strategy would be considered a success."</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess looked at Xu Bai, who had fallen into deep thought, and did not disturb him.</p><p></p><p>"Well, if it's the judgment of my ancestors, then there might be some truth to it. However, it's unfortunate that based on the current situation, if you don't have the help of our Myriad Realms Alliance, your Empire might not be able to last until that day."  Xu Bai soon snapped out of his reverie and said with a slight sarcasm.</p><p></p><p>"Although we're distant relatives, I do want to lend you a hand. But the right to use the precious Tianyuan Treasure Mirror is not something I can decide alone. If you don't show any sincerity, it'll be hard for me to do anything."  He shrugged, looking quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess nodded slightly and said, "While you were visiting the Nine-Headed Divine Temple, we also investigated the changes that have occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm. The Reincarnation Palace, the Tianyuan Treasure Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"They have indeed gone beyond our ability to resist. After some discussion, if we can exchange resources for the assistance of your Myriad Realms Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"There won't be any dissenting voices within the Empire. After all, those nobles are not only very afraid of death, but also greatly fear losing their current status." The Imperial Princess spoke as if stating a completely ordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it seems the Empire is more pragmatic than I imagined. Well, it saves me the trouble of further persuasion. However..." Xu Bai paused, a faint smile appearing on the corner of his mouth: "Given the current crisis, facing the immense pressure from the Myriad Immortal Alliance, our Alliance won't be able to treat all the small worlds equally. We will definitely provide different levels of support based on the potential exhibited by each small world."</p><p></p><p>"So if you want to obtain more of our assistance, it will depend on how much truly valuable things your Empire can offer."</p><p></p><p>"I'll be direct, the exotic beast cultivation techniques you take pride in, in our eyes, are only at the level of cannon fodder. With just these, you won't be able to impress those self-interested old fellows in the Alliance." Xu Bai said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>She then flew forward and said, "Follow me."</p><p></p><p>After flying for a while in the Imperial Treasury, she stopped in front of a mechanical device.</p><p></p><p>The device was composed of several different, constantly moving circular rings, with faint numbers rapidly changing within them.</p><p></p><p>"This is the crystallization of the 13th Emperor's painstaking efforts, the [Void Coordinate Positioning Instrument]." The Imperial Princess' eyes flashed with nostalgia as she introduced it to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"In void navigation, it can record and preserve the data of the surrounding space, and set a course according to the predetermined target, so that we won't get lost in the void. It can also mark the coordinates of the places we pass by..."</p><p></p><p>"It has some use, but not much." Xu Bai interrupted the Imperial Princess' words, "The main pressure we face now is how to survive the first wave of the Myriad Immortal Alliance's sweeping attack."</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess nodded in understanding, then led Xu Bai to a spherical pearl.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Xu Bai narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>From this pearl, he could sense both spiritual energy and the aura of a demonic beast.</p>

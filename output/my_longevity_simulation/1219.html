        <h1>Chapter 1219</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Profound Yellow Realm is our only place of residence, so naturally we must ensure its safety," said the Holy Emperor Li Ping, as a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>"After we return, I will allocate a portion of the Youzu people and let them return to the faith of the Dark Sea. Since the Wanxian Alliance captured the Youzu people and caused an imbalance in the Youjie, the Holy Dynasty will bear the responsibility alone."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping gazed at the deep, dark ocean before him.</p><p></p><p>"Although the essence of the Source Power is vast, its quantity is ultimately limited. I wonder how many Youzu people will need to pray day and night to restore the Dark Sea?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Yin was somewhat moved by Li Ping's attitude, and after pondering for a moment, he replied, "According to the Youzu leader, at the peak of their tribe's prosperity, their members' footprints covered the entire underground cave world. It is estimated that there were at least 500,000 people..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping slowly said, "It seems that we need to slightly improve our treatment of the Youzu people."</p><p></p><p>Elder Yin also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Let's end our investigation here for now. I have a feeling that the two of us are gradually being watched by this darkness."</p><p></p><p>"Agreed."</p><p></p><p>A golden light enveloped Li Ping's body, making him appear extremely sacred and majestic.</p><p></p><p>In the fluctuations of light and shadow, it seemed as if even space and time were distorted.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the figure of the Holy Emperor Li Ping suddenly disappeared and returned to the small world of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>He did not pass through the portal generated by the Youzu people's rituals and prayers, but directly utilized the power of the vast Source Power network.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the source of the Source Power network is only in Daqi. If one day, Youzu people all over the Profound Yellow Realm pray to me, then I can use this connection to appear wherever I want at will," the Holy Emperor Li Ping mused.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the significance of the Youzu people, Li Ping summoned Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>He conveyed to him the latest strategy for treating the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>In addition to continuing to increase the production of Youzu people in the flesh factories, they also needed to simultaneously expand the normal Youzu population for sustainable development.</p><p></p><p>"For these additional Youzu people, you should instead find ways to increase their lifespan."</p><p></p><p>Kneeling on one knee, Wang Xuanba listened to the Holy Emperor's instructions. Although he did not know the reason for the sudden huge change in attitude, he loyally accepted the task.</p><p></p><p>After Wang Xuanba left, Li Ping called for Sun Erlang next.</p><p></p><p>He assigned him the task of leading troops to conquer several underground worlds.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang, who had been idle for a long time, gladly accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>However, instead of dismissing him directly like he did with Wang Xuanba, Li Ping continued to inquire.</p><p></p><p>"How has Yi Shu of the Taiyi Sect been performing recently?"</p><p></p><p>The fate of the Holy Dynasty rested entirely on Li Ping. As the Holy Emperor of Daqi's Heavenly Mandate, he naturally knew everything that happened in the small world of Daqi like the back of his hand. Yet, he still asked knowingly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang did not dare to conceal anything and truthfully reported.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Taiyi Sect to actually agree to your request," Li Ping's cold voice echoed in the Holy Emperor's seat, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"But it's good. If one day the Holy Dynasty falls, it wouldn't be a bad ending for you to seek refuge in the Taiyi Sect."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was stunned for a moment, and then his face changed: "Master, how could the Holy Dynasty..."</p><p></p><p>"You may go."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang left in trepidation and unease.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sat on high, alone in the empty Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Although this time</p><p></p><p>The exploration of the underworld only lasted for a short while.</p><p></p><p>Yet it caused quite an impact on his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation, the Fishing Pond..."</p><p></p><p>"My strength has already reached the half-step peak of the Xuanhuang realm. However, there are too many hidden oddities within the Xuanhuang realm. The Wanxian Alliance has ruled over half of Xuanhuang for so many years, their foundation must be even deeper than what they have revealed on the surface."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in the war against the Wanxian Alliance, not only do we need to win, but we also need to end it swiftly. Otherwise, a prolonged war between cultivators will inevitably cause irreparable damage to this world once again. It's already a patched-up broken boat, how can it withstand any more turmoil?"</p><p></p><p>As the Destined Holy Emperor, he had many more things to consider.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Ping's figure flickered and disappeared from the small world of Daqi.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he was already within the Nine Mountains Province of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>With the protection of the essence of source power, he now had the qualifications to occasionally venture out without having to worry too much about his personal safety.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Beast."</p><p></p><p>Standing in mid-air, Li Ping sensed the chaotic and disordered space around him.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, the Tian Beast should also be a part of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation."</p><p></p><p>"In the starry sea, dangers lurk everywhere. To successfully cross, it is essential to scout the path ahead and avoid dangers."</p><p></p><p>"The Eye of the Tian Beast..."</p><p></p><p>Some blurry images flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xuanhuang realm, in an independent space called the Eye of the Tian Beast, it seemed possible to observe the depths of the starry sea even further compared to being inside the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Tian Beast is dead. Finding that unique space can only depend on chance now. The starry sea is vast, and with the constant influence of the Immortal Ruins' attraction, it's even harder than finding a needle in the ocean."</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Crossing Formation, three out of four parts have already revealed their traces. The only remaining one still has no clues at all."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head slightly, he suppressed his thoughts for now. Silently, Li Ping had already arrived at the headquarters of the Lingyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The sect members all cultivated the Cangshengling Yuan technique, seemingly breaking the rule that the same technique cannot be cultivated together. In reality, they were all tools for the Lingyuan Sect leader to refine and absorb source power.</p><p></p><p>Easily bypassing various restrictions, following the sensation of the source power, Li Ping arrived at the underground base of Qiaogong Jushi.</p><p></p><p>Filled with all kinds of strange and odd components, the one busy working among them was none other than Qiaogong himself.</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly is the flaw?"</p><p></p><p>"Source power, essence of source power, the difference of two words is the difference between heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>The golden source power puppet shattered with a bang, scattering flowing light.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the experiment had failed, and Qiaogong Jushi was a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>"Come here!"</p><p></p><p>He turned his head and coldly snorted at a female cultivator standing to the side, a whip suddenly appearing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator had an expressionless face, her eyes lacking the liveliness of a normal person.</p><p></p><p>"Not like it, not like it at all! It's nothing like the real Shangguan!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the appearance of the female cultivator, Qiaogong became even more irritated.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to swing the whip in his hand, he suddenly saw the figure of the Faceless Holy Emperor in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>As if his guilty deeds had been discovered, Qiaogong's hand trembled, nearly dropping the whip on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong shouted in both shock and anger, staring at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room, the puppets that were originally like dead objects all came to life in an instant, staring at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>That's all for today, I'll organize the follow-up plot development.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 277</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After a dizzying moment, Li Fan returned to the real world.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>"Are you the owner of this remnant space?"</p><p></p><p>Although this exploration yielded no practical gains, Li Fan at least confirmed one thing.</p><p></p><p>This Mr. Bai was strange.</p><p></p><p>In the remnant space, if Li Fan didn't intervene to change things, the events that occurred each time should have been fixed and unchanging. </p><p></p><p>Based on previous experiences, this Mr. Bai should have come to the small temple to visit the children not long after the great battle ended.</p><p></p><p>But this time...</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence, just as I was about to leave, he arrived?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't believe in his heart that this was just a simple coincidence. </p><p></p><p>This Mr. Bai was deliberately avoiding him.</p><p></p><p>Or in other words, due to some special reason, Li Fan couldn't see him.</p><p></p><p>Just like how Li Fan couldn't leave Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>It was a specific rule of the entire Ningyuan City remnant space.</p><p></p><p>For now, without delving into why this happened, analyzing it this way, the probability of Mr. Bai being the owner of the remnant space was still quite high.</p><p></p><p>Then the question arose, what was Mr. Bai's obsession? </p><p></p><p>Recalling the children's evaluation of him: the best person in the world.</p><p></p><p>Plus he would take the initiative to organize rescue efforts and actively treat the wounded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene of Ningyuan City after the great battle, as if doomsday had arrived with corpses everywhere, involuntarily surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Affected by the battle between cultivators, his hometown was almost turned into a realm of death."</p><p></p><p>"How great would it be if this cruel scene had never happened."</p><p></p><p>"Is this your obsession?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Although other possibilities couldn't be ruled out, based on Mr. Bai's character setting established from the clues currently known, this was the most likely one.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to resolve the Ningyuan City longevity fruit incident with minimal mortal casualties? It's a bit tricky."</p><p></p><p>Having deduced the result, the next step was to find a way to verify it.</p><p></p><p>However, achieving this goal seemed even more difficult than simply defeating Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the invincible Senior Brother Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Just capturing that mid Golden Core stage Song Hesong without involving mortals was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have the 【Binding Insect】divine ability as a fallback. Let me try all sorts of methods first."</p><p></p><p>"If it really doesn't work, I'll wait until after I reach the Golden Core stage to come back and resolve this matter."</p><p></p><p>In any case, he saw hope of breaking free from Ningyuan City. As for spending a bit more time, it had little impact on Li Fan instead.</p><p></p><p>After silently formulating an action plan for the next time he entered the Fallen Immortal Realm, Li Fan recalled that extremely mysterious stone in the small temple.</p><p></p><p>He immediately searched for relevant information in the Tianxuan Mirror. </p><p></p><p>It wasn't any top secret, and the information was easily found.</p><p></p><p>【Absolute Immortal Stone】was what cultivators called this type of stone material.</p><p></p><p>Its effects were the same as what Li Fan had tested. It could block the effects of all spiritual power and divine sense.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, it was generally used to build secret rooms, carve stone statues, or made into stone nails to imprison criminals.</p><p></p><p>Matching the Absolute Immortal Stone nails, there was also an acupuncture method called "Sealing Immortals and Severing Spirituality".</p><p></p><p>By piercing dozens of fixed acupoints all over the body with Absolute Immortal Stone nails, one could cut off the circulation of spiritual energy in the body and seal off one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, the number of Absolute Immortal Stones in existence gradually decreased, and they were rarely seen nowadays.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, some were recovered from the ruins of sects, and they could fetch a good price.</p><p></p><p>"There are still some remnants of Absolute Immortal Stones in that small temple. Making them into a set of stone nails should be barely enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately spent contribution points to purchase the "Sealing Immortals and Severing Spirituality" acupuncture technique and memorized it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after Li Fan entered closed-door cultivation again, anchoring 25 years, a piece of news spread from Jiushan Prefecture, once again attracting the attention of cultivators across the world.</p><p></p><p>That sect ruins of Chaoyuan Sect, which had always been unable to be thoroughly investigated for any profundities, recently showed strange changes.</p><p></p><p>At first, in the empty sect ruins, human figures would appear from time to time, walking back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the frequency of human figures appearing increased, and the duration of each stay also gradually lengthened.</p><p></p><p>Later on, even the sound of them talking to each other could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Except for being intangible and having no physical existence, these human figures were almost no different from real people.</p><p></p><p>The human figures were unaware of the existence of real cultivators and simply seemed to live in their own time and space, carrying out activities without interference.</p><p></p><p>The reason it caused a sensation was that a cultivator happened to encounter a scene of Chaoyuan Sect disciples reciting the 《Tianguang Zhuyang Jue》.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator was overjoyed and memorized the entire text of the technique.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a Qi Refining stage technique, the significance of this matter was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Because it meant the possibility of obtaining other high-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>Even without techniques, observing the ancient Chaoyuan Sect cultivators concocting pills, refining tools, etc., was equivalent to having free teachers instructing and teaching on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Chaoyuan Sect ruins, which had almost become deserted, became lively again.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the liveliness belonged to the Wanxian Alliance, and had nothing to do with the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Those few Nascent Soul cultivators responsible for guarding the borders for some reason did not return and were still stationed in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Locking Spiritual Array was regularly activated.</p><p></p><p>Any Five Elders Society cultivators with ulterior motives who entered would be killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Under such a situation, Jiushan Prefecture, which was originally somewhat chaotic, also became peaceful.</p><p></p><p>However, on the desolate island in the Congyu Sea, the people from the Separated Realm rarely had a dispute.</p><p></p><p>The cause of the matter was precisely because of the Chaoyuan Sect ruins that had new changes.</p><p></p><p>When the chubby Ye Feipeng went out, he occasionally learned about this from the conversations of passing cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the desolate island, he casually mentioned this anecdote while chatting with everyone.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that upon hearing this, Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo actually had the same feeling.</p><p></p><p>Their own Golden Core Dharma opportunity was right in that Chaoyuan Sect!</p><p></p><p>The two of them had been stuck at the peak Foundation Establishment stage for some time.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, firstly, they were trapped by the bottleneck of 【Heavenly Tribulation】 and couldn't advance.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the two hadn't made a decision on what kind of heavenly Dharma to use to form their Golden Cores.</p><p></p><p>Now that the opportunity was right in front of them, the two immediately had the idea of traveling far to Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The journey was long and fraught with crises.</p><p></p><p>As the nominal successor of 【Reviving Immortals】, Xiao Heng naturally expressed his objection.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng believed that with their aptitude, the Golden Core bottleneck could only trap them temporarily, not for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Without the Chaoyuan Sect opportunity, there would be other opportunities to make up for it.</p><p></p><p>However, venturing out with just peak Foundation Establishment strength was really too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Even if the two of them had extraordinary talent and formidable combat power.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gap in major realms was still there.</p><p></p><p>It was better to continue hiding for a while until everyone broke through to the Golden Core stage, greatly increasing their ability to protect themselves, before going out together to seek opportunities.</p>

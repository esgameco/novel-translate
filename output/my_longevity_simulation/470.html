        <div class="content">
            <p>The chubby Ye Feipeng was deep in sleep, seeming to be dreaming of something exceptionally joyful, with a slight smile on his face. He didn't notice a dark figure suddenly appearing beside him.</p><p></p><p>With a light wave of his hand, Ye Feipeng's head tilted, completely knocked unconscious. His right hand gripped tightly, covering his head.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the dark figure slowly retracted his hand.</p><p></p><p>A drop of dark red thick blood appeared in the palm.</p><p></p><p>Originally with a ruddy complexion, Ye Feipeng suddenly looked listless as if he had fallen seriously ill.</p><p></p><p>The blood in his palm, like a living creature, had its own consciousness, constantly writhing in an attempt to escape the grip of the dark figure.</p><p></p><p>As the dark figure's fingers tightened, the space for the struggling blood became smaller and smaller, eventually being fully absorbed into his body.</p><p></p><p>The figure stood still in the dark for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Puff!"</p><p></p><p>Two fierce bone wings suddenly tore through his back, extending from behind him.</p><p></p><p>Threads of flesh and blood entwined on the bone wings, emitting a faint sizzling sound, continuously growing along the bone spikes, quickly concealing the dense white bones.</p><p></p><p>The bone wings also became plump.</p><p></p><p>Even under the moonlight, the flesh and blood constantly squirming along the edges of the bone wings were still distinctly visible, looking eerie.</p><p></p><p>"Kunpeng bloodline..."</p><p></p><p>A deep voice came from the dark figure's mouth. After a moment, he forcibly tore off the wings behind him.</p><p></p><p>There was no gushing of fresh blood. The active flesh and blood at the wound struggled for a moment before being expelled from the body by a pure and vast vitality. (New 69 Book Club→69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the dark figure had returned to his original state.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient demon, indeed has some tricks." He looked at the still-beating wings that had been torn off and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>This dark figure was naturally Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the Great Lijing Capital, the first thing he did was extract some Kunpeng essence blood from Ye Feipeng's body.</p><p></p><p>While storing most of the essence blood in his storage ring, he used his own body to absorb a small portion.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the ferocity of the exotic beast power he had previously comprehended in the Beast Soul Bead, this Kunpeng bloodline's power was even more dominant.</p><p></p><p>If the power of those exotic beasts was akin to infection and grafting, then the power of the Kunpeng bloodline was about devouring and complete assimilation.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder in the previous life, Ye Feipeng's behavior, speech, and even thoughts became more and more akin to a true demon as time went on."</p><p></p><p>"This is the inevitable consequence of wanting to use the power of the Kunpeng bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly. "With my mastery of the Creation Stove Skill, I have no such worries."</p><p></p><p>"Kun Shig, Peng Fei, Jing Peng Jing..."</p><p></p><p>In a soft whisper, within the darkness, Li Fan's figure constantly twisted and morphed, sometimes turning into a whale, sometimes into a Peng, and sometimes a human with Peng wings.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan returned to his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Having only a small amount of Kunpeng essence blood for enlightenment, I can only imitate its form for now without completely manifesting the Kunpeng's abilities."</p><p></p><p>"But it’s okay, with such a ready blood bank available."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Ye Feipeng, revealing a serene smile. (New 69 Book Club→69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the chubby boy, soared into the sky, and disappeared in the night instantly.</p><p></p><p>The next day, chaos erupted in the capital.</p><p></p><p>Many children from influential families like Su, Ye, and Han went missing inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Several families joined forces to turn the capital upside down but couldn't find any trace of the children.</p><p></p><p>For a while, panic and rumors ran rampant among the people.</p><p></p><p>The affected families gathered secretly to discuss, believing that besides the rumored immortals, the only one capable of such an act might be the Great Li Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, immortals wouldn't engage in such secretive activities. Therefore, the only possibility was the Emperor's involvement.</p><p></p><p>The nobles and ministers couldn't help but recall various rumors they had heard, harboring resentment in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, undercurrents surged in the capital.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the orchestrator behind it all, Li Fan, had already left the borders.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to the Xuanhuang Realm, he didn't pause for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Instead of heading to a specific region within the Xuanhuang Realm, he returned to his homeland, the Great Xuan, through the Xianjie Passage.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Boat raced swiftly, with sixteen children sitting anxiously in the cabin, shivering.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood at the bow, gazing down.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, a complete small world, the Great Xuan, was ten times larger than the borders.</p><p></p><p>The first stop was the prosperous Han Guang City in the Great Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Upon scanning the mortals below with his vast divine sense, Li Fan sought suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Li Fan furrowed his brows deeply.</p><p></p><p>"How come there are only a few with such talent, better than mine?"</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, the Taiyan Boat accelerated towards the next city.</p><p></p><p>However, the results still disappointed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After spending nearly half a month, Li Fan had almost searched through all the inhabitants of the Great Xuan. Surprisingly, the number of suitable candidates for cultivation was scarce.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my initial step onto the immortal path was so difficult not necessarily by chance."</p><p></p><p>"Heaven, man..."</p><p></p><p>Soaring into the sky, Li Fan closed his eyes, sensing the essence of the Xuan Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>"Man is the spirit of all living beings, born of the creation of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Those favored by heaven and earth can resonate with them, follow the path, and embark on the immortal journey."</p><p></p><p>"This is what should have happened originally."</p><p></p><p>"Those able to connect with the fortunes of heaven and earth may be few, but with the large population of the Great Xuan, theoretically speaking, there should be several 'geniuses' emerging."</p><p></p><p>"But why..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought of the Crack Realm Whales lingering outside the Great Xuan, attempting to completely detach the Xuan Realm from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"If heaven and earth do not agree, who can sever the path to immortality?"</p><p></p><p>"But why is the Great Lijing Realm so special?"</p><p></p><p>With doubts crowding his mind, Li Fan sighed softly, temporarily abandoning his original plan.</p><p></p><p>He detoured near the Jieli Mountain and took away the two peculiar young men he had seen earlier.</p><p></p><p>Then, he left the Great Xuan and returned to the realm of cultivating immortality.</p><p></p><p>"I knew it, there are immortals in this world!" Sun Erlang exclaimed excitedly, pacing back and forth.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the burly Wang Xuanba wore a troubled expression, showing signs of unease.</p><p></p><p>"Erlang, why do you think the immortal brought us here? When can we go back? I miss home..." he whispered to Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Have some ambition! If we don't learn to fly through the clouds and split mountains and seas, how can you bear to return like this!" Sun Erlang retorted.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba opened his mouth to say something.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared beside the two.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal!" Wang Xuanba was startled, quickly kneeling and kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal, please teach me cultivation!" Sun Erlang also bowed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at them without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>He then brought them into the cabin where Su Changyu and the other sixteen children were.</p><p></p><p>All these children, dot-sized, had been brought here by Li Fan, many of them not having seen their families.</p><p></p><p>Feeling lost and helpless, they cried uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Keep them quiet. Consider this your first test."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, no physically harming others."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said to Sun Erlang before disappearing.</p>

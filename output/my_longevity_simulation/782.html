        <h1>Chapter 782</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai looked towards the silent Liu San and suddenly asked him: "Elder Liu, will you also go with us? You are very knowledgeable and experienced, it would be great if you could help keep an eye out. Take a look at this matter of the Taiyan Sect pledging allegiance to the Immortal Alliance - is it reliable or not? Does the Taiyan Sect really intend to join the Immortal Alliance, or might they be trying to deceive us?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai spoke with complete sincerity. </p><p>However, after a moment of silence, Liu San shook his head and declined: "Young Master, it's better if you just go with Old Fang. In terms of experience, he is no less capable than me. In these chaotic times, there still need to be people looking after the many disciples back at the Longevity Valley. Although the entrance is blocked by the Terminal Disk formation, we can't rule out the possibility of cultivators accidentally stumbling in."</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, you finally said something truthful," Fang Zaiji said, sounding a bit pleased at Liu San's honesty. </p><p>But soon he looked at him suspiciously: "Don't tell me you're taking this rare opportunity to be alone with Yushan?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Liu San said angrily.</p><p></p><p>After some banter, Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji left Longevity Valley and headed straight for the Taiyan Sect.</p><p>The entrance to the minor world was located in Taihua Prefecture. Along the way, they could see many cultivators who had also heard the news and came to see the commotion. </p><p>Quite unusually, there were members of the Immortal Alliance guiding the way.</p><p>It seemed they wanted to make a big show of the Taiyan Sect's allegiance as a model example.</p><p></p><p>Taihua Prefecture was located in the eastern region of the Immortal Alliance, not far from the Cloudmist Sea.</p><p>A mountain range ran through the entire territory, with a thousand peaks standing tall.</p><p>Among them, nine of the peaks were the tallest and most formidable, known to cultivators as the Nine Taihua Veins.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there used to be Ten Taihua Veins in the past.</p><p>But one of them, Taixu Mountain, had suddenly collapsed and vanished from people's memories. And so it became the Nine Veins.</p><p>In a previous life, He Zhenghao had even considered going to Taihua Prefecture to further his cultivation, but ended up going to Tian'un Prefecture instead due to Li Fan's intervention.</p><p></p><p>Following the guidance, the two arrived at Taixuan Mountain.</p><p>"The entrance is quite hidden, right in the middle of the mountain body? Truly a natural formation! If the Immortal Alliance hadn't opened up this passage, it would have taken quite an effort to get inside," Fang Zaiji said in some amazement.</p><p></p><p>They followed the passage winding through the mountain until reaching the end.</p><p>The spatial entrance had already been fixed open.</p><p>At the entrance stood a few cultivators from the Taiyan Sect, ostensibly there to welcome visitors. However, their eyes kept scanning over the arriving cultivators, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me those little brats from back then are still alive?" Fang Zaiji muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai noticed his sudden hesitation and knew he must be worried about something.</p><p>He cleared his throat to remind Fang, then took the lead walking forward.</p><p>Seeing this, Fang Zaiji could only follow.</p><p></p><p>When the Taiyan cultivators saw Xu Bai approaching, their eyes immediately lit up and they surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>"This friend, please stop a moment!"</p><p>"Would you be interested in joining our Taiyan Sect?"  </p><p>"After joining, you'll never have to worry about techniques again, and can even get a free mid-grade Dao-forming Pill."</p><p></p><p>They spoke over each other enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Look at me too, Taiyan friends!"</p><p>"I want to join the Taiyan Sect!"</p><p>"Why are you only surrounding him? Just because he's good-looking?"</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators felt dissatisfied, but those Taiyan cultivators paid them no mind, focused solely on Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai neither agreed nor declined, and...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He refused to answer directly. Instead, he tentatively asked about the current relationship between the Myriad Immortal Alliance and the Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect cultivators also answered without holding back: "It's just that we use the name of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, and every year we have to send a Dao Elder to sit in the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance. Overall, there's not much difference from before."</p><p></p><p>"In this Taixuan Realm, it's still our Taiyan Sect that calls the shots. The Immortal Alliance doesn't interfere."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, the Immortal Alliance has so many Daoworlds and small worlds under its control. One more or less doesn't really matter."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, having the Taixuan Treasure Mirror and Taixuan Mirror from the Immortal Alliance has made our daily cultivation much more convenient."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xu Bai seemed a bit interested, they immediately made more efforts to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>They even took the initiative to lead the way, guiding him to tour the scenery of this [Taixuan] small world.</p><p></p><p>Vast fertile lands, with countless mortals dwelling within.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, amidst the clouds, there was a suspended city floating in the sky.</p><p></p><p>One could vaguely see many cultivators moving about inside the city.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy concentration in this small world is already beyond the ordinary regions of the Xuanhuang Realm," they said.</p><p></p><p>"You actually managed to find such a good place to take refuge back then..." Fang Zaijing said with some envy.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect cultivators were collectively stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then they finally realized that the "back then" Fang Zaijing mentioned was referring to the time when the Calamity of the Unbreakable Dao descended.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we are adept in the art of Taiyan. Naturally, we were able to find a glimmer of hope amidst the crisis of destruction."</p><p></p><p>In fact, judging from the ages of these young disciples, they might not be very clear about the events of that time either. They were just deliberately boasting in order to convince Xu Bai to join their sect.</p><p></p><p>"Logically speaking, your Taiyan Sect should not be lacking in disciples with such favorable recruitment conditions. Why did you still pay attention to me?"</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect cultivators exchanged glances, and finally, an elder one answered Xu Bai's question.</p><p></p><p>"We in the Taiyan Sect don't just accept anyone. The most important thing is that they must match the several aspects provided by the Huadao Stone Mother."</p><p></p><p>After briefly explaining the Huadao Stone Mother, he continued, "Cultivators who match the aspects are either the future mainstays of the sect, or the pillars who can revive the Taiyan Sect, or the peerless leaders who can guide the Taiyan Sect out of crisis..."</p><p></p><p>"In short, it's all beneficial without any harm. We won't make any mistakes!"</p><p></p><p>They spoke with great conviction, evidently placing a lot of trust in the divination results of the Huadao Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This Stone Mother is so miraculous? I wonder if I can see it with my own eyes?" Xu Bai asked, following their lead.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you join our Taiyan Sect, you'll be able to personally meet the Stone Mother. And there's a good chance you'll even get a chance to experience a [simulation]!" the middle-aged cultivator guaranteed, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Simulation?" Xu Bai narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even Fang Zaijing was momentarily captivated.</p><p></p><p>"As I mentioned before, the Huadao Stone Mother has another almost-real simulated world. And if you get its permission, you can utilize its power to create a virtual world tailored for you."</p><p></p><p>"In this virtual world, you will experience everything you are about to go through."</p><p></p><p>"Although it can't be 100% accurate, experiencing the simulation can still save you from many detours."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's tone was filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that I didn't pass the test last time and missed out on that rare once-in-a-hundred-year opportunity."</p>

            <p>Upon seeing the situation, the man's expression relaxed slightly, saying, "This matter is of great importance, and even I cannot fully understand the intricacies of it."</p><p></p><p>"But one thing is certain, our gains from this battle are substantial."</p><p></p><p>His tone couldn't help but carry a hint of excitement, "Incidentally, the attitude from above towards us has improved quite a bit recently."</p><p></p><p>"The funding has been unusually generous, more than doubled."</p><p></p><p>"What about my share?" Zhou Qing'ang hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, why the rush? When have I ever shortchanged you all," the man reprimanded.</p><p></p><p>"When the transaction is complete, the supplies needed by Li Fan will be given to you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, boss!" Zhou Qing'ang said giddily. "Although I'm doing well now and often receive various gifts from cultivators, no one would ever complain about having more money..."</p><p></p><p>"Enough, don't get too carried away. I never expected you to become the commander this time. It seems like my decision to follow He Zhenghao's strategy was indeed the right move."</p><p></p><p>The man pondered for a moment before instructing, "He Zhenghao, Li Fan, both of these individuals have deep backgrounds, you must maintain good relations with them."</p><p></p><p>"When Cloud City is rebuilt, even if Li Fan cannot become the true master of Cloud Island, his status will definitely not be low. Following him will lead to faster advancement compared to building your own path. It can be said that your future is promising. By then, you might even infiltrate the enemy's ranks."</p><p></p><p>"With our intervention this time, helping them through this difficulty, when they are needed in the future, they probably won't be able to refuse."</p><p></p><p>The man suddenly let out a low chuckle. (New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>"Wise decision, boss!" Zhou Qing'ang praised.</p><p></p><p>The two discussed further details of the trade, then the man ended the communication.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang, on the other hand, casually returned to the bustling construction site of Cloud Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Inspecting everywhere with a proud and boastful manner.</p><p></p><p>"The scene left from the abnormality at Wuxian Island that day..." Li Fan pondered for a moment and took out a memory stone.</p><p></p><p>The images in his mind's eye flickered with light, recording every detail of that day's events meticulously.</p><p></p><p>In no time, it was completed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan habitually double-checked it.</p><p></p><p>However, he found a problem.</p><p></p><p>The recording could not capture the hint of 'green' that destroyed the Combat Hall.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the memory stone, all that was visible was the entire building and over a dozen cultivators mysteriously disappearing, with the cultivators looking terrified and scrambling to escape.</p><p></p><p>Later, when Chief Lu arrived to prevent things from getting out of hand, those actions seemed rather comical.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly tapped his finger, sinking into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After spending hundreds of years in the Illusory Realm of the Great Dao Sect, Li Fan had learned many secrets that ordinary cultivators could not know. Some faded as he returned to reality, but some remained in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the [It] hovering over Yuandao Prefecture, there are indeed terrifying existences in the world that cannot be recorded. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"Whether with pen and paper, jade slips, or other methods, they cannot be documented."</p><p></p><p>"If the restrictions are stronger, they may even disappear from people's memories."</p><p></p><p>"But, all of this assumes that these things truly exist..."</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight crossed Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that a year ago, such unrecordable phenomena had not occurred."</p><p></p><p>"So, has the Mysterious Net manifested in the world now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly surprised by this thought.</p><p></p><p>Without a massive construction of the Heavenly Mysterious Locking Spirit Array, it seemed very likely that only the rudiments existed.</p><p></p><p>In these years, the Wuxian League had been constantly mobilizing elite forces, not idle at all. If the Five Elders were making an unprecedented move, it seemed to be related to this.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Li Fan looked at the memory stone in his hand and decided not to make any more additions or revisions.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since the anomaly in Wuxian Island's Mysterious Net, and now the Five Elders suddenly brought up old matters. Li Fan speculated that their target was most likely the missing Elder Gongsun.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Five Elders, but even the Wuxian League had been searching for him all along.</p><p></p><p>Under the scrutiny of the two largest forces in the Huangxian Realm, Elder Gongsun had remained elusive.</p><p></p><p>This Elder Gongsun was indeed quite capable.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he's not deliberately hiding, but more likely, he is seriously injured and has lost his consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Fan ceased his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He took the opportunity to hand over the memory stone and the blueprint for the reconstruction of Cloud Immortal City to his avatar, Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Zhou Qing'ang passed on these two highly confidential items to the stone-faced man without breaking the agreement, handing over a storage ring filled with strategic supplies.</p><p></p><p>With ample material support, the construction progress of Cloud Immortal City accelerated once again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan appeared frequently, showing his seriousness towards this project.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators under his command were also full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>But there was a group of people who couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>On the Dusty Boat, in a dark room.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Kebao, your idea got us into this mess!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, at this point, what's the point of stalling! Haven't you seen that Cloud City is almost completed?"</p><p></p><p>"You were so confident in the beginning, saying that Li Fan must be faking his calmness. What do you have to say now?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Listening to his companions' constant reproaches, Zhou Kebao's face turned pale and then green.</p><p></p><p>He defended himself, "There's something fishy going on! Definitely something fishy!"</p><p></p><p>"Just a while ago, I heard that the supplies were indeed insufficient."</p><p></p><p>"How come the supplies are suddenly more than enough so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"These are all strategic supplies strictly controlled, you can't even buy them if you want!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao looked perplexed.</p><p></p><p>With his eyes darting around rapidly, it seemed like he was trying to figure out the big secret behind it.</p><p></p><p>However, his words clearly failed to convince everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"Leaving that aside, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"When Li Fan completes the construction of the Immortal City, won't all our supplies be useless in our hands?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget being empty-handed, if Li Fan turns the tables and reports us, what then?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Kebao, you caused this trouble, now you solve it yourself. Go find Li Fan and make amends!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group's chatter and scolding left Zhou Kebao mentally agitated.</p><p></p><p>The faint glimmer of insight in his mind had vanished and could no longer be grasped.</p><p></p><p>Caught in such a situation, Zhou Kebao could only sigh deeply and submit.</p><p></p><p>Thus, a day later, Zhou Kebao sought out Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Without playing any tricks, he sincerely explained the ins and outs of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li has one-upped us, and we deservedly lost."</p><p></p><p>"But from the beginning, this matter was Tantai Can's idea. We were just momentarily deceived..." Zhou Kebao said, feeling ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled but remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"So why are you looking for me now?"</p>

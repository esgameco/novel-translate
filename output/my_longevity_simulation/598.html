            <p>"The fisherman murmured softly, 'Extinct...' These two words, his expression was initially somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>As he kept repeating them, it seemed like he remembered something, a faint glimmer appeared in his murky eyes.</p><p></p><p>'I am...'</p><p></p><p>'Tian Jue?'</p><p></p><p>As the fisherman's memories slowly revived, the black murderous aura that had been churning within him became even denser.</p><p></p><p>Like a surging black tide, it began to spread and rampage outward from his body.</p><p></p><p>However, all the murderous aura, before reaching Tianyi's side, spontaneously avoided from a distance.</p><p></p><p>In the confrontation between the two, a vast open space was formed.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi was indifferent to the dispersing aura, only showing a slight surprise at Tian Jue, who still seemed confused.</p><p></p><p>'Your memory hasn't returned? How is that...'</p><p></p><p>Tianyi's eyes flickered, about to take action.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, from a distance, a clear reading voice was heard.</p><p></p><p>'Tianfa stern, respect rules.'</p><p></p><p>'I now have the Fa, spreading among all beings.'</p><p></p><p>'Tianfa must not be violated.'</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianyi's expression finally changed noticeably.</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he looked in the direction of the sound.</p><p></p><p>"Moo!"</p><p></p><p>Without warning, a bull the size of a small mountain suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Its horns lightly raised, hooves flying, as if rushing forward at great speed to ram into Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>'You evil beast!' Tianyi coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>Without dodging or evading, he simply had a glint of silver appear in his right hand.</p><p></p><p>The silver light turned into a thin line, swiftly piercing through the bull like lightning.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it turned the bull inside out.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the bull was fragmented into countless indiscernible pieces, but it kept its momentum forward.</p><p></p><p>Scattered all over the place.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>A furious shout suddenly resounded.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the bull that Tianyi had disintegrated, unexpectedly 'resurrected,' from the scattered flesh and blood, suddenly reformed into its original form.</p><p></p><p>Jumping above Tianyi's head, its hooves were about to step down.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi still didn't dodge.</p><p></p><p>But just as the bull was about to touch Tianyi, its body unexpectedly shrank from big to small.</p><p></p><p>From a mature bull, it turned into a young calf in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>And finally transformed into a wisp of spiritual energy, dispersing into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>'Tianyu...' Tianyi looked in the direction where the bull appeared, showing a playful expression.</p><p></p><p>A white-haired, transparent figure with a dragon-like body size appeared right on time.</p><p></p><p>'Master!'</p><p></p><p>'Master!'</p><p></p><p>With Tianyu's appearance, all the people of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace, who were previously suppressed by Tianyi and Tian Jue and dared not act out, now seemed to have found their support.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, they kept howling.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>Tianyu sighed lightly, as if soothing, waved his sleeves.</p><p></p><p>The screams of agony in the Yunshui Heavenly Palace temporarily quieted down a bit, and only then did he focus his gaze on Tianyi and Tian Jue.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi lightly applauded.</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Without looking at the two who were vaguely surrounding him, Tianyi just looked up, seemingly searching for something.</p><p></p><p>With a pensive expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>'Tianyi!'</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Tianyu couldn't hold back anymore.</p><p></p><p>'You've been hiding for so many years, and you finally show up?'</p><p></p><p>The voice thundered, containing endless anger, echoing in the Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Humph."</p><p></p><p>Tianyi just snorted coldly, without answering.</p><p></p><p>His disdainful attitude made Tianyu furious.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, there's nothing more to say. You shall die!"</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jue, why not make a move!"</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman was still in a state of confusion at this time.</p><p></p><p>But with Master's shout, the two of them seemed to be cooperating like old war comrades.</p><p></p><p>With extreme tacit understanding, the next moment, the Tian Sha Sword unsheathed with a clang.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a broken sword, a vast and continuous aura of murderous intent surged out from the sword, condensing into a sword shape.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Yunshui Heavenly Palace, a great tremor was felt.</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle snake Taichi let out a painful howl, and the Tian Sha Sword sensed the call of its master, seemingly about to break free from the monster's body.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a blue light enveloped the entire Yunshui Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>A blue giant hand pressed down on the restless Tian Sha Sword, pushing it back in.</p><p></p><p>Taichi let out another earth-shattering howl.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if suppressed, the voice grew fainter and eventually fell back into slumber.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster Hanhai?"</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Yunshui Heavenly Palace, you could faintly hear continuous amazement.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the blue ocean in the sky suddenly shrank, condensing into a faintly flickering, seemingly about to break apart illusion.</p><p></p><p>It arrived in front of Tianyi and the others.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen several venerables."</p><p></p><p>He said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Hanhai, what is your intention?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Hanhai's strange attitude, Tianyu suppressed his anger and asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"The murderer is right in front of you. Why are you not seeking revenge for the bloody vendetta from the past?"</p><p></p><p>"What you say is true, blood debts naturally have to be repaid with blood. But..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai did not look at Tianyi but turned to look at the fisherman, who was still somewhat misty and holding a sword.</p><p></p><p>"Who slaughtered my Yunshui Heavenly Palace back then was not Tianyi."</p><p></p><p>"But Tian Jue!"</p><p></p><p>His words carried boundless resentment.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai's blue remnant image trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>With an angry stare, it seemed like huge waves were constantly churning inside him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Tianyu was momentarily stunned and then shook his head, sighing.</p><p></p><p>"Hanhai, you are indeed being influenced by the years. Even memories from back then are now in confusion."</p><p></p><p>"The executioner who slaughtered all major sects in the rear, wiping them out completely, who else but this traitor?"</p><p></p><p>Tianyu looked at Tianyi, and the flames of hatred in his eyes flared up again.</p><p></p><p>"One person can make a mistake. Could it be that all the fallen souls at that time were mistaken?"</p><p></p><p>Hanhai continued to shake his head, stubbornly saying, "I may not know about other sects, but they have nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>"But back then, the one who destroyed my Yunshui Heavenly Palace was definitely Tian Jue!"</p><p></p><p>"Although he looked like Tianyi on the outside, even the aura matched. But whether it was the style of exterminating everything or that cold and silent demeanor, it was not something Tianyi could disguise."</p><p></p><p>"Most importantly, the weapon of destruction back then was none other than the 'Heaven Killing' sword handle that is now suppressed within Taichi's body."</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven Killing weapon, aside from Grandmaster Tian Jue, no one else can wield it."</p><p></p><p>With those words spoken, even Master couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to look at Tian Jue beside him.</p><p></p><p>And seemingly, Hanhai's words stirred up certain memories hidden deep in Tian Jue's mind.</p><p></p><p>He gazed blankly at his hands.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it was me who killed..."</p><p></p><p>"What!" Master's slightly bent body suddenly straightened, looking incredulously at the fisherman who had just confessed."</p>

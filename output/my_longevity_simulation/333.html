        <h1>Chapter 333</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't die? Not only did he escape the great calamity of Mo Sha's world destruction, but it seems he had another opportunity in Yuan Dao State?"</p><p></p><p>"This kind of luck..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly became interested in this Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>Looking carefully, he was completely different from his previous image of tattered clothes and messy hair.</p><p></p><p>Now, Han Yi was wearing a purple-gold robe, with a faint glow flowing on it, clearly not an ordinary item at first glance.</p><p></p><p>On his left hand, he wore a green jade thumb ring, which not only had storage functions but also traces of formation fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, he gave the impression of being extraordinary and either wealthy or noble.</p><p></p><p>His own cultivation was also remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen years ago, he had not yet broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, however, he was already at the Golden Core stage, just like Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Li Fan's eyes moved slightly, and a hint of a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the crowd, a silver light was emitted from the surface of the Tian Xuan Mirror in the center of the hall, shining on the purple wooden box in Han Yi's hand.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the purple wooden box disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And the list on the surface of the Tian Xuan Mirror changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the list, it clearly changed to "Han Yi, Tian Du Hua Yu Dan. Can prolong life by 806 years."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the hall immediately erupted in a commotion.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually true? This kid wasn't boasting?"</p><p></p><p>"A mere Golden Core cultivator, his luck is too good, isn't it? To actually find a treasure that can prolong life by 800 years? I'm really envious!"</p><p></p><p>"Tian Du Hua Yu... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>"The previous Blue Feather Immortal Master in Yuan Dao State who has already fallen, wasn't the cultivation technique he practiced called 'Tian Du Hua Yu Technique'? I heard that in order to fight for this Dao-harmonizing true technique, Yuan Dao State is in chaos, and many cultivators have fallen. I don't know what relationship this Tian Du Hua Yu Dan has with the Blue Feather Immortal Master."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was discussing, staring at Han Yi with gazes full of various meanings.</p><p></p><p>But Han Yi, facing the gazes of many cultivators far higher in cultivation than him, was able to remain calm and composed, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>He even gracefully saluted the cultivators and said with a smile, "Please forgive me, everyone! If nothing unexpected happens, the first place in this bounty hunt will be mine."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the expressions of the cultivators present turned unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>But Han Yi didn't care. He took out a folding fan from somewhere and opened it with a snap.</p><p></p><p>Fanning himself leisurely, he found a place to sit down and waited for the final result to come out.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's sudden appearance made the atmosphere in the Tian Ji Academy's hall a lot more depressing for a while.</p><p></p><p>It was not as enthusiastically discussed as before.</p><p></p><p>The first and second places were almost set.</p><p></p><p>Although the ownership of the third place might change, the degree of attention was obviously not as high as before.</p><p></p><p>The technique Yan Fa Jue could deduce was extraordinary, but the third place could only deduce it to the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>It was completely incomparable to the Primordial Spirit and even Dao-harmonizing techniques.</p><p></p><p>After about half a day, two or three more cultivators arrived at the hall one after another.</p><p></p><p>After looking at the list on the surface of the Tian Xuan Mirror, they knew there was no hope of competing for the top three.</p><p></p><p>But these cultivators still offered their treasures one by one for the double reward promised by Immortal Master Ji Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was about time, Li Fan took out a Wangshou Fruit from his storage ring and placed it in front of the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light passed, and the list on the Tian Xuan Mirror was updated again.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Fan, Wangshou Fruit. Can prolong life by 300 years."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's sudden rise caused a ripple in the somewhat depressed hall.</p><p></p><p>There was even a cultivator who suddenly stood up, his eyes red, staring at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As if Li Fan had an irreconcilable feud with him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wan! Calm down, calm down!"</p><p></p><p>It turned out that this person was the original second place, Wan Yu.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Han Yi and Li Fan made him fall out of the top three in one fell swoop, losing the opportunity to use Yan Fa Jue.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's gaze only lingered on him for a moment before completely ignoring him.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the crowd of cultivators, Li Fan slowly walked to a seat near Han Yi and sat down.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi looked at Li Fan, a glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't say anything at this time, only cupping his hands towards Li Fan with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>After another half a cup of tea's time, a countdown began to appear on the surface of the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The deadline for the bounty was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Just at this last moment, a figure dressed as a scholar rushed in at the last minute.</p><p></p><p>His figure stopped under the Tian Xuan Mirror, and he looked up, squinting.</p><p></p><p>His reaction next was also very interesting. First, he let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head, looking very regretful.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept around and directly locked onto Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>He also found a seat near Han Yi, just like Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi couldn't help but sneer, "Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>But the movement of his fan became a bit hurried.</p><p></p><p>The countdown on the Tian Xuan Mirror slowly returned to zero.</p><p></p><p>And the ranking list on the mirror surface finally only left the top three lines.</p><p></p><p>A blue-robed cultivator suddenly appeared in the hall at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He said in a loud voice, "Han Yi, Xi Men Yue, Xiao Fan, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>"The remaining cultivators stay here, and someone will be responsible for verifying and distributing the rewards later."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Yi took the lead and stood up, walking at the very front.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan stood up, he made a gesture of invitation to Xi Men Yue, who was in second place.</p><p></p><p>Xi Men Yue hesitated for a moment, then thanked him in a low voice and followed Han Yi out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan walked at the back of the three.</p><p></p><p>Under the envious gazes of the crowd of cultivators, the three of them followed the blue-robed cultivator out of the hall, turned right, and went all the way inside.</p><p></p><p>After passing through more than a dozen doors, they finally arrived at a small courtyard with a big tree in the center.</p><p></p><p>This big tree seemed to have grown very luxuriantly before, with branches extending and almost covering the entire courtyard.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was unknown what kind of changes it had suffered. The leaves had all fallen off.</p><p></p><p>Even on the main trunk of the tree, yellowish spots appeared.</p><p></p><p>His figure was a bit hunched, stroking the equally dying big tree in front of him.</p><p></p><p>His back looked a bit desolate.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Immortal Master!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, how could Li Fan and the other two not understand the identity of this old man?</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly saluted at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi also put away the arrogance on his face and became more restrained.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Master Ji Cheng slowly turned around, looking at the three young people, a trace of nostalgia and sadness flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You... are very good."</p><p></p><p>Immortal Master Ji Cheng said word by word, slowly.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, the effects of the life-prolonging treasures you submitted this time far exceeded my original expectations."</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to you, I can finally stand up again and move around a bit."</p><p></p><p>"To make some arrangements for my affairs after death."</p><p></p><p>Immortal Master Ji Cheng spoke very slowly, and a hint of death qi faintly appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Master, do you mean you have already consumed all these life-prolonging treasures?"</p><p></p><p>"But why?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xi Men Yue couldn't help but ask.</p>

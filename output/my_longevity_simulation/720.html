        <div class="content">
            <p>For them, they knew nothing about the Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>This was very unusual, which made people doubt their origins. Because such powerful beings would never be unknown.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, many things can be explained."</p><p></p><p>"When I wanted to achieve the Dan formation with the Tiansha Method and the Hanhai Method, I felt a fatal crisis. If I used only these two methods for Dan formation, it would inevitably lead to a backlash from the heavens and the earth. Only by adding other principles like Lan Yan, Mo Sha, and others, could the golden elixir be stabilized. Because the Tiansha and Hanhai methods I observed were not originated from the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If forcefully using these two methods to form the Dan, perhaps they would be regarded by the heavens and earth as pure outsiders. The consequences..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind flashed an image of numerous clouds and seas being destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"This may be the reason why the cloud sea must die."</p><p></p><p>"An existence that does not belong to the Profound Yellow Realm but thrives increasingly relying on the nourishment of the Profound Yellow Realm. Like a foreign object in the body, it must be removed to be relieved."</p><p></p><p>"But, the fact that Zhang Haobo was able to successfully build his foundation with the Tiansha Sword Intent, also indicates that these former outsiders are gradually being transformed into a part of the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Like the cloud sea that was extinct by the Red Flames and Mo Sha but recovered and thrived again. It seems that the hostility of heaven and earth towards it will greatly decrease."</p><p></p><p>"Contact, fusion..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>On that day at the Yunsui Heavenly Palace, when Hanoi identified the fisherman as the culprit who destroyed the Yunsui Heavenly Palace, she had said, "The heavenly killing weapon, besides the Heavenly Extinguisher, no one can use it."</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought he was referring to the Tian Sha. After all, when Zhang Haobo fell, the sight of Zhang Haobo's foundation with the Tian Sha Sword Intent appeared, and one of Li Fan's Nine Methods was the Tiansha Method.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that perhaps in Tianyi's original world, Tiansha was once Heavenly Killing.</p><p></p><p>However, after they arrived in the Profound Yellow Realm, their own principles had undergone convergent evolution with the laws of the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thus, some differences emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also thought that nowadays, the Profound Yellow Realm had expanded almost by a circle compared to ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Plundering other paradises and worlds, avoiding the fate of being swallowed by the Xian Tu, there were conflicts between different laws in the world.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the origin of the world's mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Zue's amnesia. The Tianyu, Yunsui Heavenly Palace turning into mysteries, could it be due to the influence of the world's integration?"</p><p></p><p>"In this process, the Tianyi, who remained unharmed, appeared even more terrifying in strength."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Tianyi has lived for thousands of years, and the various mysterious domains in the white mist are obviously related to him. I wonder what he's planning."</p><p></p><p>"The strangest thing is the reaction of several Longshengtianzun in the Profound Yellow Realm. If they claim to know nothing about Tianyi's actions, I would not believe it, but they have always been indifferent. Have they reached some kind of trade, or..."</p><p></p><p>The face of Tianyi emerged in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he shook his head slightly and temporarily suppressed various thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Back in Tianliang Prefecture, re-establishing the connection of communication symbols, countless messages came pouring in like snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was calm and dealt with them one by one.</p><p></p><p>How to keep a bowl of water level had long been mastered by him when he was in the position of the Grand Profound Tai Shi.</p><p></p><p>Now there were still six hundred and forty positions available in Tianliang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>With the approval of Nan Gong Shirong, there were only over two hundred positions left for trading and compromising with other forces.</p><p></p><p>But there were definitely more than a thousand who wanted a piece of the pie.</p><p></p><p>How to satisfy the vast majority of people without offending too many required careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai checked the backgrounds of these people while replying to messages and inquiring about their characters.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just when Xu Bai was busy in his new position, a major event suddenly attracted the attention of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Yuandao Prefecture, Blue Feather Xianzun, was nearing the end of his lifespan, thus he announced to all cultivators in the world that he was collecting all life-extending treasures.</p><p></p><p>He also provided a list of life-extending treasures he had already used.</p><p></p><p>And he declared that whoever could provide effective treasures could choose from his collection.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather Xianzun had been in charge of the Dao Yuan Prefecture for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>His collection was incredibly rich. It even surpassed the rewards the Wanxian Alliance offered for cultivators exploring the white mist.</p><p></p><p>The world was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators hurriedly left the white mist and went on adventures to find life-extending treasures.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, stared at the news, slightly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Is Blue Feather giving up, trying to reverse life and death?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that news of the Heavenly Venerables achieving enlightenment has been leaked. Is it an internal leak in the Wanxian Alliance, or..."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders?"</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was lost in thought, Huang Fu Song carefully studied the message released by Blue Feather and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I don't have such fortunes," he said somewhat self-deprecatingly.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, so many things, Eastern, I haven't even heard of half of them. And he has tried them all," exclaimed Dongfang Yao. "In my opinion, those damned will eventually die. Why struggle so much, prolonging the inevitable. It's better to find solace early."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the complaints of the two people beside him, Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"The planned operation that had been prepared for a long time was suddenly disrupted. Now what Blue Feather needs most is time, so the worldwide reward is also a last resort."</p><p></p><p>"What will he do next?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, at this point, Blue Feather did not have much choice.</p><p></p><p>One was to change the desire to reverse life and death to strive for longevity.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, grasping the conditions for reversing life and death was by no means an easy task. It was almost impossible to achieve this in a short time. Otherwise, Blue Feather wouldn't have set up a great formation and risked everything just before his imminent death.</p><p></p><p>So the only choice left was the current option for Blue Feather.</p><p></p><p>"To go against the law of life and death again, and compete with that unnamed Longsheng Tianzun!" Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Although it is extremely difficult, Blue Feather is much more familiar with the law of life and death. Compared to changing the law, the possibility of success is even greater. In this, maybe there will be support from the Five Elders."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts quickly turned.</p><p></p><p>"It's interesting. Let's see how the Wanxian Alliance will respond next."</p>

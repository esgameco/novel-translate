        <div class="content">
            <p>Although his current strength was already far beyond what the Zhang Haibo in his previous life's memories could compare to, the actual combat power displayed by Chi Yan and the various Immortal Lords was also much stronger than in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>If it were only this, he wouldn't feel so conflicted.</p><p></p><p>The key was that on the battlefield, there was another hunter lurking.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang!</p><p></p><p>This Hua Shen array master, having fully grasped his previous life's memories, would certainly not give up this opportunity to merge with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Those countless, densely packed silver cubes forming such a vast array, when he saw it in his heart, he couldn't help but feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>How could such a person be content with just being a support!</p><p></p><p>As expected, the subsequent development of events also verified Ye Feipeng's speculation.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Zhang Zhiliang was even more despicable than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Using arrays to seal the battlefield, letting the enemy and Chi Yan fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>He himself would reap the benefits like a fisherman.</p><p></p><p>He even invited another Immortal Lord who had merged with the Dao to suppress the array for him...</p><p></p><p>If this Immortal called "Black Crow" made a move, he would have no chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>Should he still take the risk and forcibly act?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Ye Feipeng, who had already made up his mind, couldn't help but waver again.</p><p></p><p>But this bit of hesitation, after the Hua Shen Immortal Lords trapped in the Taiji Microdust Array fell one by one, Chi Yan's injuries became more and more severe, and Zhang Zhiliang was about to successfully merge with the Dao,</p><p></p><p>gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood red passed through his eyes. Looking at the extremely weak Chi Yan, the greed in his heart surged up unstoppably.</p><p></p><p>"The arrow is on the string, I have no choice but to shoot!"</p><p></p><p>"At this point, I can no longer shrink back!"</p><p></p><p>"With the cooperation of the Vast Sea Pearl, using my [Kun Devouring] divine ability, I swallowed about a third of the Cong Yun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Fully activating the Kun Peng bloodline, after [Startling Peng Transformation], even I myself don't know what kind of terrifying monster I will become."</p><p></p><p>"That Zhang Zhiliang read my memories. With his meticulous mind, he must have made backup plans to guard against me."</p><p></p><p>"But it's useless!"</p><p></p><p>"I won't entangle with him at all. I don't care about any Essence of Heaven and Earth, any strange arrays, or Zhang Zhiliang. I will swallow them all in one gulp!"</p><p></p><p>"Then use the [Peng Flight] divine ability to quickly leave the Cong Yun Sea and head to [Nanming Sacred Beast Mountain]. There, the power of the sacred beast bloodline will be multiplied. I'll find a place to hide and slowly digest them all!"</p><p></p><p>"Just ten years...no, just three years, and I can completely digest everything in my belly!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I will be the new Chi Yan Immortal Lord!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through Ye Feipeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>All the blood in his body was boiling with excitement, and his mind was filled with images of everyone bowing their heads after he successfully merged with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng, his eyes blood red.</p><p></p><p>Startling Peng Transformation, activate!</p><p></p><p>The demonic beast bloodline erupted like a violent volcano, circulating throughout his body in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Vast Sea Pearl frantically converted its own power and that of the Cong Yun Sea to construct a body for Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>Silently, an ancient monster with a body thousands of miles long, the Kun Peng, reappeared in the world under the water.</p><p></p><p>The huge shadow enveloped Zhang Zhiliang, countless arrays, and Chi Yan.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ye Feipeng leaped up, his bloody mouth wide open.</p><p></p><p>Swallowing them all.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a melodious, ancient cry, the giant beast's enormous body leaped into the air, blocking out the sun.</p><p></p><p>Below, the cultivators on the Myriad Immortals Island and even the entire Cong Yun Sea who were fortunate enough to witness this scene all showed expressions of shock and horror.</p><p></p><p>Under the shadow of the giant beast, cultivators and islands all appeared incomparably tiny.</p><p></p><p>The giant beast soaring in the air did not fall back into the sea.</p><p></p><p>On its back, two pairs of huge wings spread out.</p><p></p><p>Its form also instantly changed into that of a black monstrous bird.</p><p></p><p>Wings spread fiercely, like clouds hanging from the sky.</p><p></p><p>With a powerful flap, the gale it stirred up instantly swept across the entire Cong Yun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Island directly facing the might of the Kun Peng below trembled incessantly like leaves in the wind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it flew high into the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>From its belly, the sound of huge impacts seemed to continuously ring out.</p><p></p><p>But the Kun Peng's body was too enormous. Such attacks could not shake it in the slightest for the time being.</p><p></p><p>As for the Black Crow Immortal Lord who was suppressing the array for Zhang Zhiliang, he had no intention of making a move at all.</p><p></p><p>He only transformed into a one-eyed raven with completely black feathers, looking up at the departing Kun Peng with interest.</p><p></p><p>The Kun Peng flapped its wings again.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the cultivators, this enormous monster became barely visible, only the size of a black dot.</p><p></p><p>And it was still rapidly moving towards the southwest.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the cultivators of the Cong Yun Sea finally reacted to this upheaval.</p><p></p><p>"What...what was that?"</p><p></p><p>"There was actually such a terrifying monster hidden at the bottom of the Cong Yun Sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Kun Peng! That must be the ancient monster Kun Peng that has been extinct for a long time!"</p><p></p><p>"It actually swallowed Zhang Zhiliang and the Essence of Heaven and Earth together?! Doesn't that mean this Kun Peng will become the new Chi Yan Immortal Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's a pity. Zhang Zhiliang schemed endlessly but never thought he would end up in the belly of a beast. In the end, it was all for nothing!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the final victor in this world is Ye Feipeng?"</p><p></p><p>"The Cong Yun Sea, the demonic beast Kun Peng, with the accumulation of opportunities and having foresight to plan ahead, he indeed has the qualifications to merge with the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"It's just, after swallowing Chi Yan, he directly ran away..."</p><p></p><p>"He probably doesn't have enough strength to digest on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"But how does this count?"</p><p></p><p>"If Chi Yan doesn't die for now, will Mie Sha still descend?"</p><p></p><p>"Does the Cong Yun Sea still need to be destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, like the other cultivators, looked up at the sky with an indescribable expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another loud cry of the Kun Peng rang in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators all sighed with emotion and discussed spiritedly.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Kun Peng was about to completely disappear from the sky...</p><p></p><p>A sudden change occurred.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze focused and his body abruptly stood straight.</p><p></p><p>He saw that in the vast sky above, purple qi suddenly came from the west.</p><p></p><p>Rosy clouds filled the sky, arriving in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they covered the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>A figure entirely composed of faint purple qi sat on the rosy clouds, occupying half the sky.</p><p></p><p>The purple figure gazed into the distance where the Kun Peng was about to disappear and snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Evil demons and heretics, you dare to come out and court death!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was strange, seeming to be a combination of a childish voice and the cold voice of a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was incomparably majestic, rumbling like thunder, reverberating throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>Living beings who heard it couldn't help but feel their hearts jump and become uneasy.</p><p></p><p>As that purple figure spoke, it lightly pointed a finger towards Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>A bolt of purple divine lightning suddenly struck down from the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>It hit the Kun Peng squarely!</p><p></p><p>A painful howl rang out and the Kun Peng's distant fleeing figure instantly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if losing power, it rapidly plummeted downwards.</p>

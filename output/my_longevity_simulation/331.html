        <h1>Chapter 331</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Zhang Zhiliang was briefing about the formation training matters in Tianyu Prefecture, he had mentioned that within 30 years, the Wanxian Alliance planned to cover every inch of their territory within the scope of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>In other words, at that time, within the Wanxian Alliance, there was already a subtle awareness of the impending changes in the world?</p><p></p><p>From the few interactions with the top experts in this world, Li Fan did not think this was an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>"The ducks in the warm spring river are the first to know. Experts at the Hedao and even Changsheng realm already have the strength to contend with heaven and earth. It is normal for them to detect the changes in the world early on."</p><p></p><p>"The policy has been set, but not everyone can understand the profound meaning behind it."</p><p></p><p>"They thought this was just an ordinary infrastructure task. So for the position of the Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Academy, Guan Xingxiu and others could arbitrarily use Dantai Tao and others as pawns in their conspiracy."</p><p></p><p>"However, they obviously underestimated the importance of the popularization mission of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Formation."</p><p></p><p>"Thus bringing great disaster. The Garrison Academy Commander positions of the four inland prefectures - Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, and Tianquan, are definitely not low. But they still don't understand the true meaning behind the policy."</p><p></p><p>"Then, who exactly are the policy makers of the Wanxian Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The several departments of the Wanxian Alliance that Li Fan currently knew of, such as the Ministry of Governance, the Martial Arts Hall, the Strategy Formation Hall, the Tianji Hall, the Garrison Academy, etc., each had their own responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>They were all specific implementers of the policies.</p><p></p><p>As for the mysterious and detached Hufa Hall, it was only responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Who represented the true will of the Wanxian Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Who determined the fate of countless cultivators in a single thought?</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had consulted countless secret materials and knew that now, whether it was the Wanxian Alliance or the Five Elders Council, a publicly recognized fact was that the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's whereabouts were unpredictable and he had long been unconcerned with worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>This was not something that needed to be avoided, it could be known with a single inquiry.</p><p></p><p>Then, besides the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, did the Wanxian Alliance have other Changsheng Heavenly Venerates?</p><p></p><p>If it was only Hedao cultivation, how could they convince the masses?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought of the mysterious and unfathomable Heavenly Doctor again.</p><p></p><p>His strength was above Hedao.</p><p></p><p>But he himself seemed to travel outside the Wanxian Alliance system.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there would be no need to set up a bounty mission for the "Cloud Water Diagram".</p><p></p><p>Couldn't he just issue a decree directly?</p><p></p><p>"Outside the public eye, there is a group of invisible people. They are the true leaders of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Even..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, and a rather absurd idea suddenly surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>All along, he had subconsciously believed that the Tianxuan Mirror was just an extremely powerful spirit treasure.</p><p></p><p>Although it had its own thoughts, it was still just an object.</p><p></p><p>It was an object that served the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This was also the consensus of almost all the cultivators in the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>What if the true leader of the Wanxian Alliance was actually this Tianxuan Mirror?</p><p></p><p>As soon as the thought emerged, even Li Fan himself was startled.</p><p></p><p>But on careful consideration, it was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>At the level of the Tianxuan Mirror, there was no longer a clear boundary between objects and people.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that creating a body to move around would definitely not be difficult for the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>And back then, during the Lingwu Grass incident, just when the situation was about to get out of control.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror timely sounded an announcement, settling the matter with a single statement.</p><p></p><p>This might not have been an order from some other cultivator, but a decision made by itself.</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan, who was cultivating in the Tianxuan Mirror space, suddenly felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Even this spacious private space seemed to inexplicably become a bit dark and cramped.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head silently, he suppressed the thoughts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Even if my guess is true, as long as I don't show obvious abnormalities, the Tianxuan Mirror may not notice me."</p><p></p><p>"After all, there are too many cultivators in the Wanxian Alliance, and I'm just a small Golden Core cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"It's also possible that I'm scaring myself."</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he forcibly suppressed this kind of thought.</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens to take this opportunity to cultivate to the middle stage of Golden Core in one go."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Heart Refining Chant slowly circulated, crushing all distracting thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became calm again and immersed himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the remaining few months of the 28th year, not only was Li Fan's own cultivation progress extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>The feedback he received was also endless, indicating that everyone's realms were rapidly improving.</p><p></p><p>Even the youth named Han Wuyou from the separated realm had entered the Qi Refining stage, sending help like a clear stream.</p><p></p><p>Under the blessing of various factors, at the end of the 28th year, Li Fan successfully cultivated to the perfection of the early Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>And sure enough, as other cultivators said, the bottleneck that existed between each realm and hindered the cultivators' progress.</p><p></p><p>It also became like paper, easily broken with a light poke.</p><p></p><p>With his aura surging, Li Fan successfully entered the middle stage of Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>"Successfully broke through, next I can start making a clone."</p><p></p><p>This clone was still used to deceive others.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even planned to send the clone to the Yuandao Prefecture in the 29th year to investigate.</p><p></p><p>To see what exactly happened in Yuandao Prefecture during the ten missing years.</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, what would it feel like to be inside and outside Yuandao Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>A destined cannon fodder naturally didn't need to put in too much effort.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan left Tianyu City again, randomly chose a direction, and flew for more than ten days to find a remote area.</p><p></p><p>Like before, he dug out a secret room and sealed off the way he came.</p><p></p><p>"This time there wasn't such a big commotion, I won't be unlucky and get found again, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan muttered in a low voice and began to refine the clone.</p><p></p><p>Supreme bones, heavenly spiritual milk, shattered bone precious tendons, heavenly crystal spirit sand...</p><p></p><p>He skillfully added the materials one by one into the virtually created flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>He also added a mid-grade human wonder: Raging Butterfly, as a necessary item for foundation establishment.</p><p></p><p>Then he threw in a [Golden Core Fragment] that recorded the enlightenment of the water method for forming a golden core.</p><p></p><p>The Raging Butterfly was previously purchased from the Wanfa Pavilion in Jiushan Prefecture, prepared for the [Reviving Immortals].</p><p></p><p>The buyer Lin Fan had already disappeared from the world along with Congyun Hai.</p><p></p><p>No need to worry about being investigated.</p><p></p><p>As for that Golden Core Fragment...</p><p></p><p>In this world, cultivators who formed their golden cores using the water method were countless, and it was even more untraceable.</p><p></p><p>All the preparations were complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concentrated and began to refine the clone.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used his finger as a sword and severed the fate of the clone from the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>Strands of vitality emanated from the clone.</p><p></p><p>A brand new clone with the strength of early Golden Core was born.</p><p></p><p>"Let's call you Xiao Fan!"</p><p></p><p>Dressing it in clothes, Li Fan repeatedly looked at the clone a few times and said with satisfaction.</p>

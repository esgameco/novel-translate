        <h1>Chapter 974</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Transmitter Jiang pondered for a moment, without much hesitation, and still left the Immortal Alliance headquarters, heading straight for the rampaging demons in the world.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew that what awaited him next might still be death, he did not hesitate in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the First Transmitter, he had already lost count of how many times he had "died".</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there were methods left by the Venerable Ancestor of Transmission.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Xuanhuang realm was not destroyed and the Venerable Ancestor's principles remained unchanged, he, as an existence attached to the Venerable Ancestor, would never be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>His state would always be fixed at that initial point in time, and as long as he was willing, he could return to the "Origin" at any time.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, but even the Guixu realm where he resided was the same.</p><p></p><p>This was an insurance left by the Venerable Ancestor of Transmission for the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>It allowed him to fearlessly solve various problems that might arise in the Xuanhuang realm, and through countless deaths, his ability to handle matters and experience would continuously improve, becoming more and more at ease.</p><p></p><p>And if he encountered something that he really could not handle, he would use his body as a basket to bring it back to the Guixu realm.</p><p></p><p>By relying on the forced state reset during the "Return to Origin", it could be thoroughly eliminated.</p><p></p><p>The power of "Return to Origin" in the Guixu realm was comprehended by the Venerable Ancestor of Transmission after he attained the Dao and wandered outside the heavens for nearly a thousand years, at the time of re-establishing the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancestor once told him that even the danger of the True Immortal Seal could be resolved without a trace through repeated "Returns to Origin".</p><p></p><p>"Not even leaving behind information, this situation has only occurred twice before."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that behind this turmoil, it is either the True Immortal Seal again, or..."</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Jiang glanced towards the eastern frontier of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, he continued on his way.</p><p></p><p>Encountering a rampaging demon, Transmitter Jiang immediately subdued it.</p><p></p><p>Then, he sent a thread of divine sense into it.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, that ferocious-looking demon exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Jiang slightly frowned: "Only an empty shell left? It ran away so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Next, Transmitter Jiang experimented on more than a dozen demons.</p><p></p><p>All were the same.</p><p></p><p>"Despite winning, still being so cautious..."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the purpose?"</p><p></p><p>This unknown opponent made Transmitter Jiang feel a rare sense of pressure that he hadn't felt in a long time.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he saw a thick dark cloud slowly approaching from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>It would cover the entire sky of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's first solve these abnormalities in front of us."</p><p></p><p>"After they reveal more clues, we'll deal with it in a targeted manner."</p><p></p><p>"Then we can only seek help from the Venerable Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Transmitter Jiang crushed another demon into dust.</p><p></p><p>Next, he did not continue to handle it personally, but returned to the Guixu realm and issued an order to the Immortal Alliance headquarters to thoroughly eliminate the demonic abnormalities in various places.</p><p></p><p>With demons running rampant, the grassroots defense forces of the Immortal Alliance were almost completely paralyzed.</p><p></p><p>To quickly and thoroughly resolve the trouble, it was necessary for powerful heavyweight figures to take the lead.</p><p></p><p>And as the First Transmitter, Jiang naturally would not personally take action.</p><p></p><p>After asking around among the other Transmitters, only a few were willing to take on this arduous task.</p><p></p><p>In the end, after careful consideration, Transmitter Jiang decided to let Transmitter Feng take responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Responsibility for this matter.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the impression left by the previous Dharma transmitter Feng was not bad. Secondly, Jiang believed that it was necessary to give this relatively young Dharma transmitter more opportunities for experience.</p><p></p><p>"If the second Guixu realm is completed, it may be possible to consider letting him be the successor. As long as he can pass the trial." Dharma transmitter Jiang thought so.</p><p></p><p>And Dharma transmitter Feng, who is also the Dharma King of Xuantian Sect, Mo Rubin, began issuing orders one by one after receiving the order.</p><p></p><p>With the official order of the Wanxian Alliance, those Huashen and Hedao cultivators who originally shrunk back and only cared about their own lives had no choice but to stand out at this moment and actively clean up those rampant demon gods.</p><p></p><p>In cooperation with the black-clothed cultivators from the era, the millions of demon gods who had lost their main control and greatly reduced their combat power were slowly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the disease comes as fast as a mountain collapses, and the affected area is like pulling silk.</p><p></p><p>From the sudden outbreak to the disaster of the entire Immortal Alliance, the demon god disaster only took more than half a day.</p><p></p><p>However, it took the Wanxian Alliance more than half a month to slowly eliminate these demon gods.</p><p></p><p>When all the incarnations of the demon gods were eliminated, the real problem emerged.</p><p></p><p>How to deal with those cultivators who were bewitched by the possession of the demon gods.</p><p></p><p>As the incarnations of the demon gods were eliminated, almost all of these cultivators became idiots without any sense.</p><p></p><p>In principle, as long as all these cultivators are slaughtered, this disaster can be successfully resolved.</p><p></p><p>However, the order from the highest decision-making level of the Immortal Alliance stated that no one was allowed to harm the lives of these cultivators without authorization.</p><p></p><p>And those who killed some cultivators out of anger were also severely punished.</p><p></p><p>"Even if they are guilty, they are still members of the Wanxian Alliance before their crimes are sentenced."</p><p></p><p>"Hurting them is a violation of the laws of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>According to the order, they were all escorted to the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance to await their fate.</p><p></p><p>This process lasted for more than ten days.</p><p></p><p>The demon god disaster was finally completely quelled.</p><p></p><p>The surviving cultivators all sighed at the benevolence and righteousness of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As a reward for the cultivators who made efforts in quelling the disaster, the Wanxian Alliance generously rewarded them with a considerable amount of contribution points.</p><p></p><p>The value far exceeded ordinary tasks, and the scope of the reward was beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Even those who did not actually fight, as long as they had provided information about the location of the demon gods, they received a large amount of contribution points.</p><p></p><p>This made the cultivators who chose to watch from the sidelines stomp their feet, beat their chests, and regret endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who received rewards and suddenly became arrogant all entered the Tianxuan Mirror to choose the items they needed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Wanxian Alliance issued another announcement, stating that they had found out the reason for the outbreak of the previous demon god disaster.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators basically couldn't afford the expensive cultivation techniques they desired, so they harbored resentment.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, they were finally bewitched by an evil ancient fierce god and became its running dogs.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent such a tragedy from happening again, the Wanxian Alliance made a painful decision and self-reflected, deciding to reduce the price of all cultivation techniques sold in the Tianxuan Mirror by one-third from today.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the news came out, it immediately set off a huge wave.</p><p></p><p>You know, a one-third price reduction is not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>Especially for more expensive cultivation techniques, the remaining contribution points are even more.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the cultivators who suddenly became rich went crazy.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Anchor for three years, dissociate from the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was sitting in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His mind was disturbed, and he could no longer maintain his calm.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he slowly stood up and walked out of the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>He came to the cliff's edge, gazing into the sea of clouds. The mountain wind blew in gusts, causing Li Fan's clothes to flutter noisily.</p><p></p><p>It took a full half-day before Li Fan's mood gradually returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>In the past three years, this kind of scene was not the first time it had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan successfully returned to the anchor point of 1 year later this time, the experiences of the past reincarnations still deeply affected him.</p><p></p><p>It was not a passive influence like falling into the True Immortal's net, but Li Fan's own mentality had a problem.</p><p></p><p>Even with the protection of the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, he could not escape it.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he was immersed in his thoughts for a while, in the darkness, the scene of Cat Bao leaping up and then devouring the figure of the True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins would uncontrollably emerge from the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Startled in a cold sweat, his mind was greatly disturbed.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer maintain a state of tranquility.</p><p></p><p>"Cat Bao, Cat Bao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he kept muttering these two words.</p><p></p><p>Cat Bao clearly possessed three abilities: item replication, creature imitation, and Yi Jing bone marrow tempering. But when it was fished out of the fishing pool, it was only of white quality.</p><p></p><p>The fishing pool was vaguely the creation of an unknown True Immortal who had already comprehended the Dao of Fishing.</p><p></p><p>And how could Cat Bao, who could deceive the fishing pool, be simple?</p><p></p><p>The fact that Cat Bao fed on the essence of source power also explained its extraordinary nature to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>However, neither the Holy Emperor who was a pawn, nor Li Fan who considered himself a chess player, had thought...</p><p></p><p>That Cat Bao would turn out to be such a terrifying creation.</p><p></p><p>Where the immortal power reached, it was as if a True Immortal had arrived in person. Even if it was not the real body, just a phantom, it crushed the Immortal Descent that had shattered the Xuanhuang Realm and the All Things Return to Void Grand Formation with a wave of its hand. In stark contrast, the three Supreme Mighty Ones of the Starry Sea could barely survive in the immortal formation even when exerting all their strength.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Supreme and True Immortal could not be measured in miles.</p><p></p><p>And Cat Bao, who could swallow a True Immortal's phantom in one gulp...</p><p></p><p>Its true strength was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, Li Fan had truly experienced the disappearance of the suction force in the Immortal Ruins, the collapse of the high walls, and the turbulence of the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>The instinct for survival made him briefly suppress the fear in his heart after the shock.</p><p></p><p>And it was not until this life that he came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Feeling an incredible sense of lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>So in the previous life, when the True Immortal descended, although Li Fan was startled but not panicked and only remained vigilant at all times, he did not immediately return to reality. The purpose was to be able to glimpse some more secrets about the True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly...</p><p></p><p>The descent of the True Immortal actually brought out Cat Bao's true face.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins, who could destroy the Xuanhuang Realm with a single glance, couldn't even react in front of Cat Bao and was swallowed in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan was targeted by Cat Bao, how could he have any chance of survival?</p><p></p><p>A hundred lifetimes of hard work nearly turned to dust in an instant, and from then on, there would be no turning back. How could Li Fan not feel lingering fear?</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought I was cautious enough."</p><p></p><p>"The waters of the Xuanhuang Realm have basically been explored. There's no need to be so wary in the future. But outside the high walls, it gave me a huge scare..."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the inheritance selection information that was still flashing in front of his eyes, Li Fan returned to the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>The room was filled with small cats carved from wood. The shapes were different and lifelike.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all half-finished products missing arms and legs, and the original appearance of the kitten could not be glimpsed from these carvings.</p><p></p><p>These were all hand-carved by Li Fan within three years.</p><p></p><p>Without using spiritual power, purely handmade.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared for a moment, then picked out another suitable piece of wood and took out a rasp placed beside him.</p><p></p><p>He began carving patiently.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was using the method of recreating through wood carving to directly face the root of his inner fear, in order to eliminate the influence Cat Bao had on him.</p><p></p><p>It did have some effect.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of Li Fan waking up from Cat Bao nightmares was much lower than three years ago.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan clearly knew that to truly resolve this "inner demon", it would take a long time.</p><p></p><p>He also took this opportunity to carefully review and ponder.</p><p></p><p>In the final critical moment of the previous life, the Starry Sea was turbulent. The impact of the collapse of the high walls caused many powerful cultivators who had survived in the world-destroying immortal formation to be unable to endure and perish.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan's divine sense in the core of the immortal formation, relying on the remnant power of the formation, vaguely perceived that the turbulence of the Starry Sea was not entirely due to the collapse of the high walls.</p><p></p><p>There was also the reason for the abrupt descent of a certain existence.</p><p></p><p>Like a huge rock falling into a deep pool, splashing countless water droplets. In the already tumultuous Abyssal Starry Sea, it stirred up waves of towering tsunamis!</p><p></p><p>In that chaotic and perilous scene, due to his decisive alertness, Li Fan did indeed successfully return to reality.</p><p></p><p>But the scenes experienced during the return were somewhat different from before.</p><p></p><p>This was also the deeper reason why Li Fan had been unable to truly calm his mind for three years.</p><p></p><p>The normal return scene was that the surroundings dimmed, as if shrouded in a layer of mist, and could not be seen clearly. After the return was activated, all the scenes froze, shattered, and flew into his own mind.</p><p></p><p>When facing an extremely strong threat, such as when the Xuanhuang Realm was destroyed by the True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins with a single glance, and when the Faceless True Immortal came seeking a steed, these overbearing existences could move in the frozen scene around the return. However, their speed was very slow, as if the inside and outside of the return were not in the same space-time.</p><p></p><p>But in the previous life, the return scene experienced by Li Fan was completely different.</p><p></p><p>The scene outside the return seemed to be frozen as if unaffected. But the misty images surrounding it flickered from time to time, bright and unstable, like an old-fashioned TV that had lost its signal.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p><p></p><p>There was no countermeasure at all, and he could only wait for the final fate to arrive, as if accepting judgment.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately.</p><p></p><p>The return was finally successfully activated, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to the anchor point of 1 year.</p><p></p><p>When the familiar scene appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's rasp made a stroke, and the originally perfect small cat wood carving was instantly ruined.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw it aside and took out another piece of wood to carve.</p><p></p><p>Eliminating all distracting thoughts from his mind, he was extremely focused.</p><p></p><p>When a carving very similar to Cat Bao, but missing two ears, took shape, Li Fan felt that his heart had once again calmed down a lot.</p><p></p><p>He began to review the experiences of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>The greatest gain from the previous life was naturally knowing about the existence of the cat treasure and having a concrete understanding of what lies beyond the high walls.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan had planned to see if he could use the legacy left by Mr. White to cross the high walls if given the opportunity. Now, he has temporarily dismissed this idea.</p><p></p><p>Although what lies beyond the high walls is terrifying, it doesn't actually have too much impact on Li Fan at the moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, judging from the cat treasure's behavior, the only ones who can truly catch its eye are those at the True Immortal level.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan is still far too distant from the realm of True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Because he is too weak, there is no need to worry excessively.</p><p></p><p>As for the terrifying and fearsome origins of the cat treasure, based on his experiences from the previous life, Li Fan has two guesses.</p><p></p><p>It's even possible that it's an extension of the power of the Nameless Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The fishing pool and cat treasure likely exist in more than one place, distributed across multiple locations.</p><p></p><p>Their mission is to search for the True Immortals that still exist in the world.</p><p></p><p>Once they discover traces of Them, the Nameless Immortal will descend and devour Them.</p><p></p><p>Just like back then, the fate of those "Fish Kings" that Li Fan saw in the Congyu Sea fishing competition.</p><p></p><p>But there is a question in this.</p><p></p><p>The reason they are devoured is because they have value.</p><p></p><p>The "Fish Kings" are divided up because they have been nourished by the spiritual power of the cultivators participating in the fishing competition. For the other Fish Kings, they are a great supplement.</p><p></p><p>But for the Nameless Immortal who has already comprehended a certain Dao and transcended, ordinary True Immortals seemingly don't have the value worth devouring.</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, the real targets are True Immortals like the True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins, who have comprehended the Dao for ten thousand years and are about to ascend. Being able to take their Dao comprehensions for oneself, possessing a second or even more Dao paths..."</p><p></p><p>True Immortals are already out of reach. There is even less information on Nameless True Immortals. Li Fan can only make reasonable speculations based on his past understanding of things.</p><p></p><p>Besides the possibility that the cat treasure is an extension of the Nameless True Immortal, there is a second guess.</p><p></p><p>The reason the cat treasure appeared in the fishing pool is because its target was originally that Nameless Immortal who entered the Dao through fishing!</p><p></p><p>After the fishing pool plundered the treasures of the starry sky, the cat treasure sensed its power and disguised itself to take the bait, actively entering the fishing pool. The purpose was to have a chance to find the Nameless Immortal behind the fishing pool.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the fisher is also fished.</p><p></p><p>However, while idly waiting for prey to take the bait, it discovered another True Immortal instead. It can be considered an unexpected delight.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the cat treasure's expression at the end of the previous life, it doesn't seem to be picky.</p><p></p><p>It was equally surprised and delighted by the appearance of the True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The implications behind the second guess are far more terrifying than the first.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Fan had long known about the existence of Nameless Immortals.</p><p></p><p>The realm of Nameless Immortals is even above True Immortals. Instantly killing True Immortals is also to be expected.</p><p></p><p>But if the second guess is true...</p><p></p><p>Then it means the cat treasure is likely just a vanguard.</p><p></p><p>A hunter from a civilization beyond the walls, specialized in hunting True Immortals and even Nameless True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to perceive the specific situation inside. But the gradual disappearance of the suction force from the Immortal Ruins can already explain certain facts."</p><p></p><p>"No fluctuations from any battles spreading out..."</p><p></p><p>"The True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins probably didn't put up much resistance before being captured."</p><p></p><p>The reason for using the word "captured" instead of "perished" is because Li Fan clearly felt the process of the suction force from the Immortal Ruins slowly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the source of the suction force was slowly being pulled into a quagmire and gradually disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Rather than the suction force from the Immortal Ruins vanishing in an instant with the True Immortal's demise.</p><p></p><p>"If the guess is true, then the collapse of the high walls and the turbulence in the starry sea are proof of the descent of the forces behind the cat treasure to capture True Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"The forces beyond the high walls that can create a being like the cat treasure must have also developed to an unimaginable extent."</p><p></p><p>"Capturing True Immortals is profitable."</p><p></p><p>"If True Immortals have any value, one is the power of immortal spirits, and the other is the Dao of True Immortals..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered while arranging the newly carved wooden cat figurines.</p><p></p><p>His heart became a bit more tranquil again.</p><p></p><p>After the fear was dispelled, some thoughts surfaced in Li Fan's mind: "Actually, if you think about it carefully, the discovery of the cat treasure is not entirely a bad thing for me."</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, I now have a means to restrain True Immortals. I have the capital to flip the table if I disagree with something."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike before, when a True Immortal descended, I could only pathetically use Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed: "The only thing I need to pay attention to is exposing Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the scenes Huan Zhen experienced at the end of the previous life, the civilization behind the cat treasure actually has the power to affect Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"It's not like a True Immortal's power directly acting on me, thereby affecting the activation of Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"But it truly affected Huan Zhen itself."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's just a slight fluctuation in Huan Zhen's scenes..."</p><p></p><p>"If I want to use the power of the cat treasure, it will be inevitable to use avatars."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, his true body sat unmoving in the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Avatar Saint Emperor, Saint Fetus, multiple Dao avatars...</p><p></p><p>Although there were no major problems overall, subtle loss of control still occurred.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Avatar Saint Emperor exhibited a higher moral viewpoint. Although this setting was forcefully added to him by Li Fan when creating the avatar, it caused irreconcilable conflicts with the true body. Later on, it directly severed all connections with the true body.</p><p></p><p>This caused the true body's perception to be cut off. Some details during the battles with Chuan Fa and Tian Yi were unknown because of this.</p><p></p><p>Also, the mental stability of the Dao avatars was even worse than the true body and avatars. The emotional fluctuations were sometimes too intense, completely contrary to the true body.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan could completely control the words and actions of the Dao avatars, he couldn't completely eliminate this loss of control over their mental state.</p><p></p><p>Besides the factor of Dao avatars just being a single divine sense and inherently too weak, Li Fan also vaguely realized the fundamental reason why the Dao avatars he split off in the previous life had emotions that fluctuated so easily.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the Xuan Huang Immortal Heart Mantra!</p><p></p><p>First, there was the Saint Fetus, who passed down the Xuan Huang Immortal Heart Mantra to the Qing Xuan Army guarding the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Then there was the Saint Emperor bestowing the Immortal Heart Mantra upon the Da Qi Forbidden Army.</p><p></p><p>The number of beings cultivating this dharma door exceeded a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan didn't think that widely spreading the Immortal Heart Mantra would have any impact on him.</p><p></p><p>But the facts proved that he was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Huang Immortal Heart Mantra had accompanied him all along since he stepped onto the path of immortality.</p><p></p><p>With cultivation that had already become instinctive, it had already subtly fused with his own being.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1016: Sealing Fate and Extracting the Dao Foundation</p><p></p><p>Pretending to be nonchalant, Li Fan collected the nine dissociation discs. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan inquired about Mo Rubin's collaboration with the Mirror Holder Cang.</p><p></p><p>"This fellow Cang is quite interesting. If you hadn't told me in advance, I really wouldn't have noticed that he has already become a mirror slave of the Xuantian Magic Mirror." Mo Rubin shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"But with his secret cooperation, the plan to convince the Wanxian Alliance to build a grand formation and thoroughly control the Xuantian Magic Mirror has become much smoother."</p><p></p><p>"However, the most critical part still depends on you, Brother Xingwang. A formation that can help the Tianxuan Mirror break free from the restrictions of the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate..."</p><p></p><p>"Are you really confident?" Mo Rubin asked with a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't make a promise immediately. </p><p></p><p>Instead, after pondering in silence for a while, he slowly said, "There shouldn't be any major issues. This little thing you just gave me does seem much stronger than the previous Lifeless Formation Crown."</p><p></p><p>"But to be on the safe side, if possible, it's best if you can gather more information about the restrictions left by the Dharma Transmitter."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Li Fan put on a confused expression, as if he had completely forgotten about this matter.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of amazement in Mo Rubin's tone, clearly impressed by this genius's idea: "This place is located in the Devouring Element White Mist at the intersection of the four central states of the Immortal Alliance, bordering the Xuanhuang Realm. It still belongs to the control of the Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm, but after the transformation, the Wanxian Alliance can obtain greater control authority."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan paused in his steps.</p><p></p><p>"But that's just relying on the might of the Dharma Transmitter. If I encounter the Dharma Transmitter Zheng..." A hint of inexplicable brilliance flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I recently encountered a matter that you might be interested in." Before parting, the two exchanged some more details that needed attention during the execution of the plan, and Mo Rubin suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"The original plan was to keep this batch of cultivators in a state of physical survival but with their consciousness gone forever. But later, after some discussion, we felt that the quantity of millions was still too much. After all, many of them are cultivators above the Nascent Soul realm, and as long as they are alive, they occupy resources like cave heavens and the changes of life and death. It also means that the normal number of cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm will always be a bit less in the future."</p><p></p><p>"However, although it's called returning to the Heavenly Dao, it's actually different from natural evolution. The most crucial point is that the Wanxian Alliance has prepared a new place to store these extracted heavenly and earthly resources."</p><p></p><p>"But this technique called 'Sealing Fate' used by the Wanxian Alliance is different. At most, within half a day, the heavenly and earthly resources devoured by the cultivators will be extracted in their original form and returned to the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>"These cultivators have had their consciousness completely destroyed, leaving only their bodies in the world. But it also involves the operation of the Floating Starry Sky Grand Formation, so they can't be directly executed. Therefore, all these people were imprisoned at that time."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Hearing this, Li Fan's eyes instantly lit up. "How is it different from naturally returning to heaven and earth after a cultivator's demise?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you previously split out millions of ethereal demons to occupy the bodies of many cultivators and cause a big commotion?" Mo Rubin said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's eyes revealed a hint of interest: "The Wanxian Alliance actually mastered a method to extract the cave heavens, changes of life and death, and even the spirit of heaven and earth from within a cultivator's body..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The technique of extracting and returning them to the world!" </p><p></p><p>"You mean, these extracted and stored world resources can be reactivated at any time?" Li Fan thought for a moment, and then was slightly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that this was reasonable, Mo Rubin immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"So after much consideration, we decided to keep only 500,000 and seal them forever."</p><p></p><p>Because the meaning behind this was quite frightening.</p><p></p><p>"As for the one who researched the method of 'Sealing Fate'... Transmitter Zheng was very dissatisfied with the resolution of the Transmitter Council. This kid, having been in power for too long, already believes that there is no need for cultivators in the world, and it would be better if they all turned into pigs and mortals. Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>"More crucially, the Myriad Immortals Alliance can continuously expand the realm here. Then, slowly absorb all the parts devoured by the cultivators in the world into it." The scene depicted by Mo Rubin was somewhat chilling.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"Think about the consequences if this is successfully executed. At that time, even cultivation may require the 'permission' of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The Alliance won't need ordinary cultivators to maintain the survival of the Xuanhuang Realm. They will likely transform a large number of cultivators into mortals..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin explained, "After cultivators die, they return to the heavens. By the time they are reborn in the world, many years may have passed. And those cave heavens and world souls will also undergo corresponding changes during the operation of the world."</p><p></p><p>"As for the remaining 500,000..." At the crucial point, Mo Rubin paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. In other words, as long as the Myriad Immortals Alliance is willing, they can quickly use these resources to rebuild a team of cultivators. But this is not the point. The Alliance has many other ways to achieve this as well."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, brother, you don't need to worry too much. Under the opinion of Transmitter Jiang and more than half of the Transmitters, the use of this Sealing Fate technique has been strictly restricted. After all, it's too dangerous. If not controlled well, it may lead to a future where cultivation is monopolized." Mo Rubin hurriedly consoled.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, Transmitter Jiang is quite good. He truly considers the cultivators of the world. As for the other Transmitters who hold opposing views, I think most of them are wary of the existence of the Five Elders Council's power. After all, if the number of cultivators is really too small, if they go to full-scale war with the Five Elders Council, I'm afraid the combat power provided by the 'Illusory Truth Sage' alone may not be their match." Mo Rubin analyzed.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance actually possesses such a method." Li Fan's face also turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Killed them all? No, I didn't sense the tremor of the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Fan also cooperatively reacted.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, under Mo Rubin's explanation, he pretended to nod and seemed to recall a little.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang must not be careless. This Transmitter Zheng still has some real talent and learning. After all, he can research such an evil technique as Sealing Fate..." Mo Rubin solemnly reminded, "You didn't see the miserable state of those cultivators when their fate was sealed."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin sighed, "Even with my experience, it's a bit hard to watch directly. This is when they are already in a state of ignorance. If the cultivator's spirit still remains, and 'Sealing Fate' is still executed..."</p><p></p><p>"It would probably surpass all the cruel punishments since ancient times!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin sighed and concluded as such.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>A brutal energy suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman's face was calm, his body solid like a mountain, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>Even the straw raincoat on his body seemed to have absorbed the time of millions of years, tightly following the fisherman amidst the storm, unaffected by the external world.</p><p></p><p>As for Han Yi, it seemed like from within, a surging and terrifying black aura was billowing and appearing.</p><p></p><p>Under the envelopment of this inexplicable energy, although the expression on Han Yi's face remained frozen at the moment when he was just stared at by the fisherman, it appeared inexplicably eerie and horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Tong Kong disappeared, cracks appearing on his face like shattered porcelain.</p><p></p><p>His entire body would occasionally flicker, disappearing into the rolling black aura.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it reappeared quietly.</p><p></p><p>All changes occurred in a short moment.</p><p></p><p>After a glance, the fisherman put the fish basket he had placed on the ground back on his back and strode towards the direction of the dense clouds.</p><p></p><p>As for Han Yi...</p><p></p><p>The turbulent black aura suddenly receded back into his body after the old fisherman left, but he did not return to normal.</p><p></p><p>He just stood quietly in place, with no further actions.</p><p></p><p>Like a statue that had been here from the beginning till the end.</p><p></p><p>His vacant eyes staring straight ahead.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, when an ordinary white bird flew over the statue of Han Yi, something strange happened.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning signs, the wound on the wing of this white bird that had already healed suddenly reopened and started bleeding. It lost balance, spiraling in the air and continuously falling.</p><p></p><p>Until it reached the ground, it could not recover.</p><p></p><p>Directly crashing to death in front of Han Yi's statue.</p><p></p><p>And not long after.</p><p></p><p>In a nearby small town, a group of ordinary people passed by, chatting and laughing as they strolled.</p><p></p><p>As if they couldn't see the withered image of Han Yi, they paid no attention to him standing in the middle of the road.</p><p></p><p>They didn't step aside and bumped right into him.</p><p></p><p>What was even more bizarre was that the withered image of Han Yi seemed like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>No collision occurred.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary people simply walked through.</p><p></p><p>They remained composed, oblivious of any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Just a short while later, one person in the group suddenly clutched their chest, turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the gasps of the onlookers, the person crumpled to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, they passed away.</p><p></p><p>These ordinary people had initially intended to go to the nearby mountains to pick some herbs.</p><p></p><p>But with this unexpected turn of events, they naturally lost interest in harvesting herbs.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sobbing, they carried the unfortunate victim who had suffered a heart attack back with them.</p><p></p><p>And some time passed.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator dressed in a blue Daoist robe flew excitedly over the statue of Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>"After putting in so much effort this time, I finally gathered the last main ingredient. Coupled with the alchemy furnace I purchased before..."</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Xuan Ice Treasure Pill is almost guaranteed to be made!"</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself quietly, his eyes full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>A day later, in the sky above Luo Yan Prefecture, there appeared an inconspicuous anomaly marking the fall of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It was reported that a certain cultivator made a mistake in the alchemy process, causing the furnace to explode, and thus losing both the pill and their life.</p><p></p><p>During this era, although incidents of cultivators dying due to alchemy accidents were extremely rare, they were not impossible.</p><p></p><p>The deceased was just an inconspicuous Golden Core cultivator, and people only sighed a few words upon hearing the news.</p><p></p><p>It didn't cause much of a stir.</p><p></p><p>It remained unknown to outsiders for the time being.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The perspective shifts back to the old fisherman.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't fly with the wind, he walked on the ground with lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>With each step he took, he was already thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered continuously as he advanced towards the dense clouds.</p><p></p><p>When he was only a step away from reaching the destination in Yuan Dao Prefecture, a blue figure suddenly stood in his way.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you should go back..."</p><p></p><p>The fisherman furrowed his brows, sizing up the other person.</p><p></p><p>Clad in a blue Daoist robe, with grey hair and wrinkled face, he appeared to be close to his end.</p><p></p><p>"Do I know you?" the fisherman asked uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed cultivator coughed a few times, and in a hoarse voice replied, "Friend, you seem to be getting more forgetful."</p><p></p><p>"The last time we met, you could remember me. Now, you can't even recall who I am?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me think, that was just a thing of past two hundred years."</p><p></p><p>The fisherman lowered his head in silence, seemingly pondering the words of the blue-robed elder.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, he shook his head, "Indeed, I can't remember."</p><p></p><p>"But it's okay..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, you are about to die soon."</p><p></p><p>The old fisherman said to himself.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed elder was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I am about to die..." The old man sounded somewhat melancholic.</p><p></p><p>"It's my duty, I have no choice." The blue-robed elder's response was straightforward.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman didn't waste any words.</p><p></p><p>He extended his right hand and grabbed forward.</p><p></p><p>Intersecting black lines suddenly appeared around the blue-robed elder, forming a massive net that enveloped him from all directions.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed elder let out a muffled groan as his figure vanished abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind only a blue feather that emitted a faint light within the shrinking net held by the fisherman.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, as the net retracted and disappeared into the fisherman's hand.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the blue feather in his hand, the fisherman raised his eyebrows, appearing slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Then, he shook his head slightly, not dwelling on it further.</p><p></p><p>He placed the blue feather in his fish basket behind him and continued towards the dense clouds.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the fisherman left.</p><p></p><p>A faint figure reappeared in the field.</p><p></p><p>"After my death, let the world be in chaos."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>He deeply glanced at the figure of the fisherman's back and vanished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Back in Qingyun Prefecture, two states separated from Luo Yan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The instant the perspective he was spying with disappeared, Li Fan knew something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Reacting swiftly, he immediately took out the statue of "Worldly Emanation Lord" gifted by the Five Elders' Assembly from his cave haven.</p><p></p><p>It was not the one that could establish contact with the Five Pivot Court.</p><p></p><p>It was a statue with a drooping expression that emanated melancholy, representing the Lord of Worry, a defensive image.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the deity statue was only one, to protect the spiritual sea from dispersing after a critical blow, a highly effective defense.</p><p></p><p>Just like he had been struck fiercely by a bat, Li Fan suddenly felt a roaring sensation in his head.</p><p></p><p>Myriads of overlapping scenes appeared before him, still swaying incessantly.</p><p></p><p>He vomited a mouthful of blood, instinctively holding his head tightly with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Even the protective energy of "Truly" dropped by 5%.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was just a minor injury, with no danger to his life.</p><p></p><p>The inner celestial domain within his body circulated the Five Elements of power.</p>

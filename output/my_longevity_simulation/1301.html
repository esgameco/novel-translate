        <h1>Chapter 1301</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Sage Emperor pondered, sensing the surging energy from the remnants of Tianyang's bones.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he let out a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Striving... can prove immortality, but it does not align with me."</p><p></p><p>There was not much regret in the Sage Emperor's tone as he withdrew from the state of Tianyang's armor.</p><p></p><p>Returning the remains, Li Ping instructed Tianyang, "Since the Dao of Striving is empty, these resonating remains are an invaluable treasure for you. Contemplate them well. Although the immortal dao is not manifest now, the existence of resonance indicates the dao still exists."</p><p></p><p>"Given time, you may very well be able to achieve true immortality with this!"</p><p></p><p>The Dueyue Sect's Yijue Daoist looked on eagerly as Tianyang put away the remains, then stuffed his long eyeballs back into the passage.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, what a pity..." Yijue Daoist sighed.</p><p></p><p>"What lofty opinions does the Dueyue Sect Master have?" Yijue's attitude aroused Tianyang's displeasure.</p><p></p><p>Yijue Daoist shook his head and chuckled, "Just lamenting that the Dueyue Sect missed a good opportunity. As they say, when one attains the Dao, even the dogs ascend to heaven. If the great Sage Emperor had comprehended the remnant thoughts, perhaps one day he could have truly grasped the Great Dao. We could have all benefited."</p><p></p><p>"As for you..."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe there will be such a day. But our Dueyue Sect probably won't be around to see it."</p><p></p><p>His words made no attempt to hide his pessimistic view of Tianyang's chances at immortality. </p><p></p><p>This time, Tianyang was not angered by the Dueyue Sect's provocation. He just sensed the unyielding thoughts from his own remains, as if returning to when he still had a human body.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps because he had become a puppet, even after trying for a long time, Tianyang still could not rouse his passion.</p><p></p><p>The eight words "Tianyang's life, yields to no one" sounded a bit different when shouted compared to before.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor's hall fell into silence for a time.</p><p></p><p>However, before long, the changes in the Wanxian Alliance below drew their attention.</p><p></p><p>In a flash of light, a group of black-clad, ruthless cultivators appeared at the edge of the moonlight in Tianquan Prefecture. </p><p></p><p>They first gave a slight bow to the mirror-wielding figure high above, then with solemn expressions, prepared spells and techniques towards the unbroken Bright Moon Starlight Formation.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they were about to launch an all-out attack on the formation at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Various spells were indeed unleashed, but the corresponding techniques appeared to be frozen in midair, as if a pause button had been pressed.</p><p></p><p>Purple long spears like heavenly thunder, distorted spatial rifts, endless yellow talismans...</p><p></p><p>All were activated and gathered in one place.</p><p></p><p>Just waiting for the Bright Moon Starlight Formation to be torn open before erupting together.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivators of the Alliance took turns, condensing the power within their bodies into techniques.</p><p></p><p>Several hours later, the black-robed cultivators had rotated many times.</p><p></p><p>The accumulated techniques at the formation's edge had reached an almost startling degree.</p><p></p><p>A hint of solemnity flashed across the Sage Emperor's face.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, if this suspended, converged sphere of light exploded on the surface of the Xuanhuang Realm, it could easily reduce several prefectures to ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a bit longer, I have a way to handle it," Li Ping said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded slightly, not being stubborn.</p><p></p><p>Another half day passed, with a total of over a thousand all-out strikes being infused.</p><p></p><p>The condensed small sphere of light was now even a bit more dazzling than the bright moon above.</p><p></p><p>Even the mirror-wielding figure seemed to feel some apprehension.</p><p></p><p>The mark on his forehead released a small ancient bronze mirror, enveloping himself, the nine detached discs, and the other secondary phantoms.</p><p></p><p>Within the detached discs, the light and shadows from the formation analysis rapidly changed and finally produced feedback.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, a wisp of colorful thread flew out, floating towards Lu Xichuan not far away.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Xichuan comprehended the contents of these threads, her body trembled and she revealed an enraptured expression.</p><p></p><p>Passing the insights to the array masters present also elicited exclamations of surprise.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, when they looked at the Bright Moon Starlight Formation before them, the previous despair in their eyes was gone.</p><p></p><p>Under Lu Xichuan's lead, the array masters began to unravel the great formation.</p><p></p><p>The originally substantial moonlight, like silver silk threads, began to turn hazy under the influence of external forces.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor sensed that this group of Alliance array masters were like little insects, constantly gnawing at the foundations of the Bright Moon Starlight Formation.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Li Ping could make further adjustments to the great formation.</p><p></p><p>And he was confident that the speed at which the twenty-eight detached discs jointly deciphered could not keep up with his speed of changing the formation. If the Alliance did not bring out any more special means, he could trap them for a lifetime with just the formation.</p><p></p><p>His goal had never been as simple as just trapping them.</p><p></p><p>The arrangements left outside the Xuanhuang Realm told him that the winds had started blowing in the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>The struggle between the Starry Sea's revival power and the remnant immortal power was about to officially begin.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor, who had been sitting all along, slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>In a single thought, his majestic figure was projected onto the Xuanhuang sky.</p><p></p><p>As if cooperating, the holy radiance of the Bright Moon dimmed slightly, handing the stage to the Great Awakening Sage Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The instant the Sage Emperor's image appeared, the soldiers fighting for the Alliance in various prefectures were instantly filled with boiling blood and high morale.</p><p></p><p>They shouted in unison, "Greetings to the Sage Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>The captured and besieged cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance looked with some trepidation at that magnificent figure in the sky, but involuntarily thought of the various legends about the Alliance's Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Celestial Venerable at this moment?"</p><p></p><p>And those Wanxian Alliance cultivators still fighting like trapped beasts were also stunned upon seeing this figure filling their entire field of vision.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Dharma Transmitter attained the Dao and widely spread it to all beings, creating a glorious thousand-year era of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Dharma Transmission goes against the Heavens. The Heavens and Earth nurture cultivators. Devouring the Heavens and Earth is like killing one's own parents."</p><p></p><p>"It is not the righteous path."</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor's voice resounded throughout the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Blessed by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it clearly entered the ears of every living sage soul.</p><p></p><p>At first, the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance did not react to what this Great Awakening Sage Emperor was going to do.</p><p></p><p>But when they heard the words "not the righteous path", their faces changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The mirror-wielding figure guarding the detached discs had a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>The four central prefectures flashed with light even more, as the Alliance's high-level figures who had been holding down the headquarters were finally provoked.</p><p></p><p>Slandering the Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable was equivalent to slandering the entire Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It was shaking the legitimacy and foundation of the Wanxian Alliance's rule.</p><p></p><p>For the Alliance's upper echelons, the consequences of this matter were even more severe than losing all the other prefectural territories.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if they lost land, they could still take it back.</p><p></p><p>But once people's hearts changed...</p><p></p><p>"Break the formation! Break the formation for me immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichuan heard the furious roar of the Dharma Transmitter Ren in her ear.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance's array masters were as still as cicadas in winter, desperately trying.</p><p></p><p>However, while breaking the formation, they involuntarily listened to the voice coming from high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the constant appearance of many sacred phenomena in the sky, it spread to every corner of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I also have a method that does not borrow the power of Heaven and Earth, and can also tread the immortal path."</p><p></p><p>"Namely, with my Foundation Establishment, Golden Core Refinement, Nascent Soul Formation, and Divine Transformation..."</p><p></p><p>"Resounding the Dao of Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor's words were like a bolt from the blue, shaking the Xuanhuang Realm and attracting the attention of all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Just from the name alone, the Sage Emperor's method sounded much stronger than the Dharma Transmission.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with auspicious clouds and flashing golden light appearing one after another between Heaven and Earth, it made the cultivators feel dazed.</p><p></p><p>The last time a supreme expert lectured on the Dao in the Xuanhuang Realm was the Dharma-Transmitting Immortal Venerable thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>After the Dharma Transmission was verified by the world, the Dharma-Transmitting Immortal Venerable, who was at the Harmonious Dao realm at that time, became the Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable of the Longevity realm.</p><p></p><p>If this new method was feasible, wouldn't it mean that another peerless expert capable of contending with the Dharma Transmitter would emerge in the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>The bandits of unknown origin who surrendered might face a purge by the Wanxian Alliance in the future.</p><p></p><p>But if they turned to this Sage Emperor...</p><p></p><p>A strange atmosphere began to circulate among the Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor's Dharma transmission continued.</p><p></p><p>"The first step on the immortal path is Foundation Establishment with the self."</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing the wonders of Heaven and Earth can establish the foundation. Why? The wonders of the world are manifestations of the laws."</p><p></p><p>"But the most wondrous thing in the world is not an object, but the spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment with the self should be based on the myriad principles of the world!"</p><p></p><p>The originally profound method of Foundation Establishment with the self became easy to understand when the Sage Emperor explained it in detail.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even mortals who had not yet set foot on the path of cultivation in the Xuanhuang Realm could vaguely understand the general idea.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those Wanxian Alliance cultivators who had already successfully walked the path of Dharma Transmission!</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor's new method was actually built on the foundation of the Dharma Transmission, but broke free from its shackles and was reborn.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who practiced the Dharma Transmission naturally felt extremely familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>Just by listening, thoughts of agreement such as "So that's how it is", "It's indeed feasible", and "Wonderful" had already welled up in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Some Alliance cultivators who had just completed Qi Refinement and were trying to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, but were struggling to find a foundation-establishing wonder, suddenly had a great epiphany.</p><p></p><p>As if enlightened, they were overjoyed: "Why bother searching for some wonder? The Sage Emperor is right, I myself am the wonder!"</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment! Foundation Establishment!"</p><p></p><p>Although the method of Foundation Establishment with the self was not easy to actually cultivate, the vast Xuanhuang Realm had the largest number of cultivators at the Qi Refinement stage.</p><p></p><p>With such a huge base, even a small probability multiplied would result in thousands or tens of thousands in the end!</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor had only lectured up to the middle part of Golden Core Refinement, but new cultivators of Foundation Establishment with the self had already begun to descend on the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>The treatment for breakthroughs was completely different from that of Dharma Transmission cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After their breakthroughs, the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth surged into their bodies as if crazy, as if they were truly the protagonists of destiny favored by the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>There were even a few who had rosy clouds descending beside them during their breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Within the rosy clouds were various heavenly materials and earthly treasures, as if gifts from Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The attitude of Heaven and Earth was so vastly different that other cultivators couldn't help but feel envious.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Golden Core stage and above might still have some reservations.</p><p></p><p>But for cultivators at the Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment stages, there was no burden in dispersing their cultivation and starting over.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if the Sage Emperor's new method could not be cultivated, as long as the foundation-establishing wonder remained, they could always start over at any time.</p><p></p><p>After dispersing their cultivation, they temporarily stored away the wonder.</p><p></p><p>They wholeheartedly cultivated the method of Foundation Establishment with the self.</p><p></p><p>The number of Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm far exceeded the total of cultivators at other stages combined.</p><p></p><p>Even if one out of ten people in this group chose the Sage Emperor's new method, it would be a huge blow to the Dharma-Transmitting Celestial Venerable and the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Except for Dharma Transmitter Ren, the other Dharma Transmitters finally could not sit still.</p><p></p><p>Because inside the Alliance headquarters, the true feasibility of the Foundation Establishment with the self method had already been proven through experiments.</p><p></p><p>If they let this Sage Emperor continue lecturing...</p><p></p><p>The high-level cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>In the Wanxian Alliance's prison.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the space imprisoning thousands of extremely vicious bandits.</p><p></p><p>A figure that seemed to be reduced to just bones had its four limbs spread out, forming a big character, nailed in the void.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, on each of the figure's bones, there seemed to be...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flames burned incessantly, thunder crashed, and strange insects gnawed...</p><p></p><p>Or rather, on his face that was almost skeletal, it was difficult to show any expression anymore.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the suffering of his countless bodies slightly raised their heads.</p><p></p><p>The pitch-black eye sockets, through layers of space in the dark prison, looked towards the sky of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"With me as the foundation..."</p><p></p><p>"With me as the foundation..."</p><p></p><p>A black flame, like a long snake, was born from the void.</p><p></p><p>It flew straight towards him, piercing his heart and chest in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The black flames passed through his heart, but some still remained on the wound, burning the remaining flesh and bones of the figure.</p><p></p><p>And even the remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>Even with the figure's endurance, he couldn't help but let out a muffled groan.</p><p></p><p>"With me as the foundation, with me as the foundation..."</p><p></p><p>But he still kept muttering, and the pitch-black eye sockets seemed to light up with starlight.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, except for pain, any other feeling had long been absent from his heart.</p><p></p><p>But now, he vaguely saw a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of hope to break free.</p><p></p><p>How long had he been imprisoned?</p><p></p><p>In the dark prison with no daylight, he had almost forgotten the concept of time.</p><p></p><p>But judging from the trauma his body had suffered, it must have been a full five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>After being unfortunately captured and imprisoned here, he gave up the idea of escape.</p><p></p><p>After all, all his abilities had been drained by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could fortunately escape from here, it would be difficult to find the way back under the pursuit of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But now, through this voice reaching the depths of the dark prison, he might really be able to escape from here.</p><p></p><p>"Every bit of suffering is built upon my body."</p><p></p><p>"It's all that I feel."</p><p></p><p>"I lay the foundation..."</p><p></p><p>Spots of golden light began to flicker with the figure's words.</p><p></p><p>These golden lights seemed to come from the remaining dry bones of the figure.</p><p></p><p>Always hidden, until this moment of risking life, they were finally stimulated.</p><p></p><p>With creaking sounds, the golden light was like a flame, baking the dry bones.</p><p></p><p>The dry bones melted like candles, but after condensing, they formed a slightly smaller body that had returned to normal form.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding restrictions sensed the figure's abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Punishments were constantly triggered, bombarding the figure.</p><p></p><p>But the figure had long been accustomed to it, and even absorbed these punishments to transform them into energy to condense his new body.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the golden light, the figure became smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only the size of an adult's palm remained.</p><p></p><p>Walking out from the original dry bones,</p><p></p><p>"With me as the foundation, it actually returned me to the appearance when I first started cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a supreme and mysterious method!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I was delayed in the high walls for more than five hundred years, if I can bring this method back, it won't be a loss."</p><p></p><p>The small figure turned into a golden light and flew straight out from the deepest part of the dark prison.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring all the restrictions along the way.</p><p></p><p>Even the jailers of the Wanxian Alliance's dark prison didn't see this escaping golden light at all.</p><p></p><p>The golden light figure came to the ground and gazed at the shadow of the Holy Emperor in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"In a place of desperate straits, talents will indeed emerge. In five hundred years, such a character has appeared again in the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Mixed Origin Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>The golden light figure listened attentively for a long time, his brows always tightly knitted.</p><p></p><p>"A bit strange. Could it be that I've been imprisoned for too long and become stupid?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll record it first. When I get out, there will be people to study it."</p><p></p><p>The Great Enlightened Holy Emperor naturally didn't know that he had gained an audience from outside the high walls in a subtle way.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Xuanhuang, above the starry sea, there is the Great Dao of Immortality."</p><p></p><p>"True Immortals have fallen, the Great Dao is empty."</p><p></p><p>"The shadow of the reversed Dao, the true meaning of the resounding Dao, can glimpse the realm of immortality..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor solemnly preached.</p><p></p><p>And these abstruse words even made the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao itself gain some insight.</p><p></p><p>The wind in the world all came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Xuanhuang realm, except for the sound of the Holy Dynasty's preaching, there was no other sound.</p><p></p><p>Including the Wanxian Alliance cultivators who were originally eager to break through the Bright Moon Starlight Formation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were all stunned, listening to the Holy Emperor's words in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The higher the realm and strength, the greater the shock in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>In the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke and Yin Shangren, who were waiting for the decisive battle between the Immortal Alliance and the Holy Dynasty to break out so that they could take the opportunity to detonate the Golden Tree and take away Mr. Bai's skull, suddenly felt the ground beneath their feet begin to shake.</p><p></p><p>From a slight tremor, it slowly turned into a violent shaking.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Xu Ke was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>Because he felt that not only the Museum of Divine Treasures where they were, but the source of the shaking was the space itself where the Museum was located!</p><p></p><p>The shaking became more and more intense, and the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, which was originally like a starry sky and a bit dim, actually slowly lit up with spots of starlight.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance headquarters is in the Tianxuan Mirror. This situation, is it the Tianxuan Mirror breaking through?" A trace of surprise flashed across Yin Shangren's face, not knowing whether this anomaly was a blessing or a curse for them.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true body also sensed the slight tremor outside.</p><p></p><p>The three guardians of the joint Dao instantly became a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>After all, this scene hadn't appeared even once in hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu and Hua Yueye guarded in front of Yanfa Jue, while Li Fan guarded at the entrance of the space.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Elder Xu of the Dharma Protector Hall quickly sent a message, indicating that everything was fine, and they breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, it should be the Holy Emperor's avatar attacking." Li Fan secretly pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he took over the control of the other party's simulated personality.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, something big happened outside!" The little loli made an exaggerated expression.</p><p></p><p>"You're trapped here and couldn't see it, what a pity!" Yanfa Jue looked at Li Fan with eyes full of regret.</p><p></p><p>"You can see the outside world?" Li Fan stared at the little loli and asked suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue snorted and put her hands on her hips: "As for me... of course not."</p><p></p><p>"But someone told me! What, you don't believe it?"</p><p></p><p>"How about this, as long as you beg this young lady, I'll tell you the big events that happened outside!" The little loli said very proudly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan was unmoved and still thinking about something, she enticed: "You're at the joint Dao realm now, right? If you know about those things outside, it will definitely be of great help to you! Even for me, after hearing it, my deduction speed has increased a lot..." Yanfa Jue said in a serious manner.</p><p></p><p>"The one who secretly told you about the outside world... is it the Tianxuan Mirror?" Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue's expression suddenly froze, and then she waved her hand: "Hahaha, how is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes: "The tremor outside just now..."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror upgraded? How is that possible? In this lifetime, the Wanxian Alliance hasn't measured the heavens and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"Even Yanfa Jue gained something."</p><p></p><p>"Could it really be caused by the Holy Emperor's preaching?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit doubtful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His two avatars outside did indeed see the Holy Emperor preaching.</p><p></p><p>But he already knew that this was something the Holy Emperor had compiled to strike at the foundation of the Dharma transmission.</p><p></p><p>Except for the chapter "With Me as the Foundation", the rest were all empty talk and couldn't be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't pay too much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>But now, judging from the performance of Yanfa Jue and the Tianxuan Mirror, this Dharma preached by the Holy Emperor...</p><p></p><p>It actually had some insight.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Yanfa Jue in front of him who was still showing off and trying to make him beg, and coldly snorted, directly reciting the content of the Holy Emperor's preaching.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue instantly had a look as if she had seen a ghost: "Did Brother Tianxuan Mirror also tell you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly snorted and didn't answer.</p><p></p><p>"No fun!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to sleep!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" But Li Fan called out to her.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue couldn't help but look at Li Fan with vigilant eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's understandable that this new Dharma of the Holy Emperor is useful for us cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"But it also enlightened you, Yanfa Jue?" Li Fan showed a suspicious look.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue glared at Li Fan: "Didn't you hear, outside the Xuanhuang, above the starry sea, there is the Great Dao of Immortality!"</p><p></p><p>"True Immortals have fallen, the Great Dao is empty!"</p><p></p><p>"The shadow of the reversed Dao, the true meaning of the resounding Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue's eyes were wide open: "Take me as an example, Yanfa Jue is originally the manifestation of the laws of the Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"And the laws of Yanfa in the Xuanhuang realm are the projection of the Dao that can prove immortality above the starry sea..."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, in terms of resonating with the Great Dao, we have a natural advantage."</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue couldn't help but feel a bit proud: "This is something you cultivators can't even come close to!"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to resonate with the Great Dao, you at least need to find traces of the Great Dao first, right? The Dao that proves immortality is illusory and fleeting. Even if you can occasionally glimpse it, it's extremely difficult to always maintain this connection!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's somewhat heavy expression, the little loli became even more proud.</p><p></p><p>And then she suddenly thought of something, and showed a vigilant look: "Don't even think about snatching it from me! To be honest, even if you can forcefully borrow me to comprehend this Dao of Yanfa, it's useless."</p><p></p><p>"Why?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Do you still remember that character I showed you before? Thinking about it now, it's actually like a painting, depicting the Dao that proves immortality. For others to view."</p><p></p><p>"It's not the entity of the Dao that proves immortality, just a painting, so even ordinary cultivators can perceive it."</p><p></p><p>"But we are the projection of the Dao that proves immortality, if you're not me, how can you look up and see the Dao itself?"</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Jue said it very slowly, word by word.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that expressing this meaning was also a rather difficult thing for her.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao is empty..."</p><p></p><p>"True Immortals inscribe characters, engrave the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>All the past scenes related to the power of immortality surfaced in the mind, rapidly circulating.</p><p></p><p>Finally, four characters vaguely emerged on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Remembrance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit uncertain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Not the projection of the Dao that proves immortality, but the resonance of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Resounding the Dao of Immortality, so that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Emperor was actually able to discover the existence of Eternal Remembrance?"</p><p></p><p>The figure of Tian Yang flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, perhaps it should be like this."</p><p></p><p>After all, it was his own avatar, even though the connection was severed now, Li Fan quickly deduced the possible truth of the matter based on fragmentary clues.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, it seems that this Great Enlightened Holy Emperor, who has integrated the blood essence of Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba, has even higher comprehension than I imagined?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, my comprehension is extraordinary in the first place..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully read again this incomplete new Dharma that he didn't value before.</p><p></p><p>"If Eternal Remembrance is the resonance of the Dao, then it's true that every time it senses Eternal Remembrance, it's so hungry. Does it indicate that what it really needs is the Dao that proves immortality?"</p><p></p><p>"It can supplement the true ability..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rapidly pondered in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xuanhuang realm, the Holy Dynasty's preaching was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether they belonged to the Holy Dynasty or not, all the living beings who heard the Dao slightly lowered their heads to show their amazement at the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>After all, such a wonderful Dharma was originally something they had no chance to hear in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But now the Holy Emperor selflessly shared it with them.</p><p></p><p>There were even many cultivators who, out of gratitude, wept bitterly, constantly knelt and kowtowed, becoming the most loyal believers of the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>In the four states of the Immortal Alliance, at the boundary of moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The array masters woke up from the shock of the Holy Emperor's preaching.</p><p></p><p>They privately looked at Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>"Continue breaking the formation!"

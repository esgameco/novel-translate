        <h1>Chapter 391</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"I hope Su Xiaomei and the others can keep these four small tripods so that I can glimpse the mystery of the Medicine King Cauldron."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving the Daoist temple, Li Fan checked the Tianxuan mirror once again.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he checked the ranking in the Great Comparison Golden List.</p><p></p><p>He still securely held the second position, untouchable by others.</p><p></p><p>After more than two years of aggressively scoring in the Five Elements Cave Paradise, he had already opened up a considerable gap with the third position.</p><p></p><p>Unless there were major changes in the future, it was likely that he would end up in this rank.</p><p></p><p>As for Guo Yezhong, who held the first place due to his unique and unbeatable points deduction system, he was still far ahead of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be no hope of surpassing him at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at Guo Yezhong’s name intently: "Jielidi…"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Wanxian Alliance has no intention of sending it out at all."</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Li Fan closed the ranking and began to look through the communications he had received over the years.</p><p></p><p>Due to being in various secret realms, communication talismans were unable to connect with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the communications were sent to the Tianxuan mirror space.</p><p></p><p>Mostly casual greetings from He Zhenghao, Jing Xuandaoren, and others, with nothing of great importance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly scanned through them.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, he checked his merit level.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Thirty-One."</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw this number, Li Fan couldn’t help but be surprised. "It’s truly the Wanxian Alliance's thousand-year plan. I only participated in the construction of three grand formations, and my merit level skyrocketed to thirty-one."</p><p></p><p>"If one were to slowly do merit missions, it's likely that their Golden Elixir cultivation wouldn't reach this height in a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Participating in the construction of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array was rewarded with merits.</p><p></p><p>And after completing each formation, there would be real-time settlements.</p><p></p><p>This was made clear by Jihong Dao before the mobilization began.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the merit level of Yan Thirty-One, new privileges were unlocked.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, some small benefits.</p><p></p><p>One could apply for a free visit to certain famous places in the Wanxian Alliance, such as the Divine Treasure Museum seen before.</p><p></p><p>They could also apply for cross-regional level transfers for their position.</p><p></p><p>If He Zhenghao had this privilege initially, he wouldn't have had to bother with Oracle Zi, Jing Xuandaoren, and others; he could have directly transferred to Tianyu State.</p><p></p><p>Besides this, what Li Fan valued more was the decryption of some taboo information.</p><p></p><p>Many pieces of information that couldn't be searched for before were now visible to Li Fan in the Tianxuan mirror.</p><p></p><p>For example, the information on the Wanxian Alliance's entrance exam held every ten years.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes glittered as he noted down the upcoming test questions anchored nine years later.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan voraciously browsed through various pieces of information, two days swiftly passed.</p><p></p><p>On the last day of rest, Li Fan received a communication from Gu Youguang and Xiang Liu.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had looked around but hadn't seen Li Fan's figure in the Qianxing Branch Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a bit worried, they inquired about his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan responded that he was well, at the last moment, he returned to the celebration venue.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qianxing Branch Courtyard, the lights were brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>The place was bustling with people, lively and busy.</p><p></p><p>"Feeling a bit tired, so I went to rest for a while. Please forgive me," Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu and Gu Youguang both nodded repeatedly, showing understanding.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's a pity," Gu Youguang shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What do you mean?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu continued, "Friend, you're not aware. Yesterday, the renowned 'Ethereal Fairy' from the Wanxian Alliance came to express condolences."</p><p></p><p>"Friend missed the opportunity to see her beauty, which is truly regretful!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Youguang also agreed, "The Ethereal Fairy, unmatched in beauty, is rarely seen. My collection of images cannot capture even a fraction of her charm. That level of beauty surpasses what words can describe. Only by seeing it with your own eyes can you understand the true extent of her reputation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought it was something significant, only to realize it was about a woman.</p><p></p><p>He laughed dismissively, "I’m an old man at death’s door, why should I care about this?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Youguang's tone turned solemn, lowering his voice, "If Friend had the chance to meet her, it might present an opportunity to change one’s fate."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, you understand."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu noticed that the topic might not be appropriate and quickly changed the subject, "Friend, what are your plans for the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qi has already publicly disclosed the overall progress of the Locking Spirit Array within the Wanxian Alliance’s territory. Practitioners involved in the construction of the Five Element Great Cave Paradises can freely choose their next targets."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he took out a crystal that looked like a jade slip from his storage ring and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>Upon examining it, Li Fan was somewhat surprised. "The construction progress is so fast."</p><p></p><p>Compared to what he had seen from Huangfu Song more than two years ago.</p><p></p><p>The current state of the Locking Spirit Array construction task revealed that it was almost completed, with an overall progress close to 95%.</p><p></p><p>"It's because of those opposing voices causing a commotion."</p><p></p><p>Gu Youguang shrugged, "The recent wave of opposition against the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array is becoming increasingly fierce. In some places, there have even been incidents of armed forces blocking the construction. Although they were immediately suppressed, it also shows the dangerous nature of the situation."</p><p></p><p>"To prevent long nights with many dreams, everyone is going all out during this time, without a moment's rest."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Liu also sighed deeply, "I really don't understand why some people have such strong opposing views."</p><p></p><p>"If they were to witness the power of the Locking Spirit Array within the Five Elements Cave Paradise, they would definitely change their minds," Gu Youguang earnestly stated. "Unfortunately, Senior Qi has made it clear that this is top-secret information and must not be leaked out. Otherwise, one needs to have a talk with them."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan superficially agreed, in his mind he quipped, "If those opposing individuals were to truly witness the might of the Locking Spirit Array, they might go as far as risking their lives to stop it."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, when the day comes that the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array is truly widespread, all doubts will naturally be dispelled," a voice suddenly rang out from near the three individuals, spoken by Qi Buyi.</p><p></p><p>Startled, Li Fan and the others hurriedly bowed to her.</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi waved her hand, seeming a bit tipsy likely from drinking a lot of spirit wine, her face slightly flushed.</p><p></p><p>Addressing Li Fan, she said, "Rest assured, the Wanxian Alliance will never mistreat those who have contributed. The matter of extending your lifespan has been approved, and treasures will be delivered shortly. If all goes well, the extra life span should be enough to support you until you break through the Yuanying stage."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xiang Liu and Gu Youguang were both delighted.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also showed a face full of gratitude, thanking Qi Buyi.</p><p></p><p>As they were talking, a ray of sunlight shone into the Qianxing Branch Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, dawn is breaking."</p><p></p><p>"Just like how this dark night will pass eventually."</p><p></p><p>"Under the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array, the Wanxian Alliance will surely embrace an incredibly bright future."</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi's gaze was dreamy but incredibly resolute.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the others exchanged glances and also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Just then, many pieces of information appeared in Li Fan’s mind out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>They were the experiences of the mysterious disappeared clone from before.</p><p></p><p>"Yuandaozhou, the missing ten years..."</p>

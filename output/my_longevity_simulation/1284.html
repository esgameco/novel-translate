        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1280: The Secret of Blue Feather Heavenly Capital (7K words)</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu spoke eloquently in the flying boat. At first, he was a bit stiff, but he became more and more certain as he spoke, as if what he had realized was the natural principle of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of the starry sea can almost be regarded as a superior substitute for the laws of the mortal world. Therefore, the key to our breakthrough is to find the [Dao of the Starry Sea] corresponding to our cultivation in this desolate starry sea. I believe that you all have the qualifications to achieve the Dao, and your aptitude must not be too weak. As long as you remove the fear of the starry sea from your heart, and instead maintain a normal state of mind, just like when you were in the mortal world, and quietly comprehend it, I believe it will not be too difficult to achieve this."</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu introduced in detail how he sensed his own Dao of the starry sea. When he was talking excitedly, an extremely frightened voice suddenly interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>It was Zimu, one of the survivors: "Old Guan, if... I mean, if the Dao I cultivate no longer exists in the starry sea, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Zimu stared closely at Guan Xingxiu: "Does it mean that the way forward is cut off and I can't go any further?"</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu was silent.</p><p></p><p>The other Dao achievers present also had different expressions after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Some had pale faces, while others were extremely relieved.</p><p></p><p>Because they also found that perhaps due to the various catastrophes that destroyed the immortal world back then, the laws of the starry sea were broken and incomplete.</p><p></p><p>It was not that their aptitude was insufficient to sense the Dao of the starry sea they belonged to.</p><p></p><p>But in the starry sea, this Dao had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, you can try to sense other laws and give it a try. After all, all paths in the world lead to the same destination." Seeing that some desperate emotions were beginning to spread, Guan Xingxiu hurriedly suggested after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But he was ruthlessly refuted: "If it were under the Dao, if it were other world cultivators, they might be able to do so. But we Dao achievers of the mortal world have already devoured the souls of heaven and earth, and our bodies are one with the laws. Hmph, how easy is it to change to another path?"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, among us, the one who is most likely to achieve the highest attainment is none other than Brother Lanyu." The Dao achiever named Qingshuang suddenly said something inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat instantly fell into silence, and everyone's eyes were focused on Lanyu.</p><p></p><p>As for Lanyu himself, he did not refute this point either.</p><p></p><p>It was because among all the Dao achievers present, or in the entire mortal world, he was the only one who was unique.</p><p></p><p>He was the only one who achieved the Dao through the ancient method.</p><p></p><p>Not being bound by the laws of the mortal world meant that in this desolate starry sea, Lanyu could use any law to comprehend the Dao and break through.</p><p></p><p>"I say, Brother Lanyu, could it be that you haven't shown any signs of breakthrough because there are too many choices and you're dazzled?"</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations in advance, Daoist Lan!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh! New law! Oh! Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>For a while, everyone reacted differently.</p><p></p><p>Lanyu had a solemn expression and casually dealt with everyone's words. But in his heart, he was indeed a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Because he did not sense the Dao of the starry sea in the void.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my aptitude is really so poor? Or is it because I'm really too old and have lost all my spiritual nature?"</p><p></p><p>Lanyu was a little dazed for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I seem to remember."</p><p></p><p>"I, Wu Fuqiu, seem to have a really mediocre aptitude indeed."</p><p></p><p>At that time, the immortal Dao was prosperous, and the Ten Sects stood tall. He was just an ordinary cultivator under the Ten Sects, one of countless. His natural talent was average, and he had no special encounters. Originally, the Golden Core realm should have been his limit.</p><p></p><p>But that day, a moment of curiosity completely changed his destiny.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, what's going on with such a big scene ahead?" Wu Fuqiu asked curiously, looking at the blocked air route ahead and the flying boats of different styles, comparable to the size of a city, flying over his head one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Shh, keep your voice down. If you disturb the [Respecting the Master Ceremony] of the Ten Sects, be careful not to know how you'll die."</p><p></p><p>The silence and awe-filled eyes of the people around made Wu Fuqiu even more curious.</p><p></p><p>It was not until half a day later that the grand parade fleet of the Ten Sects finally passed, and the air route was restored.</p><p></p><p>But Wu Fuqiu kept looking in the direction where the Ten Sects left, unwilling to leave for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After some inquiries, he learned that this so-called [Respecting the Master Ceremony] was a grand ceremony held by the Ten Sects of the immortal Dao every hundred years to thank the Heavenly Capital Great Master for his grace in bestowing the Dao. Important figures from the Ten Sects would all attend.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu didn't know who the Heavenly Capital Great Master was.</p><p></p><p>But the prestige of the Ten Sects that ruled the cultivation world was well-known to Wu Fuqiu, even though he was a wild cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Sects are already so powerful, so how powerful is that Great Master who bestowed the Dao upon the Ten Sects?"</p><p></p><p>"If I'm lucky enough to gain his appreciation..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu's mind was shaken. At the same time, an unprecedented ambition suddenly arose from his heart.</p><p></p><p>After much deliberation, he finally couldn't get rid of this demonic thought that lingered in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He set off towards the legendary Heavenly Capital.</p><p></p><p>After much hardship, he arrived outside the Heavenly Capital, but his hopes were instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Capital was nowhere to be seen, only a Source Dao Palace standing in the mountains, hidden in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>And at the foot of the mountain, it was crowded with young cultivators like him who came here with a glimmer of hope, seeking opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu was instantly a little confused.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Heavenly Capital was the Great Master's traveling palace. But what was this Source Dao Palace?</p><p></p><p>"You don't even know the Source Dao Palace? Where did this country bumpkin come from! The source of all laws, the first of all Daos. Even the personal disciples of the Ten Sects of the immortal Dao have to line up obediently here!"</p><p></p><p>"Think carefully! Who is the Great Master? How can you mortals easily see him? If you want to see the Great Master's heavenly countenance, you need to enter the Source Dao Palace first and pray devoutly. If you can catch the Great Master's eye, he will naturally lead you to the Heavenly Capital."</p><p></p><p>"What, you also want to go in? No problem, pay a thousand high-grade spirit stones, and you can go there to line up!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu was squeezed out by the latecomers who swarmed in, feeling lost.</p><p></p><p>Although his pockets were empty, Wu Fuqiu had no intention of leaving just like that.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that there were many people like him who couldn't afford the money and couldn't go up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>After getting familiar with them for half a month, Wu Fuqiu obtained an important piece of information.</p><p></p><p>That so-called Source Dao Palace was just built by the Ten Sects later. It had no actual connection with the real Heavenly Capital.</p><p></p><p>The real source Dao area referred to this large area below the Heavenly Capital. It's just that the Ten Sects enclosed a large part of it and built the Source Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't make it absolute, leaving this piece of land at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Master hasn't shown up for who knows how many years. They say it's easier to catch the Great Master's eye on the mountain, but it's just seeking comfort."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, the Great Master is high up in the ninth heaven. In his eyes, what's the difference between the top and the foot of the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Squatting on the ground, Wu Fuqiu also settled down at the foot of the Source Dao Palace mountain.</p><p></p><p>He stayed there for a full twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Some people came, some people left. Some died with regrets, some cursed the Great Master out of resentment and were beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu also went from a young man to a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what exactly made him persist in staying here.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps for a mediocre talent like him, it was the same wherever he went.</p><p></p><p>During these years, while guarding, he didn't neglect his cultivation. But without a source of spirit stones, he could only consume his reserves. Although the spiritual energy was dense in the source Dao area, it couldn't withstand so many people absorbing it at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he not make any progress, but there were also signs of regression.</p><p></p><p>With things coming to this point, Wu Fuqiu also accepted his fate and no longer held any unrealistic illusions.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he had been an orphan since he was a child, drifting without any support. After staying at the foot of this Source Dao Palace mountain for more than twenty years, he had long been accustomed to the scenery here. In his heart, he secretly regarded this place as his hometown.</p><p></p><p>Whenever young people came here full of hope, begging for the Great Master's grace, he just smiled without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he saw himself back then.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't shatter these young people's illusions either.</p><p></p><p>Because those who did so were all cleaned up by the people of the Ten Sects.</p><p></p><p>However, this is where the mystery of worldly affairs lies.</p><p></p><p>Just when Wu Fuqiu had completely put the Great Master's grace out of his mind...</p><p></p><p>Below the Source Dao Palace, thousands of cultivators were stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Someone shouted, the Great Master has manifested!</p><p></p><p>Then, in extremely excited and fearful emotions, a large number of cultivators knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Only Wu Fuqiu stood still due to his blank mind.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you disrespect the Great Master!"</p><p></p><p>A sword light, accompanied by an angry rebuke, flew from afar.</p><p></p><p>Just as Wu Fuqiu was about to be beheaded, at this moment, a blue feather slowly floated down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The white sword light was fast. Extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>The blue feather fell later. Swaying slowly, extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>However, a strange scene occurred. In front of everyone's eyes, this blue feather actually landed on Wu Fuqiu's body one step ahead of the white sword light.</p><p></p><p>The sword light arrived late, but it did not cut off Wu Fuqiu's head. It only passed through his body and instantly killed the three cultivators who were kneeling and worshipping behind him.</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Fuqiu himself...</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in blue feather light, he uncontrollably slowly ascended.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the exclamations of the crowd, he kept going up.</p><p></p><p>Passing the Source Dao Palace on the mountaintop, flying through the clouds, he arrived in front of a purple-gold Dao hall in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu felt like he was in a dream. He stood for a long time before coming back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled with excitement, even making Wu Fuqiu forget his manners and directly push the door open.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the imagined sacred Heavenly Capital, there was no one here.</p><p></p><p>Quiet and deathly still.</p><p></p><p>Only a faint chanting sound came from inside.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu followed the direction of the sound and cautiously came to the deepest part of the Dao hall.</p><p></p><p>The antique-style purple-gold wooden building emitted bursts of fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu knelt down and bowed, but after a long time, there was no response. He mustered up the courage to push the door open.</p><p></p><p>The scene inside the wooden building came into view.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, a child wearing blue and white Daoist robes stood with eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>The child had red lips and white teeth, with a delicate face, making it hard to tell if it was a boy or a girl.</p><p></p><p>But Lanyu noticed that this child seemed to have fought with someone. The Daoist robes on the body were actually somewhat damaged, and there were faint bloodstains attached to them.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu didn't dare to act rashly and knelt down to pay respects again.</p><p></p><p>But neither the phantom figure nor the child showed any reaction.</p><p></p><p>"This phantom figure should be the Heavenly Capital Great Master."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Wu Fuqiu mustered up the courage to stand up and also sat cross-legged like the phantom figure.</p><p></p><p>Carefully listening to the other party's continuous chanting.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>The blue feather that had fallen on his body and disappeared before suddenly appeared in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"Feather Transformation Technique..."</p><p></p><p>"In the endless eons of heaven and earth, countless worlds are born and perish, like feathers floating in the void."</p><p></p><p>"Transform the body into a feather, resonate with the world, follow the flow of eons, live and die indefinitely, traverse calamities, and eternally transcend..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu listened as if intoxicated, sometimes frowning, sometimes delighted.</p><p></p><p>This [Myriad Calamity Feather Transformation Technique] was really too profound for a small Foundation Establishment cultivator like him.</p><p></p><p>But even glimpsing a corner of it made him enlightened, and his inner realm continuously rose.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu was immersed in it, not knowing how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt the light and shadow in front of his eyes flicker, startling him awake.</p><p></p><p>He saw the child who was originally standing with eyes closed waving at him.</p><p></p><p>Although the child didn't speak, Wu Fuqiu understood that he was being asked to leave.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had countless reluctances, Wu Fuqiu could only silently retreat.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the purple-gold...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before the wooden tower, he politely closed the door.</p><p></p><p>Before the door fully closed, a stream of light flew out from within.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu instinctively caught it and discovered it was a miniature circular structure.</p><p></p><p>"It also has storage functionality."</p><p></p><p>After briefly examining it, Wu Fuqiu's face showed joy. </p><p></p><p>He kowtowed and bowed three more times towards the inside before finally leaving the Heavenly Capital.</p><p></p><p>Only at this moment did he realize that after leaving the Purple Gold Wooden Tower, he could no longer hear the voice of that seated illusory figure.</p><p></p><p>A sense of wistfulness welled up in his heart. Wu Fuqiu even suddenly had the urge to return.</p><p></p><p>But after all, that was a grand master of the Ten Immortal Sects. In the end, he didn't dare act rashly and left the realm of the Heavenly Capital.</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the mortal world, he was shocked to find that the Daoyuan Palace at the foot of the mountain had inexplicably disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Even the surrounding terrain had undergone immense changes, as if a great battle had erupted here.</p><p></p><p>Wu Fuqiu searched for a long time before finding a living cultivator nearby.</p><p></p><p>From the other party's respectful attitude, Wu Fuqiu was horrified to realize that he had unknowingly already become a top powerhouse in the Xuanhuang Realm - a cultivator at the Harmonious Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>And hundreds of years had already passed.</p><p></p><p>The rule of the Ten Immortal Sects was no longer as solid as before. An organization called the Myriad Immortals Alliance had risen...</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Blue Feather?"</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu's voice startled Blue Feather out of his recollection. </p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I'm just a mediocre talent who achieved the Harmonious Dao Realm by luck."</p><p></p><p>"Over these many years, the flattery from disciples and subordinates nearly made me forget this fact."</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather felt a sense of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"If my aptitude wasn't so poor, how could I, with the mighty [Myriad Tribulations Feather Transformation Art], only cultivate it to the Harmonious Dao realm."</p><p></p><p>"Without the Grand Master's teachings, in the span of thousands of years, I actually made no further progress."</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather inwardly shook his head, his thoughts returning to the present. He looked at Guan Xingxiu: "I believe in your judgment. Since the culprit is hiding among us, as long as we gather together and wait for him to expose a flaw, that will do."</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather paused, then said: "This person, immediately after his breakthrough, couldn't wait to commit murder. If it's not a psychological reason, then it must be due to his cultivation technique, causing him to require a blood sacrifice of other cultivators after his breakthrough. Going forward, he definitely won't stop."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone nodded, affirming Blue Feather's judgment.</p><p></p><p>To protect themselves, this group of Harmonious Dao experts from the Myriad Immortals Alliance henceforth always stayed together in the great hall of the [Revering the Honored] flying ship, mutually supervising each other.</p><p></p><p>However, the culprit's cunning completely exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Another corpse appeared on the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather and Guan Xingxiu exchanged glances, confirming the fall of [Purple Wood].</p><p></p><p>The pressure in their hearts instantly increased several fold.</p><p></p><p>"Old Guan, this time we were all together, right? Among everyone, your cultivation is the highest. Did you notice at all which dog dared to make a move?!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with everyone's hopeful gazes, Guan Xingxiu could only shake his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The great hall was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone calm down. Just now we were all focused on facing the void calamity, so we were caught off guard and the culprit took advantage again."</p><p></p><p>"What do we do next? If we don't hide from this calamity we die, but if we hide we get assassinated..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, in my view, we don't need to bother trying to hide from any calamity. At worst we all perish together!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, don't say such words in anger. Don't we still have so many people here!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I want to leave this ship!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the group's heated discussion, a sharp cry suddenly suppressed all other sounds.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather and the others looked over and saw Qing Shuang, who had been relatively calm before, suddenly seem to have a mental breakdown.</p><p></p><p>His expression was crazed, flashes of madness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, he charged out of the great hall, leaving the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!" Guan Xingxiu shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Only Blue Feather and a few others took action.</p><p></p><p>Inside the flying ship, for fear of damaging it, everyone's movements were restricted.</p><p></p><p>For a time, they were at a loss facing this seemingly crazed Qing Shuang.</p><p></p><p>Just as they reached an impasse, Qing Shuang's movements suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>His facial expression also froze as he stood there blankly.</p><p></p><p>Before everyone could react, Guan Xingxiu's expression changed. He immediately flew over to check.</p><p></p><p>"Dead."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he turned back and said with an extremely ugly expression.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the initial killings, this culprit's methods seemed to be getting more and more skilled.</p><p></p><p>Just now when facing the void calamity, that could still be used as an excuse. But now, everyone was clearly focusing their attention here.</p><p></p><p>Yet the culprit still murdered with impunity...</p><p></p><p>How could this be prevented?</p><p></p><p>Inside the flying ship, a deathly silence fell.</p><p></p><p>"I actually think Qing Shuang's words before he died weren't unreasonable." Sun Luchang spoke, breaking the stillness.</p><p></p><p>"From the current situation, this culprit's strength is growing too quickly. Perhaps before long, after slaughtering a few more, he won't need to act in secret anymore. He can appear openly and kill us off one by one. Staying on the ship is definitely a path to certain death. It's better we each abandon ship and seek life in the void."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luchang's words also gained the agreement of the other Harmonious Dao experts: "Not bad. This [Revering the Honored] flying ship's speed is extremely fast. As long as we leave separately at intervals, the relative distance between us in the starry sea will be very far. In the vast starry sea, even if he has heaven-defying abilities, he definitely can't catch us all in one go!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this place is still within the attractive force of the Immortal Ruins. As long as we follow the direction the force is coming from, we can return to the Xuanhuang Realm. Plus, each of us has a Void Brilliance Crystal magic treasure distributed by the Immortal Alliance. Returning safely isn't an issue."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With everyone chiming in, they slowly reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>In the end, over half the people chose to give up and disembark midway.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu looked at Blue Feather, seeking the opinion of this most senior Harmonious Dao expert.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather sighed lightly: "The heavens are vast, the earth is vast, but life is the most precious. Them making such a choice is understandable."</p><p></p><p>"To avoid more casualties, let's decide it like this."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Blue, you're not leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather shook his head: "My end is near anyway. Even if I return, I'll just be waiting for death. I might as well seek a thread of life in the void."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was greatly shocked. After expressing their well wishes, they left the flying ship one after another, returning to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Having their starry sea exploration journey cut short was a bit of a disgrace.</p><p></p><p>But it was still better than losing their lives.</p><p></p><p>After a flurry of activity, in the end only five people remained on the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Blue Feather, Guan Xingxiu, Sun Luchang, Xu Guanhai, Zi Mei.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu looked at Xu Guanhai with some surprise: "You actually didn't leave?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Guanhai chuckled: "I actually think, now that a large group has left, the flying ship is a bit safer."</p><p></p><p>Xu Guanhai looked at Sun Luchang: "Brother Sun, you're a bit strange. Before when everyone was clamoring to leave, weren't you the one shouting the loudest? How come you ended up staying instead?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luchang was a bit embarrassed: "My cultivation is too weak. I'm afraid if I leave the flying ship, relying on my own strength alone, it would be difficult to return to the Xuanhuang Realm. Staying here is actually safer."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They could see that what Sun Luchang said was indeed true.</p><p></p><p>Unlike them who volunteered, Sun Luchang was forcibly assigned to the flying ship by the Immortal Alliance. His cultivation was the weakest among them.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luchang edged closer to where Guan Xingxiu and Blue Feather were: "You two, among the few of us, is there really a culprit or not?"</p><p></p><p>The other four looked at each other, their expressions a bit subtle.</p><p></p><p>Before the culprit's identity was revealed, no one dared to guarantee anything.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've all decided to stay, then our originally planned route remains unchanged." After a moment of silence, Guan Xingxiu said loudly, "We can shrink the [Revering the Honored] flying ship's space to speed up our journey."</p><p></p><p>"Right, Xingxiu. Why is this flying ship called [Revering the Honored]? I always feel this name is a bit ominous."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Guan Xingxiu's words, Blue Feather furrowed his brows as if recalling something.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu was slightly taken aback, then replied: "I don't know either. It was a direct order from those transmitting the Dao. I guess it probably means [Going to Meet the Heavenly Honored]."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, Blue Feather's brows furrowed even tighter.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head to survey the flying ship and posed a question that made the other four present feel their hairs stand on end: "On this Revering the Honored flying ship, besides us, are there any other people?"</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be... right?" Guan Xingxiu said with some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zi Mei, who had been silent all along, suddenly spoke: "Perhaps? This ship... is alive?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luchang was startled and hurriedly asked: "Fellow Daoist Zi, what makes you say that?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Mei said softly: "I comprehended the Dao of the starry sea and watched the Harmonious Dao lives on the flying ship perish like ants. Thus I had a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"In my perception, this flying ship..."</p><p></p><p>"Seems to have its own life."</p><p></p><p>Zi Mei's words made everyone feel a chill down their spines.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu said with some hesitation: "If it's true, then the Immortal Alliance definitely would have..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Guan Xingxiu abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The golden Falling Star Divine Sword above his head shone with golden light. Guan Xingxiu gathered together all the black threads extracted from the bodies of the assassinated Harmonious Dao experts.</p><p></p><p>Before, he had already had this murder weapon come into contact with every cultivator present. No one had any reaction to it.</p><p></p><p>But uniquely, he had overlooked the ship itself.</p><p></p><p>The last five people on the flying ship exchanged glances and instantly reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>They formed a formation, trapping the black threads in the center.</p><p></p><p>"Old Guan, go to the flying ship's control hub." Xu Guanhai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>These words seemed to enrage the black threads as they frantically slammed against the seal trapping them.</p><p></p><p>The five Harmonious Dao experts joined forces, firmly locking it in place.</p><p></p><p>They made their way to the center of the [Revering the Honored] flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Guan Xingxiu took a deep breath and opened the flying ship's main control formation.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the formation floated an illusory image of the Revering the Honored flying ship.</p><p></p><p>As if guided by an unseen force, the black threads trapped by everyone uncontrollably drifted towards the illusory image in the main control formation!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the five people's faces turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the flying ship suddenly shook violently.</p><p></p><p>That thick black thread abruptly erupted with several times more impact force than before, instantly breaking free of everyone's restraints.</p><p></p><p>It returned inside the flying ship's illusory image.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the truth was already clear as day!</p><p></p><p>The culprit who had slain so many Harmonious Dao experts turned out to be the flying ship they were riding on!</p><p></p><p>This was an utterly unimaginable conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Even now with the facts laid out before them, Guan Xingxiu still found it a bit hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>"Why..."

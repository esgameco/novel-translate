            <p>Chapter 1052: Opportunity in the Abyss Prison</p><p></p><p>In the private small world of the Dharma Transmitter Zhou, almost all were lone survivors whose clans had been massacred. Those like You Chisong, whose family was still intact, were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Although they all understood You Chisong's background, they wished they could drag his entire family to be buried with him.</p><p></p><p>However, after all, it concerned everyone's life and death safety, so the followers of the Dharma Transmitter Zhou still had some reservations about You Chisong.</p><p></p><p>Including but not limited to: someone was always watching You Chisong, never letting him be alone. You Chisong was not clear about the secret method to open the passage to the private small world, so every time he entered and exited, someone else would take him along. He was not allowed to participate in key tasks. He was only arranged to start from the most trivial tasks...</p><p></p><p>Even though he was subjected to such discriminatory treatment, You Chisong still had no complaints.</p><p></p><p>Diligent and hardworking, willing to take on any task.</p><p></p><p>His performance was seen by everyone, and slowly, their attitude towards him gradually improved.</p><p></p><p>On this day, he finally had the opportunity to participate in the organization's real mission.</p><p></p><p>"The target of this mission is to infiltrate the [Abyss Prison] of the Myriad Immortal Alliance and rescue a senior who is suppressed at the bottom level."</p><p></p><p>"This senior was also a member of the Dharma Transmitters back then. However, because of his upright and unyielding character, he offended many other Dharma Transmitters. Five hundred years ago, when Senior Zhou left the Dharma Transmitter Council, he was also taken advantage of and thrown into the Abyss Prison."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance's Abyss Prison is located in the rift space of the central four states. It suppresses the most vicious criminals of the Myriad Immortal Alliance from ancient times to the present. They often have some special reasons and are still valuable to the Myriad Immortal Alliance, so they were not executed, just suppressed and guarded."</p><p></p><p>"The [Abyss Prison] is heavily guarded, but Senior Zhou has already arranged an inside response. We only need to pretend to be disciples from the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters, present the transfer order, and take the target out."</p><p></p><p>"Many functions of the Tianxuan Mirror are damaged, and the communication between the [Abyss Prison] and the Immortal Alliance headquarters has also been affected. We must seize this rare opportunity before the new contact verification method is established."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When the Myriad Immortal Alliance interrogates prisoners from the [Abyss Prison], they often use three teams of ten people, forming an array and traveling together.</p><p></p><p>You Chisong was selected as a member of the task force this time and was taught the tips for playing the role and the true escort array.</p><p></p><p>After more than half a day, they were already playing the role very well.</p><p></p><p>"The situation in the Abyss Prison is special. It's inconvenient for Senior Zhou to go, so we can only rely on ourselves this time."</p><p></p><p>"The mission is difficult and there is a possibility of failure. Everyone must be prepared to sacrifice at any time. If things are accidentally exposed, in order to prevent soul search, everyone must immediately remove the restrictions in their souls. Better to perish in both form and spirit than to let the Myriad Immortal Alliance get a bit of information!"</p><p></p><p>"If anyone is hesitant or unwilling, you can withdraw now."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, no one spoke.</p><p></p><p>So the plan was initially set.</p><p></p><p>After the mission begins, they will leave the small world. They will not carry any items with personal identification on them, so Li Fan will also lose his sense of this group of people.</p><p></p><p>However, at the beginning of the monitoring, Li Fan had sneaked into the You family and stolen a drop of You Chisong's natal essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the blood connection, Li Fan still vaguely locked onto You Chisong's location.</p><p></p><p>Quietly following behind.</p><p></p><p>Thirty people's cultivation</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The squad of thirty men were all dressed in black clothes that Li Fan was extremely familiar with. Even the aura emanating from their bodies was as cold and murderous as the orthodox black-clothed cultivators of the Wanxian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Transmitter Zhou does indeed have some tricks up his sleeve."</p><p></p><p>Following all the way, they arrived at a deep valley at the intersection of the four central states of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The leading black-clothed cultivator took out a jade seal, which emitted a white light, shining into the deep valley.</p><p></p><p>The sea of clouds immediately parted from within, and the squad of cultivators entered one after another without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, did not follow them in, but only observed from afar.</p><p></p><p>From below the deep valley, the so-called underworld prison, Li Fan vaguely sensed a trace of dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>His goal was not to break into the prison. He just needed to wait outside for them to complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>The mission seemed to be carried out exceptionally smoothly.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, the sealed sea of clouds opened up again.</p><p></p><p>The squad of thirty men flew out from the sea of clouds with an old man with white hair locked in the center.</p><p></p><p>At first, it seemed quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Later, the speed of their escape became faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>"Once we leave the affected range of the rift, open the small world passage immediately!" The leading black-clothed cultivator suppressed his inner excitement and transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, the white-haired Transmitter they had rescued did not seem to have any emotional fluctuations about his newfound freedom.</p><p></p><p>He just kept his eyes tightly closed, ignoring everything in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The situation was urgent, and the group had no time to explain. They just took the white-haired old man and fled at full speed.</p><p></p><p>When they finally retreated to a safe boundary and were about to use their techniques to open the small world passage.</p><p></p><p>"Who goes there?" At this moment, the leading cultivator's gaze swept towards Li Fan's position, and he let out a shout.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a white sword light suddenly rose and slashed towards Li Fan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>His accomplices also reacted one after another. In an instant, they unleashed their full strength without any reservation. Spiritual energy overflowed, and all kinds of magical techniques and moves were thrown at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, what made them terrified was that all the attacks were absorbed and disappeared without a trace the moment they approached the enemy, like a muddy ox entering the sea.</p><p></p><p>Not even half a ripple was stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are you?" The leading black-clothed cultivator asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly revealed his figure, ignoring him.</p><p></p><p>"The real Transmitter Zhou is already dead!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Li Fan's words, the dozens of people escorting the white-haired old man all trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>The disguised murderous aura was gone, and instead, they became somewhat panicked and chaotic.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The leading cultivator was also unable to hide the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly reacted and hurriedly tried to explain to the white-haired old man.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, don't be deceived by this person! I have Senior Zhou's token here!" As he spoke, he took out a red knot to prove his identity.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the confrontation between the two groups of real and fake people, the white-haired old man, who had been watching the show, finally opened his eyes at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He first glanced at the red knot and snorted coldly, "What token..."</p><p></p><p>"You think I would fall for such a clumsy trick? It's not the first time you've tried to pull this off."</p><p></p><p>"If Zhou really instructed you, why didn't she come here in person?"</p><p></p><p>The leading black-clothed cultivator was instantly at a loss for words, not expecting the white-haired old man to think this way.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man then sized up Li Fan and shook his head slightly, "You, young man, don't look like a good person."</p><p></p><p>"Zhou would never accept someone like you as her subordinate..."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man pondered, "Both sides are fake?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 695</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But what made Li Fan so solemn was only 【Tian Xuan】.</p><p></p><p>Although the square mirror in Huangfu Song's hand and the Tian Xuan mirror he had seen before were not exactly the same, the familiar aura emanating from the mirror made Li Fan almost certain that it was definitely related to the Tian Xuan mirror.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Huangfu Song nervously said in a low voice, "Dongfang brother, be cautious. Despite this small mirror looking inconspicuous, it is a great creation almost exhaustively researched by all the outstanding battle formation masters of the Wuxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Quantum Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed slightly, while Dongfang Yao was still puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Impatiently, he said, "Don't beat around the bush. Just say it clearly."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song, not angry, gently stroked the 【Quantum Mirror】, somewhat nostalgically saying, "Explaining it in detail might be too much for you to understand. Just know that this item is a batch of treasures constructed with the core of battle formations using the original material of the 【Qing Xuan Mirror】."</p><p></p><p>"It can be viewed as a portable Tian Xuan Mirror fragment. What's more crucial is that the user almost has complete control authority."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Dongfang Yao widened his eyes, "Tian Xuan Fragment Mirror? Such a treasure, I must try it!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he reached out to grab the Quantum Mirror in Huangfu Song's hand.</p><p></p><p>However, something unexpected happened. Although his hands clearly touched the square mirror, they passed directly through it, like a bamboo basket fetching water, coming up empty.</p><p></p><p>"Fake?" Dongfang Yao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Huangfu Song proudly tossed the Quantum Mirror in his hand, saying, "Such treasures naturally have a worthy holder. Without the permission of the Immortal Alliance, even if an ordinary cultivator luckily obtains it, they simply cannot touch it."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan, who had been silently observing, finally spoke up, "Brother Huangfu, being able to borrow such a valuable item must have cost a significant price."</p><p></p><p>"However, how does this Quantum Mirror benefit us in exploring the White Mist?" Li Fan looked at Huangfu Song, frowning as he asked.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song no longer beat around the bush and explained, "The Quantum Mirror, as the name suggests, can measure the heavens and earth. In the vast White Mist, even cultivators' divine sense cannot penetrate far, relying solely on luck to explore. But if you use this Quantum Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song smiled, "Everything within a hundred zhang is clear at a glance. Even with the White Mist obstructing, it remains so."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that I exhausted my accumulated merits over the years and only managed to borrow this inferior Quantum Mirror from Chief Ji. If it were a superior one, it could instantly detect everything in a radius of thousands of miles." He said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"A radius of a hundred zhang is already extraordinary. With such a handy tool, our exploration of the White Mist this time will surely be twice as effective." Li Fan couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song added, "The Quantum Mirror is akin to the Tian Xuan Mirror, so reporting discovered information does not require accumulation for later settlement. Instead, after the Quantum Mirror intakes surrounding area information, it records contributions in real-time."</p><p></p><p>"And there's this benefit?" Dongfang Yao exclaimed joyfully, "I was worried about the trouble and returning periodically. Now it's great; I can just charge straight into the White Mist."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not like you guys with money and power. Living hand to mouth, I can only rely on my own efforts!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao patted his chest and stomach, promising, "Anything needing action, just leave it to me. You guys just sit back and enjoy the show."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, "Brother Dongfang jests. If not for you, how could I have had the fortune to meet Brother Huangfu? Being able to explore the White Mist ahead of other cultivators, half of the credit goes to you!"</p><p></p><p>This statement brought a light to Dongfang Yao's face.</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, the three felt that everything was well-prepared and decided to set off immediately.</p><p></p><p>"In ordinary White Mist regions, the rewards will at most be contribution points. To obtain true generous rewards, we must find unknown labyrinth zones. Even with the Quantum Mirror paving the way, the White Mist's expanse makes it as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack. However, I heard Chief Ji mention that these labyrinths attract and merge with each other. So, around known labyrinth zones, there may be discoveries. I happen to know of a labyrinth named 【You Wen Huo Zi】 within the White Mist barrier of Tian Yu State. We might as well try our luck there." Huangfu Song suggested.</p><p></p><p>"You Wen Huo Zi? What kind of place is that?" Dongfang Yao scratched his head, curious.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that among the explored labyrinths, the danger level of this one is low. However, the characters inside cannot be fixed by any means and float in the sky like living beings. The scene is quite peculiar." Huangfu Song briefly introduced.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement. Dongfang Yao had no objections either.</p><p></p><p>So, the three operated the Pu Xian True Boat and, following Huangfu Song's guidance, plunged into the White Mist barrier.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the vast white mist, Huangfu Song tossed the Quantum Mirror overhead.</p><p></p><p>A faint blue light emanated from the Quantum Mirror and spread outwards. With the Pu Xian True Boat as the core, a circular area with a radius of a hundred zhang was formed.</p><p></p><p>Protected by the green light, Li Fan squinted. After a thorough examination, he found no abnormalities in his body, calming down.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this place has already been explored by others," Huangfu Song shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Just entering the White Mist barrier and being preempted is normal," Li Fan said, while in reality, his attention was focused on a massive map instantly appearing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Most areas on the map were vast white, but there were already some small dots and lines starting to occupy space.</p><p></p><p>Zooming in, a black dot marked his position.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by dark green, it vividly contrasted with the vast white surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Although we know that the region has been explored, what specific things are present within the area remain unknown."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>The Wuxian Alliance launched the White Mist exploration plan with clear objectives. Data on scenes within the White Mist were top secret. How could they easily let the cultivators acting as pathfinders know?</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song steered the Pu Xian True Boat, using the direction of the 【You Wen Huo Zi】 labyrinth indicated on the map, skirting around the dark green regions marked on the map. While making progress, they were earning contributions.</p><p></p><p>The vast white mist was like an endless sea.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the journey, besides the white mist, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan checked his contributions through the Quantum Mirror and found his points were increasing very slowly.</p><p></p><p>In three to four days, he had only earned a little over two hundred points.</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary cultivators, this earning speed might not be considered slow. But for me, it's useless."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Shuo Feng looks down on it."</p><p></p><p>In addition to contribution points, there was another type of point called 【Qing Xuan Points】, which could be used to exchange for special items.</p>

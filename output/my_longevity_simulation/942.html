        <h1>Chapter 942</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"What are you talking about, senior? What's wrong with me?"</p><p></p><p>"In the entire Xuanhuang Realm, besides me, there's probably no one else willing to play a thousand games of chess with you, right?" </p><p></p><p>Shengtai smiled and asked in return while placing a piece. This first move was directly placed in the "Tianyuan" position.</p><p></p><p>The disheveled old man's expression changed. He glanced at Shengtai, and his demeanor became extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"You little fellow, you clearly only have Yuan Ying cultivation. But your deduction ability is frighteningly strong. And you don't even try to conceal it, directly sitting beside me."</p><p></p><p>"You came fully prepared!"</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I was a bit happy. After so many years, I could finally satisfy my chess craving. Halfway through the game, I realized that I had fallen into your trap!"</p><p></p><p>The old man sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Shengtai just smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>The disheveled old man was named "Thousand Seeking Daoist". He was a veteran Harmonious Dao cultivator who had fallen in cultivation due to injuries.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what contributions he had made to the Immortal Alliance, but he actually carried a "Jing Fa Jade Tablet" on his body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, at this point in time, few people in the world knew about this.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the crowd, this Thousand Seeking Daoist was just an ordinary cultivator who was a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>Only more than ten years later, a mortal named Xiao Shengke encountered Thousand Seeking Daoist by chance.</p><p></p><p>After accompanying Thousand Seeking Daoist to complete a thousand days of begging together, he was gifted the Jing Fa Jade Tablet.</p><p></p><p>With a mortal body, he met Yan Fa Jue face to face.</p><p></p><p>He obtained the Harmonious Dao cultivation method and from then on strode on the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>This matter was often talked about with relish by later generations.</p><p></p><p>Shengtai naturally also sought out Thousand Seeking Daoist for his Harmonious Dao Jing Fa Jade Tablet. </p><p></p><p>However, a thousand days of begging was too long. So he deliberately used words to provoke the other party to play chess with him.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Seeking Daoist, his name was closely related to his cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Everything needed to be completed in a thousand increments and required someone to accompany him.</p><p></p><p>When he played chess with Shengtai, he was actually also cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The only limitation was that he could not take the initiative to mention the inside story to others. And when he completed a segment of "Thousand Seeking" cultivation, his appearance and aura would change as if he was a different person.</p><p></p><p>So everything could only depend on fate.</p><p></p><p>But Shengtai Li Fan was able to know about this matter in advance.</p><p></p><p>When the last piece was placed, Shengtai Li Fan lost by one move and ultimately lost to Thousand Seeking Daoist.</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, you at least knew to let me win one game."</p><p></p><p>Thousand Seeking Daoist cursed angrily. Although he won, he couldn't be happy no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But a surging aura emanated from the old man's body. </p><p></p><p>"Congratulations senior, you are not far from re-attaining Harmonious Dao!" Shengtai Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" Thousand Seeking Daoist didn't waste words and directly asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Jing Fa Jade Tablet."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Thousand Seeking Daoist directly threw over the jade tablet.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan to respond, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Shengtai put away the jade tablet, not minding. Anyone who lost 999 games in a row, and all seemed to be "narrow defeats" just one move short, would definitely be a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>Not making a move to teach a lesson could already be considered Thousand Seeking Daoist having high character.</p><p></p><p>"With the Hua Dao Stone's deductions, there are truly few in the world who can beat me in the Dao of chess."</p><p></p><p>Shengtai shook his head slightly and arrived at a remote place with no one around.</p><p></p><p>He directly used the Jing Fa Jade Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Before this, he had already settled his identity within the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>The entire process went without any unexpected incidents.</p><p></p><p>As usual, a disciple came to guide the way, and a doorway appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment of dizziness, he once again arrived at the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Looking around, the scene was not that of the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>In a hazy sphere of light, several silhouettes stood.</p><p></p><p>Fragments of conversation could be heard coming from within.</p><p></p><p>"This time, how confident are you?"</p><p></p><p>"I can only do my best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p></p><p>"That doesn't sound like something you would say."</p><p></p><p>"The difference in strength is too great, I can only risk my life and fight."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, you should go. Who knows if it will be a blessing or a curse."</p><p></p><p>The voice of one of the silhouettes sounded somewhat familiar to the Holy Fetus Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Yet it wasn't exactly the same as anyone he knew.</p><p></p><p>He knew this was an illusion caused by the influence of the Dharma Transmission Venerable when he first entered the Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, this time it was different from what his original self and his clones had seen before.</p><p></p><p>"Is one of these silhouettes the Dharma Transmission Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"And what does this signify?"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could ponder further, he felt the world shake and the scene shatter into layers.</p><p></p><p>He left the illusory realm and appeared in the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The guiding disciple was used to this, gave a simple explanation, and continued leading Li Fan towards the Dharma Derivation Orb.</p><p></p><p>The route was familiar, exactly the same as his experiences in previous lives.</p><p></p><p>Until he entered the inner area of the Dharma Protector Hall's headquarters, the announcement he heard greatly surprised Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Applicant for the use of the Dharma Derivation Orb, Fan Li."</p><p></p><p>"Number: 005. Authority level: Harmonious Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Please wait patiently here. Estimated remaining waiting time, three thousand six hundred and twenty-three days and six hours."</p><p></p><p>At first, the Holy Fetus Li Fan thought he had misheard. After hearing it again, he was startled.</p><p></p><p>"How can the wait be so long?"</p><p></p><p>Shocked and doubtful, he made a corresponding expression and couldn't help but ask the empty space.</p><p></p><p>"If you are unwilling to wait, you may leave on your own."</p><p></p><p>"Warning, leaving means voluntarily giving up the right to use the Dharma Derivation Jade Tablet."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, a voice finally responded in the space.</p><p></p><p>"I'm number 005, yet I need to wait for nearly ten years. How does that make sense?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not like I've never used the Dharma Derivation Orb before. How long can it take to derive a cultivation method? Someone must be misusing this public artifact for private purposes!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was not intimidated at all, instead he made a big fuss.</p><p></p><p>He seemed determined to get an explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Due to uncontrollable factors, the derivation ability of the Dharma Derivation Orb has been severely disrupted."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the waiting time has also been greatly extended."</p><p></p><p>"Please understand and cooperate, fellow cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Warning, this matter is a top secret of the Immortal Alliance, please be sure not to leak it."</p><p></p><p>That voice warned.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's expression changed slightly, but he did not restrain himself at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he shouted exaggeratedly, "What? The foundation of the Immortal Alliance, a wonder of the heavens, the Dharma Derivation Orb is actually malfunctioning?"</p><p></p><p>"What the hell are you Dharma Protectors doing!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a serious matter has occurred, not only have you not thought about how to solve it, you even deliberately try to conceal it?!"</p><p></p><p>"There must be a traitor among you!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I must make this matter known to all!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the Holy Fetus Li Fan's shouting, a figure slowly appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Expressionless, looking at the Holy Fetus Li Fan as if looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan instantly became serious: "Why don't you let me take a look, perhaps I have a solution."</p>

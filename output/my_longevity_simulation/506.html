            <p>But in a flash, he became somewhat discouraged again: "Achieving Golden Dan over Primordial Infant, I can't do it!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes were somewhat confused as he reached out his hands, muttering to himself: "No, I must see the Supreme Lord. New 69 Book 69shux.com I need to think of a way..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing him increasingly agitated, Li Fan couldn't help but speak up: "Friend Lu..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, he suddenly stood up. Ignoring Li Fan sitting beside him, he flew out of the restaurant, loudly shouting: "Lu Fan from the Wan Xian Alliance, Lu Fan from the Cloud Sea Martial Hall is here, who dares to battle me!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, Li Fan was stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The bustling streets of Weichang City fell silent instantly.</p><p></p><p>Only Lu Fan's bold figure stood proudly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, the crowd exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Merely a Golden Dan cultivator, dare to speak so arrogantly!"</p><p></p><p>"Are the cultivators of the Wan Xian Alliance all so audacious?"</p><p></p><p>"Since when did the dogs of the Wan Xian Alliance dare to be so arrogant in our Five Elders Association!" A burly Primordial Infant cultivator with a full beard and strong physique angrily flew in front of Lu Fan, ready to teach him a lesson.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan, not completely devoid of wisdom, shouted back, "I am Golden Dan, you are Primordial Infant. Are the members of the Five Elders Association all fond of bullying the weak with their strength?"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to fight, let the Golden Dan cultivator come forth!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan's voice, deliberately guided, quickly spread throughout Weichang City.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Primordial Infant cultivator's words were stuck, his expression changing rapidly, eventually coldly snorting and choosing not to attack.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the ground, he turned to the crowd and shouted angrily, "Are all the Golden Dan cultivators from Canghai Province dead?!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd began to react.</p><p></p><p>A young cultivator in blue robes flew forward, saying, "I am Qiu Juemo from the Luo Yan Gang, please enlighten me, Friend Lu!"</p><p></p><p>He bowed slightly, without waiting for Lu Fan's response, directly sending a flying sword straight towards Lu Fan.</p><p></p><p>The blue sword light was silent and suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lu Fan reacted swiftly, dodging the sword attack narrowly.</p><p></p><p>"You're attacking sneakily!" A hint of anger appeared on Lu Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"In a life-and-death battle, one must go all out. There's no such thing as a sneak attack! Be careful, friend!" With Qiu Juemo's shout, thirty-three sword lights separated from the flying sword already behind Lu Fan, forming a sword formation resembling a fierce tiger within moments, attacking Lu Fan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan snorted, emitting a faint copper-colored light around him, his body also suddenly expanding several times.</p><p></p><p>An abacus suddenly appeared in his hand, Lu Fan lightly flicked it, producing crackling sounds.</p><p></p><p>"The world is bustling, all for the sake of profit!" chanting incantations, every flick of the abacus caused a copper coin with a square hole in the center to appear out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, thirty-three copper coins took shape, emitting green light streaks in the air, heading towards the flying tiger sword formation.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Juemo's face slightly changed, sensing something amiss. He tried to control the sword formation to dodge the peculiar green coins.</p><p></p><p>However, the green light was extremely fast, almost disappearing upon contact with the flying swords.</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>"Uh-oh!" Before Qiu Juemo could finish speaking, the thirty-three flying swords turned and attacked him instead.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at a faster pace.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, thirty-three sword lights pierced through his body.</p><p></p><p>Blood gushed out, and Qiu Juemo stumbled, ultimately unable to hold on and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The flying tiger sword formation also lost control, falling to the ground one by one.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were amazed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's concede!" Lu Fan put the abacus behind his back, proudly declaring.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qiu!" Qiu Juemo's friend hurried forward to check on his condition, realizing that Lu Fan had left him a lifeline at a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>"So embarrassing! Get him out of here!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, his defeat was too quick!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qiu Juemo's severe injury did not elicit sympathy from the others present. Instead, they kept mocking him, full of scorn in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Juemo's friend blushed, knowing better than to provoke further anger, just helped Qiu Juemo and quickly left.</p><p></p><p>"I'll come!"</p><p></p><p>An ashy-clothed cultivator, with a tone filled with anger, soared up.</p><p></p><p>This time, he learned from the previous lesson and did not use any magical tools. He manifested a Golden Dan avatar, continuously summoning raging fires to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Wealth can communicate with gods!"</p><p></p><p>The originally red flames also took on a strange touch of green.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the flames originating from his own divine abilities also lost control, backfiring on himself.</p><p></p><p>In the end, with a scream, the ashy-clothed cultivator also miserably lost.</p><p></p><p>The second challenger's swift defeat reduced the clamor on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"This Lu friend is quite skilled." Li Fan, who had lost interest in the battle, couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>After a brief lull, another challenger appeared.</p><p></p><p>"I am Ou Qianye from Canghai Province, please enlighten me, Friend Lu!"</p><p></p><p>This time, Lu Fan did not immediately make a move but rather loudly questioned, "If you can't defeat the Five Elders, are you planning for a war of attrition?"</p><p></p><p>Ou Qianye's momentum stagnated, forcefully retracting the techniques he had already initiated. He said in a deep voice, "Friend, you rest for a while first, when you're fully recovered, we'll battle again!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan ignored him, focusing on restoring his energy with closed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the two engaged in combat.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Lu Fan emerged victorious once again. However, Ou Qianye was no ordinary opponent, as his techniques and spells were endless.</p><p></p><p>Every move controlled by Lu Fan would be followed by another spell.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fan exerted considerable effort, barely winning the battle.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, skilled techniques!" After exhausting his moves, Ou Qianye, knowing his defeat, bowed and voluntarily conceded.</p><p></p><p>"Mutual respect..." Lu Fan's tone softened a bit this time.</p><p></p><p>Following this, the Golden Dan cultivators of Weichang City one after another challenged Lu Fan.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, all were defeated.</p><p></p><p>Even with breaks in between, Lu Fan, engaged in continuous battles, gradually appeared a bit pale.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed to sense something and couldn't suppress the excited look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Just as the attention of all of Weichang City was focused on the battle arena...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had lost interest in watching, found himself by a small stall on the street.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Secret History of Cultivation."</p>

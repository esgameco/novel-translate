        <h1>Chapter 1083</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether it was the Heavenly Sword Sect or the departing Emperor One's Demonic Beast Clan, the Xuanhuang Realm never heard any news about them again in the future.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's view, this was the escape method he would least consider.</p><p></p><p>The high walls separated the inside and outside of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Once outside the high walls, one would probably completely lose contact with the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>So whether the escape was successful or not could not be verified at all.</p><p></p><p>And under the huge energy fluctuations of the Rift, once it failed, there might not even be a chance to try again.</p><p></p><p>Neither the true body nor the avatar could "give it a try" to test the true feasibility of the Rift.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan had always had little interest in this method.</p><p></p><p>"Leaving through the Rift is undoubtedly a thorough escapist approach. The trial of the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate definitely cannot support such a plan."</p><p></p><p>"If I were the Xuanhuang Celestial Venerate, and a group of people preparing to defect appeared in the world, what should I do then?"</p><p></p><p>On the way following Xu Ke to Nanming Mountain, Li Fan carefully pondered.</p><p></p><p>The experiences along the way were similar to the illusions experienced before.</p><p></p><p>However, this time with Mr. Bai's wooden carving protecting his body, it was even more smooth and uneventful, arriving very successfully.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, under the leadership of the human body split by Emperor One, he visited the Myriad Beasts Assembly of the Demonic Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the ocean-shaking cheers of "Forever support Lord Emperor One" from the demonic beasts, the assembly concluded.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xu Ke also handed over the wooden box containing Emperor Two Li at Li Fan's reminder.</p><p></p><p>Emperor One's reaction and performance did not deviate.</p><p></p><p>After saying a bunch of obscure and hard-to-understand words, he split out a gray sphere and handed it to Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>"You may go now."</p><p></p><p>Emperor One immediately gave the order to send off the guests.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xu Ke suddenly spoke up again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Emperor One Beast was a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>But he still patiently waited for Xu Ke to finish speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how many of these demonic beasts present do you think are sincerely willing to follow you and leave?"</p><p></p><p>"Just for an illusory, currently signless so-called catastrophe, they have to abandon the paradise of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Emperor One's human body frowned, "I don't need their sincerity. I only need them to execute orders."</p><p></p><p>"If they really don't listen, I'll just devour them all at worst!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke smiled, with an air of an old man, "Just now, Senior said that in the infinite future, there are infinite possibilities. Then why are you so certain that the Xuanhuang Realm is doomed in this great catastrophe, and only by fleeing can there be a glimmer of hope for survival?"</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't you do something for this sliver of possibility?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's eyes were full of wisdom, as if shining, staring closely at Emperor One.</p><p></p><p>These words were obviously not something Xu Ke at this age could say.</p><p></p><p>And the silly bird sleeping soundly on his head...</p><p></p><p>was clearly not his idea either.</p><p></p><p>"So this is his intention?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor One naturally knew who sent Xu Ke here.</p><p></p><p>So he began to seriously ponder what was just said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Ke struck while the iron was hot, "Since back then, Emperor Three Mo was able to split from the demonic beast group and choose to side with humans,"</p><p></p><p>"Then today, naturally a portion can also be split between leaving and staying, to remain in Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"This is actually unstoppable in the first place. But with your words, it seems even more..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's just more formal." </p><p></p><p>Emperor One Beast glanced out the window at the various demonic beasts with different expressions, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Then you wait a bit before leaving."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Emperor One's human body slowly disappeared into thin air.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke and Li Fan looked towards the not yet dispersed venue.</p><p></p><p>Emperor One suddenly called out to more than thirty demonic beasts, including [Red Nine Heads].</p><p></p><p>Not knowing what was said, the demonic beasts first showed a look of panic, followed by disbelief and ecstatic joy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only felt Emperor One's gaze coming from afar, and then quickly shifting away.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>Above Nanming Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"What, you want us to listen to this little baby?"</p><p></p><p>Red Nine Heads, who had already transformed into human form, looked at the tiny Xu Ke and immediately showed dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The team was on the move, with a total of more than three thousand transformed demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke swallowed his saliva, and finally nodded seriously under Li Fan's encouragement: "Although Senior Emperor One agreed to your request to stay in the Xuanhuang Realm, the only condition is that you must obey my orders."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I won't make any disrespectful demands, just afraid that you will cause trouble in the territory of our human cultivators, so you must exercise more restraint."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Ke spoke, he took out a round plate from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the round plate appeared, the many demonic beasts who were originally exuding a fierce aura immediately became honest.</p><p></p><p>At least that's how it looked on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you have the Beast Wheel, you call the shots." Red Nine Heads said with a forced smile.</p><p></p><p>"But little baby, it's fine to listen to your orders. But there must be a time limit, right? We can't be your workhorses for the rest of our lives, can we?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I don't think we need to worry about that. This little baby can live for a few thousand years at most, while we demonic beasts can easily live for tens of thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Then we must keep a close eye on this little baby. Don't let him die so early!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Many in the demonic beast group joked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's face was tense, not affected by them.</p><p></p><p>After making a fuss for a while, seeing that Xu Ke was not getting angry, the demonic beasts immediately quieted down and focused on the journey.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the demonic beast group following the migration was far more than the three thousand or so on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Each different demonic beast basically brought their entire family.</p><p></p><p>Using treasure items similar to cave heavens to carry the tribes unwilling to flee the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>And along the way, there was news that demonic beasts who also wanted to stay in the Xuanhuang Realm kept rushing over to join.</p><p></p><p>By the time they were about to reach the Beast Taming Sect, the team had swelled to a huge size of ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Vast and mighty, demonic energy permeated.</p><p></p><p>Like a demonic beast army going to war.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Beast Wheel bestowed by Emperor One Beast suppressing the aura, and Mr. White's wooden carvings occasionally invoking the power of the Dao to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>It would have been enough to cause panic among the cultivators passing through the area.</p><p></p><p>Even so, when they finally reached the mountain gate of the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying demonic beast army still caused the unsuspecting Beast Taming Sect to be filled with dread.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack! Enemy attack!"</p><p></p><p>The tragic alarm sounded throughout the entire sect in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators brought their own spirit beasts and rushed from all parts of the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>"So weak, so weak!"</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that after our Azure Dragon lineage was domesticated by humans, it would become so weak!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I really wouldn't believe that demonic beasts would sincerely submit to humans!"</p><p></p><p>"There are many of us, why don't we..."</p>

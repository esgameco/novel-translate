        <div class="content">
            <p>It seems that the bodies were all his own corpses!</p><p></p><p>Even though Su Changyu prided himself on his firm will and being different from ordinary people, at this moment, he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat from this bizarre scene.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't be so nervous. They're just dead people, what's there to be afraid of."</p><p></p><p>"You should know, the living are much more frightening than the dead."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired monk said gloomily. </p><p></p><p>With a light point of his finger, a set of table and chairs rose from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Sit, and enjoy the view."</p><p></p><p>"No one has come here for many years."</p><p></p><p>After the initial horror towards the strange double voice and the frightening surroundings, Su Changyu gradually adapted.</p><p></p><p>Calming his mind, he sat down steadily. </p><p></p><p>"May I ask how to address Senior?"</p><p></p><p>After sitting down, seeing the white-haired monk only blankly observing the surroundings, Su Changyu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Yin Shangren."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, others call me Yin Yin Shangren."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren said with a hint of self-mockery.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings Senior Yin. I am Su Changyu." Su Changyu introduced himself neither humbly nor arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yin Shangren suddenly turned his head back and carefully looked over Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally moved his gaze away.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, there really is fate amidst the mysteries of the heavens..." Yin Shangren muttered under his breath.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu heard it in his heart but didn't understand the meaning.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Yin Shangren spoke again, "You also encountered a bottleneck in Establishing Foundation, and were guided by the opportunity in your heart to come here, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Establishing Foundation?" Su Changyu was startled. He had just reached late Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to deny it, he heard Yin Shangren say to himself, "Hehe, I'm used to it. Anyway, every few years, there will be cultivators guided here."</p><p></p><p>"Each time one comes, I have to repeat it. I'm sick of saying the same things."</p><p></p><p>"When immortals fight, the little ghosts suffer. Damn, it's so annoying I could die..."</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu frowned slightly. This Yin Shangren was a bit crazy, saying difficult to understand things. He didn't know the deeper meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll say it one more time then."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren also sat down and said, "The so-called Establishing Foundation is to build the foundation of the Dao. Then do you know what this foundation of the Dao is?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I used myself as a marvel to build the foundation of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>The body split in two, revealing another face amidst the internal organs and blood.</p><p></p><p>The two faces inside and out spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>Finally ending the elaboration with two eerily smiling faces.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu first stood up startled by the horrifying scene before him, then slowly sat back down seeing Yin Shangren restore to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Using myself to build the foundation..." Strange light flashed in Su Changyu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What? Tempted?" Yin Shangren asked with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao foundation perfectly overlaps with oneself, all divine powers and techniques belong to one's own body."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, no matter what secret arts or techniques, you'll master them as soon as you learn them."</p><p></p><p>"Punch unrivaled geniuses, step on hidden powerhouses..."</p><p></p><p>"Why not take action quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren looked at Su Changyu with a somewhat crazed gaze, saying full of temptation.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu rarely maintained his reason and calm, "Then, may I ask Senior, what is the price?"</p><p></p><p>"If everyone could easily 'use themselves to build the foundation', wouldn't geniuses be everywhere?"</p><p></p><p>"If everyone was a genius, then there would be no distinction between the mediocre and geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren laughed foolishly and pointed at the hundreds of corpses on the ground, "These are the price!"</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu didn't understand and could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"After dissecting hundreds of 'me's and having sufficient confidence,"</p><p></p><p>"I began to 'use myself to build the foundation' anew."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, it still fell short of perfect success by a tiny margin."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren explained with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"The human body is so exquisite and complex."</p><p></p><p>"How can ordinary people fully know themselves to build their foundation."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to do this completely by oneself without external help is a rare genius in the world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Changyu immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help feeling a bit dejected in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Those who know others are wise, those who know themselves are enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu was very clear about his own cultivation talent.</p><p></p><p>Definitely couldn't be called a genius at all.</p><p></p><p>Not even ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even using "mediocre" to evaluate would be no exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to "use himself to build the foundation" was even more impossible.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren saw the changes in Su Changyu's expression and chuckled, "Little Su, don't be discouraged."</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, you came before me, indicating everything is destined."</p><p></p><p>With that said, he extended his index finger and lightly tapped the center of Su Changyu's brows.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless scenes and knowledge frantically surged into Su Changyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Those were the scenes and insights of Yin Shangren dissecting hundreds of Establishing Foundation corpses.</p><p></p><p>And even more precious was the process and half-successful experience of "using oneself to build the foundation".</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly receiving such a vast amount of information, Su Changyu felt a bit overwhelmed for a time.</p><p></p><p>His temples kept throbbing, as if his head would split open.</p><p></p><p>But he knew in his heart that this fortuitous encounter was likely his only chance in this life to change his fate.</p><p></p><p>So he gritted his teeth and persevered.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he collapsed into the chair, his whole body drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a bit, Su Changyu mustered his spirit and deeply bowed to Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks Senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, no need to thank me."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren revealed an ill-intentioned smile, "Originally you had given up the idea of 'using yourself to build the foundation'."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've transmitted my experiences to your mind, it has given you the intention to give it a shot."</p><p></p><p>"You should know each person is unique. My situation definitely may not all apply to you."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps because of this, you will fail and perish in body and Dao."</p><p></p><p>"In that sense, it would be me who harmed you!"</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu said solemnly, "Life and death are a matter of fate, wealth and rank are up to Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's smile disappeared, "Good ambition indeed."</p><p></p><p>He said bluntly without courtesy, "If your business here is done, then scram!"</p><p></p><p>Not expecting the other party to suddenly give him the boot, Su Changyu was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>But since Yin Shangren had already said so, it wasn't good for him to overstay.</p><p></p><p>Bowing again, he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Before departing, looking at Yin Shangren's corpses covering the ground, Su Changyu couldn't help but ask, "Senior Yin, may I ask where these corpses came from?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren swept his gaze around, his eyes becoming a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, where did these corpses come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah! I remember!"</p><p></p><p>"There was a huge rain! Countless corpses fell from the sky like rainwater, so I took the chance to collect some..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren muttered a bit crazily.</p><p></p><p>Getting the answer, Su Changyu once again felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to stay any longer on this bizarre little island, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Watching Su Changyu's retreating figure, Yin Shangren slowly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>He touched his chest, seeming to hide some hard to part with treasure there.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A long time later, the extinguished flames reignited.</p><p></p><p>Completely engulfing Yin Yin Island.</p>

            <p>Li Fan remained silent. </p><p></p><p>Facing the glowing light in front, Bingyin pointed towards it, and the changing scenery blurred, revealing a part of the azure crystal within. </p><p></p><p>Under the dazzling light and a blue beam shining in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"You can try to invest a strand of your divine consciousness into it to see for yourself," Bingyin said confidently. </p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan's eyes flickered as he separated a wisp of divine consciousness. </p><p></p><p>The moment it touched the blue light. </p><p></p><p>The beam retracted. </p><p></p><p>Dizziness crept in, and Li Fan closed his eyes. </p><p></p><p>The next moment. </p><p></p><p>The divine consciousness suddenly returned. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan abruptly opened his eyes, somewhat bewildered. </p><p></p><p>As he sensed the memories from his divine consciousness returning, Li Fan couldn't help but feel speechless. </p><p></p><p>He was born in the "Era of the Great Plague," an ordinary foundational cultivator. </p><p></p><p>However, due to accidentally getting infected by the Immortal-Mortal miasma while buying alchemical materials in the market, his body weakened, and he suffered from dizziness. </p><p></p><p>Initially, he thought it was a problem with his cultivation method, so after taking an elixir, he forcibly closed himself off to meditate. </p><p></p><p>Who knew that the night after, when he woke up from meditation, his cultivation was completely lost, and he transformed from a prestigious foundational cultivator into an ordinary mortal without any spiritual power. </p><p></p><p>Unable to accept this drastic change and with his body growing increasingly weaker, under the dual blow, he passed away. </p><p></p><p>Survival time: seven days.</p><p></p><p>"The initial Immortal-Mortal miasma was quite terrifying," Li Fan reminisced about his brief life, furrowing his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the guide Bingyin. </p><p></p><p>"I want to try again," Li Fan said. </p><p></p><p>Bingyin smiled, not surprised at all. </p><p></p><p>After performing some hand seals, he summoned the blue light beam once again. </p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan was born in the "Era of Wasteland."</p><p></p><p>His original body survived the brutal fights in the Dark Ages as a deity transformation cultivator. </p><p></p><p>Hands soaked in blood, he trusted no one. </p><p></p><p>A lone wanderer in the wastelands, a bitter cultivator. </p><p></p><p>After replacing his identity, during a solo exploration of ruins, he finally obtained a valuable cultivation method after enduring countless hardships. </p><p></p><p>Thus, he began secretly searching for information on the soul of the heavens and the earth, attempting to break through to the deity transformation realm. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, despite being extremely cautious, for some unknown reason, news got out. </p><p></p><p>He was besieged by several cultivators in the wilderness and met his end in anger. </p><p></p><p>Survival time: three months. </p><p></p><p>As Li Fan came back to his senses, he carefully pondered over his encounters in these two lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>Then, he said to Bingyin, "Can I choose to start over with a blank identity?"</p><p></p><p>Bingyin seemed to understand what Li Fan was thinking, smiled at him, and gently pointed as the blue light beam shot towards Li Fan once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, his reincarnation was during the peak era of cultivation before the great calamity arrived. </p><p></p><p>With numerous sects flourishing, infant transformation cultivators were as common as dogs, and deity transformations were everywhere. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan was from a small mountain village within the jurisdiction of the Scarlet Flame Sect. Through the biennial "Ascension Assembly," he became an outer disciple of the Scarlet Flame Sect. </p><p></p><p>After working diligently for two years, he finally succeeded in reaching the Foundation Building stage. </p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to be promoted to an inner disciple and truly embark on the path of cultivation, a great war erupted between the Scarlet Flame Sect and the Nine Yang Mansion for the sake of a spiritual vein. </p><p></p><p>Despite being extremely unwilling, he had no choice. </p><p></p><p>As a cannon fodder, Li Fan stepped onto the battlefield. </p><p></p><p>Survival time: fifteen and a half years. </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you intentionally increased the probability of various misfortunes happening?" Li Fan looked at Bingyin skeptically.</p><p></p><p>Bingyin shook his head, "Everyone praises the path of immortality, but they don't know that in ancient times, beneath the feet of an ordinary cultivator, countless failures lie buried."</p><p></p><p>"I can see you still have some doubts. Nevermind, let me make you convinced." </p><p></p><p>Bingyin's expression turned slightly serious. </p><p></p><p>Moving his fingers, he exposed the blue crystal more within the surrounding glowing light. </p><p></p><p>From the crystal emerged a rhombus-shaped blue pattern that appeared in front of Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>"Please invest more of your divine consciousness and give it another try," Bingyin reminded. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded. </p><p></p><p>The moment his divine consciousness touched it, everything spun around wildly. </p><p></p><p>His consciousness split into a hundred parts, each entering different areas of the "era," experiencing various life journeys. </p><p></p><p>In the Era of the Great Plague, he barely survived the Immortal-Mortal miasma, but due to a violent outburst and massacring mortals, he triggered the miasma once more. His cultivation was lost, and he was stoned to death by vengeful mortals. </p><p></p><p>In the Dark Ages, he massacred all cultivators who shared the same cultivation technique, becoming the only surviving Gu King. He planned to hide in seclusion in a deep mountain cave but was inadvertently involved in a battle between two powerful beings and died unknowingly. </p><p></p><p>In the era of the newly passed law, he was one of the first lucky cultivators to hear about the Immortal Ancestor's teaching. Initially struggling with cultivation as a solo cultivator, his progress skyrocketed after switching to the new law. Thinking his cultivation path was smooth from there, he was unexpectedly attacked by a group of people who labeled him a "devilish outsider" and killed him without explanation. </p><p></p><p>In some unknown era, where Immortal Spirit Towers dotted every corner of the world, releasing pure spiritual energy day and night. The concentration of spiritual energy in the air was denser than that of the Heaven Profound Mirror post-enlightenment. All techniques were accessible through the Immortal Spirit Towers. If any confusion arose with the techniques, one could ask the immortal spirits in the tower for clarification or consult practitioners of the same technique. It was truly a paradise for cultivators. </p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because they were accustomed to it, or because it was inherent, the people living in that period were not particularly enthusiastic about cultivation. In that highly developed society, even with heightened cultivation, one had to abide by the rules set by the highest authorities. Even if one was a completely non-cultivating mortal, basic rights were respected. With such abundant spiritual energy around, all talent and treasures were merely mundane. With extremely extended lifespans, one could not see the end of life. Every desire could be easily fulfilled. </p><p></p><p>Over time, an inexplicable sense of emptiness began to occupy and erode the soul. </p><p></p><p>After Li Fan's reincarnation, he indulged in pleasures for five centuries, idled for another five, gradually lost his way for another five, and fell into despair for a final five hundred years. Finally, after surviving for over two thousand years, he laughed heartily, willingly bringing an end to his own life. </p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>Out of the over a hundred divine consciousnesses, except for the "Cultivation Paradise," the longest lifespan was forty-three years. The average survival time was just half a year. The highest cultivation reached early Golden Core stage, while the lowest died before even starting the path of cultivation due to an accident. </p><p></p><p>A hundred different paths of cultivation played out in Li Fan's mind. </p><p></p><p>As he gradually came back to his senses and all the scenes slowly vanished, he vaguely saw a blurry figure standing in front of him, whispering softly, "Remember, it's not the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance that needs you. </p><p></p><p>It's you who needs the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. </p><p></p><p>This era is the best era. </p><p></p><p>Without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>All the images shattered like broken glass, like streams of starlight, scattered throughout his consciousness. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, a blue light suddenly lit up at the center. </p><p></p><p>As if attracted, the starlight changed its direction and flew towards the blue crystal. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

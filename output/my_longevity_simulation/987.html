        <h1>Chapter 987</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tone of Baihua Daoren also sounded a bit uncertain. </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan furrowed his brows tightly: "You? Immortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>His tone was full of doubt.</p><p></p><p>Although he indeed found it a bit hard to gauge the other party's strength, there was definitely a big gap compared to the immortal experts in the Xuanhuang Realm. </p><p></p><p>At the very least, Li Fan did not sense a great threat from the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you don't think that by putting forth the title of immortal realm, you can fool me, right?" Li Fan said with a slightly displeased expression.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren let out a bitter laugh: "I have already fallen to such a state, how would I do such a meaningless thing."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, if still in the Wansheng realm, or even the other cultivation realms, I can indeed be considered an immortal."</p><p></p><p>"However, in the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren looked up at the sky, a trace of reverence flashing through his eyes: "After thousands of years, the world has changed. This heaven and earth has unexpectedly become so vast already."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, my homeland Wansheng realm is only about the size of the current five states of Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"And our Wansheng realm, among the many cultivation realms back then, was only mid-tier in scale."</p><p></p><p>"Even among immortals, there are naturally differences too." Baihua Daoren said somewhat helplessly. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang realm of the past, compared to the many cultivation realms, was also like a behemoth.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of continuous plundering and devouring, today's Xuanhuang realm has expanded by who knows how much.</p><p></p><p>As likely the only remaining cultivation realm in the Dark Star Sea, Xuanhuang indeed cannot be speculated using common sense.</p><p></p><p>And in such a vast world, the immortal emperors who defy the natural order and coexist with heaven and earth naturally have very terrifying strength.</p><p></p><p>It cannot be reasoned with common logic.</p><p></p><p>"Being born in Xuanhuang is truly a blessing and a curse." Li Fan felt moved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Baihua Daoren again, he estimated the other party's strength to be roughly equivalent to the stronger Harmonized Dao level in Xuanhuang realm. </p><p></p><p>"No wonder I find Fellow Daoist a bit weak." Li Fan said rather bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"I have fought against immortal emperors before. Fellow Daoist probably wouldn't last a few rounds against them."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren's expression couldn't be seen clearly, but judging from her slightly wavering golden figure, her mood was evidently not very good.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since Fellow Daoist's words have been verified, let's return to the Lingmu realm first. The Xuanhuang realm itself is under the constant surveillance of the emperors. Although Fellow Daoist's strength is a bit weak, your realm is after all still immortal. If you stay too long, I'm afraid there will be a risk of exposure." As Li Fan said this, he led Baihua Daoren back into the Lingmu realm.</p><p></p><p>And Baihua Daoren did not act rashly either. </p><p></p><p>Putting aside that their strengths were evenly matched and a fight may attract the covetousness of even stronger beings, more importantly, Little Liuli was still in Li Fan's hands. She was alone now and still needed the support of the Liuli Spirit Fruit for her future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Baihua, do you have a way to contact those survivors from the various realms back then?" In the Lingmu realm, Li Fan changed his appearance and asked amiably.</p><p></p><p>"I know what Fellow Daoist is worried about. But there's no need for concern. After so many years, that group of people have probably long perished in the immortal ruins." Baihua Daoren's tone was ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You're so certain?" Li Fan asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"So besides the Xuanhuang Realm, I have nowhere else to go now. We're all in the same boat, so there's no need for you to be so wary of me," Baihua Daoren persuaded earnestly.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he sighed at how the cultivation world had changed.</p><p></p><p>Back in their time, although there was inevitably some deception, it was never like this - being on guard all the time as if they were mortal enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the human heart is treacherous and one can never be too careful," Li Fan seemed quite accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>"Words are no guarantee. Whether it's letting you go or cooperating with you, I don't feel at ease..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Upon hearing this, Baihua Daoren thought Li Fan was still going to make a deadly move. His golden light body suddenly became a bit agitated.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Li Fan changed the subject: "Come with me, Daoist friend. You just need to bow before the statue, and we'll be on the same side. From then on, we'll be of one mind and purpose, with no need for mutual suspicion."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren was stunned: "Statue?"</p><p></p><p>His confusion turned into horror the moment he saw the faceless statue. </p><p></p><p>The golden light kept flashing, trembling like a young beast seeing its natural enemy.</p><p></p><p>He stepped back, exclaiming: "A True Immortal statue? How can there be such a thing here?"</p><p></p><p>"You've been deceiving me all along?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren stared at Li Fan, half in fear and half in resentment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also keenly sensed that the faceless True Immortal stone statue seemed to be exerting a vague suction force.</p><p></p><p>It wanted to absorb Baihua Daoren's Liuli golden light divine body into it.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so alarmed, Daoist friend? This is the Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal, quite different from the other immortals you know."</p><p></p><p>"Just take an oath with me, and I guarantee your safety!" Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his mind connected with the statue. In an instant, the prayer scenes of countless Compassionate Immortal believers in the Xuanhuang Realm appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And he himself seemed to be empowered by some force.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren let out a miserable cry, fleeing in panic, staring at Li Fan in terror.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred. He felt a faint trace of golden threads being stripped from Baihua Daoren's body.</p><p></p><p>They drifted in the air, attracted by the faceless True Immortal stone statue, slowly floating to Li Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>"Golden wish power?"</p><p></p><p>After absorbing it, Li Fan realized that the nature of this energy seemed extremely similar to golden wish power.</p><p></p><p>But it appeared more pure.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze fell on Baihua Daoren again.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's coercion, Baihua Daoren had no choice but to recite the oath with him.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the mental connection in Li Fan's mind instantly sensed Baihua Daoren's presence.</p><p></p><p>However, it was no longer a human form shimmering with golden light, but a lotus-shaped lamp.</p><p></p><p>"This is your true form now?" Li Fan frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes it is," Baihua Daoren's tone was no longer like before, but became very restrained.</p><p></p><p>"You're at the Eternal Life stage after all. Why are you so weak?" This time Li Fan was truly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, Li Fan felt a strong sense of grievance from the other party.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren glanced at the silently standing faceless statue, wanting to say something but stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Speak freely," Li Fan assured.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, even if not at the realm of the [Nameless True Immortal], is not far from it. I'm just a down-and-out Eternal Life being, how could I resist?" Baihua Daoren said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, it's just a stone statue. Is there a need to be so afraid?"</p>

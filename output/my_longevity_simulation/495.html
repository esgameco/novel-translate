        <h1>Chapter 495</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The main reason on the surface is due to the incident of the "Sudden Attack on Wanxian Island". Among the surviving cultivators within the Congyun Sea, Li Fan holds the highest position.</p><p></p><p>Due to unforeseen circumstances, the two God Transformation realm immortals, Ziyun and Hongxi, couldn't return, so the responsibility of acting as the island lord naturally fell on Li Fan's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no trace of joy in Li Fan's heart at being handed such a significant role out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading the handover instructions, his brows furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the position of a special contracted steward in the Hall of Martial Arts was just a nominal one, in terms of the rank of the position, it was indeed only suitable for cultivators of the Yuanying realm or above.</p><p></p><p>The rank was not low.</p><p></p><p>There was no issue with that. However, in the vast Congyun Sea, scattered around and not taken captive by the Five Elders Council, there were definitely many other cultivators within the system of the same rank as him.</p><p></p><p>Why did they specifically entrust this "important task" to him, Li Fan?</p><p></p><p>He didn't have any hidden background in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Was it a probe, a warning, or an attempt to pacify?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>However, since the order had already been issued, overthinking was futile. When the enemy comes, we must put up a fight and be prepared!</p><p></p><p>A hint of coldness flashed in Li Fan's eyes as he flew towards the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>As he reached the edge of the Shilinzhou, getting closer to the Congyun Sea, he once again encountered an invisible barrier blocking his way.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a communication charm, infused it with spiritual energy, and activated it. </p><p></p><p>A radiant "ä¸‡" character shot out towards the front barrier.</p><p></p><p>Ripples spread out, and Li Fan tried to extend his right hand. It felt as if there was an invisible substance sticking to his arm, changing shape as he continued to reach forward.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, it resembled a sticky bubble that burst. Deep in thought, Li Fan then rushed towards the invisible barrier.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Li Fan's true self had returned to the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Following the recorded location in the handover instructions, Li Fan flew at full speed. Four days later, he arrived at his destination.</p><p></p><p>A giant Dust-Transcending Boat, which looked very familiar, was silently hovering in the air.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, shadowy figures of many black-clad cultivators could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan flew towards the Dust-Transcending Boat.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the black-clad cultivators who came and went on the boat had already known about Li Fan's arrival and didn't step forward to hinder him.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li Fan, come to this place!" A voice resounded from inside the Dust-Transcending Boat as soon as he stepped onto the deck.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan headed towards the direction of the voice, discreetly assessing the black-clad cultivators around him.</p><p></p><p>They exuded a familiar aura of coldness and deathly intent.</p><p></p><p>They should be the souls of gods from the "Era" dealing with special affairs, the predecessors of the "Celestial Masters" that emerged after the establishment of the Xuan Network in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Not wanting to stir up trouble for now, Li Fan merely gave a casual glance before withdrawing his gaze and continuing inside.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he arrived at a room deep within the corridor and pushed the door open to enter.</p><p></p><p>A young man with white hair was sitting solemnly in front of a long table.</p><p></p><p>Many characters and images flickered rapidly on the long table.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly equipped with a function to prevent outsiders from peeking, all the things Li Fan saw were distorted and blurred.</p><p></p><p>"Island Lord Li, you've received the appointment letter, so I won't dwell on it further." Without looking up, the white-haired young man continued solemnly, "I want to emphasize three points."</p><p></p><p>"First, the reconstruction work must be completed within six months."</p><p></p><p>"Second, the budget for this project is limited, and you need to strictly control the overall material expenditure. If the actual costs exceed the approved limit and delay the construction progress, you will be held responsible. Of course, if you manage to complete the task on time, you will be duly rewarded!"</p><p></p><p>"Third, and most importantly..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the white-haired young man finally lifted his head, staring at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat when he noticed that the white-haired young man's eye sockets were empty and entirely black.</p><p></p><p>"There is no formal written explanation in the appointment letter. Once we leave this room, I will never acknowledge having said these words. However, this is something you must do. If there is any failure..."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired young man snorted coldly and lightly tapped the table with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>A stream of light flew out from the table towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his hand to block it, and at the moment of contact between the light and his body, it disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, some information appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Binding Phantom Array diagram." The white-haired young man seemed to sense Li Fan's confusion and explained, "With the diagram guiding you, you don't need to be particularly proficient in the formation, as long as you have some knowledge. As an ancient cultivator, this should not be a problem for you." Not allowing Li Fan to refuse, the white-haired young man preempted.</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you?" Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly and did not respond immediately but asked first.</p><p></p><p>After examining Li Fan with his ethereal gaze for a moment, the white-haired young man finally spoke, "First Eminent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze slightly sharpened.</p><p></p><p>This name, he had seen it before.</p><p></p><p>After three years of cultivation, he transcended from being a mortal to forming a Golden Core, defeating Yuanying and surpassing Transformation to achieve godhood.</p><p></p><p>Decades ago, at the pinnacle of Transformation, he abandoned the easily obtainable opportunity to ascend, solely because the heavenly soul was too weak, falling short of his expectations.</p><p></p><p>The legendary figure among cultivators, the Principled Prince.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long admired his reputation. However, he never expected to meet him in person today.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, having seen much of the world, Li Fan remained composed, courteous, and said with a bow, "So it is First Eminent confronting me!"</p><p></p><p>"Although it is an order from the Bureau of Arrangements of the Wanxian Alliance Headquarters, why should I inexplicably act as a stand-in island lord and set up the Xuantian Binding Phantom Array..."</p><p></p><p>"I am sorry but I cannot comply!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan firmly stated.</p><p></p><p>The First Eminent furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the space around him gradually becoming heavier, Li Fan remained unfazed.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "This matter is too suspicious, exuding a sense of conspiracy everywhere. Who can guarantee that the Wanxian Alliance will not turn around and harm the very donkey carrying the load?"</p><p></p><p>The First Eminent was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>With a slight smile, he eased his imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>"So, you are concerned about this..." he said.</p><p></p><p>Walking to the side of the room, the entirety of the ship wall instantly turned transparent.</p><p></p><p>As if standing in the clouds, the vast Congyun Sea appeared in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Island Lord Li originates from ancient times and may not be aware that since the Great Calamity descended, there have been entities called the 'Anomalies' emerging all over the world."</p><p></p><p>The First Eminent spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>"And a few places have the most frequent occurrences of these 'Anomalies'."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

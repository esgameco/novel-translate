        <h1>Chapter 1339</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a sincere look on his face: "Over these years, in order to find the former heroes of the Xuantian Sect, I have searched high and low, almost turning the entire Xuanhuang realm upside down...I was fortunate to find some traces of the Dharma Kings, but I never found any clues related to the Xuantian King. But I don't believe that with the Xuantian King's extraordinary cultivation level back then, he has truly fallen..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen listened quietly, his expression unchanged. </p><p></p><p>"Tens of thousands of years have passed, and the situation in the Xuanhuang realm has become increasingly dire, only a thread away from falling into the Immortal Ruins. If it weren't for the many arrangements left behind by the Xuantian King back then, we probably couldn't have lasted until now!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrangements from back then?" Mo Rushen narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Precisely the Great Formation of Floating Through Starry Space!" Li Fan said with deep feeling. "Built upon the ancient immortal formation, manifesting near-immortal power through mortal means! It's just a pity that the formation has long been incomplete..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned solemn: "Reactivating the Great Formation of Floating Through Starry Space may be the only way to save the world. This formation is profoundly mysterious - even though it was constructed tens of thousands of years ago, it is not something I can comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen snorted: "That's only natural, how could a mortal cultivator fathom the legacy of the immortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement: "First the ten great immortal sects fled collectively, then came the catastrophic wars of tens of thousands of years - so many legacies have been severed. The current level of formations, artifacts, pills and talismans in the Xuanhuang realm is probably not only not advanced, but far inferior to tens of thousands of years ago!"</p><p></p><p>"To rebuild and restore the Great Formation of Floating Through Starry Space, finding the Xuantian King is the only hope! But as I said before, there is not a single trace left. My life is nearing its end, I cannot wait any longer. With great reluctance, I had to awaken you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mo Rushen's pensive expression, Li Fan continued in a solemn voice: "From the memory fragments of Ji Yuxuan's residual soul, I also learned of the existence of traitors within the Xuantian Sect back then. So this act required immense determination on my part. I feared entrusting this to the wrong person could bring misfortune to the Xuantian King. Therefore, I chose to awaken you outside the void, far from the Xuanhuang realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Where were you when the ten sects besieged the Xuantian Sect back then? According to Ji Fawang's memories, you never left the Xuantian King's side!" Li Fan's tone gradually became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this cultivator from a later era interrogating him, Mo Rushen did not get angry. Frowning slightly, he recalled the events of that fateful day that changed the destiny of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I was leading the core cultivators of the ten sects into the inner depths of the sect."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen's words were shocking. Li Fan raised his eyebrows but remained calm, waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>Surprised by Li Fan's composure, Mo Rushen nodded slightly and went on: "Back then, Big Brother Xuanxuan had already sensed there were impure minds within the sect plotting with the ten sects."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, Big Brother Xuanxuan happened to have a breakthrough, so he decided to lure the snake out of its hole..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen paused and took a deep breath: "The plan initially proceeded smoothly. I successfully gained the trust of the ten sects and led them to secretly break through the protective formations of the Xuantian Sect's headquarters..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of regret flashed across Mo Rushen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"However, those formations could only delay them. The real killing stroke was Big Brother Xuanxuan's power after his breakthrough, and the deadly formation he personally laid. Actively dispersing the formations would actually lower their guard. But I didn't expect..."</p><p></p><p>"Run!" </p><p></p><p>It was as if he could hear the Xuantian King's final transmission again. Mo Rushen clenched his fists unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>"I heard Big Brother Xuanxuan telling me to flee quickly, so I knew something had gone wrong. I sped towards where his aura had vanished..."</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't the agreed ambush location, nor was it where Big Brother Xuanxuan usually cultivated in seclusion. It was just the main hall displaying the Faceless Immortal statue - a place Big Brother Xuanxuan had ordered sealed before."</p><p></p><p>"By the time I arrived first, Big Brother had completely disappeared. And that statue..." Mo Rushen fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Mo Rushen's account, Li Fan's heart shook violently. But he still feigned ignorance: "The Faceless Immortal statue, what is that? Why would the Xuantian Sect seal it away? After the ten sects unified the Xuanhuang realm, they erased everything related to the former Xuantian Sect. There seems to be no mention of this Faceless Immortal statue in Ji Fawang's remaining memories."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen studied Li Fan for a moment before explaining: "The Faceless Immortal was a true immortal who had once saved Big Brother Xuanxuan's life. When Big Brother Xuanxuan first entered the immortal realm, before he could form his true immortal body, he happened to encounter a catastrophe. If not for this Faceless Immortal's casual rescue, he might have fallen in the immortal realm back then."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slowly, then couldn't help asking with puzzlement: "From this perspective, this Faceless Immortal seems to be a good person. Why did the Xuantian Sect later order his statue to be sealed away, as if they were wary of him?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen gave a cold snort: "Good person...He was not some person, but a true immortal through and through. The same matter, viewed from the perspectives of a mortal cultivator and a true immortal, would produce completely different attitudes! Initially, Big Brother Xuanxuan erected the Faceless Immortal statue to express gratitude for saving his life, and also in hopes of contacting this true immortal senior he had only met in passing."</p><p></p><p>"If we could gain the help of this true immortal senior, it would certainly be easier to save the Xuanhuang realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The Faceless Immortal could casually rescue Big Brother Xuanxuan because Big Brother Xuanxuan had already embarked on the immortal path. Even though he had not yet formed his true immortal body, he was a genuine 'semi-immortal' - of the same kind as the Faceless Immortal."  </p><p></p><p>"But for mortal beings...even if it was an entire world of living beings, even if it just took a wave of his hand, the Faceless Immortal would be completely unwilling and disdainful to do so!" Mo Rushen said coldly and resentfully.</p><p></p><p>"He even went so far as to advise and warn Big Brother Xuanxuan..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen was filled with indignation. Li Fan also narrowed his eyes and breathed rapidly, feigning righteous anger.</p><p></p><p>"The divide between immortal and mortal is like a vast chasm. But no matter what, don't immortals also ascend from mortals? To be so indifferent as to not save those facing death!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen continued: "As the saying goes, 'Those of different paths do not scheme for each other.' After their disagreement, Big Brother Xuanxuan no longer contacted this true immortal and had the statue sealed away."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"He even planned to re-sculpt the statues of Xuantian across different regions."</p><p></p><p>"But before he could do that, the dramatic change occurred." </p><p></p><p>"Based on what you're saying, friend, it's very possible that Xuantian Wang encountered some mishap at the hands of the Faceless Immortal?" Li Fan asked in shock.</p><p></p><p>"An authentic immortal taking direct action - even with Xuantian Wang's supreme prowess, he likely could not have escaped unharmed, right? No wonder I haven't been able to find any trace of him all these years..." Li Fan seemed to suddenly realize, putting on an air of dejection.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin frowned, interrupting Li Fan's self-mutterings: "Though the Faceless Immortal had some ideological differences with Elder Xuanxuan, he had no reason to kill."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, though powerful, even an immortal could not instantly slay Elder Xuanxuan." Mo Rubin stated definitively. </p><p></p><p>"Elder Xuanxuan was already a demigod on the path to immortality. Before enacting his 'luring the snake from its hole' plan, he told us that after battling the Great Master, he would break through again. Even if not a true immortal in the past sense, he had sufficient power to cross the great barrier himself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shaken again: "Then what could it be that made the further advanced Xuantian Wang disappear without a trace?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan couldn't help but recall the previous life, when the cat sprite mysteriously appeared, swallowing the immortal's illusory form, before instantly taking away the true immortal of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The two situations were so similar!</p><p></p><p>"Could there really be some connection?"</p><p></p><p>"But Xuantian's change occurred tens of thousands of years ago. Adding my previous guess that time may flow differently inside and outside the barrier, if it was really the work of an outside force, to them it may have been tens or even hundreds of thousands of years ago..." Li Fan felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"But looking at it this way, the methods used by the outside forces to hunt true immortals have indeed advanced too much. Xuantian Wang was not an orthodox immortal, yet he still managed to send a warning when meeting misfortune. As for the immortal of the Ruins, he was a true immortal who had cultivated for tens of thousands of years in the Ruins, perhaps nearing the realm of the Nameless True Immortal. But the result was even more wretched." A sense of dread welled up in Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's inquiry, Mo Rubin could only remain silent in response.</p><p></p><p>If he knew the answer, he would not have been so apprehensive when hunted by the Ten Sects of Immortality, as if he had lost his backbone.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm also unclear what terrifying existence caused Elder Xuanxuan's disappearance, I'm certain he still survives in this world." After a long silence, Mo Rubin stated resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan raised an eyebrow, unable to understand Mo Rubin's such confidence.</p><p></p><p>"And that stone statue of the Faceless Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"It has grown a face!"</p><p></p><p>"The statue fell to the ground, its head severed and rolling aside. The lone stone head bore a face identical to Elder Xuanxuan!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin spoke words that left Li Fan dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The scene from back then surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" Li Fan asked in utter bewilderment amidst the fog.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin said solemnly: "Initially, we all thought the Faceless Immortal harmed Xuantian Wang. But later, during our days on the run, I felt something was amiss, for the reasons I mentioned before."</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards, I took the risk and found a remaining Xuantian statue. I tried using the methods Elder Xuanxuan taught to re-establish contact with this Faceless Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gasped: "Friend, you truly disregarded life and death with that act!"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Li Fan's praise, Mo Rubin continued: "True immortals generally do not bother with mundane ants like us. As expected, my first attempt at communication received no response."  </p><p></p><p>"But I did not give up. I persisted, continuously attempting contact for three full years, every moment without rest..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood Mo Rubin's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Even if disdaining ants, if an ant keeps pestering, a true immortal would surely be enraged and punish it. From what I know of the Faceless Immortal, he certainly had the ability to do so."</p><p></p><p>"Yet he did not."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if it were just an ordinary stone statue, with no response for three years."</p><p></p><p>"So I guessed that after that day, not only Xuantian Wang, but even the Faceless Immortal himself was severely injured!"</p><p></p><p>"The reason the Faceless Immortal's statue bizarrely manifested Elder Xuanxuan's face, even having its head severed..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said in disbelief: "Could it be because that Faceless Immortal took action to help Xuantian Wang avoid a calamity?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin nodded: "This is also why I firmly believe Elder Xuanxuan is still alive. Though on different paths, from what Elder Xuanxuan had revealed, he actually got along decently with this Faceless Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, they are of the same kind. Since there is precedent of rendering aid, it is not impossible for him to have helped again."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell silent for a long while.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he shook his head in denial: "This is merely your conjecture, friend."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought the adversary Xuantian Wang encountered back then was at most a fellow demigod. If it was a true immortal, or an even stronger existence that took action, the possibility of Xuantian Wang surviving would be far too slim!" Li Fan said dejectedly. </p><p></p><p>"It's hard to be convinced by your mere guesswork."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mo Rubin hesitated for a long time before finally adding solemnly: "It's not just blind guessing. My lingering connection with Elder Xuanxuan tells me that he is still alive in this world."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin spoke vaguely and obscurely. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan wanted to ask for more details, but Mo Rubin refused to elaborate further.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Profundity Pearl?" Li Fan guessed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you are so certain, then I'll believe you this once!" Seeing he could not extract more, Li Fan pretended to ponder before acquiescing.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I don't have many days left to live, so I'll just make one final gambit."</p><p></p><p>"From your words and actions, friend, you are certainly not the traitor of the former Xuantian Sect. Perhaps we can cooperate to search for Xuantian Wang's whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently at Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>"You know much about Xuantian Wang, but are very unfamiliar with the current Xuan-Huang realm. Tens of thousands of years have passed, the landscape transformed - the arrangements left behind by the former Xuantian Sect may have vanished with the changing rivers and mountains."  </p><p></p><p>"But over these years, I have thoroughly explored the Xuan-Huang realm and can directly lead you to the areas worth investigating, greatly increasing our efficiency."</p>

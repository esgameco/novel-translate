            <p>The woman, on the other hand, remained calm and collected, slowly retracting her fist: "Let's go back."</p><p></p><p>The representative of the Wufa'ng Martial Arts Group also showed a hint of fear in his eyes, following behind the peasant woman and slowly disappearing from the viewfinder's screen.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the peak Nascent Soul cultivator named Xu Jing from the Wanxian Alliance awoke from unconsciousness with a bewildered expression that the spectators snapped out of their shock.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! That old lady is so strong!"</p><p></p><p>"That punch seemed like it could extinguish the Dao itself!"</p><p></p><p>"Did any of you see clearly how she made her move?"</p><p></p><p>Including Li Fan, the spectators continued to replay the footage captured by the viewfinder.</p><p></p><p>However, even after slowing it down to the extreme, they still couldn't make out the movements of the peasant woman.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed like a blur, and suddenly, the shadow of a fist appeared. Xu Jing had already been overwhelmed by the punch and completely passed out.</p><p></p><p>"The peasant woman's three punches could shake the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>Even the commentator was shocked by this punch, and after a long pause, a sentence slowly appeared on the screen.</p><p></p><p>"Three punches from the peasant woman? Does that mean she still has two more punches to unleash?"</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, the first punch easily suppressed Xu Jing, a talent like him. If all three punches are unleashed, who could resist?"</p><p></p><p>"Shuofeng is definitely out, how about Di Luwu?"</p><p></p><p>"Di Luwu's speed is too fast; the peasant woman might not be able to harm him.  Visit new69book.com for more."</p><p></p><p>"I doubt that."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the crowd discussed, the first day's competition came to a close.</p><p></p><p>The final result of a tie seemed to set a good tone for this "friendly exchange meeting."</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, the results of the remaining competitions in Dao, Artefact, Formation, Pill, Talisman, etc., all ended unexpectedly in a tie, one after another.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere gradually became eerie.</p><p></p><p>If the competitions on the first and second days were a tie, one could still barely explain it as a coincidence. But continuous ties for six days, in all competitions...</p><p></p><p>The implications seemed intriguing.</p><p></p><p>It appeared as if the Wanxian Alliance and Wufa'ng Martial Arts Group had reached a certain agreement secretly, sending a signal of "peace" to all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>A signal of "peace."</p><p></p><p>On both sides, they seemed evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>Commencing another battle seemed difficult to determine a clear winner. At most, it might end in a mutual defeat.</p><p></p><p>In that case, was there still a need for fighting?</p><p></p><p>Hence, cultivators from all over the world began to realize. The so-called "friendly exchange meeting" was actually just a large-scale performance.</p><p></p><p>The final outcome was probably already predetermined, and every match might have been scripted.</p><p></p><p>However, spending one hundred contributions to watch the spectacle at least provided some entertainment. Visit new69book.com for more, allowing them to understand the process of the battles of the geniuses and perhaps gain insights.</p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of cultivators, it was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>This performance seemed to set the tone for "peace" in the future, finally bringing some stability to the minds of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After the conclusion of the friendly exchange meeting, discussions among the cultivators continued.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen those geniuses who stood out in this competition. They are strong, but not beyond our imagination. Now that I have reached the Nascent Soul stage, after my breakthrough, I might be able to fight them!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, take the nine-year-old Nascent Soul, Di Luwu, for example, he is still young. Observing his fighting style, it's just that he is a bit faster. On careful consideration, I might find a way to counter him."</p><p></p><p>"I also have this thought. It doesn't seem like an illusion, right?"</p><p></p><p>"We should strive harder in cultivation, and perhaps next time, we might also have the opportunity to perform and gain fame."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While cultivators everywhere thought they could excel again, Li Fan received a message from the Hongxi Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The real competition between both sides is about to start. Do you want to come and watch, kid?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a slight movement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"A real competition? What do you mean by that, sir?"</p><p></p><p>Hongxi replied with a lazy tone, "This friendly exchange meeting is divided into two parts, one public and the other hidden. Publicly, it's a predetermined performance-like competition."</p><p></p><p>"The participating sides cannot display their full terrifying strength. Now that the great battle is over, it's time to replenish with new blood. If it affects their enthusiasm for cultivation, it wouldn't be good."</p><p></p><p>"So, both sides didn't give their all in the competition."</p><p></p><p>"In private, however, there should be a real winner to reveal the true depths of each side."</p><p></p><p>"The whole process of the competition needs to be kept confidential, with only two long-distance viewing slots per region. Since Ziyun observed the event on-site, one spot is available."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately agreed. He also felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>He also found the performances of those geniuses somewhat disappointing. Although their techniques and skills were remarkable, none of them displayed astonishing great mystical abilities.</p><p></p><p>At the same level of power, not to mention compared to Li Fan, even Zhong Shen Tong, who wielded the Rainbow Light, might not secure a definite victory.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that there was something fishy going on.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arrived at the Ministry of Administration, where Hongxi was already waiting.</p><p></p><p>He lightly tapped the table, and the surroundings instantly changed.</p><p></p><p>From Congyun Immortal City, they moved to the peak of a cloud-covered mountain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was initially surprised, but seeing that Hongxi seemed harmless, he chose to observe for now.</p><p></p><p>"The competition is about to begin. Without commentary, how much you can comprehend depends on your own insights."</p><p></p><p>With that, Hongxi waved his hand, and in the distance, the clouds rolled, revealing a square seal.</p><p></p><p>The pattern on the seal seemed somewhat similar to the scenery of the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a radiance projected from the seal above, shining on the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, two figures suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Not only were their images truly lifelike, but even their aura and pressure felt substantial.</p><p></p><p>As if a huge mountain pressed down on him, Li Fan almost had to bend over, feeling suffocated.</p><p></p><p>With his internal cave heavens' power circulating slightly, not exerting all of his strength, he managed to alleviate the burden.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently at the two figures standing in the sky above the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Among them, one bore a striking resemblance to the previously seen nine-year-old Nascent Soul cultivator. Even their attire and weapons were identical.</p><p></p><p>However, this one appeared even younger, looking like a five or six-year-old child.</p><p></p><p>"Please enlighten me!" Speaking childishly, the figure seemed cute at first glance.</p><p></p><p>But when he moved his hand, it made Li Fan's expression change drastically.</p><p></p><p>He gently grabbed the empty space in front of him, and in an instant, thousands of silver rays descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>As the silver rays completely dyed the sky and earth silver, it seemed to transform the surrounding area into a realm under his control.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's perception, the area in front of him seemed to have become an independent world.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid my Binding Insect technique's effect will be greatly weakened inside here."</p><p></p><p>A sudden thought emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p>

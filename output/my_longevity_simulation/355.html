        <h1>Chapter 355</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A clear state of mind, observing like a passing traveler, rational analysis.</p><p></p><p>"Is this my instinct?"</p><p></p><p>"Faced with such an extreme situation, some people may choose to take risks and enter the white mist, seeking a glimmer of hope in the dire circumstances."</p><p></p><p>"Some may choose to survive at all costs, resorting to cunning tactics to eliminate others and gain an advantage."</p><p></p><p>"Others may choose death over harming their companions."</p><p></p><p>"I, on the other hand, subconsciously choose to hide and wait for others to finish their conflicts, then reap the benefits."</p><p></p><p>"This is the most optimal strategy based on the current situation and my past experiences."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone's choices are different. In my view, personalities vary, and there is no superior or inferior."</p><p></p><p>"This is what is known as the true nature of people."</p><p></p><p>"Purify the heart, purify the heart..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had forgotten about the imminent danger of the Magic Tide outside the base, as well as the impending dire situation within the base.</p><p></p><p>Lost in his thoughts, he seemed unaffected even by the minor attacks from the Magic Tide.</p><p></p><p>Time passed swiftly as Li Fan delved into his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>This was the fiftieth day after the outbreak of the Magic Tide.</p><p></p><p>Captain Leng still hadn't returned, prompting the decision to abandon most of the base's area of the Jiaxu Number stronghold in order to prolong survival as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Through discussions, it was decided to retain only some basic structures.</p><p></p><p>By doing so, it could reduce the consumption rate of the Black Death Rune by nearly half.</p><p></p><p>Although the active area would be significantly reduced, the trade-off for more surviving time was acceptable.</p><p></p><p>However, the camaraderie among the group seemed to have increased tension.</p><p></p><p>Despite maintaining a polite facade, there was an underlying current of suspicion and hidden intentions among them.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan gradually noticed the increasingly tense atmosphere around him, he finally woke from his daze, alerted by his instinctual warning signals.</p><p></p><p>With a swift scan around, Li Fan understood the current situation clearly.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, it was not uncommon to be trapped in desperate circumstances, where survival led to internal strife.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan himself, upon realizing his current predicament, felt the rise of killing intent within him.</p><p></p><p>This killing intent was his true self.</p><p></p><p>Unrelated to distractions, even the Xuanhuang Refining Heart Spell couldn't eliminate it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan deeply pondered on the continuous thoughts flooding his mind.</p><p></p><p>"To seek survival is human instinct. To kill for survival is in accordance with one's true self."</p><p></p><p>"In line with the true self..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan had a moment of realization, understanding what "refining the heart" truly meant.</p><p></p><p>"To attain longevity, one must go against the laws of the world."</p><p></p><p>"And to refine the heart..."</p><p></p><p>"Requires going against one's true self."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps all along, I have been practicing incorrectly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes gradually brightened.</p><p></p><p>"Following one's desires and crushing all distractions is merely scratching the surface of the Clear Mind Spell."</p><p></p><p>"To truly practice the Xuanhuang Refining Heart Spell, one must refine the true self."</p><p></p><p>"To resist one's instinctual choices..."</p><p></p><p>Contemplating this, Li Fan felt a sense of clarity, relieving the burden in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my accidental speculation was correct."</p><p></p><p>"Refining the heart in reverse."</p><p></p><p>"This method of cultivation is indeed quite unique."</p><p></p><p>"With this crisis at the Jiaxu Number stronghold, in order to refine the heart through this, I must go against my natural inclinations."</p><p></p><p>"The greater the difference from my true self, the more inner torment I will face, highlighting the effects of the Refining Heart Spell."</p><p></p><p>"The best choice should be..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan made a decision upon these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>And as the Refining Heart Spell operated more smoothly, it validated his assumptions.</p><p></p><p>"However, is it worth it to do so?"</p><p></p><p>"In comparison to other evaluation methods, the Xuanhuang Refining Heart Spell is superior to the Cloud Water Illusion Spell..."</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Li Fan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, in the discussion hall of the Jiaxu Number stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gathered everyone and presented his doubts.</p><p></p><p>"The feasibility of forcefully returning to the Eternal Immortal Stronghold? Master Li, why are you asking about this?" A guard named He Chen from the Green Yuan Army asked with confusion.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly realized and thought that Li Fan wanted to send people for help again.</p><p></p><p>His expression turned slightly unpleasant, but he still responded truthfully: "In recent days, the intensity of the Magic Tide has not weakened, but has shown a trend of escalation."</p><p></p><p>"With our current strength, if we were to cross the white mist in the Magic Tide, it would be extremely difficult..."</p><p></p><p>He Chen shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Another cultivator named Kong Yu from the Demonstration Martial Hall also directly negated: "Absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>"I know Cold Fellow's strength. If even he failed to seek help, we have no chance of success. It's better to wait until the intensity of the Magic Tide weakens before making a decision."</p><p></p><p>Others also tried to persuade.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit longer, maybe Captain Leng will return soon?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Li, let's not make rushed decisions. As they say, there is strength in numbers. Although our manpower is limited in the stronghold, we can still support each other. Splitting up now, if any unforeseen circumstances arise, we might not be able to handle it!"</p><p></p><p>Even the cultivators constructing the formation inside the stronghold, despite being at the Golden Core stage, called Li Fan "Master."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan always claimed his formation skills were ordinary and did not deserve the title of Master, he vehemently refused.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't change their way of addressing him.</p><p></p><p>Over time, he had no choice but to accept it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, faced with everyone's opposing opinions, Li Fan thought to himself, "Actually, my thoughts are the same as yours. Unfortunately, I have to conduct an experiment."</p><p></p><p>"I can only take a different path."</p><p></p><p>But he didn't argue with them, just waited for everyone to quiet down before staring at them with a stern expression.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivators started avoiding his gaze, Li Fan finally spoke solemnly, "My mind is made up, there is no need for further discussion."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Feigning restraint, they tried to persuade Li Fan again, but realizing they couldn't change his mind, they could only sigh.</p><p></p><p>While feeling fortunate, they all began to share their survival experiences in the Abyss with sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened attentively, taking mental notes.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, carrying the necessary supplies for twenty days of survival alone in the white mist, Li Fan embarked on the journey to Eternal Immortal Stronghold, under the reluctant gazes of everyone.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that perhaps touched by Li Fan's righteousness, He Chen from the Green Yuan Army decided to accompany him on his journey.</p><p></p><p>However, in admiration of Li Fan's nobility, Li Fan respectfully declined his offer.</p><p></p><p>As He Chen looked at him with admiration and touched by He Chen's eyes, Li Fan put on the Black Death Rune, identified the location of the Broken Palm Immortal City in the vast white mist, and turned into a stream of light, plunging in.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators at the Jiaxu Number stronghold watched Li Fan's disappearing figure with varied expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected to see such integrity in today's cultivation world. It shames us."</p><p></p><p>"For three hundred and forty-eight years, I have lived in vain. Only today have I seen such a person, what a pity."</p><p></p><p>"If Master Li does not perish, I swear to follow him as my guiding star from now on."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, everyone expressed heartfelt admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Humph!"</p><p></p><p>Only He Chen looked disdainful and left with a flick of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The others felt somewhat embarrassed by his reaction.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 788</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"To truly activate the reverse flow of time, predetermined anchors are needed. Let's take the three current anchor points on 69shu8.com, all set before Mr. Bai's resurrection."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he truly manages to wrest away the 'Reversal of Truth' from me, he cannot return to an era when he did not exist." </p><p></p><p>"Any new anchors he can use must be set after obtaining the 'Reversal of Truth'."</p><p></p><p>"So I only need to spread word of the existence of the 'Reversal of Truth' across the world before my death. Even if he succeeds in taking revenge."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai made a "death note" while imagining the scene after his own death. He hadn't felt this way for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Ever since awakening the "Reversal of Truth" at the brink of death in his first life, he hadn't contemplated facing death himself for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because it had not truly descended yet, he did not feel much fear in his heart. Rather, it was a jumble of emotions, even containing a fantasy of having narrowly escaped disaster.</p><p></p><p>It was the unknown future that caused his unsettled mood.  </p><p></p><p>In the past, no matter what perilous situation he faced, he never felt lost. Even if things were in utter chaos, he thought "no matter what, I can just use Reversal of Truth!"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the study he lived in as a mortal, or the summit of Departure Mountain, they were the safest harbors in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But now, a stretch of sea riddled with reefs and undercurrents suddenly lay outside the harbor.  </p><p></p><p>The slightest carelessness could lead to being smashed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While his thoughts wandered, the first "death note" was completed. On 69shu8.com</p><p></p><p>The so-called "death note" was actually an instantaneous, large-scale image created by the aberration after a cultivator falls, embedded with a wisp of his consciousness to act as a detonation or destruction switch.</p><p></p><p>"I need to bury them in corners of the Primordial Realm that even I don't know about beforehand."</p><p></p><p>"That way, even if the resurrected Mr. Bai wants to stop it, he won't be able to."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I still need to find someone trustworthy to do this."</p><p></p><p>Face after face flashed rapidly through his mind. Soon, he had an idea.</p><p></p><p>After making 108 "death imprints", Xu Bai left Longevity Valley and returned to Tianliang State to find his former superior, Nan Gong Shi Rong.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shi Rong initially thought Xu Bai had changed his mind and wanted to take up an official post again.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai's request left him taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"The Soul Reversal Tally? What do you need that for?" Nan Gong Shi Rong studied Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Reversal Tally was a prop from the Underworld Department that could trace a cultivator's reincarnation based on objects carrying their former aura, to prevent some people from "maliciously killing themselves" to escape due punishment through rebirth.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld is relatively independent. Even if I govern a state, I can't really talk to them." Nan Gong Shi Rong looked hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't speak and passed him a storage ring instead. Nan Gong Shi Rong suspiciously took and checked it, almost blinded by the massive pile of top-grade spirit stones crammed inside.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual scan revealed that exchanging these spirit stones for merit would amount to no less than three million!</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shi Rong couldn't help but gasp coldly. Although merit had inflated a lot due to the White Mist pioneering era and conquest of realms, with large amounts issued, three million merit was still an astronomical sum - a colossal fortune even for someone of his status.</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The leader of the state said it was the same way. </p><p>You should know that in order to continue advancing further, he also needs to handle various relationships. His funds are not very abundant at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Without making a sound, Nangong Shirong quickly put the storage ring back into his sleeve and said solemnly, "Don't worry, I'll take care of this! I'll give you an answer in less than three days!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Xu Bai left quietly with the Soul-Sealing Token.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, Nangong Shirong never asked him about the purpose of the Soul-Sealing Token. After all, some things are better not investigated too thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Tianliang State, he met Li Fan's true self halfway along the road. </p><p></p><p>After handing over the Soul-Sealing Token, they exchanged a glance and went their separate ways again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai returned to the Longevity Valley, meeting change with constancy.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, he began the final arrangements. </p><p></p><p>First, he contacted Dongfang Yao. This person was truly someone who valued friendship and righteousness. Li Fan had almost completely forgotten about Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>But during this period, he still hadn't given up on finding Huangfu Song's reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>It's just that it's as difficult as ascending to the heavens to interfere with the affairs of the Afterlife Department.</p><p></p><p>So after all this time, he still hadn't gained anything.</p><p></p><p>The two had been separated for a long time. But after meeting, Dongfang Yao still enthusiastically greeted him.</p><p></p><p>It's just that after receiving the Soul-Sealing Token handed over by Li Fan, he was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan told him the specific use of the Soul-Sealing Token, Dongfang Yao's body trembled: "This..."</p><p></p><p>"I know you have always been troubled by Huangfu Brother's passing. I am the same, never giving up all these years."</p><p></p><p>"This item was hard-won, you keep it well. Wait for Huangfu Brother's reincarnation, then you go find him."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao didn't expect that it was Li Fan who had fulfilled his long-cherished wish.</p><p></p><p>He was both surprised and delighted. </p><p></p><p>While feeling deeply moved, he also looked at Li Fan and suddenly noticed something unusual: "Huh? I go find him?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, what about you? Why don't you go together?"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he understood. No wonder the other party seemed a bit strange, with an air of entrusting something.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed slightly, and he immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan revealed a bitter smile and told the truth: "I have provoked a powerful enemy, my life is in danger."</p><p></p><p>"I may not even have the chance of reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao heard this and was shocked and alarmed.</p><p></p><p>If even the power of a Celestial Master could be affected, one can imagine how terrifying the enemy Li Fan spoke of must be.</p><p></p><p>But he merely hesitated for a moment before resolutely offering to help Li Fan, without asking the reason for the pursuit.</p><p></p><p>However, he was shaken his head in refusal by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It would just be a waste of your life. I can't bear to implicate you."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao wanted to say more but held back.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>"If you really want to help me, then..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Fan handed the storage ring containing 108 Soul Imprints to Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>"Help me bury these in secret, not too far from the heavenly cities of each state."</p><p></p><p>"Be very careful, don't let anyone discover them."</p><p></p><p>"If you do this, I may still have a chance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan transmitted these instructions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this item was related to the life and death of his friend, Dongfang Yao was also very solemn.</p><p></p><p>After a reluctant farewell, he immediately rushed towards the nearest heavenly city.</p><p></p><p>"Even if White Brother has my memories, from finding Dongfang Yao to clearing the locations of the buried Soul Imprints in his mind and then destroying them, it will still take some time."</p><p></p><p>"That should be enough for me to initiate my plan."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Capturing the heart and mind of a Hua Shen cultivator is no easy feat, even if the other party is an inexperienced virgin.</p><p></p><p>For half a year, Li Qing patiently played the role of an obedient disciple. </p><p></p><p>Except for occasionally frolicking with Si Ma Jing, he remained restrained and cultured at all other times, focusing only on diligently cultivating the Moonlight Hundred Transformations technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing himself was already exceptionally handsome. After achieving initial success in the Moonlight Hundred Transformations, the charm it brought overlapped with the effects of the "Incest Scripture". </p><p></p><p>Moreover, with his clever mind and unparalleled interpersonal skills, although he had just recently become a disciple, Li Qing had already become the most popular cultivator on Liuyue Peak.</p><p></p><p>As they interacted day and night, the female cultivators gradually forgot the fact that Li Qing was originally male.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, on this day, Li Qing, who had been holding back for a long time, finally waited for an excellent opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's master, the Great Elder of the Great Dao Sect, the Hedao cultivator Yang Nishang, was approaching the end of her life. She failed to break through to the Changsheng realm and passed away in her closed-door cultivation cave.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong was personally selected by Yang Nishang from the foot of the mountain and raised single-handedly. </p><p></p><p>The two had a mother-daughter like relationship.</p><p></p><p>Yang Nishang's death was a huge blow to Huo Jingtong.</p><p></p><p>Even when imparting Dao techniques to her disciples, she would suddenly become absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>And it was at this very time that the Great Dao Sect's Nine Veins Seventy-two Peaks Grand Competition began.</p><p></p><p>The ranking in the sect's grand competition not only affected the allocation of sect resources for the next hundred years, but was also closely related to the conferment of the Changsheng Fruit position.</p><p></p><p>One must know that even in the Great Dao Sect, one of the Ten Immortal Sects, the Changsheng Fruit position was extremely scarce and required many Hedao cultivators to compete for it.</p><p></p><p>Yang Nishang's ranking dropped in the previous century's grand competition because the Moonlight Vein ranked low. </p><p></p><p>So until her life ended, she never saw the day when the Changsheng Fruit position was granted to her.</p><p></p><p>This had become a knot in Huo Jingtong's heart, so she desperately wanted to achieve good results in the grand competition to comfort her master's spirit in heaven.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the strength of the Moonlight Vein was already at the bottom among the Nine Veins. And among the younger generation disciples, Zhao Ruoxi, who had the most outstanding potential and talent, had too short a cultivation time and could not yet take on a big role.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this grand competition ended with the worst results in the history of the Moonlight Vein.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, who appeared to only have a Foundation Establishment cultivation, was not yet qualified to participate in the grand competition. So it could not be blamed on him.</p><p></p><p>But after the grand competition, the depressing atmosphere of the Moonlight Vein from top to bottom did affect him.</p><p></p><p>Knowing shame and then courage, the Moonlight female cultivators put away their playful thoughts and began to cultivate diligently, striving to regain face in the next grand competition.</p><p></p><p>The sect's style became pure, and Li Qing's sweet talk became somewhat inappropriate and inconvenient to use.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong also underwent a change in temperament. Her preference for disciples slowly shifted from valuing appearance to valuing cultivation talent.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, she gradually became cold towards Li Qing, whose cultivation seemed to have stagnated.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing was not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>He knew that although there were many female cultivators with excellent talent on Liuyue Peak, there were no true peerless geniuses like Zhao Ruoxi who could shoulder the responsibility of reviving the vein.</p><p></p><p>So Li Qing was fully confident that when he revealed his true cultivation, he would completely reverse Huo Jingtong's impression of him.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just as Li Qing expected, the cultivation progress of the Liuyue Peak female cultivators could not meet Huo Jingtong's requirements.</p><p></p><p>Her temper became more and more irritable, often scolding and reprimanding.</p><p></p><p>The disciples did not dare to refute and could only lower their heads and admit their faults.</p><p></p><p>Punishment alone could not change the status quo.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere on Liuyue Peak became more and more oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Under the immense psychological pressure, Zheng Keyin, the personal disciple Huo Jingtong had high hopes for, failed to break through to the Nascent Soul stage and even damaged her cultivation foundation, ruining her future on the Dao path.</p><p></p><p>This incident made Huo Jingtong, whose emotions were already unstable, completely lose her composure.</p><p></p><p>She didn't even say a word of comfort to this former beloved disciple, leaving coldly with a sweep of her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The indifference in her eyes made Zheng Keyin feel utterly disheartened.</p><p></p><p>The disciples also felt a sense of "when the rabbit dies, the fox grieves" in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After a long deathly silence, Li Qing knew that the best opportunity he had been waiting for had finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>First, he helped the severely injured Zheng Keyin back and spent three whole days comforting her shattered Dao heart.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the pure Yin Qi in her body, he broke through to the middle stage of the Golden Core in one go.</p><p></p><p>Then he patiently waited for half a month.</p><p></p><p>When he was sure that Huo Jingtong had almost given up on her disciples and was preparing to go down the mountain to accept new ones, Li Qing secretly knocked on Huo Jingtong's door that night.</p><p></p><p>The restrictions on the door were lifted, and Huo Jingtong's cold voice came from inside.</p><p></p><p>"It's so late, what are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>"Master... I have some doubts about cultivation that I would like to ask for your guidance on," Li Qing said with his head lowered, looking extremely respectful and fearful.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong was silent for a moment. She did not open the door, but dismissed him, saying, "Go find any of your senior sisters. They should be able to answer your questions."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing did not leave.</p><p></p><p>Just as Huo Jingtong was feeling a little impatient, Li Qing suddenly spoke again, "Master, I'm afraid the senior sisters may not be able to resolve the doubts in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The door blasted open, and Huo Jingtong appeared in front of Li Qing in an instant, looking at him in shock.</p><p></p><p>For this exceptionally handsome little disciple, Huo Jingtong had rarely paid attention to him since the end of the grand competition.</p><p></p><p>After all, his cultivation was too low, and his talent was also average.</p><p></p><p>She never expected that it was this disciple she had neglected who had quietly broken through to the Golden Core realm!</p><p></p><p>How long had he been cultivating?</p><p></p><p>At most, not even three full years!</p><p></p><p>This kind of talent...</p><p></p><p>"Follow me!" A strange light flashed in Huo Jingtong's eyes as she grabbed Li Qing and pulled him into the room.</p><p></p><p>"A pure Yin body?" After carefully examining him, Huo Jingtong was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>When she first accepted him as a disciple, because she still had some disdain for him being a man-turned-woman, she did not examine him carefully, only roughly scanning with her divine sense.</p><p></p><p>She never thought that a man's body could also be a supreme Yin body!</p><p></p><p>"Master, is my cultivation speed a bit abnormal?"</p><p></p><p>"Too fast..."</p><p></p><p>"So fast that I'm even a little scared." At this moment, Li Qing, who had been observing her words and expressions, said in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huo Jingtong's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>She carefully examined Li Qing's progress in cultivating the Moonlight Hundred Transformations technique again.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that nothing had gone wrong, she suppressed the joy in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Yue comforted, "Don't worry. It's normal for true geniuses to have cultivation speeds beyond ordinary people's imagination."</p><p></p><p>"I hope he improves quickly, the faster the better," Huo Jingtong murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, have you revealed your cultivation progress to anyone else?" After a moment, Huo Jingtong reacted and hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"No. Except for you, Master, I haven't dared to mention this to anyone else. The senior sisters have been busy with their own cultivation recently, so they don't know I've reached the Golden Core stage," Li Qing honestly reported.</p><p></p><p>"Very good. Remember, from now on, don't easily reveal your cultivation level in front of outsiders," Huo Jingtong solemnly instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Under Huo Jingtong's personal guidance, Li Qing, who carried all of Huo Jingtong's hopes, received treatment vastly different from before.</p><p></p><p>Spirit stones and elixirs were abundant, and various cultivation technique manuals were provided to the greatest extent possible.</p><p></p><p>Even when Li Qing came to ask questions, Huo Jingtong would temporarily pause her own cultivation to patiently answer Li Qing's doubts, regardless of day or night.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, within half a year, Huo Jingtong's thoughts were almost entirely focused on Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Huo Jingtong a bit anxious was that during this period, although Li Qing's cultivation level did improve, compared to a true genius and the speed he had shown before, the difference was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I put too much pressure on him," Huo Jingtong could only think this way after carefully examining Li Qing's body again and failing to find the cause.</p><p></p><p>So she specifically approved Li Qing's request for leave to relax.</p><p></p><p>When Li Qing returned three days later, his energy and spirit all seemed a bit different.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his cultivation progress also surged forward in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the late Golden Core stage was not far off.</p><p></p><p>This made Huo Jingtong feel slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>But before long, Li Qing's cultivation speed slowed down again with an almost perceptible change.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing once again made a request to go out and relax.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong agreed on the surface, but in her heart, suspicions had already arisen.</p><p></p><p>Secretly following Li Qing, she unexpectedly saw a scene that made her face turn red, ears burn, and heart race.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Li Qing was embracing two of her female disciples, Han Haiyan and Sima Jing.</p><p></p><p>The room was filled with the joys of passion and the colors of spring.</p><p></p><p>They kept saying absurd and wanton words, making Huo Jingtong want to rush in and stop this unsightly behavior on the spot.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, Huo Jingtong endured it.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's face kept changing colors, but in the end, she did not interrupt Li Qing and the others' pleasure, and left with a swish of her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing sensed Huo Jingtong's figure leaving outside the room, and the corner of his mouth revealed an imperceptible smile.</p><p></p><p>His movements became even more intense.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, when he returned to Huo Jingtong, seeing her displeased appearance, Li Qing knelt down on the spot without a word.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple knows his wrongs!"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong snorted coldly, "What wrongs do you have?!"</p><p></p><p>"This disciple should not have lost his mind for a moment and done those absurd things with the senior sisters. But..." Li Qing said pitifully.</p><p></p><p>"But what?" Huo Jingtong glared fiercely at Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"But after finishing each time, I felt my cultivation speed becoming faster and faster. In order not to let down Master's expectations, I..." Li Qing's face was full of self-blame.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Qing's words, Huo Jingtong's heart couldn't help but jump.</p><p></p><p>After examining, she found that Li Qing was not lying.</p><p></p><p>The pure yin energy in Li Qing's body had become even more refined. When applied to cultivation, a month later, Li Qing successfully broke through to the late Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of cultivation speed..."</p><p></p><p>While Huo Jingtong was shocked again, her heart was also filled with doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that doing that thing is really beneficial to cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong, who knew nothing about this, couldn't help but feel a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>After secretly reading some scriptures, Huo Jingtong understood.</p><p></p><p>It must be because Li Qing's physique was extremely special!</p><p></p><p>Regardless of her intentions, Huo Jingtong had no reason to stop Li Qing's behavior.</p><p></p><p>So for Li Qing's actions of causing chaos on Liuyue Peak, she chose to turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>"As long as he can maintain this cultivation speed..."</p><p></p><p>"Not in a hundred years. Very soon, he will shock the entire sect."</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong was immersed in the fantasy of the Yuehua Lineage holding its head high.</p><p></p><p>He revealed his fangs to the female cultivators of Liuyue Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was already extremely popular among these female disciples.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had also become Huo Jingtong's treasure, as long as it wasn't too excessive, almost everything on Liuyue Peak was decided by his word.</p><p></p><p>In addition, with the help of female cultivators like Sima Jing who had already fallen into Li Qing's clutches, Li Qing didn't need to make much effort to coax these female cultivators into bed with a mix of deception and persuasion.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Qing was harvesting the yin essence of numerous female cultivators at a terrifyingly fast speed.</p><p></p><p>The benefits brought about were also extremely significant.</p><p></p><p>Three months after just breaking through to the late Golden Core stage, relying on this unimaginably pure and vast yin essence, Li Qing successfully formed his Nascent Soul and stepped into the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation speed could no longer be simply described as fast.</p><p></p><p>Even Huo Jingtong, who had witnessed Li Qing's cultivation progress from beginning to end, couldn't help but feel a sense of fear in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be able to understand the feeling of bewilderment in Li Qing's heart when he came to her door in the middle of the night back then.</p><p></p><p>Just as she began to waver in her heart about whether to continue letting Li Qing act so wantonly, she received an order from the sect, asking her to assist in investigating the incidents of spreading the Dao that were rising like sparks within the sect's territory.</p><p></p><p>Out of helplessness, she could only verbally warn Li Qing, and then hurriedly leave the mountain gate, hoping to complete the mission and return as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>But what she couldn't imagine was that without her presence, there was almost no one left on Liuyue Peak who could restrain Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qing no longer concealed himself, openly starting to wreak havoc on the remaining female cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, simply using the word "wreak havoc" was not accurate.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only did those female cultivators not resist, the vast majority of them even reveled in it.</p><p></p><p>Physiological and psychological factors were secondary. The most crucial point was that the female cultivators of Liuyue Peak discovered that after having a good time with Li Qing, their cultivation speed was a bit faster than before.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when the number of times was low, they didn't notice it.</p><p></p><p>But later on, as time passed, this difference gradually became apparent.</p><p></p><p>It could bring pleasure and benefit cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Who could refuse?</p><p></p><p>As a result, in just half a month, Liuyue Peak completely fell.</p><p></p><p>There was no longer any female cultivator who could escape Li Qing's clutches.</p><p></p><p>When Huo Jingtong returned, this was the situation she faced.</p>

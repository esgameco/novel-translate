        <h1>Chapter 431</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>These restrictions are highly likely to only be effective within the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>Because the cultivation techniques stolen by the Empire's thieves, although also subject to the restriction of not being able to cultivate together, are not as clear in sensing the location of those cultivating the techniques as in the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the restrictions are weakened.</p><p></p><p>This should be because the Empire is not within the original mysterious and yellow realm, but only in its affiliated small world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the method to solve this problem is becoming apparent.</p><p></p><p>That is, to sever the shackles and break away from the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>To become an independent small world.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary mortal civilizations, this may be an impossible task.</p><p></p><p>But for the Empire, which can control the power of exotic beasts, it is definitely worth a try.</p><p></p><p>When the first generation of lawbreakers crossed the Immortal Array and entered the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>The group of boundary whales meandering in the void had already attracted the attention of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>After hundreds of years of attempts and the sacrifice of countless warriors, the Empire finally succeeded in capturing an outlying boundary whale.</p><p></p><p>And subsequently, realized the commercialized breeding of boundary whales.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other exotic beasts, boundary whales utilized a unique method of [solitary reproduction].</p><p></p><p>Any individual in the group seemed to be able to produce offspring by absorbing unknown energies in the void.</p><p></p><p>However, before this, the Empire had not thought of using the boundary whale to break away from the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>The numerous and large-sized boundary whales in the Empire's possession primarily served as food.</p><p></p><p>Boundary whale meat was delicious and had the effect of improving one's physique if eaten consistently for a long period.</p><p></p><p>It was highly popular in the Empire.</p><p></p><p>However, since the plan to break away from the mysterious and yellow realm was established, the Empire ordered the protection of boundary whales and prohibited private consumption.</p><p></p><p>The entire nation rallied to cultivate boundary whales.</p><p></p><p>And once again, elite lawbreakers were dispatched to steal cultivation techniques from the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>Prior to this, the most advanced cultivation techniques in the Empire were only at the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p></p><p>Considering that a complete separation from the mysterious and yellow realm would require a reference after the Yuan Ying stage to derive advancements on their own, it would be extremely difficult without existing techniques.</p><p></p><p>So the Empire decided that it would be best to acquire cultivation techniques at the Harmony Path realm.</p><p></p><p>If that was not possible, they would settle for Divine Transformation techniques.</p><p></p><p>To achieve this goal, the Empire assembled over a dozen extremely loyal warriors to sneak into the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>To avoid the potential of complete destruction, they formed small groups, and except for group members, they were unaware of each other's identities.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Shaotang and Xiao Jin were originally part of the same group.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng was a replacement member who joined later due to an accident.</p><p></p><p>These three individuals had been steadfast in their mission throughout the years, accumulating contributions and attempting to exchange for Harmony Path cultivation techniques before returning to their homeland.</p><p></p><p>Until Li Fan appeared and apprehended them.</p><p></p><p>From Li Chenfeng's memories, Li Fan also learned that there were still debates within the Empire, above whether they should break away from the mysterious and yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>The biggest opposition had a simple reason.</p><p></p><p>If such actions were discovered, the Empire would bring about a catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Even with control over exotic beasts, what could they do against immortal swordsmen?</p><p></p><p>The Nine-Headed Divine Bird, with its head cut off, still stared at them in death!</p><p></p><p>Due to the natural fear of immortals, the opposition within the Empire was quite strong.</p><p></p><p>However, the ruler of the Empire, the Empress, forcibly suppressed all opposing views.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the ultimate lawbreaking plan could be implemented.</p><p></p><p>The Empress was the descendant of the first person to awaken the ability to control exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial Family of the Empire, with the surname Xu..."</p><p></p><p>Exotic Beasts, with the surname Xu.</p><p></p><p>These two terms appearing together made it difficult for Li Fan to not associate them with the situation he encountered with the Imperial Beast Sect's Xu Kelian in the Meteoric Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, it could also be just a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"I have read ancient records before. Inside the bodies of ancient demonic beasts, there existed such crystalline cores."</p><p></p><p>"Some cultivators could even absorb the energy within for their practice."</p><p></p><p>"I thought this had vanished, but unexpectedly, a small number of exotic beasts still retained this item."</p><p></p><p>The sword marks that continued for millennia were faintly related to the Imperial Beast Sect in the past.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit interested in this small world.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the future, I can spare some time to explore this Empire."</p><p></p><p>"But for now, the current matters are more important."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Li Chenfeng and the others who were deep in their dreams and lightly snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the beautiful dreams shattered, and the three returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>Initially filled with confusion on their faces, after looking around, they gradually came to their senses.</p><p></p><p>What they had just experienced â€” their successful lawbreaking, the Empire breaking away from the mysterious and yellow realm, developing their own traditions...</p><p></p><p>All of it turned out to be a dream.</p><p></p><p>"You are really bold."</p><p></p><p>Though Li Fan's words were softly spoken, they hit their ears like thunder.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng and the others instantly turned pale, feeling utter despair in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They were resigned to their own deaths.</p><p></p><p>The only thing they feared was the impact on their homeland.</p><p></p><p>When the immortal beings grew angry, the consequences would not be as simple as the death of thousands.</p><p></p><p>But sadly, now they couldn't even bring themselves to end their own lives.</p><p></p><p>However, what they didn't expect was that the powerful immortal before them would say something completely unexpected next.</p><p></p><p>"Very well! I admire you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded approvingly, releasing Li Chenfeng and the others from their bindings.</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other, but in the end, they did not dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Shaotang cautiously asked, "Senior, are you planning to let us off the hook?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and replied, "I didn't have any intention of investigating in the first place. The loss of cultivation techniques by the Ten Immortal Alliance has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>"It's you who have been overzealous. If I hadn't had some abilities left, it might not have been that simple to leave without a proper explanation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly and looked at Li Chenfeng.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Chenfeng quickly said, "It's my recklessness. Please forgive me, Senior."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Chenfeng even knelt down directly, ready to kneel and apologize to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan shook his head, stopping him.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for such formalities in front of me. Let's go, follow me to your secret chamber. I have something to tell you."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhu Shaotang and the others had a slight change in expression.</p><p></p><p>They never expected their supposedly secretive arrangements to be easily uncovered by this person.</p><p></p><p>Feeling uneasy, the three followed Li Fan into the secret chamber in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The following words from Li Fan dispelled their discomfort and brought forth a burst of joy.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they felt like they were given a new lease on life.</p><p></p><p>"Truth be told, I also come from a small world outside the mysterious and yellow realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan confessed slowly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 336</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"It is said that in the past, before the Blue Feather Immortal of Yuan Dao Prefecture fell, he stored his many years of treasures in different blue boxes and scattered them throughout Yuan Dao Prefecture, leaving them for destined people."</p><p></p><p>"And naturally, I am one of those destined people." Han Yi spoke to the two with a face full of pride.</p><p></p><p>"You may not believe it when I say this. At that time, I had just arrived in Yuan Dao Prefecture and was completely clueless about the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly, a blue box descended from the sky and flew in front of me."</p><p></p><p>"I thought it was some magic treasure of another cultivator and was startled. After coming back to my senses, no one showed up for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"Only then did I muster the courage to open the box."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought..."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi himself seemed amazed at his own luck as he savored the experience again, still clicking his tongue in wonder.</p><p></p><p>"You mean... such a treasure delivered itself to your doorstep?" Xi Men Yue was dumbfounded, pointing at Han Yi with a slightly trembling finger.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Brother Xi Men, there's no need to be so surprised. It's just happening to encounter a treasure while walking on the road. It's not a big deal, right?" Han Yi extended his folding fan and moved away Xi Men Yue's finger pointing at him.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "In my life, there have been ups and downs. I've had highs and I've had lows. Now, I can treat such matters with a calm mind."</p><p></p><p>Xi Men Yue opened his mouth but was at a loss for words. </p><p></p><p>He could only turn his head away and stop looking at Han Yi's face.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly recalled that when Cong Yun was setting up the fish earlier, he heard that this Han Yi once had all his family possessions swindled by a Foundation Establishment master and lived in utter misery.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he is not a person born with great luck. What caused his sudden turn of fortune?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it not just simply good luck?"</p><p></p><p>While pondering in his heart, Li Fan added Han Yi to the list of key observations for the next life.</p><p></p><p>He showed nothing on the surface, but spoke to comfort Xi Men Yue, "Brother Xi Men, you don't need to be so discouraged. Being able to obtain the Longevity Fruit shows that you also have extraordinary luck!"</p><p></p><p>"Extending life by 500 years is also an incredible treasure."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, where did you obtain this Longevity Fruit?" As he spoke, Li Fan casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"How can it be the same?" Xi Men Yue seemed somewhat dejected and very depressed.</p><p></p><p>"I obtained this Longevity Fruit after narrowly escaping death in the Liling Ruins of Tian Hua Prefecture. He had it fall from the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you think it's infuriating?" Xi Men Yue was about to say something more.</p><p></p><p>An abruptly appearing black figure caused him to stop his movement involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The face of the black-clothed figure was unclear, as if shrouded in a layer of black gauze.</p><p></p><p>But the chilling aura faintly emanating from him made Li Fan feel a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi and Xi Men Yue's expressions also instantly turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man sized up Li Fan and the others, then tossed a small round mirror into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The round mirror stopped in mid-air and shot out a beam of silver light, enveloping Li Fan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Some characters seemed to flow upward along the light.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the light beam disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man spoke, "Follow me."</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the small round mirror in the sky, and the circular edge of the mirror seemed to melt like ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>It spread outward in an instant, forming a rectangular portal before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Silver light flowed on the portal, and many images of buildings and cultivators appeared faintly within.</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed a bit familiar.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately associated it with the scene he saw when the Tianxuan Mirror's new surface was born in the Huanyu Branch Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Before he could think deeply, Han Yi had already taken the lead and flew in.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>There was no dizzying sensation of long-distance teleportation.</p><p></p><p>It was no different from ordinary flight, and he couldn't even sense passing through any portal.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan had already left Tianji Academy and arrived at an unfamiliar place.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, the path they came from had already silently disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dazed state of Han Yi and Xi Men Yue on either side, Li Fan took a deep breath to calm the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He carefully observed the scenery before him again.</p><p></p><p>The first thing that caught his eye was a towering statue of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the statues seen in other Myriad Immortals Alliance prefecture cities, at first glance, this Heavenly Venerate statue in front of him was no different from a living person.</p><p></p><p>Eyes closed and slightly lowered, with a profound and compassionate gaze.</p><p></p><p>The clothes on his body and the tall crown on his head.</p><p></p><p>Everything looked so real, with every detail vividly lifelike.</p><p></p><p>There was even a majestic pressure emanating from the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate statue.</p><p></p><p>Although not directly targeted, it still pressed on Li Fan's chest like a heavy stone, making it hard for him to breathe.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw this Heavenly Venerate statue, Li Fan inexplicably felt a great fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It almost made him instinctively want to call out to Huan Zhen and leave this place.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he suppressed it with great willpower.</p><p></p><p>Only after a long while was he slowly able to think calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept pondering, trying to figure out where the sudden fright came from.</p><p></p><p>It was a spontaneous warning from his body and soul, a pure instinctive reaction from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the reason, Li Fan chose to trust his intuition.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, Li Fan seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>But the answer he got was a bit unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Because when he suddenly saw this lifelike Heavenly Venerate statue, a sense of familiarity arose.</p><p></p><p>As if he had seen it before, his body's instincts spontaneously warned him.</p><p></p><p>Making him feel like falling into deep cold, unable to control himself.</p><p></p><p>"Familiarity?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Where does it come from?"</p><p></p><p>The shock on Li Fan's face was no longer an act.</p><p></p><p>He forced himself to overcome the fear in his heart and looked at the Heavenly Venerate statue again, searching for the source of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>When he looked again, that towering Heavenly Venerate statue seemed to have been just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>It completely disappeared from his sight.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan became more and more puzzled, he suddenly heard Han Yi's sigh beside his ear.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Venerate transmits the Dharma, all beings bow their heads. How magnificent this scene is, and how fortunate the cultivators present at that time were!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerate transmitting the Dharma?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that what Han Yi and I see are not the same?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xi Men Yue's words also rang out in a timely manner, corroborating Li Fan's judgment.</p><p></p><p>"The new law is established, the sky rains black blood, all things weep together. What a cruel yet beautiful scene..."</p><p></p><p>"I wish I could have been born ten thousand years earlier to personally experience it."</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the previous black figure appeared beside them from somewhere unknown.</p><p></p><p>"In this space, there is a trace of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's aura remaining. Cultivators coming here for the first time will have a mental response and experience illusions."</p><p></p><p>He explained softly.</p>

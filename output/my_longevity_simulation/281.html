        <h1>Chapter 281</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Everyone was stunned and shocked.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the man confronting Shen Yurou from afar, their minds were in a chaotic mess.</p><p></p><p>After painstakingly cultivating to the Deity Transformation stage, he scattered his cultivation and started over just like that?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that cultivation breakthroughs are as easy as eating and drinking?</p><p></p><p>[I Am Invincible] didn't take the shock of others to heart at all, but instead looked at Shen Yurou aggressively and asked, "What? You don't think that just because I'm at the Foundation Establishment stage now, I can't beat you?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, there was another uproar.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Foundation Establishment and Nascent Soul is like the difference between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>For a Nascent Soul True Monarch, killing an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator is no different from crushing an ant to death.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from what [I Am Invincible] said, although he was at the Foundation Establishment stage, he could defeat a Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p></p><p>How is this possible?</p><p></p><p>What shocked everyone was that Shen Yurou, with her long flowing hair and androgynous appearance, did not lash out when faced with [I Am Invincible]'s provocation.</p><p></p><p>She only gave him a wary look, snorted coldly, and did not refute.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to directly admitting [I Am Invincible]'s statement!</p><p></p><p>This Nascent Soul stage Shen Yurou might really be no match for the Foundation Establishment stage [I Am Invincible]!</p><p></p><p>The crowd of cultivators looked at the golden-armored man with different eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Yurou, who had lost face, suddenly smiled and said with a sarcastic tone, "Anyone in the Nine Mountains Prefecture with some access to information knows that you are the dear baby of the esteemed [Crimson Snow Immortal]. Let alone the Foundation Establishment stage, even if you were at the Qi Refining stage and stood still letting me make a move, I wouldn't dare!"</p><p></p><p>"If I injured you somewhere, and that person came knocking, our Ling Yuan Sect wouldn't be able to handle it!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the surrounding cultivators' gazes towards [I Am Invincible] changed again.</p><p></p><p>They all showed expressions of realization.</p><p></p><p>And Shen Yurou's words seemed to have hit [I Am Invincible]'s sore spot. His face instantly darkened as he stared at Shen Yurou.</p><p></p><p>However, Shen Yurou had no intention of continuing to entangle with him.</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her hand, smiled, and made a "please" gesture.</p><p></p><p>[I Am Invincible] gave her a cold look, but for some reason did not continue to provoke trouble.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he turned around and entered the mountain pass.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear and childish voice suddenly rang out from the crowd: "Wait, wait! I'm with him, let me through!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled and looked towards the voice.</p><p></p><p>They saw a little girl in red, only seven or eight years old, shouting and running quickly towards [I Am Invincible].</p><p></p><p>Behind her followed a middle-aged man with bronze skin, looking a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>The little girl was naturally Su Xiaomei, and the middle-aged man was Zhang Haobo.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei ran over to [I Am Invincible]'s side with short steps, patted his arm, looking like she had made it just in time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>She stared at [I Am Invincible] with those innocent big eyes, urging him.</p><p></p><p>[I Am Invincible] was a bit puzzled at first, sizing up this little girl who had appeared out of nowhere. He was about to say something.</p><p></p><p>But his expression changed slightly, and the words on the tip of his tongue instantly changed: "Alright! Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He showed a rather intrigued smile and entered the mountain pass.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo's expression was solemn as he followed closely.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watched them leave, all speculating about the identity of this little girl.</p><p></p><p>And Shen Yurou also had a gloomy expression, not knowing what she was thinking.</p><p></p><p>The Xishi Mountain pass was seven or eight li long, passing through the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have been forcibly excavated through the center of the mountain, with Ling Yuan Sect cultivators stationed at intervals.</p><p></p><p>[I Am Invincible] didn't ask about Su Xiaomei's background or intentions, and just focused on the journey.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhang Haobo transmitted his voice to Xiaomei: "Xiaomei, what are you trying to do? This person up ahead is not to be trifled with, why are you forcibly trying to establish a connection with him? Could it be just to save those two hundred spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei's steps paused: "What spirit stones! Am I that petty? Can you not always treat me like a child!"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, you're such an adult, why are you so timid."</p><p></p><p>"What 'not to be trifled with'... He's at the Foundation Establishment stage, and so am I. What's there to be afraid of!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo was a bit speechless after being retorted.</p><p></p><p>Your Foundation Establishment stage can't be the same as others' Foundation Establishment stage, right?</p><p></p><p>However, the somewhat rebellious Su Xiaomei not only didn't restrain herself, but instead went up and started asking this and that.</p><p></p><p>"Is your name really [I Am Invincible]? Why is this name so weird?"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of experience is it to become a Deity Transformation cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"The armor on your body just now wasn't bad, is it some treasure?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo listened from behind with a slightly pale face, afraid that [I Am Invincible] would be annoyed by Xiaomei and turn hostile.</p><p></p><p>However, although [I Am Invincible] did not answer Su Xiaomei's questions, he did not get angry.</p><p></p><p>There was even a faint, inexplicable smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo suddenly had some understanding.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the cultivation method Su Xiaomei practiced could detect the slightest emotional changes in the people around her.</p><p></p><p>Her previous behavior seemed reckless, but actually had no risk.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Xiaomei has another purpose? Indeed, she shouldn't be underestimated because of her young age." Zhang Haobo pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The three traveled together, with only Su Xiaomei constantly chattering.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they passed through the mountain pass and left the vicinity of Xishi Mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, [I Am Invincible], who had been silent, suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to look at Su Xiaomei and asked with interest, "You're an interesting little kid. We're strangers, right? Why did you say you're with me?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei tilted her head, full of innocence, and said, "We're traveling together now, doesn't that count as being together?"</p><p></p><p>Her cunning eyes turned and she asked, "You haven't answered my questions yet!"</p><p></p><p>[I Am Invincible] chuckled lightly, not getting angry: "Alright, let me introduce myself first then. This humble one is Shuo Feng, [I Am Invincible] is just a nickname I use when traveling the world. And you, little girl?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm called Su Xiaomei, and that person beside me is called Zhang Haobo!" Su Xiaomei answered quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Su Xiaomei..." Shuo Feng repeated this name.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at her seriously and asked, "Su Xiaomei, what do you want with me?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, Zhang Haobo instantly became a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>But Su Xiaomei was fearless, her eyes shining, and she answered straightforwardly: "It's because your name is too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"Invincible?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't accept that! I want to fight you!"</p><p></p><p>This answer was beyond Shuo Feng's expectations.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then he burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Good! What an interesting little kid!"</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that I'm feeling a bit restless after walking all this way."</p><p></p><p>"This place happens to be open and deserted, why don't we have a battle right here?"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1164: Overturning Heaven and Earth with One Hand</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren turned his head away, trembling and not daring to respond.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping waited for a long time, but still did not see Baihua change his mind. He then sighed lightly and put away the three True Immortal seal characters beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, if Fellow Daoist is unwilling, I won't force it."</p><p></p><p>"After all, not everyone has the courage to leverage the power of True Immortals..."</p><p></p><p>"As for the matter of transporting the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, does Fellow Daoist have any difficulties?" Li Ping returned to the main topic and asked.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the terrifying power and aura around him disappear, Baihua Daoren finally recovered from his shock for a brief moment.</p><p></p><p>The tone of Sacred Emperor Li Ping's question was already subtly different from before. Baihua knew that if he refused again, he would probably truly anger this madman. He could only agree with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please set off as soon as possible. By the way, since you are unfamiliar with the destination, to be on the safe side, I will send a disciple to accompany you." Li Ping said intentionally or unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>When Baihua Daoren saw the so-called disciple of Li Ping, he couldn't help but feel his scalp go numb and his body tremble again.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Even though Baihua had extraordinary knowledge and had personally witnessed the destruction of various worlds, at this moment he still found it a bit hard to accept: a body that looked completely the same as an ordinary human, but was actually composed of countless constantly wriggling unknown insects inside. Each of these insects was an individual with its own independent thoughts, yet they gathered to form a collective "human" entity.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren's scalp went numb, not because he was scared by the endless ugly insects. But because it was his body's instinctive reaction.</p><p></p><p>Those insects seemed to have some kind of natural restraint on bodies purely made of energy.</p><p></p><p>Even though she was at the Eternal Life realm, even though there was still some distance between her and these insects. Baihua still felt the sudden birth of anxiety and unease within her body. Constantly warning her to stay away from this insect person.</p><p></p><p>"You can call him [Dao Yi]." Li Ping answered irrelevantly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, although Dao Yi's strength is a bit lacking, he has some peculiar abilities. With his help, it should be much easier for Fellow Daoist to transport the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Baihua Daoren could only steel himself and nod slightly. Led by Dao Yi, he headed straight for Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Watching the two figures disappear into the distance, Li Ping actually did not feel much joy in intimidating an Eternal Life realm expert with a few words.</p><p></p><p>"My own strength is still not enough. I can only use external objects to threaten. If I could use the essence of Source Power, there would be no need for such trouble."</p><p></p><p>Dao Yi was a special variant of the Dao Yi Insect preserved in the Myriad Beasts Crystal.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much the group population expanded, it could always maintain a unified tribal consciousness. More crucially, this Dao Yi Insect not only simply produced spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be able to reside within spiritual energy, using it to multiply itself, and then gradually transform itself into an existence like spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient external breeding conditions, [Dao Yi] only needed about a year to convert all the spiritual energy of an entire small world into "itself".</p><p></p><p>The whole process was silent and would not even affect the various creatures in the world that relied on spiritual energy to survive.</p><p></p><p>Even weaker cultivators were unable to detect it.</p><p></p><p>Only after reaching the Nascent Soul stage and forming an independent grotto-heaven in the body could one sense this mutated spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sent [Dao Yi], cultivated with a wisp of his own consciousness, to the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was all for the purpose of allowing it to achieve a leap in evolution there.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the vast scale of spiritual energy in the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, a large amount of mutated spiritual energy was cultivated, enough to shake the entire Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Under normal conditions, it would have been impossible for Dao Yi to develop in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit troublesome to solve, eliminating these bugs was actually not a difficult task for the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, from discovery to management, it required a certain reaction time.</p><p></p><p>If there was a large enough quantity, it would be possible to achieve a major change in the spiritual energy of the Xuanhuang Realm before the cultivators there could react.</p><p></p><p>This move of draining the pond to catch the fish was a killer move prepared by Li Ping for the counterattack against the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>When spiritual energy gained self-awareness and could distinguish between friend and foe,</p><p></p><p>the advantages possessed by the cultivators of the Myriad Worlds Alliance in their battles against the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance would likely be more than just a little.</p><p></p><p>"Dare to call for the sun and moon to change to a new sky."</p><p></p><p>"The aura of this Xuanhuang Realm is too decayed. It's time to teach them a harsh lesson."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's avatar, Saint Emperor Li Ping had his memories of Huan Zhen removed.</p><p></p><p>In his self-perception, he was a product of the Xuanhuang Realm's desire to save itself under the threat of apocalyptic crisis, a result of a coincidence of fate.</p><p></p><p>The so-called destined saint.</p><p></p><p>He knew the vast majority of secrets in the Xuanhuang Realm like the back of his hand.</p><p></p><p>He had even foreseen countless futures of his own destruction.</p><p></p><p>And his ultimate pursuit was to change the world, to liberate the Xuanhuang Realm from the decayed rule of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Saint Emperor Li Ping firmly believed that he was not actually too far from achieving this goal.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The finals of the first Great Enlightenment Fishing Tournament officially kicked off.</p><p></p><p>A total of ten outstanding individuals would personally showcase their fishing skills in front of the Saint Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Originally, all three of the Saint Emperor's disciples participated, but in the end, only the simple-minded Wang Xuanba advanced to the final competition.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly further demonstrated the fairness of this competition.</p><p></p><p>Passing through a circular light gate, after a moment of dizziness, these ten contestants arrived in what seemed to be a very ordinary garden.</p><p></p><p>The great faceless Saint Emperor was sitting by a small pond not far away, fishing with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the ten people were seeing the Saint Emperor's face for the first time. Not daring to disturb him, they waited anxiously with their heads lowered.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the Saint Emperor suddenly reeled in his rod.</p><p></p><p>It was a white sphere of light.</p><p></p><p>Casually putting away the sphere of light, the Saint Emperor looked at the ten outstanding anglers and explained the rules of the competition.</p><p></p><p>"In this pond, I have placed countless treasures."</p><p></p><p>"One person, one rod, one chance."</p><p></p><p>"The higher the quality of the treasure fished out, the better the score."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, everyone felt extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Because the Saint Emperor promised that regardless of their ranking, the treasures they fished out would belong to them!</p><p></p><p>Amidst everyone's eagerness to give it a try, Wang Xuanba, as the Saint Emperor's disciple, made the first move.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba had never been to the fishing pond before.</p><p></p><p>He sat there in a daze for a long time, then reeled in his rod.</p><p></p><p>In the end, his hands were empty.</p><p></p><p>Empty rod!</p><p></p><p>This made Wang Xuanba quite depressed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the others were all shocked in their hearts, knowing that the Saint Emperor's fishing test was not as simple as ordinary fishing. At that moment, they all became nervous and serious.</p><p></p><p>As they took turns walking to the fishing pond, in the end, one purple, three blue, and five white spheres of light were fished out from the pond.</p><p></p><p>There's one more chapter coming around 12:30.</p>

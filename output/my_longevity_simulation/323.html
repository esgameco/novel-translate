        <h1>Chapter 323</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone's spirits were lifted, looking eager to give it a try. </p><p></p><p>"Master Ji, quickly tell us, what exactly does 'contributing the most effort' mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Ji, there must be some quantitative and specific rules, right? The amount of effort should be a criterion for evaluation."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao looked at the trainees whose enthusiasm had been mobilized, and couldn't help but reveal a gratified smile.</p><p></p><p>Lightly coughing, he began to explain to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The core of the [Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation] is essentially a new mirror surface of the Tianxuan Mirror, and you have all personally witnessed its encapsulation process."</p><p></p><p>"And the construction of the entire Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation starts from the central core area. In other words, from the very beginning of the formation's creation, the entire construction process of the Soul-Locking Formation can be sensed by the core, or the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Precise to every formation unit, exactly which cultivator personally laid it down, everything is under the control of the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"And the final result will be based solely on the data rankings announced by the Tianxuan Mirror, eliminating any possibility of falsification, absolutely fair and just."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao spoke eloquently and at length.</p><p></p><p>"I know that anyone who can be recommended by each state to study at this Huanyu Academy must have their own outstanding qualities. You are all young elites, who would be willing to always be inferior to others? In order to let everyone have a clear understanding of their performance ranking, and to better exert their own initiative, in this [Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation Competition], how much each of you contributes to the construction of the formation will be displayed in the form of real-time scores."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it will be ranked according to the scores, and announced by the Tianxuan Mirror, so that everyone can check it at any time!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan, listening to this rather familiar tactic, couldn't help but be shocked in his heart: "Well, this is to make these young formation masters desperately roll up their sleeves and work."</p><p></p><p>Next, Ji Hongdao also announced the preliminary construction plan of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation. </p><p></p><p>Initially, each cultivator returns to their hometown and begins to build the Soul-Locking Formation with the assistance of the local Formation Hall and Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>And if their own progress is faster, once the Soul-Locking Formation in the state they are in is completely built, they can freely flow to neighboring states to assist in construction.</p><p></p><p>Because the Tianxuan Mirror sees through everything, there is no need to worry about being in a different place and having one's own merits taken away.</p><p></p><p>The moment when all the territories of the Wanxian Alliance have completed the construction of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>The formation master with the highest score is the final winner.</p><p></p><p>Explaining the competition plan in detail, a hint of self-satisfaction flashed in Ji Hongdao's eyes that was not easily noticed by others.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he suddenly heard someone shout.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ji, I want to ask, now that I have no home to return to, what should I do? Where should I go?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao looked in the direction of the voice, and the cultivator who spoke was none other than Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>His face sank and he reprimanded: "You little guy, are you making fun of me? What do you mean by having no home to return to? Naturally, you go back to where you came from..."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Ji Hongdao seemed to remember something, and his words abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan again, he stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a problem..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't answer directly, but after a while, he transmitted a message to Li Fan: "This is what we'll do, you stay behind later, and I'll discuss it with you in detail."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also knew better than to say more.</p><p></p><p>This little episode fell into the eyes of the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Some didn't take it to heart. Some had a sudden realization and looked shocked.</p><p></p><p>And some seemed to have already known about the cultivators forgetting their worries, and their expressions remained normal.</p><p></p><p>It was still relying on Ji Hongdao's continued explanation of the competition process to pull everyone's attention back.</p><p></p><p>A year later, the new mirror surface of the Tianxuan Mirror will be transported to various states.</p><p></p><p>Before that, the students should first return to their respective states to assist local branches in coordinating and collecting the materials needed for the formation construction.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some special formation materials will also be uniformly managed and allocated by the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After listening to the general construction plan, the students returned to their respective courtyards to contact their relatives and teachers.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan stayed where he was.</p><p></p><p>Besides Li Fan, there was another cultivator who didn't leave.</p><p></p><p>This person was called Xue Mu, with a cultivation level of Foundational Establishment, and was also one of the three members from Congyun Sea participating in the training.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not under Zhang Zhiliang, and Li Fan had only met him a few times, so they were not very familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>As for the third person, he had failed the soul contract sensing test earlier and was eliminated.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he should have returned to Congyun Sea, and then perished in the catastrophe of Mo Sha's destruction of the world.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu seemed to be feeling the existence of the Carefree Celestial Venerable for the first time, and the confusion and fear in his eyes had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao looked at the two of them and asked kindly, "Congyun Sea has suffered a disaster, and you have no home to return to. What plans do you have for the future?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu pursed his lips and lowered his head in silence.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan cupped his hands frankly and said quite respectfully, "I will listen to Senior's orders."</p><p></p><p>"But if you are not allowed to participate in this competition, you will certainly not be convinced."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, his eyes flickering for a moment, as if communicating with someone.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Ji Hongdao said, "I don't know if you are willing to do this."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the various states, the Wanxian Alliance also has many important cave heavens and small worlds that need to be fully covered by the construction of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, these places were to be handled by us old guys, responsible for the construction."</p><p></p><p>"But since the situation is special, it would be fine to apply for your transfer over."</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that it can also help us share some of the pressure."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao smiled, "Now I don't have the same drive as you young people."</p><p></p><p>"As for the points for constructing the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation, you don't need to worry. The Wanxian Alliance has a large number of subordinate cave heavens, and some of them are not much smaller in scale than a state."</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured and do as you please."</p><p></p><p>"How about it?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Ji Hongdao looked at Li Fan and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Cave heavens? I wonder if there will be a chance to come into contact with the Five Elements Grand Cave Heavens." The moment he heard Ji Hongdao's words, this thought flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't dare to think too much, and only after Ji Hongdao asked did he reply solemnly, "I am willing."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao nodded with satisfaction, and then looked at Xue Mu, "What about you?"</p>

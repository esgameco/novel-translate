        <h1>Chapter 756</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If one does not leave the Longevity Realm and attains the Dao, then they become the strongest beings manifested in the world. New69bookbar→69shux.com</p><p>It was like this in the Xuanhuang Realm, let alone in this small imperial world. </p><p>Qing and Hong were fine, as they had lived long enough lives. From memory, many years ago when they were still in the Beast Taming Sect, they had also seen Dao cultivators.</p><p>But the Princess had it much harder.</p><p>Even though she had accepted the memories of the imperial emperors of the past dynasties, she only had a vague impression of the legendary strength of Dao cultivators.</p><p>After all, the Princess was just an ordinary mortal.</p><p>Facing the overwhelming pressure like a vast ocean inadvertently revealed by Liu San, the Princess turned deathly pale and could hardly breathe.</p><p>The three of them paid their respects, but Liu San did not respond, only remaining silent.</p><p>Qing and Hong suddenly felt a bit apprehensive in their hearts.</p><p>To be honest, before today, the two of them had always had some doubts about the so-called "Multiversal Alliance."</p><p>After all, from start to finish, this Multiversal Alliance only had one person responsible for contacting them. And the messenger's cultivation was not particularly profound either, only at the Yuan Ying realm that could be found everywhere in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>But today, the moment they saw the Dao cultivator in person, all three of their doubts were dispelled.</p><p>Because the strong are the best proof!</p><p>It's impossible that a great Dao cultivator would come to deceive them, right? With a wave of their hand, they could destroy the entire empire. New69bookbar→69shux.com There was no reason for them to do such a thing.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through their minds in an instant, and the three from the empire became even more respectful in their attitude.</p><p>Seeing that the atmosphere had settled, Liu San finally gave a light snort and nodded slightly: "Let's go, take me to see those few things you reported."</p><p>Xu Bai also chimed in: "Recently, the Immortal Alliance's offensives have become increasingly fierce. Elder Liu doesn't have much time to waste."</p><p>The Princess quickly nodded and led them to an underground chamber in the high tower palace.</p><p>The chamber was extremely spacious, with a virtual coordinate locking device, over a thousand spirit crystal cores of different varieties, and a huge smelting furnace already prepared there.</p><p>Liu San first looked towards the coordinate locking device and suddenly asked: "If you know the coordinates of a certain realm relative to the Xuanhuang Realm, would you be able to use this device to pinpoint the location of that realm in the void?"</p><p>Xiao Qing was stunned at first, then revealed an astonished expression.</p><p>Because she realized that the "realm" this Elder Liu spoke of did not refer to the small Xuanhuang world, but rather another cultivation realm on par with the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>Her evaluation of the Multiversal Alliance suddenly rose even higher. After pondering for a moment, Xiao Qing shook her head and honestly said: "Due to the influence of the Immortal Wasteland, it has caused spatial distortions around the Xuanhuang Realm. If we only have simple coordinate data, even if we could escape the Wasteland's gravitational pull, we might mistake the direction midway."</p><p>"However, if we preset the destination coordinates first, we can perform spatial corrections while continuously advancing. In theory, it is entirely possible to safely reach the coordinate location." Xiao Qing quickly added.</p><p>"For this realm without spiritual energy to have developed such technology is no easy feat," Liu San nodded in praise.</p><p>Hearing this, a hint of joy flashed across the eyes of Xiao Qing and the others.</p><p>Liu San then shifted his gaze to the thousands of spirit crystal cores of different varieties.</p><p>With just a glance, he skipped over them.</p><p>Liu San then looked at the huge, constantly roaring and pulsating smelting furnace.</p><p>The threads of dangerous aura seeping out from it made even him...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liu San narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"You are playing with fire here." After a long time, Liu San gave such an evaluation.</p><p>"The idea of 'All Beasts Return to One' does have some possibility. But if you really create that terrifying creature, I'm afraid the so-called 'Unison Technique' you have may not be able to control it."</p><p>"Perhaps if the Sovereign Beast Sect's treasure 'Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts' was still around, there would be a glimmer of hope."</p><p>Qing and Hong looked at each other, both shocked.</p><p>However, before they could respond, Liu San simply left with a sentence, "I already know the general situation of this realm. Just wait patiently for the result."</p><p>Qing asked anxiously, "Fellow Daoist Xu..."</p><p>Xu Bai looked helpless: "As I said earlier, the assault of the Myriad Immortal Alliance is now fierce, and many small worlds have fallen one after another. The organization has decided to implement a 'retreat and survive' plan, contracting the sphere of influence and only keeping the valuable small worlds as the core force members."</p><p>"The final result is not something Elder Liu alone can decide. It requires a comprehensive assessment by the organization's higher-ups before a decision is made."</p><p>As evidence, Xu Bai then showed the group the images he had collected from the Heavenly Profound Mirror, depicting the small worlds being constantly overrun by the frenzied attacks of the Myriad Immortal Alliance cultivators.</p><p>Faced with this scene full of slaughter and cruelty, the three from the Empire couldn't help but change color.</p><p>Throwing the recording stone to them, Xu Bai comforted, "Don't worry, for the sake of our shared ancestor, even if the organization's decision doesn't approve of protecting you, I will quietly come to take you away and save your lives."</p><p>"Of course, the number can't be too many, five is the upper limit."</p><p>Xu Bai said solemnly.</p><p>Looking at the increasingly pale faces of Qing and the others, Xu Bai added, "Of course, if the organization ultimately decides to protect you, that would be even better."</p><p>"But as a price, all the resources and technologies in the Empire must be integrated into our Myriad Worlds Union."</p><p>"Regardless of the outcome, you need to prepare well during this period."</p><p>"I heard that there is still a nobility class in your Empire..."</p><p>Xu Bai sneered and said to the Imperial Princess, "Remember, the Empire only needs the Emperor. There is no need for any nobility."</p><p>"From today on, let the Empire have only one voice."</p><p>With that, Xu Bai cupped his hands: "I also have many matters to attend to and cannot stay here any longer. I hope I can bring good news next time I come."</p><p>Without waiting for Qing and the others to bid farewell, Xu Bai then flew away.</p><p>Watching Xu Bai leave, the Imperial Princess's gaze turned towards the palace outside.</p><p>A flash of killing intent crossed her eyes, but ultimately became resolute.</p><p>...</p><p>At the entrance of the Xuanhuang Realm, the one who had left earlier, Liu San, was waiting for Xu Bai.</p><p>"Young Master, how was my performance?" he asked proudly.</p><p>"Haha, I didn't expect Elder Liu, who seems so upright, to be so skilled at deceiving people, leaving no flaws at all. In the future, I'll have to remind Elder Jiang to be more careful," Xu Bai said with a smile.</p><p>Liu San's expression immediately fell.</p><p>However, he soon changed the subject: "Setting aside other matters, this place called the Imperial Small World really has some tricks. Not to mention other things, just the 'Cauldron of Myriad Phenomena' alone, even in the ancient cultivation world, it was quite extraordinary."</p>

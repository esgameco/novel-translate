        <h1>Chapter 518</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Zhao Sister saw from a distance, her face solemn, observing the condition of the cultivator in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Cough...” This Dadao Sect disciple's cultivation had stagnated at the Yuan Ying stage, but at this moment, he looked no different from a dying mortal, with hollow eyes, clouded consciousness, and weak energy like floating silk.</p><p></p><p>He coughed violently from time to time, as if he was going to cough up his lungs.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of deathly grayness on his face, appearing extremely weak, completely unlike the appearance of a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled.</p><p></p><p>Just moments ago, this cultivator didn't seem this serious. Just in the short time he took to find Zhao Sister, the situation had worsened significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Could he have been affected by some evil curse?" Li Fan squinted, observing.</p><p></p><p>"Cough... Daoist?" Suddenly, this cultivator saw the two people standing in front of him and subconsciously struggled to get up to show respect.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, don't move if you're feeling unwell, rest well," Zhao Sister stopped him and said gently.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." This Dadao Sect disciple had never seen Zhao Sister's gentle and approachable side before, and in an instant, his face regained some vitality. He stared at Zhao Sister with eyes full of infatuation, as if his soul had been entranced.</p><p></p><p>"After you left the mountain, where did you go? What happened to you, who did you meet?" Zhao Sister asked again.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring his near-death condition, he coughed continuously, trying to convey every detail to Zhao Sister.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, his breath grew weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Zhao Sister's eyes filled with curiosity, he persisted, intermittently narrating.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as he spoke the last word, his breath suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, his eyes remained open, staring firmly and unwillingly at Zhao Sister.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Zhao Sister grabbed Li Fan and quickly left the place.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she handed him a purplish-gold pill and instructed him to take it.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the 'Creation Purple Gold Pill'?" Li Fan was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>This type of pill was a treasure closely guarded by the Dadao Sect, usually only obtainable by experts of the Longevity Realm. As long as one doesn't die on the spot, swallowing this pill can instantly restore one to their original state. It's like having a second life.</p><p></p><p>Extremely rare, the Dadao Sect didn't have much stock of it.</p><p></p><p>Despite the seriousness of the situation, Zhao Sister didn't hesitate to take it...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately understood the gravity of the situation and swallowed the Creation Purple Gold Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Don't waste it, wrap it in your spiritual power, slowly absorb its medicinal power," Zhao Sister instructed while continuously casting spells to construct layers of barriers around them.</p><p></p><p>"Will the cause of that disciple's death be contagious? What kind of curse is this potent? Is it aimed at our Dadao Sect?" Li Fan couldn't help but feel alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than a curse, it is more like an illness. A deadly ailment that even cultivators cannot avoid or escape from,” Zhao Sister's expression was unusually serious.</p><p></p><p>Even when the world-changing event that was beyond their control occurred that day, she had never been as worried as she was now.</p><p></p><p>"Its goal is definitely not just our Dadao Sect. It aims to eradicate all cultivators in the world... This matter must be reported as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shocked, "Could it be the backlash of heaven and earth again?! Damned heavens, they truly intend to wipe us out entirely!"</p><p></p><p>“Cough…” As the two flew towards the sect's main hall, a strange pale color suddenly appeared on Zhao Sister's face.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she began to cough uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>But quickly, a purple-golden light burst forth, suppressing the pale color. The coughing ceased, and Zhao Sister's face regained its rosy hue.</p><p></p><p>"How could it flare up so quickly? Sister, you've already achieved the Harmonization Realm, haven’t you?" Li Fan couldn't help but feel an unbelievable fear.</p><p></p><p>If someone as proficient as Zhao Sister was affected, what about him, a mere Nascent Divinity cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Unable to wait for any symptoms to appear on himself, he immediately circulated the medicinal power of the Creation Purple Gold Pill in his dantian, to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, shortly after doing all this, he suddenly felt extreme fatigue.</p><p></p><p>As if he had been battling with Zhao Sister for seven days and seven nights, his whole body was incredibly sore, as if his bones were about to fall apart.</p><p></p><p>His throat felt like it was being cut by a knife, but his body was desperate to breathe like a drowning mortal, gasping for air.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, the Creation Purple Gold Pill did not disappoint.</p><p></p><p>As the purple-golden pill's power circulated, the abnormality in his body vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... this ailment is so vicious!” Feeling like he had faced death, Li Fan looked at Zhao Sister with lingering fear, “Thank goodness for your pill. If not for that, I might have met the same fate as that senior disciple just now!”</p><p></p><p>"Don't take it lightly; the symptoms have just been temporarily suppressed. The root of all this, the culprit that caused it, still remains within us. It hasn't been eliminated,” Zhao Sister reminded in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>As if to confirm her words, she soon couldn't help but let out a slight cough.</p><p></p><p>Although the illness was quickly resolved by the Creation Purple Gold Pill, it plunged Li Fan into deep despair.</p><p></p><p>Even with such divine pills protecting them, they were still unable to rid themselves of this unknown disease. What about the ordinary Dadao Sect disciples and lone cultivators, how tragic would their situation be?</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>The two of them continued to fight against the disease and soon arrived inside the sect's main hall.</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi, the head of the Dadao Sect, who had been informed by Zhao Sister, had already gathered all the elders together.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhao Sister had detailed the terrifying nature of this disease as much as possible, Ji Changxi and the elders of the Dadao Sect did give it due consideration.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>It didn't receive as much attention as it should have.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, even though Zhao Sister, the newly promoted Harmonization Realm cultivator who had successfully broken through by using a new method, was also a Harmonization Realm cultivator as them, she could not be compared to those senior elders who had achieved Harmonization Realm mastery centuries ago.</p><p></p><p>They held many secrets and possessed various means. They believed that this young disciple who had mastered a new technique would be harmed by this unknown "illness," but they might not be.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they believed they had already made sufficient preparations.</p><p></p><p>Various restrictions surrounded the empty space within the main hall, layered and sealed.</p><p></p><p>The 【Deep Abyss Dao Barrier】 was activated, appearing to be distant, but in reality, it was separated by several worlds.</p><p></p><p>Everything was secure and in place.</p><p></p><p>"You two, don't suppress that strange disease. Each of you release a drop of your own blood," Ji Changxi instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Zhao Sister complied.</p><p></p><p>Amidst a gentle cough, two blood droplets emitting an inexplicable aura appeared before everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone observed from a distance, and the main hall fell into a silent stillness.</p>

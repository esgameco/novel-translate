        <h1>Chapter 890</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the desolate and decaying land, numerous small mounds rose like tumors. The stench of decay and rot could be smelled from afar.</p><p></p><p>Some of the mounds had been dug open by the curious. Inside, there was nothing but some black, rotten, thick liquid.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Wanxian Alliance had officially sent someone to investigate. After the investigation yielded no results, they scraped off the entire area that seemed like boils on the earth's surface.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that in less than half a year, these continuous small mounds would reappear? So the Immortal Alliance sent people to deal with it again.</p><p></p><p>This happened three times, yet these pustules persisted tenaciously. In the end, they had to leave it be and deem it as something akin to a "bizarre" existence.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan knew that the cause of this area's abnormality was not some bizarre phenomenon at all. Rather, it was due to the remnant thoughts attached to countless swords, distorted and corrupted over thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"One can't blame the Wanxian Alliance for being perfunctory." "Even if an ordinary Immortal personally came, if they weren't well-versed in the Dao of the Sword, they probably wouldn't be able to detect the abnormality here at all."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan activated the Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword. In his vision, the scene ahead suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Countless black shadows floated out from those raised pustules. Like ghosts, their eyes glowed crimson red, staring intently at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Unintelligible whispers came from all around, sounding like screams and resentful curses. The whispers seemed to penetrate the eardrums and reach directly into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Even closing his hearing and isolating his spiritual sense couldn't stop it. Li Fan frowned slightly, knowing this was a necessary step to enter the Sword Tomb of Tian Jian Sect. He could only maintain his original heart and persist under the assault of these strange and piercing sounds.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan unmoved, those red-eyed black shadows flew into a rage. They turned into streaks of black lines and pounced fiercely at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As they got closer, the appearance of the black shadows became clear. Some looked like recently deceased, rotting corpses with decaying flesh and maggots. Some looked like they were being roasted by fire, their bodies melting in a horrifying manner. Others were like bloody flesh cut into countless pieces...</p><p></p><p>Their common point was that these corpses all had Li Fan's appearance! It wasn't just imagination, but more like an extremely real illusion after taking Yima.</p><p></p><p>One could even feel the corresponding pain in one's own body. "A little trick." "Not to mention I have the Immortal Heart Mantra protecting my body, impervious to all methods. Even if I accidentally fall for it, with the method of endlessly regenerating the body above the Nascent Soul realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Not a bad move, but it's outdated." Thinking this, Li Fan allowed these black shadows to devour him.</p><p></p><p>Then the Five Elements Grotto Heaven rumbled slightly, and in the blink of an eye, another body reappeared. More black shadows emerged from the mounds, screaming as they flew towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, Li Fan kept recreating his body, finally tainting all the black shadows in the nearly ten thousand mounds here.</p><p></p><p>With each black shadow's erosion, Li Fan felt his body "sink" slightly. Not sinking into the ground, but into another space.</p><p></p><p>These black shadows were like water ghosts, pulling Li Fan down...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was drawn into the world they lived in.</p><p></p><p>Once fully immersed, the scene before his eyes changed, and Li Fan finally truly entered the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Just as Shuo Feng had described, there were thousands upon thousands of broken swords stuck diagonally in the ground.</p><p></p><p>They all curved slightly towards the center, as if paying homage to their emperor.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of Li Fan, an outsider, did not elicit any reaction from them.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation of these seemingly decaying swords, Li Fan discovered that rather than saying they were becoming decayed...</p><p></p><p>It was more like...</p><p></p><p>Under the baptism of the extraordinary "Sword" in the center, they were becoming more and more pure.</p><p></p><p>No longer needing the constraints of form, just like the "Sword", they were trending towards conceptualization and energization.</p><p></p><p>"The black shadows above are the killing intent, obsessions, and desires of those slaughtered by the swords, stained upon the thousands of blades."</p><p></p><p>"In this world of pure swords, they gradually have no foothold and are slowly being excluded."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan operated the Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword, disguising himself as a sword. Motionless, he observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"If there's no external disturbance, under the subtle influence of the 'Sword', perhaps the thousands of swords in this tomb might really all be able to shed their forms and become conceptual existences."</p><p></p><p>"What's this, when one attains the Dao, even the dogs and chickens ascend to heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's an existence enlightened by Mr. White."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan finally took the first step forward.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, his expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>Because in that instant, the thousands of swords around him simultaneously sent out sword intent.</p><p></p><p>They seemed dissatisfied with his "cutting in line" behavior.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's perception, these outwardly decayed swords finally revealed their dazzling true appearances.</p><p></p><p>Some had fiery red blades, like blazing flames; some had misty sword aura, like azure jade; some had pitch-black bodies, yet emitted a heavy bloody aura; some were like golden light, with lightning coiling around them, like the majestic might of heaven...</p><p></p><p>Although they were just the outermost swords of the tomb, after thousands of years of tempering by the true meaning of the "Sword", they were no longer in the realm of ordinary objects.</p><p></p><p>Each one of them could be considered a top-grade extraordinary weapon!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, and the intent of the Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword burst forth vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of countless sword intents, he took another step forward.</p><p></p><p>This time, he offended even more swords.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless sword marks appeared on Li Fan's body, blood flowing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Even his divine soul seemed to be chopped by sword aura, aching faintly.</p><p></p><p>"I can't fight back, I can only silently endure."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I'll be seen as an enemy by all the swords in the tomb and attacked en masse."</p><p></p><p>"Even that wooden sword in the center will take action."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a feeling in his heart and temporarily canceled his Soul Burning state.</p><p></p><p>Fully operating the "Infinite Void Method", he strode forward.</p><p></p><p>For a time, he truly tasted what it meant to have ten thousand swords assailing the body.</p><p></p><p>His body was already riddled with wounds. Even with the support of the power of the Five Elements Grotto Heaven constantly regenerating, he could barely maintain human form.</p><p></p><p>Although his divine soul quickly healed after being severely injured, that extreme pain was unavoidable no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"Shuo Feng is more comfortable after all."</p><p></p><p>"He didn't need to pay any attention to the attacks of these thousands of swords at all. Just relying on the golden armor bestowed by his mother, he walked to the center of the sword tomb as if strolling through a courtyard."</p><p></p><p>In his suffering, Li Fan recalled Shuo Feng's description and couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't help complaining, in reality, the combined force of the thousands of swords in the tomb didn't hinder Li Fan in the slightest.</p>

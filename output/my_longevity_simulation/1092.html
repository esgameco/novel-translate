        <h1>Chapter 1092</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1090: Xu Ke a Thousand Years Later</p><p></p><p>However, what surprised Li Fan a little was that although these few fellows who had successfully passed the Dharma Transmitter's Oath were no longer in charge, they did not leave the power core of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were granted the power of supervision, as a supplement to the Dharma Transmitter Council.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that after this incident, Jiang also realized the problems existing within the Dharma Transmitters. If they were not restrained, problems would definitely arise in the future.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Mo Rubin will eventually be able to pass the test of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter if we reveal some specifics about the test illusion to the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Anyway, they have already mastered the method to enter it. With the resources of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, they will find a qualified candidate sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan transmitted the general situation of the first scene of the illusion [Ningyuan Taking the Longevity Fruit] to Dharma Transmitter Zhou.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not say that he had successfully passed the test, but fabricated a story according to the most likely plot development route when entering for the first time.</p><p></p><p>When taking the longevity fruit, he was seriously injured by Steward Song. Although he barely kept his life under the protection of Senior Brother Zhang, he also fell into a coma and was in a daze all day long. Until one night, he was inexplicably possessed by someone and lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Dharma Transmitter Zhou solemnly replied: "The information provided by Daoyou is very critical. It will be of great help to our exploration of the illusion next."</p><p></p><p>In order to express gratitude, Dharma Transmitter Zhou also presented Li Fan with a virtual position of senior elder of the Myriad Immortals Alliance on behalf of the Dharma Transmitter Council.</p><p></p><p>There was no real power, but one could enter and exit the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance at any time, and the authority level was only slightly lower than that of the Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>"However, Daoyou cannot take up this position of senior elder. After all, in the eyes of other uninformed Dharma Transmitters, you have already been executed by Jiang for false accusations." Dharma Transmitter Zhou reminded again.</p><p></p><p>This so-called senior elder was obviously meant to win over the [Myriad Realms United Association] behind Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In this Xuantian Sect possession incident, the Myriad Realms United Association had already demonstrated sufficiently powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>They even grasped many secrets that the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not know.</p><p></p><p>Using a virtual position to deepen the cooperative relationship between the two sides was definitely worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>However, the Myriad Immortals Alliance probably never thought that the so-called Myriad Realms United Association was actually just Li Fan's one-man show.</p><p></p><p>During the more than a year when Li Fan was in seclusion and disappeared, everything within the United Association continued to develop steadily according to the set tone, and periodically summarized and reported to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After reading through this news one by one.</p><p></p><p>What attracted Li Fan's attention the most was what the Empire reported.</p><p></p><p>The location of the small world where Xu Ke was in had finally been determined!</p><p></p><p>An old man, weathered by time, carrying a coffin on his back.</p><p></p><p>Exactly the same as what Li Fan had seen before.</p><p></p><p>Although the Imperial Princess was very excited to find her ancestor, she did not get carried away for a moment and disobey Li Fan's order to meet Xu Ke without authorization.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me go meet him."</p><p></p><p>"I'm still very interested in Mr. White's hidden trump card."</p><p></p><p>"Qing Huizhou."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan headed straight for the target location.</p><p></p><p>"Although transforming into a seven-colored divine light is already very fast, compared with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate's ability to arrive in one thought, it's still far inferior."</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan returned</p><p></p><p>After the reality, the huge contrast still made him feel a little bit lost.</p><p></p><p>Even in his heart, a feeling of regret secretly arose.</p><p></p><p>The moment this emotion emerged, Li Fan's mind trembled.</p><p></p><p>He immediately circulated the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, wanting to eliminate it.</p><p></p><p>But the method that had always been effective in the past, at this moment, actually failed.</p><p></p><p>"Humph."</p><p></p><p>"In this Xuanhuang Realm, there is nothing worth regretting. Even transcendent immortal treasures, I can discard like worn-out shoes!"</p><p></p><p>"Mere Xuanhuang Celestial Venerable, you also want to disturb my state of mind?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking that after truly returning, all these things that were once lost, could be obtained again.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, those few disharmonious little emotions in Li Fan's heart immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, is the reason why from the beginning when I entered the Fallen Immortal Realm, I was different from other cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Early on when it was still the Xuanhuang Heart Tempering Mantra, it probably already became a special mark for the Fallen Immortal Realm to identify me."</p><p></p><p>"When it involves matters related to Xuanhuang Celestial Venerable, it directly goes on strike. It seems that things of unknown origin can never be absolutely trusted."</p><p></p><p>"In all matters, one still has to rely on oneself."</p><p></p><p>A trace of gloom flashed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Heart Tempering Mantra..."</p><p></p><p>Before this, Li Fan had never had the thought of sharing this method with others.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, this not big not small mishap, gave him a wake-up call.</p><p></p><p>"Passing it to a suitable person, pushing them to inherit the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable, or inherit the immortal spiritual energy and bravely charge beyond the high walls, both are not bad ideas."</p><p></p><p>Face after face rapidly flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>While thinking about suitable candidates, Li Fan also arrived at Xu Ke's hiding place.</p><p></p><p>"This place..."</p><p></p><p>"Seems to be like Jiushan Prefecture, transformed from the remains of some fiend beast."</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the small world, Li Fan keenly sensed some familiar auras.</p><p></p><p>"This is the growth of cognition."</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, he cracked the formation restrictions at the entrance of the small world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly entered inside.</p><p></p><p>The empire's intelligence was very accurate. This small world was a desolate desert landscape.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was a hazy gray.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a towering stone mountain that seemed to connect heaven and earth was probably the only significance of the small world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was attracted to it at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was at the very top of this stone mountain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to fly up, but discovered to his surprise that he actually could not fly.</p><p></p><p>This was not because of Li Fan's cultivation level, but the special rules of this small world restricting it. </p><p></p><p>If he wanted to forcibly fly, it wasn't impossible. He just had to be prepared to face the backlash of the small world's Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not want to make the atmosphere so stiff right from the start.</p><p></p><p>So he raised his head, his gaze penetrating through the obstruction of myriad miles, directly landing on Xu Ke at the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>This white-haired old man also sensed something at this moment and cast his gaze over.</p><p></p><p>The two's gazes intersected.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Fan took a step with his foot.</p><p></p><p>He did not fly, but directly tore space, appearing beside Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>His expression was calm, only leaving two spatial tears that were slow to dissipate at the starting point and end point.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xu Ke?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan got straight to the point, directly speaking the white-haired old man's identity.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Li Fan's sudden appearance, Xu Ke actually also did not feel the slightest surprise. Instead, he asked straightforwardly: "You recognized me from the Fallen Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan's gaze concentrated.</p><p></p><p>His move of taking the initiative that had always been foolproof, this time actually failed.</p>

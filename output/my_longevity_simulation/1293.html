            <p>Chapter 1287: Changes in the Starry Sea Begin (7K)</p><p></p><p>"Go all out..." Yin Shangren fell silent upon receiving the answer.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry, I have already made plans. Regardless of victory or defeat, the orthodox Xuanhuang will surely be re-established. You and Xu Ke, just go and do what you want to do," Holy Emperor Li Ping said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"But..." Yin Shangren still hesitated upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes for the Dharma to manifest, it will be the moment when the Holy Dynasty's army launches an all-out attack on the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. You two will take advantage of the chaos to sneak into the [Museum of Divine Treasures] and bring out Mr. Bai's skull. At this point, victory or defeat is a struggle of the overall situation. Although both of you are not weak, you cannot influence the overall situation. Moreover, restraining the Huanzhen Sage lineage that controls the Divine Treasure Pavilion is also a great achievement."</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloominess flashed in Yin Shangren's eyes: "It's just the undying ghostly souls of ancient beasts from the Xuanhuang Realm. If [Emperor One] was still here, I might be wary. But with only Emperor Three Mao..."</p><p></p><p>"Nothing to fear!" Yin Shangren snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Huanzhen Sage wields the powerful artifact [Era]. Even the most mediocre existence, after hundreds of thousands of simulations and deductions, can give birth to miracles. Do not underestimate the enemy!" Li Ping said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's words still carried some weight in Yin Shangren's heart. </p><p></p><p>He no longer refuted, but instead narrowed his eyes in thought.</p><p></p><p>As he was thinking, Yin Shangren's scalp once again transmitted a rustling sound like silkworms crawling. His scalp undulated, as if something would drill out from the cracks on the top of his head at any time.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren instantly became somewhat irritated, while Li Ping flashed to his side.</p><p></p><p>With a light touch of his palm and the infiltration of starlight, the abnormality gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"This is the reaction of your true self. Forcibly suppressing it is not a good strategy," the Holy Emperor saw through it at a glance and advised.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren showed a helpless expression: "Starting halfway, after all, is not the same as cultivating from the beginning. It is destined to leave various sequelae. At first, I thought that as long as I devoured my original imperfect Dao foundation and re-established [Establishing Foundation with Myself], everything would be fine. But some time ago, when I heard your sermon in the Starry Sea, I had some new insights. I realized that my original cognition, my complete self, was not entirely complete. The foundation is shaken and indeed needs to be re-adjusted."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I will handle it well before the decisive battle arrives," Yin Shangren promised.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you have it under control, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's voice lingered, but his figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren looked around, but was surprised to find that the incomplete [New New Law] that had been virtualized into reality and taken away by the Holy Emperor had suddenly reappeared on the long table where the Holy Emperor had been sitting.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the Holy Emperor had deliberately left it for him, Yin Shangren was not polite and immediately picked it up to study.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful..."</p><p></p><p>Even though it was only compiled to deceive the world, in Yin Shangren's eyes, this half of the New New Law was still profound and boundless, almost no different from true divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>He quickly became completely obsessed.</p><p></p><p>Holy Dynasty, Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, Fire Attribute Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Endless sea of fire, raging flames like towering waves, bursting out from time to time, rushing straight to the sky.</p><p></p><p>The scorching flames, like wild fiery horses, gnawed at everything inside the grotto-heaven.</p><p></p><p>But in the deepest part of this hellish scene, a golden glaze flower was blooming. No matter how rampant the surrounding flames were, the flower remained as clear as ever, unaffected in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the glaze flower, the image of a world was faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, a wisp of golden light would float out from the glaze world within the flower. When the surrounding flames came into contact with this golden light, they would instantly ignite and burn even more vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when it was first captured here, not only the fire grotto-heaven, but the entire Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven had almost expanded by a fold. The Hundred Flowers Daoist had made indispensable contributions.</p><p></p><p>The figure of Holy Emperor Li Ping flashed beside the golden glaze light.</p><p></p><p>The raging flames instantly withered. They didn't even dare to approach, only swaying from afar in a fawning manner.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well. The Five Elements Grotto-Heaven has been managed very well."</p><p></p><p>"The other grotto-heavens as well," Li Ping said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>His gaze penetrated the sky of the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven and reached the void outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, like a strong helmsman, led the Holy Dynasty's Great Vessel swiftly through the void.</p><p></p><p>And around it, it simultaneously enveloped hundreds of different small worlds of various sizes.</p><p></p><p>With the Holy Dynasty's Great Vessel as the core, they were vaguely connected into a formation. Like a giant battleship, it was awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>"It's just part of my duty. If it weren't for the Holy Emperor bestowing the Myriad Spirit Jade Nectar, I wouldn't be able to achieve this level," Hundred Flowers came to Li Ping and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers also looked in the direction of Li Ping's gaze.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, she couldn't help but sigh: "I can't believe that such a magnificent sight was actually done by me."</p><p></p><p>"Most of them are no smaller than my hometown."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll have to trouble you again. Send this Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven back to the Xuanhuang Realm," Li Ping's voice came at the right time.</p><p></p><p>Hundred Flowers was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor smiled and explained: "The time for evasion has passed. Now is the time for close combat. Let it take the lead in this first battle!"</p><p></p><p>With these words from the Holy Emperor, the surrounding flames seemed to be inspired and surged violently.</p><p></p><p>And Hundred Flowers also saw that in the entire fire grotto-heaven with raging flames, besides the flames themselves, there was also a deep shadow flowing inside.</p><p></p><p>It was a terrifying existence that could threaten her.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor stretched out his palm, and the shadow flowed, quickly coming to his palm, transforming into a cute little bug with a tiger's head.</p><p></p><p>It looked chubby and harmless, but Hundred Flowers was very clear about the horror of this little thing.</p><p></p><p>The fire grotto-heaven they were in, and even the entire Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, were nothing more than the incarnations of this black bug.</p><p></p><p>In these years, Hundred Flowers had been taking care of the grotto-heaven, or rather, raising this bug named [Dao One].</p><p></p><p>"With [Dao One] helping you, dragging the grotto-heaven back won't be as difficult as when you came."</p><p></p><p>While speaking, Li Ping's palm emitted starlight.</p><p></p><p>The Dao One bug seemed a little proud, and its fat body affectionately rubbed against Li Ping's palm. Then it greedily devoured the starlight.</p><p></p><p>Its black body seemed to become even more condensed.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping lightly patted, and although the Dao One bug was a little reluctant, it obediently dispersed its shadow and returned to the surrounding grotto-heaven.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding flames instantly became even more prosperous.</p><p></p><p>And Hundred Flowers also sensed that the entire grotto-heaven seemed to come alive in an instant. Being inside it was like being in the belly of a giant beast.</p><p></p><p>The constantly rising sense of crisis made Hundred Flowers restless.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping also noticed Hundred Flowers' abnormality and brought her to the void outside the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor lightly tapped his finger, and the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven detached from the Holy Dynasty's Great Vessel and the void fleet formation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry. Dao One will only loyally execute my orders."</p><p></p><p>Since the Holy Emperor said so, Hundred Flowers could only nod. Suppressing the fear in her heart, she transformed into a golden light and flew towards the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Five Rings Grotto-Heaven instantly seemed to be dyed with a golden edge.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom!</p><p></p><p>After the initial rumbling sound, the movement of the grotto-heaven was absolutely silent.</p><p></p><p>Under the concealment of the Holy Emperor's formation, even if one was beside the grotto-heaven it passed by, they might not necessarily be able to detect this moving behemoth.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven that was returning home, Li Ping secretly pondered in his heart: "With [Dao One]'s current state, it is enough to change the spiritual energy of the entire Xuanhuang Realm silently."</p><p></p><p>"Not only is it aimed at the Myriad Immortal Alliance, but it can also take the opportunity to stimulate the Xuanhuang Realm and further trigger its revival."</p><p></p><p>Since the last time he comprehended the Dao in the center of the Starry Sea, the power of revival had briefly erupted within the Xuanhuang Realm. However, after all, it was rootless water, and as time passed, the signs of revival had gradually stagnated.</p><p></p><p>The tender buds that had newly opened on the branches were turning yellow again.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, transformed by the Dao One bug, was like a potent medicine.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was an extremely important component of the Xuanhuang Realm. If it was eroded, it would inevitably trigger the Xuanhuang Realm's own instinctive and intense reaction.</p><p></p><p>"The mission of the Dao One bug, in addition to creating a battlefield environment suitable for the Great Vessel's soldiers to fight, is to try to infest and devour the foreign immortal realms that have been stitched together over the past several thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"After the great battle ends, the Dao One bug will die. The spiritual energy will return to normal, and the corpse of the Dao One bug, which is those foreign realms, can be used as nourishment for the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Emperor's mind, he kept deducing the scenes of the great battle in the near future.</p><p></p><p>His eyes looked into the distance, penetrating layers of time and space barriers, and saw Hundred Flowers Daoist successfully dragging the infested Five Elements Grotto-Heaven back into position.</p><p></p><p>In the silent roar of heaven and earth, the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven that had returned to Tianling Prefecture began to emit an abnormal spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The concentration of spiritual energy in the Xuanhuang Realm would slightly increase in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators would find it difficult to detect the abnormality of this newly born spiritual energy. Only when the [Infestation] was activated would they be caught off guard and lose their "right to invoke" the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the plan being implemented smoothly, Holy Emperor Li Ping finally withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>With a step, he returned to the Holy Dynasty's Great Vessel.</p><p></p><p>The deepest part of the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Myriad Spirit Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were many other formations stacked, such as the Sentient Beings Refining God Formation. Even the consciousness of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, which was closely related to the Holy Emperor, would have its connection cut off here.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring that all external probing could be severed.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's disciple, Lin Ling, the former incarnation of the Spirit Wood Realm, now revealed her true form.</p><p></p><p>However, it looked quite strange. The tree was inverted, with the crown at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>The dense roots were at the top.</p><p></p><p>The buildings scattered throughout the Holy Dynasty's Great Vessel, such as the Hero Seat, the Holy Physician Institute, the Holy Academy, the Holy Heart Palace, and the Holy Supervision Court, were all connected to the roots of the inverted spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>In the heart of the tree, all the scenes happening within the Holy Dynasty's Great Vessel were simultaneously reflected.</p><p></p><p>After playing through a scene, the light and shadow would transform into green light and be absorbed by the inverted spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>Holy Emperor Li Ping looked at the inverted spirit tree in front of him, and a rare hint of hesitation flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'before seeking victory, first seek defeat.' Only with great wisdom can the Holy Emperor make such a move!"</p><p></p><p>Beside Li Ping, a yellow paper man with a worried face was praising without reservation.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than One Absolute Daoist from the Crossing Calamity Sect.</p><p></p><p>He was seen sitting on the Book of Crossing Calamity, his eyes tightly fixed on the inverted spirit tree in front.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Holy Emperor's plan this time is for the sake of the Xuanhuang Realm. It is not a way out left for himself, so it cannot be said to dampen his sharp spirit and determination," One Absolute Daoist continued.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>And at the heart of the tree, the speed at which those Great Vessel scenes were absorbed seemed to have increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the Holy Emperor finally stopped his actions.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly spoke: "In this decisive battle with the Myriad Immortal Alliance, your Crossing Calamity Sect does not need to take action."</p><p></p><p>"Still follow what I said before, hide in the dark and see..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether there are other prying eyes," the Holy Emperor said in a mysterious tone.</p><p></p><p>"The battle between the Holy Dynasty and the Immortal Alliance is a change in the Xuanhuang Realm unseen for ten thousand years. If that force secretly monitoring the Xuanhuang Realm is still operating, it will inevitably supervise this and then transmit the information. I don't require you to find the final destination of the information. Just determine whether the event has occurred or not," the Holy Emperor instructed word by word.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tightly furrowed brows of Yijue Daoren from the Duoye Sect finally slowly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He clapped his hands in praise and said, "Your Majesty's move is truly in line with the great way of our Duoye Sect. If Your Majesty is willing, I can give up the position of the sect leader of Duoye Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Before Yijue Daoren could finish his words, he was interrupted by the Holy Emperor: "Regardless of who wins or loses between me and Chuanfa, you need to inform the winner of the result. As for after completing the task... it's up to you."</p><p></p><p>Yijue Daoren did not show the joy of gaining freedom soon, but was somewhat stunned. The vaguely shaped little hand of the paper man pointed to the inverted Lingmu in front: "I'm not going along?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor chuckled lightly: "The only living being in this [Huawai Zhimu] is Lin Ling, who serves as the main body. I will not leave any way out on it, and your Duoye Sect still wants to go along?"</p><p></p><p>Yijue Daoren's face instantly turned bitter: "Your Majesty, please reconsider. Relying solely on that tree spirit who was born not long ago, what can be accomplished? In the vast starry sea, it may encounter some disaster and fall halfway. Wouldn't Your Majesty's escape method be abandoned halfway..."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping waved his hand to interrupt him.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the inverted Lingmu, he corrected: "It's not an escape method, but a way to preserve information."</p><p></p><p>Yijue Daoren sighed: "What's the difference?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping narrowed his eyes and remained silent without answering.</p><p></p><p>In this [Huawai Zhimu], not only the image data of all events that have occurred since the opening of the Holy Dynasty are preserved.</p><p></p><p>Even the true spirits and memories that have fallen during this period and were originally located in the Yingling Seat will be transferred here when activated.</p><p></p><p>This is a backup left by the Holy Emperor for the entire Holy Dynasty, inspired by the Taiyan Sect's theory of information indestructibility.</p><p></p><p>Or, it is more appropriate to describe it with the word "proof".</p><p></p><p>If Li Ping wins, there is no need to mention it. Huawai Zhimu will not be activated at all.</p><p></p><p>But if Li Ping loses, then when the Great Qi is destroyed, this Huawai Zhimu will wrap the true spirits of the people of the Holy Dynasty and fly into the depths of the void.</p><p></p><p>If it were a physical entity, it would definitely not be able to escape Chuanfa's obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Duoye Sect will create a disturbance at that time.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the Holy Emperor has doubts about the decisive battle. After all, there is no position reserved for any living being on Huawai Zhimu.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Emperor wants to leave a final proof of existence for the countless people who follow and believe in him.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that in the thousands of years when the Wanxian Alliance ruled half of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty was not the first to rise up.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years ago, there was an example of various realms uniting and rising up to resist.</p><p></p><p>But after their failure, all information about them was erased and sealed by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It was as if these failures had never come.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's move was to avoid such things from happening again.</p><p></p><p>"Even if we lose, our existence will not be erased!"</p><p></p><p>"If possible, when Huawai Zhimu returns to Xuanhuang in many years and inspires future generations, that would be even better."</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>Emotions surged and were quickly calmed.</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa Tianzun." Li Ping repeated this name in his mind again.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with his current strength, he already had a thirty percent chance of not losing to Chuanfa. He might even win.</p><p></p><p>After all, after comprehending the starry sea, he already understood the current limit of this extremely dark starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Even if Chuanfa had oppressed Xuanhuang for nearly ten thousand years, he definitely had not broken the current limit of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>But what made Li Ping feel uneasy was the shadow behind Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Ping didn't know much about this person, the vague feeling in his heart told him that this person should never be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>To be able to conspire with Chuanfa, his strength should not be weak either.</p><p></p><p>"I can deal with Chuanfa. But if Tianyi is added..."</p><p></p><p>Although it was not optimistic, the Holy Emperor's plan to launch a general attack in three years was not an impulse.</p><p></p><p>Three years later was a very special point in time.</p><p></p><p>The sensing from the vast true meaning of the starry sea source told him that in three years, the starry sea would once again erupt with the power of source revival.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the revival power from the starry sea would launch a large-scale struggle with the remnant power of catastrophe scattered throughout the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Under the collision of two huge forces, the cultivators in the starry sea, as long as they had not reached the point of being able to contend with the two, would inevitably be affected.</p><p></p><p>This was true for both the cultivators who had comprehended the starry sea and the believers of the power of catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>And this kind of influence, when manifested in specific cultivators, was that the upper limit of strength would be greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>Just like those with larger bodies would be exposed to more wind and waves in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>Those with stronger cultivation would be more deeply affected by the power of the starry sea and catastrophe in the extremely dark starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa and Tianyi, these two existences standing at the peak of the starry sea, would be temporarily pulled down.</p><p></p><p>Although the Holy Emperor would also have his strength reduced, on one hand, a large part of his combat power came from the fortune of the Holy Dynasty. As long as the Holy Dynasty did not fall, the strength he could exert could always be maintained at a relatively stable level.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, he had a mysterious connection with the true meaning of the starry sea source. Under its protection, compared to other existences in the starry sea, he only needed to face the impact of the power of catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>"Through brief communication with the true meaning of the starry sea source, I am certain that no cultivator had contact with it before me. Although I don't know why Chuanfa and the others have not discovered the revival of the true meaning of the starry sea source in the past ten thousand years. But undoubtedly, it is a fortunate thing for me."</p><p></p><p>"Not only has it reduced the gap between us to a certain extent. I can even borrow the power of this vast starry sea to a certain degree."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that compared to the lack of choice in the Xuanhuang Realm, this starry sea is now in vigorous rebirth, and my power is too small. There is only one chance..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor stood in front of the inverted Lingmu, speculating on various scenarios that might be encountered in the great battle three years later.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Yijue Daoren of the Duoye Sect tried to persuade him, he remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"If we can borrow the power of catastrophe, maybe the chances of winning will increase a bit more."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>And he would never have thought that in the distant other end of the starry sea, a group of existences trying to master the power of the starry sea catastrophe had also seen through the anomalies that would occur in three years.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxian Boat, Duanxian Building.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian, who was in seclusion, also known as the Holy Fetus Li Fan, was hastily summoned.</p><p></p><p>At the general meeting of all core members of Duanxian Building, Ai Tianjue spoke and announced an event that might have a significant impact on the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>"The remnant power of catastrophe in various parts of the starry sea is constantly increasing and is expected to reach its peak within three years?"</p><p></p><p>"Affected by this, the true immortal power attached to the Sea of Artifacts will also form a resonance. The fluctuations that are usually amplified are a great opportunity for us to search for effective realm-destroying artifacts. This good opportunity comes once in a thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>"If it goes well, we may be able to collect enough artifacts needed for the next hundred years in one go!"</p><p></p><p>Now, due to the scarcity of realm-destroying artifacts, the research on true immortal seal characters by Duanxian Building can be said to be progressing very slowly.</p><p></p><p>Often, several cultivators share the same artifact.</p><p></p><p>Only true power holders and their disciples have the opportunity to enjoy it alone.</p><p></p><p>Almost every cultivator in Duanxian Building was confident that their aptitude was not inferior to others. If everyone had sufficient artifacts to study, the difficulty of research would definitely be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"What I'm more concerned about is why this phenomenon would occur?" The voice of Chi Gongdao came.</p><p></p><p>He did not attend the meeting in person, and the one speaking was only a pen woven with flesh and hair.</p><p></p><p>The pen of flesh and blood danced in the void, gesturing: "The Immortal Boat has always had very detailed records of the fluctuations of the power of catastrophe. Such an abnormal phenomenon has never appeared before."</p><p></p><p>"And abnormality either means opportunity or..."</p><p></p><p>"Disaster!"</p><p></p><p>The pen of flesh and blood wrote a large character in the air.</p><p></p><p>A strange fluctuation emanated from the character. All the cultivators present couldn't help but feel a chilling coldness in their hearts, as if they were beside a ten-thousand-zhang deep abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Gongdao, don't mess around." A blue-haired elder said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>With a glance, he actually absorbed the character into his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The speaker was the second elder of Duanxian Building, the host of this council meeting, Gan Jingda.</p><p></p><p>After stopping Chi Gongdao's mischievous behavior, Gan Jingda said in a deep voice: "However, what you said is not entirely unreasonable. In fact, we have already analyzed it privately in advance."</p><p></p><p>"This anomaly is different from the previous resonating star force disturbance. I'm afraid the root of the anomaly still comes from this starry sea itself."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the scene became quiet.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were all thinking about the deep meaning represented by this sentence.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was not stupid, they were very clear that the source of their power now came from the remnant true immortal power in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>But for the entire starry sea, this true immortal power was a foreign object, a heresy.</p><p></p><p>It was an existence that needed to be cleaned up.</p><p></p><p>From the current trend, there was no possibility that the two could be integrated with each other.</p><p></p><p>What could be the possible result of the impending anomaly?</p><p></p><p>The power of catastrophe going out of control? For the Xuanxian Boat, which is now living very difficultly and can be described as walking on thin ice, it may not necessarily be a good thing. Although the true immortal power that can be used in the future may increase, correspondingly, the crisis faced will also definitely increase simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>And if the starry sea gains the upper hand. Then the prospects for the Xuanxian Boat are even less optimistic.</p><p></p><p>After losing the weapons they once wielded, the strength of these remnants belonging to the true immortal power will definitely be greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>Unless they are willing to change doors and return to the path of enlightenment cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>A subtle atmosphere circulated in the field.</p><p></p><p>Having tasted the ability to dominate the true immortal power with a raise of the hand, who would be willing to cultivate slowly step by step?</p><p></p><p>Ai Tianjue coughed lightly, breaking the silence in the field: "Everything now is still speculation, and there is no substantial evidence."</p><p></p><p>"Since ancient times, the Xuanxian Boat has experienced countless catastrophes. I believe we can safely pass this anomaly as well."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators responded with applause.</p><p></p><p>"However, this anomaly is after all a major event. We have decided that from today, the Immortal Boat will enter an emergency state of war readiness."</p><p></p><p>"Be prepared to enter a state of war at any time." Gan Jingda announced the purpose of this meeting.</p><p></p><p>Although no one raised any objections, the heavy expressions on their faces were evident.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan suddenly spoke up, attracting everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"When the anomaly occurs, will the suction force in the starry sea also be affected to a certain extent?"</p><p></p><p>"I have heard before that there is an existence in the Xuanhuang Realm on the other side of the starry sea. Compared with our Immortal Boat, that place with a relatively intact cultivation realm has much more abundant resources. Previously, it was considered that the journey was too far and affected by the suction force of the starry sea, so the Immortal Boat's long-distance trip was not worth it. Now..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, everyone's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Gan Jingda and Ai Tianjue looked at each other, seeming to be discussing something.</p><p></p><p>Then, under the expectant eyes of everyone, they said, "The Council of Elders will conduct research and make a specific assessment of the feasibility of this matter."</p><p></p><p>"If feasible..."</p><p></p><p>"Our Immortal Boat may be able to find a place to settle down on the other side of the starry sea."</p>

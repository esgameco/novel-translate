            <p>Above, many buildings seemed to have grown out from the top of the stone cave, hanging upside down in midair.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also saw stone statues that looked like cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Their feet merged with the buildings, hanging upside down on top, desperate and helpless with hands outstretched, seeking help.</p><p></p><p>But their bodies were forever frozen in this moment, with faces full of fear.</p><p></p><p>"This should be a mountain peak of the Heavenly Machine Sect, coincidentally swallowed by this Guiyuan Toad."</p><p></p><p>"Judging by the looks of it, they were petrified as a whole before being swallowed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his guard and flew above the hollow.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring these petrified cultivators, he navigated through the ruins, heading straight for the most conspicuous stone tower.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Skylight Tower,' a vital place for the Heavenly Machine Sect to probe the heavens."</p><p></p><p>Arriving in front of the stone tower, Li Fan discovered that even after thousands of years, a faint glow still radiated from it.</p><p></p><p>"Although restricted, unfortunately, it's just superficial."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly unhindered, Li Fan entered the Skylight Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The moment he entered, Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Because he felt a malicious gaze staring at him fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Following the line of sight, Li Fan saw a cultist with unkempt hair standing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The face was sinister, with one eyeball protruding as if trying to pop out of the socket, staring fixedly at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The lower body of the cultist had also turned into stone, similar to the disciples of the Heavenly Machine Sect outside. But the upper body seemed to be in the process of petrification, presenting a bizarre appearance of flesh and stone intertwined.</p><p></p><p>"Dead or alive?"</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be negligent, Li Fan quickly unleashed the Five Elements Annihilation Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The black light sword struck the cultist's body.</p><p></p><p>Upon piercing through the chest, the cultist's body instantly shattered into pieces, scattering on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Only that semi-petrified eyeball remained floating in the air, its pupil tightly fixed on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan slowly approached, the eyeball continued to change positions.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the eyeball seemed to sense his presence, continuously locking onto his position.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in front of the petrified eyeball, and waiting for a while, it showed no other reaction.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took it in his hand and examined it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out it's not a real eyeball but was implanted into the body of the deceased cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Weird, I don't remember Xiao Heng and the others having found this..."</p><p></p><p>"Did they overlook it? Or was it secretly hidden by Linghu Chang?"</p><p></p><p>After playing with it for a while, Li Fan found no use for the eyeball.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily putting it in his embrace, Li Fan continued to explore inside the Skylight Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Skylight Tower had a total of nine levels.</p><p></p><p>From the second to the fifth level, scattered on the ground were some jade slips and magical tools.</p><p></p><p>However, most of them were already damaged.</p><p></p><p>After finding a storage ring, Li Fan joyfully stored the intact items in his bag.</p><p></p><p>"The Book of Cosmic Destiny," "Nine Heavens One Qi Art," "Heavenly Intent Descend Technique," "Thousand Machinery Confusion Records"...</p><p></p><p>There were cultivation techniques as well as research works on the "Heavenly Machine."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Li Fan had gathered a total of twenty-six cultivation techniques and forty-eight books.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were seventeen cultivation techniques for the Golden Core stage and nine for the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>"What a windfall, but I wonder how many unique ones are among them."</p><p></p><p>"However, out of these cultivation techniques, only two show signs of someone practicing them. I doubt the proportion of cultivation techniques in the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals would be too high."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stored his joy and continued upwards.</p><p></p><p>On the sixth to eighth levels, various unusual objects were displayed.</p><p></p><p>Such as a lotus flower with a human face among its petals.</p><p></p><p>An unknown fruit shaped like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>Rectangular stones with natural patterns.</p><p></p><p>These extraordinary objects seemed to have been enveloped in some special power.</p><p></p><p>However, with the passage of time, this power had completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Now they just looked peculiar.</p><p></p><p>"These should be the objects used by the Heavenly Machine Sect to sense cosmic patterns." Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>According to the Heavenly Machine Sect, the qi of heaven and earth interact and manifest in the world.</p><p></p><p>Those phenomena that defy common sense are the products of intense interplay of the cosmic energies.</p><p></p><p>By relying on these objects, one could deeply comprehend the cosmic patterns.</p><p></p><p>"It's like how I relied on the Sea of the Pearl to sense the cosmic patterns back then." Li Fan didn't care whether these objects were useful or not; he collected them all.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he arrived at the ninth level of the Skylight Tower.</p><p></p><p>Upon opening it, it was completely empty, devoid of anything.</p><p></p><p>"Just as Xiao Heng mentioned." As expected, Li Fan wasn't disappointed.</p><p></p><p>After carefully searching around and finding nothing of value, he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, inspiration struck, and he turned back.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the empty space of the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>"From the situation outside, the calamity encountered by the Heavenly Machine Sect on this mountaintop was sudden."</p><p></p><p>"They had no time to react and fell victim to it."</p><p></p><p>"Not even having time to save their lives, let alone transfer their treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Then why is the ninth level of the Skylight Tower empty?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan grew suspicious, feeling like there might be some hidden secret here.</p><p></p><p>However, despite searching thoroughly, he couldn't find anything valuable.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like it was wishful thinking on his part.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Li Fan decided to use the Five Elements Annihilation Sword to cut off the ninth level of the stone tower separately.</p><p></p><p>The black annihilation light cut through like butter, destroying the thousands of years old restrictions remaining in the Skylight Tower.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, amidst a massive rumble, the topmost level of the Skylight Tower was enveloped by Li Fan and stored in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied, Li Fan nodded in contentment.</p><p></p><p>He then meticulously searched through the ruins inside and out.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, in several other separate caves, he found four cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Three Golden Core stage and one Nascent Soul stage cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>And this Nascent Soul cultivation method was none other than the "Thousand Machinery Jade Sphere Gold Manual."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this cave on the outskirts of the ruins was accidentally exposed a few decades later, which led to Kou Hong and his brother's discovery."</p><p></p><p>"However, the luck of these two indeed was quite terrible. If they had searched a bit more diligently, they would have discovered the true ruins of the Heavenly Machine Sect not far away."</p><p></p><p>"But because Kou Hong saw the Nascent Soul cultivation technique, he became greedy and missed the treasure trove."</p><p></p><p>Understanding the reasons behind it, Li Fan couldn't help but find it amusing.</p><p></p><p>With a bountiful harvest, Li Fan didn't linger any longer.</p><p></p><p>Transforming back into a Stone Spirit Worm, he carved a passage out of the now resealed stone wall and left the Hundred Stone Cave Heaven, heading towards the direction of the Clouds Cluster Sea.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Liu Li Island.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao had been feeling very troubled, chaotic, and anxious recently.</p><p></p><p>"To go or not to go?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao frowned, sighing deeply.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when he was practicing the "Mountain-Sitting Technique" some time ago, he suddenly felt a strange resonance.</p><p></p><p>Another person was inexplicably cultivating the "Mountain-Sitting Technique" in this world.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the "Mountain-Sitting Technique" was already an extremely slow cultivation method, and now there was another person practicing it alongside him.</p><p></p><p>How could this work?</p><p></p><p>It was basically impossible to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation technique he had been mainly practicing had suddenly encountered this unexpected event, leaving He Zhenghao unsure of what to do.</p><p></p><p>The "Mountain-Sitting Technique" was something he had accidentally obtained while exploring caves when he was young and had never disclosed it to anyone.</p><p></p><p>How did the other party find out?</p><p></p><p>This matter was weird, and He Zhenghao, who didn't have much courage to begin with, didn't dare go recklessly to investigate, fearing the worst.</p><p></p><p>He could only hide in the island's protective array all day long, tangled up in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever's sneaky! Daring to learn our sect's cultivation technique!"</p><p></p><p>"Get out of here!"</p><p></p><p>Thunderous voices echoed over Liu Li Island, reverberating continuously.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was first startled, about to go out to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>Soon he realized.</p><p></p><p>"Is the other party coming to find me?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the powerful aura emanating from the other side, He Zhenghao's face paled immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Core stage?"</p>

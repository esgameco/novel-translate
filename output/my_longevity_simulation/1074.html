            <p>Chapter 1072: How Easily Vows Change</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I was a homeless orphan, with clothes that couldn't cover my body and not enough food to fill my stomach. Every day I struggled between life and death, living in constant fear and uncertainty," said Transmitter Feng, his voice echoing in the circular conference hall, his face full of reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, after joining the ranks of the Transmitters, my fate changed from then on, and I truly understood the meaning of life."</p><p></p><p>Feng then vividly described the brutal battles with the Ten Immortal Sects back in the day, and the careful hiding during the Great Calamity. He spoke of the excitement when the Transmitting Celestial Emperor reappeared thousands of years later and rebuilt the Myriad Immortal Alliance on the ruins of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>His words seemed to transport the Transmitters present back to that turbulent era.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Transmitter Feng declared resolutely, "I, Feng Rui, will forever be loyal to the Transmitting Celestial Emperor and always maintain loyalty to the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"In life after life, I will never have a second heart!"</p><p></p><p>"Just like back then!"</p><p></p><p>Feng didn't play any ambiguous word games, but stated straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>Above the circular conference hall, the countless phantoms of the martyrs all emitted a faint glow, shining upon Feng Rui.</p><p></p><p>Feng Rui held his head high, proudly accepting the scrutiny of everyone present. As if this was a supreme honor.</p><p></p><p>All the Transmitters present, including Jiang, were inexplicably moved.</p><p></p><p>They knew that Feng Rui had already passed the test of the Transmitter's Oath.</p><p></p><p>Zhou, Wei, and Huang glanced imperceptibly at Li Fan, whose expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Feng Rui returned from the center of the hall, and the Transmitters applauded thunderously to show their respect and congratulations.</p><p></p><p>Next, the other Transmitters who were detected to have the Profound Heaven Sect's techniques took turns to speak on stage.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, they all perfectly passed the review of the Transmitter's Oath.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what is going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that from beginning to end, you were fabricating lies to deceive us?" Wei asked loudly in front of the Transmitters, his face somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>This sentence seemed to be an angry outburst after being deceived. In fact, it was to shift the contradiction and draw a clear line.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Puppet Li Fan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the situation in the circular conference hall was somewhat unexpected. It had already exceeded the scope of what he could handle. He was waiting for the decision of his true self.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was remotely controlling from the Lingmu Realm, thought for a moment, but in the end, he still did not take out the footage recorded by the formation at that time - Moru Bin possessing Feng Rui's body.</p><p></p><p>Because the other party could directly use a sentence "the recorded footage is forged" to turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>After all, now that Feng Rui had passed the test of the Transmitter's Oath, it had already legally verified his identity as a Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>"This Feng Rui is actually truly loyal to the Transmitting Sect from the bottom of his heart..."</p><p></p><p>"There are two possibilities for this situation to occur."</p><p></p><p>"Either the Transmitting Celestial Emperor is actually the Profound Heaven King. The Myriad Immortal Alliance and the former Profound Heaven Sect are two sides of the same coin. Naturally, Moru Bin can openly say all this."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the truth?" Li Fan's true self pondered rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of past interactions with Moru Bin surfaced in his mind once again.</p><p></p><p>Although it was playacting, some meanings between the words were still extremely difficult to conceal and change.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"If I guessed wrong, it would just be wasting an Immortal Puppet."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without any mental burden, Li Fan immediately issued instructions.</p><p></p><p>In the circular conference hall.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the questioning gazes of the Dharma Transmitters, the Immortal Puppet Li Fan did not offer any explanations.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he looked straight at Dharma Transmitter Jiang: "I have something to say to you in private."</p><p></p><p>These words immediately caused some people present to be dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>They were all brothers, what could only be said to Dharma Transmitter Jiang?</p><p></p><p>There was a commotion in the hall.</p><p></p><p>However, after pondering for a while and seeing the sincere look in Li Fan's eyes, Jiang still nodded and agreed to his condition.</p><p></p><p>With a light wave of Jiang's hand, a circular compartment appeared in the center of the circular conference hall.</p><p></p><p>Heroic phantoms appeared outside the compartment, blocking the view from outside.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body was uncontrollably flown into it.</p><p></p><p>"You can say whatever you want now. Only I can hear it here." Dharma Transmitter Jiang said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"How well do you know the four of them, Feng Rui and the others?" Li Fan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Every move of all Dharma Transmitters within the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance cannot escape my eyes. Everything they do, any resources they use from the Immortal Alliance, are all under my control. It's just that I turn a blind eye to it. In fact, they are all clear about this in their hearts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then asked, "Then, in your opinion, out of the twenty-seven people present today besides you, how many can pass the Dharma Transmitter's Oath?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you find it strange that Feng Rui and the other three passed the oath test so perfectly...?"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang immediately fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the words and deeds of the Dharma Transmitters over the years.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he knew that they had indeed been a bit too willful.</p><p></p><p>He just turned a blind eye to it.</p><p></p><p>But to say that after so many years, these people still remained unchanged from their original intentions...</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there were some, but only a handful at most.</p><p></p><p>After Feng Rui and the other three righteously and perfectly completed the great oath, Dharma Transmitter Jiang knew that something was already amiss.</p><p></p><p>However, being pointed out by an outsider at this moment, he still felt a slight sense of emotion.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Dharma Transmitter Jiang responded, "No matter what, they completed the oath verification in public. It shows that they still have the qualifications to sit in the position of Dharma Transmitters. Except for the Celestial Venerable, no one can strip them of their power."</p><p></p><p>"As for those who are playing tricks behind the scenes..."</p><p></p><p>"I will personally take action to root them out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately nodded, "I can assist you."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang remained noncommittal.</p><p></p><p>The circular compartment disappeared, but only Jiang reappeared in the center of the conference hall.</p><p></p><p>"The suspicions on Feng Rui and the others have been cleared, they are still the most loyal Dharma Transmitters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>"Just like all of you!"</p><p></p><p>"As for that slanderous bandit, he has already been eliminated by me."</p><p></p><p>Jiang proclaimed, setting the final tone for this incident.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitters also responded with applause.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, some more official pleasantries were exchanged, and then Jiang announced the end of this conference.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitters left one after another.</p><p></p><p>However, Feng Rui and the other three were asked to stay behind by Dharma Transmitter Jiang through a transmitted message, saying that there were still some specific details that needed to be inquired about.</p><p></p><p>Feng Rui and the other three naturally answered all the questions.</p><p></p><p>After learning the details of what happened during this period from them,</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang then nodded slightly and let them leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, only he was left in the circular conference hall.</p><p></p><p>It was then that Li Fan's figure slowly appeared.</p>

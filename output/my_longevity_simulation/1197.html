        <h1>Chapter 1197</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chen Tianhai's eyes flashed with a strange light.</p><p></p><p>"Our Taiyan Sect has been in seclusion for thousands of years, with little contact with the outside world. Your master actually knows where we are hidden."</p><p></p><p>"He must have some understanding of us. Even so, he still actively sent you to contact us..."</p><p></p><p>"This is a certainty that we will inevitably be interested in this [variable outside]."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sun Erlang was stunned: "Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of his master's mysterious background and seemingly omniscient divine powers, he instantly felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, there is no lack of transcendent variables. Some even profoundly influence and change the fate of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Although our Nine Scrolls of Taiyan claim to be able to calculate everything in the world, if there are visitors from outside the world or true immortals descending from the heavens, such things that have already transcended heaven and earth itself..."</p><p></p><p>"We are naturally powerless."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"However, our Taiyan Sect does not exclude or fear the occurrence of such variables outside." His tone was faint, and there seemed to be unfinished meaning in his words.</p><p></p><p>"Visitors from outside the world?" Sun Erlang pondered.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he suppressed this slight fluctuation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No matter what his master's origin was, his current identity was the only destined holy emperor of the Great Qi, on whom the rise and fall of billions of lives depended.</p><p></p><p>As his master's chief disciple, he would always stand firmly in front of his master.</p><p></p><p>"So, does Senior mean to agree to our request for an alliance?" After a brief silence, Sun Erlang asked.</p><p></p><p>"If there is a chance of winning, why would we refuse?" Chen Tianhai smiled slightly, not directly answering.</p><p></p><p>"Then what does Senior mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the simulation has such a deviation, we naturally have to make corrections. Since the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty wants to ally with us, they naturally won't refuse the inspection of allies, right?" Chen Tianhai said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The other party's request was somewhat beyond Sun Erlang's expectations.</p><p></p><p>When he came, his master did not instruct him on how to handle the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Erlang, you can make your own decisions on all matters when you go there. This Taiyan Sect is important..."</p><p></p><p>"And also not important."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang suddenly recalled the last sentence his master said before he left.</p><p></p><p>"If we are timid in the face of a small Taiyan Sect, how can we compete with the Wanxian Alliance for the Xuanhuang Realm in the future?"</p><p></p><p>A sense of heroism arose in his heart, and Sun Erlang blurted out, "The Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty awaits with an empty seat. The Taiyan Sect is welcome to come at any time."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's eyes inexplicably flashed with a blue light.</p><p></p><p>He did not respond, only not knowing what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Since Young Master has said so, our Taiyan Sect will send an envoy to accompany you to the Great Qi to investigate."</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Sun Erlang suddenly breathed a sigh of relief, as if he had just walked on the edge of life and death.</p><p></p><p>"Then Senior, when shall we set off?"</p><p></p><p>"No hurry, guests from afar. Young Master, it was not easy for you to come all this way. Our Taiyan Sect has not had a guest visit for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, you have brought back the remains of Yi Xing."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Chen Tianhai asked, "I wonder if Young Master is interested in our [simulation]?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm curious."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai nodded, and the surrounding ground and decorations disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The two seemed to appear...</p><p></p><p>(The excerpt ends here without a complete sentence at the end.)</p><p></p><p>In the void, a sapphire crystal emitted a captivating glow in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Dao-Transforming Stone Mother'," Chen Tianhai said with an inexplicable tone.</p><p></p><p>"Dao-Transforming Stone Mother?" Sun Erlang repeated the four words.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the mysterious crystal not far away, Sun Erlang was somewhat startled to find that he was actually unable to discern the details on the crystal's surface.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be infinitely divisible, with countless tiny surfaces extending from each mirror-like edge upon closer inspection.</p><p></p><p>After just a brief glimpse, Sun Erlang felt a wave of dizziness.</p><p></p><p>He immediately averted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao-Transforming Stone Mother is the foundation of our Taiyan Sect. Although the Great Master passed down the Nine Scrolls of Heavenly Evolution back then, the method was ultimately a matter of heavenly creation, not something ordinary people could study. Even the most exceptional talents would exhaust their hearts and souls and have their lives cut short if they wanted to cultivate the Nine Scrolls of Heavenly Evolution to perfection," Chen Tianhai flashed and appeared beside the huge sapphire crystal. His figure seemed to merge with the Dao-Transforming Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>"If cultivation is so difficult even for geniuses, it's even more challenging for ordinary people. The characteristics of the Nine Scrolls of Heavenly Evolution's techniques dictate that our Taiyan Sect can only have a handful of disciples in each generation. With a shortage of talent, it's difficult for the sect to grow stronger. Perhaps one day, it will be hard to even maintain our status among the Ten Immortal Sects."</p><p></p><p>"This was the predicted fate of our Taiyan Sect."</p><p></p><p>"If not for the Dao-Transforming Stone Mother."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's tone suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Even a small fragment of the Stone Mother can instantly grant a mortal the ability to perform calculations comparable to a Dao-Unifying expert. What a magnificent creation!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, did you bring the white papers that Yi Xing carried with him before his death?" Chen Tianhai suddenly asked, looking at Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang suddenly remembered and quickly took out the white papers.</p><p></p><p>"These white papers have a name, called the Inverse Calamity Treasure Box. They are commonly used by Taiyan Sect disciples to practice their calculation abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Would you like to give it a try, young master?" Chen Tianhai scattered the white papers in the air, letting them float randomly. He then looked at Sun Erlang and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Restore them in order?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang had previously studied those white papers, and they were all identical, with no special markings.</p><p></p><p>"Purely based on luck, without any special techniques?" Sun Erlang tried asking.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chen Tianhai's expression, Sun Erlang made a quick mental calculation and his face turned slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>He decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. For ordinary people, this is an impossible task even if they spent their entire lives on it. But for Taiyan Sect disciples possessing the Dao-Transforming Stone..."</p><p></p><p>"It takes but a moment!"</p><p></p><p>With a light point of his finger, Chen Tianhai sent the white papers flying and dancing wildly.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they arranged themselves in order.</p><p></p><p>Finally, all the white papers were in place, and after a dazzling flash of light, the treasure box opened.</p><p></p><p>A jade slip and a blue, crystal-like stone.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Dao-Transforming Stone in the treasure box seemed to resonate with the Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the Stone Mother's light, the color of the Dao-Transforming Stone appeared even more profound.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai first put away the jade slip, then caressed the blue stone.</p><p></p><p>With a somewhat wistful expression, he looked at Sun Erlang and said, "Young master, I'll give this Dao-Transforming Stone to you."</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the Dao-Transforming Stone landed in his hand that Sun Erlang came back to his senses.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1159: The Immeasurable Mirror, a Divine Artifact</p><p></p><p>Silver flashes, like bolts of heavenly thunder, fell in succession. ▲𝐺𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑙𝑒 𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑜𝑚 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔▲</p><p></p><p>Under the majestic divine might, the human figure hidden in the black mirror changed from cursing to wailing, and then to begging.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's divine avatar had no intention of showing mercy from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Unlike a clone, a divine avatar cannot automatically absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth to recover. The accumulated power is reduced with each use, so it must be done with absolute certainty.</p><p></p><p>The silver thunderbolts were like a huge millstone, refining the human-shaped black mist.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan's divine avatar took the opportunity to continuously make hand seals, using the "Array Refinement" technique to try to gain control of the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>The black mirror was not an object with an owner, but every once in a while, it was nourished with the blood of the Sun family disciples, forming a mysterious and subtle connection with the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, only the Sun family members could use and even refine it.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's array formations had received the accumulation and enhancement of the Final Detachment Disc over several lifetimes, reaching an unfathomable level.</p><p></p><p>Under the layering of numerous array formations, it was actually able to ignore this rule.</p><p></p><p>Even when Li Fan's divine avatar was refining the black mirror, even Sun Luyuan, who had a special resonance with it, could not detect it.</p><p></p><p>As time slowly passed, unnoticed by anyone, the black mirror had quietly changed ownership.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine avatar manifested its true form and tossed the black mirror in its hand.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that the black misty human figure, which was the "spirit of the artifact" of the black mirror, was hiding in the mirror, trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>It was filled with dread and apprehension towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't care what the other party thought. With slightly narrowed eyes, in an instant, he already knew the origin of this Sun family's ancestral treasure.</p><p></p><p>More than a thousand years ago, the Sun brothers, Sun Luyuan and Sun Luyao, accidentally discovered a slightly damaged bronze mirror during an exploration of ruins.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the two brothers only thought that this bronze mirror was an ordinary ancient object and didn't pay much attention to it. However, when they brought it back to the Tianxuan Mirror, wanting to sell it, something incredible happened that astonished them.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror actually turned a blind eye to this bronze mirror, or rather, completely ignored its existence! Even though it was in the Tianxuan Mirror space, it simply could not appear on the sales list.</p><p></p><p>After repeated confirmations, the two brothers knew they had encountered a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Next, they tried various attempts to find the correct way to use this magical bronze mirror. But at that time, they were only Golden Core realm cultivators, and their strength and knowledge were insufficient to support them in completing this matter.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother Sun Luyuan found a miniature cave heaven and wanted to use it to advance to the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao acted as a guardian for his elder brother. Although they were already very cautious and careful, man proposes but God disposes. They alarmed another Golden Core perfection cultivator who was passing by.</p><p></p><p>Golden Core and Nascent Soul, a realm apart, as different as heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity for a breakthrough was right before his eyes, so that Golden Core cultivator naturally had no reason to give up.</p><p></p><p>And in order to ensure that his elder brother could successfully advance, Sun Luyao actually used his life to hold back the enemy's attack.</p><p></p><p>When Sun Luyuan successfully broke through to the Nascent Soul realm and angrily killed the Golden Core cultivator, Sun Luyao was on the verge of death due to his severe injuries, already beyond saving.</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Luyuan was overwhelmed with grief, he suddenly discovered that the bronze mirror he had been carrying with him finally showed a reaction at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Although he could no longer come out of the bronze mirror afterwards, it was still better than being separated by life and death from then on.</p><p></p><p>The spirit and the bronze mirror merged, and through this, Sun Luyao also learned all kinds of information about the mirror.</p><p></p><p>The bronze mirror's original name was "Wuliang", and it was a supreme treasure bestowed by the immortal realm to the Xuanhuang "Wuliang Sect" in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, for some unknown reason, this immortal tool became damaged and incomplete, losing most of its former supreme power.</p><p></p><p>Even the spirit of the immortal tool disappeared without a trace, leaving only its shell in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was once an existence above the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing a new spirit, it still displayed some incredible abilities.</p><p></p><p>For example...</p><p></p><p>When entering the Tianxuan Mirror, it could steal all kinds of information from within.</p><p></p><p>Also, after accumulating energy for a period of time, the Wuliang Mirror could release a bit of light and shadow.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, what was portrayed in this light and shadow were things that might happen in the future!</p><p></p><p>Although the principle behind it was unclear, this discovery made the Sun brothers wild with joy.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Wuliang Mirror, the Sun brothers began their legendary rise to power.</p><p></p><p>But slowly, they also discovered the strangeness within this mirror.</p><p></p><p>Because it had been damaged before, the mirror's incompleteness also affected Sun Luyao inside the mirror. His spirit was wearing away, and no matter what methods Sun Luyuan tried, he could not stop it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was only by chance that he used his own essence blood to delay the process of his younger brother's spirit dissipating.</p><p></p><p>If it was only this, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>After achieving the Yuanyuan realm, the new law cultivators relied on cave heavens and were immortal. Squeezing out some essence blood, there would always be some.</p><p></p><p>The real trouble with the Wuliang Mirror was its tendency to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if it had suffered unimaginable catastrophe before. The scenes of the future portrayed by the "Wuliang Light" would always end up with the same outcome after a few times.</p><p></p><p>Endless darkness, great destruction, nothing but emptiness.</p><p></p><p>As if it was the destiny of the entire world, no matter how the Wuliang Mirror portrayed it, it could not escape this outcome.</p><p></p><p>And every time it awoke from the destruction and the Wuliang Light extrapolated again.</p><p></p><p>The Wuliang Mirror seemed to be tainted by the black destruction in the prophecy, becoming blacker each time.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan also went from a former Yuanyuan realm cultivator to a Hedao great cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But he was still powerless to stop the Wuliang Mirror from heading towards destruction.</p><p></p><p>The only solution he could find was to find the missing fragments of the Wuliang Mirror to help it mend itself.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, by relying on the resonance between the main body and the fragments, he actually found another piece of the Wuliang Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But it only slowed down the speed of destruction and did not fundamentally solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>The abilities displayed by the Sun family during their rise to power had long been eyed by those with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the many scheming people outside, the biggest noble supporting the Sun family's rise was one of the highest power centers of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror Holder.</p><p></p><p>One of them, named "Fu", learned of the existence of the Wuliang Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But he did not seize it, and even sponsored the Sun family's rise.</p><p></p><p>It was because he valued the Wuliang Mirror's ability to invade the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"A damaged immortal tool, although incomparable to a true supreme Tianxuan artifact, still has its merits."</p><p></p><p>"You find a way to maximize and restore its power."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, we Mirror Holders may have a use for it."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan knew this was poisoned candy, but he had no choice but to swallow it.</p><p></p><p>According to his original plan, the Sun family should have developed as low-key as possible.</p><p></p><p>But things turned out contrary to his wishes.</p><p></p><p>There's one more chapter that will take about 10 minutes.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1025</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt, with some names and terms left in pinyin:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1023 - Void Gives Birth to Creations</p><p></p><p>"Now it's strictly controlled, so you can't see too much. This thing is not of much use anymore. If you want it, I can give it to you." Tian Xuan Jing's avatar looked into Li Fan's eyes and said with a smile. </p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that Li Fan would directly refuse Tian Xuan Jing's avatar's proactive offer.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's slightly wary appearance, he couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there will basically be no more connection between the secondary body and me. Think about it, would you humans want to have any association with your excrement again?" </p><p></p><p>"Although the wording is a bit crude, the principle is just that." Tian Xuan Jing's avatar said slowly.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's sea of consciousness, the Doomsday Separation Disk emitted bursts of strange fluctuations. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, as soon as there were signs, they were suppressed by Li Fan. Otherwise, the clues might have been exposed in front of Tian Xuan Jing's avatar.</p><p></p><p>However, possessing the Tian Xuan secondary body and standing in front of Tian Xuan Jing, the other party did not notice.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly also confirmed his words.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I will not refuse." Li Fan said, reaching out to take it.</p><p></p><p>Tian Xuan Jing's avatar did not go back on his word, and directly handed over the Liang Tian Suo.</p><p></p><p>The moment he grasped the Liang Tian Suo, Li Fan seemed to fall into an endless world of mirrors.</p><p></p><p>Each square mirror surface showed a different scene.</p><p></p><p>Countless mirror surfaces combined to form the events happening in the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It looks similar to the original Creation Stone Slab. But the stone slab records everything, while this Liang Tian Suo does not have the ability to preserve images."</p><p></p><p>"And to find the desired information from this infinitely vast sea-like mirror world..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, trying to integrate all the mirror scenes into his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, after a short while, the Hua Dao Stone showed signs of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"It's too forced. I'm afraid only the Hua Dao Stone Mother can do it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed in his heart and withdrew his divine sense from the Liang Tian Suo.</p><p></p><p>"How does it feel?" Tian Xuan Jing's avatar seemed to have expected Li Fan's setback early on, and he asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. It satisfies my voyeuristic fetish very well." Li Fan put on a look of lingering interest.</p><p></p><p>Tian Xuan Jing's avatar was a little speechless: "You are a top figure among the cultivators in Xuan Huang Realm after all..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded with a hearty laugh.</p><p></p><p>The two fell into silence again.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Tian Xuan Jing's avatar looked at Li Fan who still hadn't left, and asked in puzzlement, "Do you have anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to have just woken up from a dream: "Ah! If you hadn't mentioned it, I almost forgot!"</p><p></p><p>"We are risking our lives for your freedom, but you are sitting here waiting for success. Isn't this a bit inappropriate?" Li Fan asked with a serious face.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed true that nothing moves without benefit." Tian Xuan Jing's avatar had long seen through what kind of person Li Fan was, and did not show much anger.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party's unresponsive appearance, Tian Xuan Jing's avatar suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, who let them be "partners" now?</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Tian Xuan Jing's avatar finally decided to take out some benefits to send this guy away.</p><p></p><p>"You asked me for information about the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation last time. Although the details of this formation are only recorded in the main body, I have a formation that is very similar to it here."</p><p></p><p>"Together with the [Xuan Ji, Wan Ling Gui Shu] that I transmitted to you before, it happens to belong to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Using the same formation again to dismiss me?" Although he said this, Li Fan's eyes were already fixed on the fingers of the Tian Xuan Mirror's clone.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror's clone felt a bit helpless and broke off his fingers, throwing them over.</p><p></p><p>"Alright. I need to recuperate for a while recently, so don't come and disturb me if there's nothing important," he said weakly.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained what he wanted, Li Fan didn't persist further.</p><p></p><p>He immediately clasped his hands and flew away.</p><p></p><p>"Is he truly greedy or just pretending?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it an act or his true nature revealing itself?"</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought I saw through him clearly, but unexpectedly, I find it a bit inscrutable now."</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan left, the Tian Xuan Mirror's clone actually spoke such words.</p><p></p><p>"Venturing into the starry seas together..."</p><p></p><p>Recalling Li Fan's previous proposal, the Tian Xuan Mirror's clone fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the surging excitement transmitted from the Terminal Dissociation Disc, Li Fan began reading the information on this second immortal-level formation.</p><p></p><p>"Desolation, Flowers Blooming in the Void"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed through Li Fan's eyes: "It indeed belongs to the same set of formations, still so incredible."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanji, Myriad Spirits Converging to Numbers Grand Formation could quantify everything within its coverage into data. Freely transforming.</p><p></p><p>As for the Desolation, Flowers Blooming in the Void Grand Formation, it could create from the void, conjuring something from nothing!</p><p></p><p>For example, all things in the Xuanhuang Realm, as long as one had a thorough understanding of the principles behind them and sufficient immortal power supply, one could recreate a new Xuanhuang Realm in the void!</p><p></p><p>All the rarities in the Xuanhuang Realm could be reproduced in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have a hint of the Fallen Immortal's Eye reflecting the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind: "This formation is indeed marvelous beyond compare, but how does it relate to the Floating and Crossing the Starry Void Grand Formation?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the fragmentary descriptions about the Floating and Crossing the Starry Void Grand Formation, Li Fan carefully studied this Flowers Blooming in the Void Grand Formation again but still couldn't find any similarities.</p><p></p><p>So he could only resort to using the Terminal Dissociation Disc for analysis.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing another immortal-level grand formation, especially with these two originating from the same source.</p><p></p><p>The analysis speed of the Terminal Dissociation Disc reached another level.</p><p></p><p>However, it still took a full seven days before Li Fan finally obtained a possible answer from it.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan's eyes, he seemed to see again those dark golden chains extending from the Xuanhuang Realm, traversing the boundless void, capturing the numerous immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>"This object should only exist in the immortal realms..."</p><p></p><p>"The mortal realm simply doesn't have the materials to forge these dark golden chains. However, back then, the Xuantian King had studied the Heavenly Principles and comprehended this Flowers Blooming in the Void Grand Formation. Through the method of creating from nothing, he stubbornly created them in the mortal realm. Accomplishing what was originally impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Gradually understanding, Li Fan's heart once again rose with a thread of admiration for the Xuantian King.</p><p></p><p>"Only by achieving a complete analysis of the essence of its power can one create from the void. From this perspective, the Xuantian King back then was indeed not far from the realm of immortals, just a step away. If not for the lack of immortal spiritual energy, even among immortals, he would probably be no ordinary existence."</p><p></p><p>With the Terminal Dissociation Disc's continuous analysis, Li Fan gained a deeper understanding of just how marvelous and vast the Flowers Blooming in the Void Grand Formation was.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the Xuantian King who relied on his own strength and self-study to master the various heritages of the immortal realms, Li Fan felt even more amazed.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder after so many years, the Dharma Kings of the Xuantian Sect still miss him dearly."</p>

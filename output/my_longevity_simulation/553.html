        <div class="content">
            <p>The monsters seemed to value him greatly, watching over him without pause.</p><p></p><p>They didn't give Han Yi any chance.</p><p></p><p>Facing the monsters who kept a close watch on him with fierce and sinister eyes, Han Yi had to swallow his saliva and give up his escape plan.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the conditions in this prison were tolerable, and the monsters would deliver food and drink on time every day.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't too uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten days passed, the monsters once again tied up Han Yi and brought him to a stake to be roasted.</p><p></p><p>"I'm done for! If I had known earlier, I would have rather died at the hands of that cultivator before!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Han Yi thought so, a change occurred.</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, thunderous roars echoed.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a torrential rain suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>The fire that had just been lit was instantly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Not only were the monsters extremely panicked, but Han Yi himself was shocked as well.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have realized something, lost in thought, not even aware of when he was carried back to his cell.</p><p></p><p>The third sacrificial offering came particularly long.</p><p></p><p>Within the monster group, some internal conflicts seemed to have arisen. Han Yi, in the prison cell, could faintly hear the intense arguments from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>After more than thirty days, Han Yi was brought out again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the days seemed to be carefully selected and exceptionally clear.</p><p></p><p>And the expressions on the faces of each monster were very serious.</p><p></p><p>The noisy scenes like the previous two times did not reappear.</p><p></p><p>But in Han Yi's heart, there was a calmness.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid, but rather looking forward to something.</p><p></p><p>The monsters hummed mysterious songs in unison, indulging in dance.</p><p></p><p>As the singing and dancing continued, Han Yi approached the fire.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a sudden demonic wind swept through the world.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it blow the monsters, who were dancing in unison, askew, but it also scattered the neatly piled firewood in the center.</p><p></p><p>The flames raged and ignited the monster village.</p><p></p><p>But miraculously, Han Yi standing aside remained unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Yi couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>And the chaotic monsters all discreetly assessed the figure in the firelight with eyes full of fear.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Han Yi's status in the monster village changed significantly.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he no longer suffer the torment of imprisonment, but he was given the most comfortable housing in the village.</p><p></p><p>The food he received every day was the best in the village.</p><p></p><p>When the monsters saw Han Yi, they no longer looked as ferocious as before.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they bowed their heads, not daring to make direct eye contact.</p><p></p><p>Despite the great treatment, Han Yi was a dignified Qi Refinement cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This almost barbaric life made it impossible for him to accept.</p><p></p><p>He had thought of escaping again but decided against it after giving it some thought.</p><p></p><p>This world was vastly different from the world of cultivation, and there was no spiritual energy here.</p><p></p><p>He was no different from an ordinary person without any strength here.</p><p></p><p>For now, he was relatively safe in this monster village.</p><p></p><p>If he rashly ran away, he might encounter more danger and lose his life in vain.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Han Yi decided to settle temporarily in this village.</p><p></p><p>He began to learn the language of the monsters, attempting to communicate with them.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Han Yi gradually understood his situation.</p><p></p><p>This village was called "Zhu" and was located in an endless wilderness.</p><p></p><p>In the wilderness, there were many creatures like them, resembling a mix of humans and beasts.</p><p></p><p>The fewer traces of "humans" they had, the more powerful the monsters became.</p><p></p><p>Villages like Zhu, with humanoid faces and animal features, were considered among the weakest.</p><p></p><p>It was said that deep in the wilderness, the supremes who had fully transformed into beasts possessed the power to move mountains and divert rivers.</p><p></p><p>They were beings that could anger the gods above.</p><p></p><p>They needed to be burned alive in sacrificial rituals to appease the anger of the gods.</p><p></p><p>However, the sacrifices had been interrupted three times in a row by celestial phenomena.</p><p></p><p>The monsters of Zhu village realized the extraordinary nature of Han Yi, the heretic, and had to abandon their plan to burn him.</p><p></p><p>At the altar in the center of Zhu village, Han Yi saw the statue of the deity mentioned by the monsters.</p><p></p><p>It was a magnificent and majestic strange bird.</p><p></p><p>The monsters of Zhu Village kneeled in front of the statue, and Han Yi was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>It also confirmed his previous guess.</p><p></p><p>This deity was remarkably similar to the Celestial Bird of Fate recorded in the "Celestial Destiny Scripture" he practiced.</p><p></p><p>"Although there is no spiritual energy and I can't cultivate, the [Feather of the Celestial Bird] prepared in my dantian for Foundation Building seems to have returned home."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to absorb an unknown energy wandering in the air continuously, causing a transformation in myself."</p><p></p><p>A glint of unknown excitement flashed in Han Yi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>According to the Celestial Destiny Scripture, theoretically, when the magical abilities of the Celestial Bird lineage had reached the extreme, it meant "The celestial destiny is my destiny, my destiny is the celestial destiny."</p><p></p><p>The unity of heaven and self, without distinction.</p><p></p><p>To achieve this in the Xuanhuang World was extremely difficult. Not to mention just the Celestial Bird, even the Lord of Demons might be unable to do it.</p><p></p><p>Hence, there was a compromise.</p><p></p><p>That was to find a small world to set up one's own cultivation place.</p><p></p><p>Assimilating the small world's minor celestial destiny would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>Once cultivated, within the small world, the Celestial Bird would be deemed an existence akin to the heavenly dao itself.</p><p></p><p>A thought could change territories, like a walk in the park.</p><p></p><p>"The Feather of the Celestial Bird is absorbing what seems to be the broken and floating [Celestial Destiny] in the world." Han Yi pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Destiny belongs to the Celestial Bird that refines this world and should not be absorbed by an outsider like me. Even if I practice the Celestial Destiny Scripture and possess the Feather of the Celestial Bird, it shouldn't happen."</p><p></p><p>"The only possible reason for the current situation is..."</p><p></p><p>An excitement arose in Han Yi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Bird that fused with the Celestial Destiny of this world..."</p><p></p><p>"Has fallen!"</p><p></p><p>"And it seems that it has not been too long since its fall. The original world's Celestial Dao has not yet recovered, and the Celestial Destiny is fragmented and dispersed like unclaimed treasures, scattered everywhere!"</p><p></p><p>"The way of destiny is mysterious and unfathomable. Ordinary cultivators won't be able to perceive it. Even if they can feel it faintly, it's useless to them."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm different!"</p><p></p><p>"To me, this place is an absolute treasure trove!"</p><p></p><p>"By subconsciously seeking survival, I set loose the wandering Celestial Destiny, which can summon storms and rain."</p><p></p><p>"If I could absorb all the Celestial Destiny of this world..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of greed and ambition flashed in Han Yi's eyes for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's a narrow escape, there must be blessings in disguise!"</p><p></p><p>He looked towards this vast unknown world, filled with immeasurable ambition.</p><p></p><p>"Once I've integrated the world's Celestial Destiny, when I return to the Xuanhuang World, I'll be like a soaring dragon, unstoppable!"</p><p></p><p>Imagining the scene ahead, an uncontrollable smile appeared at the corner of Han Yi's mouth.</p>

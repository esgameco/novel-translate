            <p>Chapter 1150: Xuanhuang Rebirth Technique</p><p></p><p>"Supreme secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>When Shang Shaojun heard these four words, he was still somewhat skeptical.</p><p></p><p>After all, with his identity and status, he had even entered the treasure vault left by the ancient Dharma Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Among those, there were no divine powers or secret techniques that dared to call themselves "supreme".</p><p></p><p>"Although his strength is great, his foundation is still a bit shallow."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>But when he read two or three sentences of the text sent by the other party, his expression suddenly changed and became solemn in an instant.</p><p></p><p>And by the time he had read more than half of the text, his mind was already rumbling and he was stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Though through myriad calamities, the heart remains unchanged. This..."</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the name of this secret technique, there was no doubt that it was a true profound skill that surpassed all the methods he currently knew.</p><p></p><p>It truly deserved the two words "supreme"!</p><p></p><p>What shocked Shang Shaojun even more was that such a secret technique, which would undoubtedly cause countless brutal fights if placed in the Xuanhuang Realm, was so easily thrown to him by the other party!</p><p></p><p>As if it were a foundation building technique that could be obtained at will!</p><p></p><p>"Exactly..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun suddenly looked up at Li Fan, who was earnestly clearing the abyssal pustules along the way, his heart filled with inexplicable shock.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan never showed any intention of explaining his identity, and Shang Shaojun didn't dare to ask.</p><p></p><p>He could only honestly follow behind and secretly cultivate that supreme technique.</p><p></p><p>This technique was calm, peaceful, and vastly righteous.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to worry about any hidden traps inside.</p><p></p><p>And Shang Shaojun also quickly felt its power.</p><p></p><p>In the dark abyss, countless dark red "blood vessel patterns" suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Like continuous mountain fires, the light flickered.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the appearance of these blood lights, the interior of the abyss also seemed to suddenly begin contracting.</p><p></p><p>Space was squeezed, and the indescribable sound of destruction from ancient times emanated from those suddenly extinguished blood lights.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's eyes were instantly filled with illusions.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see one world after another being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators wailed in despair.</p><p></p><p>Even the heavens and earth themselves had already met their end.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, countless black cracks dismembered the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Countless fireballs fell, stirring up raging flames.</p><p></p><p>A bluish wind blew, freezing all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One doomsday scene after another played out in Shang Shaojun's mind.</p><p></p><p>Even though he considered himself a proud son of heaven, facing such a terrifying scene that felt like being there in person, he couldn't help but tremble and feel great fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike before...</p><p></p><p>As the supreme secret technique automatically operated, an extremely cold aura instantly spread throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun thus broke free from the boundless terror.</p><p></p><p>Although those doomsday illusions were still vivid, Shang Shaojun's mind was crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>No worries, no fears.</p><p></p><p>Like a passerby, coldly observing from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Though through hundreds of thousands of calamities, the heart remains unextinguished."</p><p></p><p>"This, this is indeed a supreme divine skill..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's state of mind was a bit strange at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Under the enhancement of the technique, what should have been a great joy remained calm and undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>But he was even more puzzled about Li Fan who had imparted such a divine skill to him.</p><p></p><p>"There are only a few places in the Xuanhuang Realm that can have a secret technique inheritance of this level."</p><p></p><p>"He's not from our Wanxian Alliance, nor from the Five Elders Society. Could it be that he comes from another destroyed cultivation realm?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun knew that in the Xuanhuang Realm, there were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>They were refugees from other worlds. However, these people often hid very deeply, and even the Wanxian Alliance could not fully know about them.</p><p></p><p>"What is his true purpose for coming to the Chizha Abyss?" </p><p></p><p>While helping Li Fan suppress and eliminate the demonic sound, Shang Shaojun pondered.</p><p></p><p>In the Chizha Abyss, the outbreak of demonic sound was not continuous.</p><p></p><p>After going through a wave of demonic sound, the interior of the abyss became quiet again.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan and Shang Shaojun also discovered some remnants of the demonic sound wave in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Does Shaojun know what this is?" Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun observed for a while and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the remnant of the fusion of different worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Previously, Shaojun said that the demonic sound in the abyss is the distorted Dao of the destroyed worlds. In fact, it is not."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is a complete and grand prosperous cultivation world, how can it be easily eroded by other destroyed cultivation worlds? Even if there is the Dao of destruction from other worlds, it will not present such a scale of demonic sound."</p><p></p><p>"The key lies here, in this sore spot of the Xuanhuang Realm. The Dao of the destroyed worlds, where it connects with the Xuanhuang Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained to Shang Shaojun while observing the interior of the Chizha Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of the destroyed worlds have been transformed into the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm itself."</p><p></p><p>"It's like drawing out the blood from one's body and transferring it to another person. Here, two different Daos collide. The Xuanhuang Dao naturally emerges victorious, but..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He left half a sentence unsaid.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of the Dao has also been slowly changed in this process."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the means of the Heavenly Doctor?"</p><p></p><p>"Dismembering the remnants of the old world, grafting and suturing. Transferring the Dao of the old world, subtly changing the nature of the Dao. Minimizing the side effects of the fusion..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to see that deep within the white fog barriers all over the Xuanhuang Realm, there were countless existences like the "Chizha Abyss".</p><p></p><p>Under their joint transformation, the Xuanhuang Realm was silently undergoing metamorphosis bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"A grand and meticulous operation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the "Patching Heaven Record" bestowed by the Heavenly Doctor, even if Li Fan cultivated to the Harmonious Dao and Eternal Life realm, he probably wouldn't have the ability to perceive these things happening to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just like Shang Shaojun now, even after Li Fan's enlightenment, he still couldn't comprehend the hidden truth for a while.</p><p></p><p>"To probe them in this world, one cannot be timid."</p><p></p><p>"Since we're here, let's destroy one place first and see how they react."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of sword shadows appeared behind him, suddenly accelerating and rushing towards the depths of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun, who was in a daze, hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>The deeper they went, the shallower the degree of interweaving and fusion of the laws of different worlds.</p><p></p><p>The collision of Daos, even between worlds that had already been destroyed, was not something ordinary cultivators could withstand.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic fluctuations swept through the darkness like a fierce wind.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun, at the Harmonious Dao realm, even felt that the Dao spirit he had refined was in danger of being disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>"Harmonious Dao cultivators here are like a boat in the rain or a dying candle in the wind, unable to sustain themselves."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun looked at Li Fan again, his heart full of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party's cultivation level was not as high as his own, he was still able to remain so calm and composed amidst the fluctuations caused by the collision of laws from different worlds.</p><p></p><p>"What realm is he actually in?"</p>

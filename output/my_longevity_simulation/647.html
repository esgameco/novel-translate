        <h1>Chapter 647</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A faintly mocking smile appeared on the blurred face as if it was pulsating.</p><p></p><p>Then, his body instantly transformed from a mixture of black and red to all black!</p><p></p><p>It was as if ink dripped into a pool, and the surrounding space was dyed black in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Even the surviving cultivators who had greedy desires while watching Chi Yan, now had their hearts enveloped by fear.</p><p></p><p>Because the spiritual essence of the world they sensed from Chi Yan had quietly transformed into the spiritual essence of the world: [Ink Kill]!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?!"</p><p></p><p>Not only were they panicked, but even Li Fan was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual essences of the world can be exchanged with each other? Ink Kill can instantly replace Chi Yan and descend into the world without his death?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart raced, his thoughts spinning. The scenes he witnessed today seemed to have opened a new door for him.</p><p></p><p>The first to bear the brunt of this sudden change was Hongxi, who sacrificed himself in a desperate strike.</p><p></p><p>He transformed from being resolute and determined to terrified and hopeless.</p><p></p><p>But once the arrow is released from the bow, he could no longer restrain himself and collided into the pitch-black domain of Ink Kill.</p><p></p><p>There was no earth-shattering collision, no dazzling colors.</p><p></p><p>It was like snow melting into water, his whole body seemingly dissolved in an instant and disappeared silently.</p><p></p><p>Ink Kill's head tilted slightly, a strange smile appearing on his lips.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change caused a vision to emerge above his head.</p><p></p><p>"God-transforming cultivator Hongxi, cultivated for seven hundred and sixty-three years, achieved the foundation of Dao with the [Five Elements Mountain], and formed the Golden Core with the five methods of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Swallowed [Bai Ling Dong Tian] to form the Nascent Soul, extracted [Tai Hua Jiang Sheng Qian Shan] to transform his spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, heaven chastised, Dao disappeared and returned to the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the collapse of the continuous mountain range symbolized the fall of the exalted god-transforming cultivator, Xianjun Hongxi, from the Cloud Sea region.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Ink Kill appeared, Tianyang already sensed the danger.</p><p></p><p>Though he vowed not to be weaker than others in his lifetime, it did not mean Tianyang would just sacrifice himself.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation no longer had any room for maneuvering. At the cost of damaging the formation, it completely exploded.</p><p></p><p>As the earth fire lava raged, Tianyang tried to escape by breaking his hand.</p><p></p><p>While the giant hand still trapped Ink Kill, Tianyang had already quietly fled.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how fast his movements were, he was still not as fast as Ink Kill.</p><p></p><p>Before the fiery red magma could reach Ink Kill, it was contaminated and transformed into tiny black particles.</p><p></p><p>As if a drop of ink fell from the sky and swiftly spread.</p><p></p><p>Before Tianyang could escape far enough, he was caught up by the expanding circular black ink area.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Hongxi's silent dissolution, there were constant sounds of flames and crackling coming from the pitch-black area.</p><p></p><p>Even as the vast black area continued to expand towards the surroundings, signs of Tianyang's struggling could still be seen at the center.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed to only add to his agony.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, all the commotion disappeared completely, and calm returned to the dark.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyelids jumped incessantly.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the material he had used to reinforce Tianyang included the supposedly indestructible "Eternal Crisis Essence Metal."</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking he could hold his ground against Ink Kill for a few rounds, but the result...</p><p></p><p>"The gap is too big. Ink Kill..."</p><p></p><p>"Truly terrifying." Even after witnessing battles involving Heavenly Healers and Grandmasters, Li Fan still felt a chilling sensation in his heart seeing Ink Kill in action once again.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this Ink Kill in this life seems to be more 'vivid' than before."</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Li Fan's misconception or not, as he gazed at the expanding black spot in the sky, he suddenly had this inexplicable realization.</p><p></p><p>The remaining cultivators inside the Cloud City were not just slightly chilled like Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>The situation changed suddenly, and in an instant, the two god-transforming cultivators who seemed to have the victory in their hands had all fallen.</p><p></p><p>This plunged the remaining people into despair.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud City, many cultivators who were in seclusion in the Tianxuan Mirror were suddenly thrown out.</p><p></p><p>Looking confused, they didn't understand the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan Mirror has also withdrawn its empowerment. It seems to have abandoned the Cloud Sea."</p><p></p><p>"What should come will come."</p><p></p><p>After Tianyang fell, the spread of Ink Kill gradually slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Reverting to a humanoid form, Ink Kill's gaze swept over the people in the Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators he looked at were frozen, unable to move, and filled with extreme fear.</p><p></p><p>And then, perhaps in a playful mood like catching mice, Ink Kill didn't immediately attack these cultivators but disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' faces were full of disbelief, thinking that Ink Kill had spared them.</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of hope ignited in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, this was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Black rain began to fall from the sky.</p><p></p><p>As the black droplets descended, everything they touched vaporized.</p><p></p><p>Then more ink-colored substances emerged from nowhere and devoured everything around them.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all, the Cloud Sea was fading away.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, all the black rain avoided the Cloud City in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was like a punishment, making the cultivators in the city watch as the Cloud Sea was slowly erased.</p><p></p><p>Ink Kill orchestrated all these events.</p><p></p><p>"This Ink Kill has a somewhat sinister sense of humor."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the increasingly dark space around him, feeling the weight in his heart gradually intensify as he thought so.</p><p></p><p>Such a horrifying scene completely drove the cultivators inside the Cloud City into madness.</p><p></p><p>Knowing they had no chance of survival, some gave up on themselves, ending their lives.</p><p></p><p>Some, with red eyes, launched suicidal attacks towards the dark area outside the Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>And some just sat on the ground, crying uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Trembling uncontrollably, the advice from his daughter kept echoing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying calamity, life-threatening worries."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With a bewildered and regretful expression on his face, He Zhenghao once again visualized the faces of his beloved wife, Heng Ruoshui, and his daughter He Xinxin.</p><p></p><p>"What a fool I am!"</p><p></p><p>The rapidly changing scenes of this life flashed through his mind, causing He Zhenghao to sob uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he stopped abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he turned and rushed towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Master Assistant! Master Assistant, you must think of a way!"</p><p></p><p>"You surely have a solution, right?"</p><p></p><p>Crawling and scrambling, he made his way to Li Fan, hugging onto the last shred of hope as he asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not reply, he just silently flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>With a provocative gesture towards the pitch-black region outside the Cloud City, the ink color of the world seemed to freeze suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Then, a figure appeared not far from Li Fan, watching him with great interest.</p>

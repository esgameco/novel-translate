        <h1>Chapter 848</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan held the brilliant round orb in his hand and sent a thread of his divine sense into it.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his field of vision changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>The connection with his main body was severed.</p><p></p><p>This thread of divine sense was invested into a body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a vast amount of information surged in like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>The body he possessed was merely that of a mortal.</p><p></p><p>It took several days, amidst a pounding headache, to fully absorb all the information.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face revealed a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Within this brilliant orb was actually a fictitious space-time.</p><p></p><p>It was the end of a dynasty, with corrupt officials and people unable to make a living.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, disasters were rampant, and corpses from starvation were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The common people only wished to have enough to eat, but it was just a extravagant hope.</p><p></p><p>So in despair, they rose up to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Now the flames of war were rising everywhere, and the body Li Fan possessed was an inconspicuous minor character in one of the rebel armies.</p><p></p><p>Because he was digesting knowledge, his expression was dazed, and he was thought to have contracted a strange illness.</p><p></p><p>He was sent to the military doctor for treatment.</p><p></p><p>This military doctor had some skills. With just a glance, he prescribed a calming formula.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan came back to his senses and was about to leave,</p><p></p><p>A prompt suddenly appeared before his eyes: "Discovered the talent of Wang Zuo, Bai Moxiu."</p><p></p><p>"Current favorability: 1."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression couldn't help but be a little strange.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is the Wanxian League doing?"</p><p></p><p>Without too much interaction with this military doctor Bai Moxiu for the time being, Li Fan instead took a stroll around the rebel army's main camp.</p><p></p><p>In just three or four days, he discovered a "peerless famous general", two "ancient divine weapons".</p><p></p><p>As for other malleable talents, there were too many to count.</p><p></p><p>Some only had a rough favorability prompt, but some even had strategy reminders.</p><p></p><p>The other party's hobbies, temperament, weaknesses, he could know them all clearly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested.</p><p></p><p>According to the prompts that appeared, he made contact one by one, catering to their preferences.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, from being unknown in the rebel army before, he gained some renown.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't speak out to remind them, only pulling together a group of confidants and secretly preparing.</p><p></p><p>The rebel army instantly collapsed in a night raid.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan led a group of people and narrowly escaped with their lives.</p><p></p><p>As the leader who led everyone to survive, Li Fan gradually established his prestige.</p><p></p><p>Then, according to the prompts that appeared before his eyes again, relying on just a hundred men, he launched a long-distance raid and occupied a small city whose interior was empty because the army had gone out to suppress bandits.</p><p></p><p>With his own place of refuge,</p><p></p><p>Using this as a starting point, he slowly annexed the surrounding forces.</p><p></p><p>In just five years, he swept through the world, overthrew the corrupt dynasty's rule, and became the founding emperor of a generation.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes shattered layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>Everything returned to the void.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was pondering the purpose of this illusory scene,</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes changed again.</p><p></p><p>It was another illusory space-time.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was a fictional immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The body he possessed was that of a mortal youth who was rejected by the Taichu Sect because he had no spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>The youth begged bitterly, and only then did he obtain the identity of a miscellaneous servant disciple.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking that he could only have a difficult life,</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that by chance, he would find a stone bead in the back mountains.</p><p></p><p>This stone bead had the heaven-defying effect of devouring surrounding objects, feeding back spiritual liquid, and improving one's aptitude.</p><p></p><p>It was by relying on this treasure that Li Fan transformed from a mortal into a true cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, step by step, he became a Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul...</p><p></p><p>In this process, not only did he gain three peerless beauties as his Daoist companions and ancient divine beasts as mounts, but he also encountered numerous fortuitous opportunities, discovering the tomb of an immortal and obtaining a unique immortal artifact in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>After roaming the cultivation world for a hundred years, he eventually became the strongest of his era.</p><p></p><p>The scene shattered once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, after returning from the illusion, Li Fan vaguely felt that his mentality had undergone some changes.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could analyze it, he was drawn back into the cycle of illusory realms.</p><p></p><p>Following that, Li Fan experienced ninety-seven more cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The encounters were all quite similar.</p><p></p><p>Generally, he would start from humble beginnings, then unexpectedly receive a fortuitous encounter. Afterwards, he would embark on a journey of counterattack, becoming the strongest in the world - a clich√©d story.</p><p></p><p>When all the cycles ended, the brilliant spherical pearl in Li Fan's hand completely dimmed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Although the ninety-nine lifetimes of reincarnation experiences were illusory, they were too realistic.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely similar to what he experienced with Senior Sister Zhao, incredibly lifelike.</p><p></p><p>After so many reincarnations, even with Li Fan's current state of mind, he was inevitably somewhat affected.</p><p></p><p>Slowly reciting the Profound Yellow Heart Mantra, he gradually dissipated these experiences.</p><p></p><p>"This move by the Myriad Immortals Alliance is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was enigmatic.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, this brilliant spherical pearl descended like a torrential downpour in some territories of the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators and mortals within were attracted by curiosity and had their minds drawn in by this pearl.</p><p></p><p>They fell into ninety-nine lifetimes of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>When they slowly awakened, although their bodies were not significantly affected, their mentalities had undergone earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>That is...</p><p></p><p>Influenced by the illusions, those who were originally just ordinary people all inexplicably believed themselves to be "chosen ones" after awakening.</p><p></p><p>If it was only a one-sided belief, it wouldn't be a big deal.</p><p></p><p>But they all realized that they were living in a world that had been forcibly transformed by the five long-lived Celestial Venerables, defying the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>To rescue the cultivators of the world from their miserable lives.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after being baptized by ninety-nine lifetimes of reincarnation, these people had indeed become somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they not choose to tough it out, but they would also go into hiding.</p><p></p><p>First cultivate, then cause destruction later.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not explicitly stated, judging from the tone of the Five Elders Society, the impact caused by these brilliant white spheres was indeed giving them a headache.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, "In addition to causing cultivators to subtly awaken, there seems to be a kind of spiritual imprint."</p><p></p><p>"How can a heaven-ordained child be subservient to others!"</p><p></p><p>"To actually implant the notion of overthrowing the rule of the Five Elders Society under the influence of the Five Celestial Venerables..."</p><p></p><p>"A good item!"</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan was not affected by this brilliant spherical pearl.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if he was affected...</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, unlike others, with the [Zhen Zhen] in hand, he could be considered a true heaven-ordained child!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the storage ring sent over by the Five Elders Society, densely packed with what he estimated to be no less than a thousand brilliant spherical pearls...</p><p></p><p>He stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>"The cost of making this item doesn't seem to be high. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been scattered on such a large scale."</p><p></p><p>He took out another one and began studying it.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Analysis Disk emitted a faint glow, deciphering it.</p><p></p><p>"There are traces of an illusion formation."</p><p></p><p>"But more than that..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly frowned, sensing a familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>"Heart Ape Mind Horse?"</p>

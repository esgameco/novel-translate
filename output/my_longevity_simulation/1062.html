        <h1>Chapter 1062</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1060: The Counterattack Finally Begins</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze remained focused on the phantom of the Xuan Tian King. </p><p></p><p>At this point in time, Xuan Yuan Hong's performance was actually not much different from that of other ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fragmented memories of Ji Yu Zhen that gave him an understanding of the Xuan Tian King, Li Fan would not have believed that such an seemingly ordinary person would become the protagonist of an era in the future. His influence on the Xuan Huang Realm would even continue to this day.</p><p></p><p>The scenes recorded on the stone tablet did not last long.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly disappeared amidst the joyous atmosphere where both the host and guests were enjoying themselves.</p><p></p><p>Although this first image obtained from the Blood River was not of much value, it undoubtedly marked a good start, making a breakthrough in the "Seeking the Obscure" work of the Myriad Realms Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, all things are difficult before they are easy. With the first time, the second and third times will surely come soon.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true body, as the Emissary, did not personally commend.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he handed the red rope to his avatar Li Qing, who then passed it on.</p><p></p><p>In front of all the cultivators of the Seeking the Obscure department, the man named Ji Ling, with a flushed face, received the reward of the red rope.</p><p></p><p>Due to consuming a considerable amount of his lifespan in the Blood River, although Ji Ling was only twenty-three years old, he already looked like a middle-aged man in his forties or fifties.</p><p></p><p>However, after cultivating the true Primordial Spirit technique taught by Li Qing, he would have the opportunity to advance from the Nascent Soul realm, thus gaining more lifespan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with surging emotions, Ji Ling stood in front of the stone tablet engraved with his name, imparting his experience of exploring the Blood River to the thousands of Seeking the Obscure cultivators below.</p><p></p><p>Seeing those who were originally of nobler birth and higher cultivation than himself now attentively listening to his lecture, the sense of accomplishment in Ji Ling's heart was simply indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the benevolence of the Merciful Immortal of the Mortal World, how could I, a mere mortal, have such fortune?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Ling's heart was filled with endless emotions, and his faith in the Merciful Immortal was further sublimated.</p><p></p><p>In the shadows, Li Fan watched this scene in its entirety with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the Myriad Realms Alliance got on track, it developed at an unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter Zhou also did not keep Li Fan waiting for long, and soon there was news.</p><p></p><p>"It has been verified. Among the five highest ruling Dharma Transmitters of the Immortal Alliance, three of them actually cultivate the demonic techniques of the Xuan Tian Sect!" Zhou said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"As for the remaining Chen and Shang, even if they haven't been possessed by the demons of the Xuan Tian Sect, they must have been bewitched. They deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>"We can start taking action now!"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou then invited Li Fan to meet and discuss in detail.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had been waiting for a long time, gladly agreed.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Tian Yang transformed from his armor form back into his cultivator appearance.</p><p></p><p>Still maintaining the appearance of a child in his early teens from when he was alive, without changing his appearance.</p><p></p><p>After the two returned to Dharma Transmitter Zhou's private small world, the gazes of the two Dharma Transmitters fell on Tian Yang in unison.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to show any contempt because of his childlike appearance.</p><p></p><p>Let alone among Eternal realm experts, even among Dharma Transmitters like them, there was no shortage of those with strange fetishes.</p><p></p><p>"This is Senior Tian from our Myriad Realms Alliance, responsible for assisting in the arrest of the remnants of the Xuantian Sect, such as Mo Rubin," Li Fan introduced with a solemn face.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang, with the demeanor befitting a Longevity Realm powerhouse, merely snorted coldly in response, not even sparing a glance at the two Transmitters, Zhou and Wei.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Yang indeed displayed the strength of the Longevity Realm, Zhou and Wei were once existences standing at the pinnacle of power in the Myriad Immortals Alliance, or rather, the Xuanhuang Realm. Being looked down upon like this, they inevitably felt some discomfort in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to show it on the surface, they exchanged glances and hatched a plan.</p><p></p><p>"We can take this opportunity to test the other party's strength."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. Relying on imposing manner alone is not enough to truly prove the identity of the Longevity Realm."</p><p></p><p>Zhou and Wei looked at each other, and then Zhou made a suggestion.</p><p></p><p>"During this time, we have been very fortunate to find information about another companion who left the Transmitter Council. Perhaps we can persuade him to act together with us."</p><p></p><p>"This person has a rather eccentric temperament and is ruthless once angered. Even when facing Jiang, he cannot control himself from taking action. With just the two of us, we might not be able to convince him. If Senior Tian were to make a move..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood the little scheme of the two people in front of him.</p><p></p><p>However, it was also understandable.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm, which they considered themselves very familiar with, suddenly had a Longevity Realm powerhouse emerge that they had never heard of before. It would be difficult for anyone to accept it right away.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to consult Tian Yang, and then nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Without delay, Zhou and Wei led the way to find the third Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>On the way, they introduced him to Li Fan in detail: "This person is named [Huang]. Born deformed with two heads and four arms, he was abandoned by his biological parents on the roadside and was about to starve to death when he was fortunate enough to meet the Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. From then on, he became one of the most loyal Transmitters."</p><p></p><p>"He cultivates a special technique taught by the Heavenly Venerate, tempering his physical body to the extreme. When he takes action, relying solely on his brute strength, he can tear apart ordinary Harmonized Dao with his bare hands."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this person's madness is actually all a facade. No matter when, Huang is always in an absolutely rational and calm state. The reason for such pretense is actually a strategy to make people dread him before even fighting."</p><p></p><p>"However, facts have proven that this method is indeed effective. For many years, among the members of the Transmitter Council, basically no one would take the initiative to provoke him. Even if they were sought out, most would just pinch their noses and endure it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Zhou and Wei also had some trepidation about Huang in their hearts, introducing him in extraordinary detail.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in idle chatter, and they got closer and closer to their destination.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in Qu Yang Province, the surrounding air gradually became scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>The fire-attributed energy wandering in the air was raging without any pattern.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, huge fireballs would suddenly descend from the sky, crashing to the ground with a bang, stirring up towering waves of lava.</p><p></p><p>"This place is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Miles Scorching Beach?"</p><p></p><p>In the 114th world, he had assisted in building the Tianxuan Spirit Locking Formation in the [Hua Ling Brook] deep in this place.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the green river in Hua Ling Brook that could suppress the activity of spiritual energy and make one's heart palpitate, a guess suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And the facts were consistent with his guess.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the Myriad Miles Scorching Beach, the three arrived above Hua Ling Brook.</p><p></p><p>The immortal alliance cultivators mining Hua Ling stones here were completely unaware of their arrival.</p>

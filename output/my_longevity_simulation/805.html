        <h1>Chapter 805</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sure, here's the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It's not that Su Yuqing is Mr. Bai. Rather, it's the temperament she exudes, which is extremely similar to Mr. Bai's. So much so that when Li Fan looked over abruptly, he almost had an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Every move and gesture, all natural and effortless. Every frown and smile, all tugging at people's hearts. More crucially, it's the pure "kindness" from the other party. </p><p></p><p>Extending her palm, the butterfly naturally rests on it, not feeling the slightest danger. Even when Su Yuqing curiously poked its wings with her finger, the butterfly still didn't fly away. Instead, it flapped its wings rapidly, as if playing with Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing laughed happily, and as a gentle breeze blew by, hundreds of flowers in the garden bloomed in competition. Seeing this scene while spying from above, Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Favored by the Dao..."</p><p>"No, it can be said that the Dao has descended."</p><p>"The only difference from Mr. Bai is that in this world, there is no spiritual energy, and the energy level is not high."</p><p>"So what Su Yuqing, this incarnation of the Dao, can do is also extremely limited."</p><p>"Unlike Mr. Bai, who has earth-shattering power."</p><p>"The most she can do is summon wind and rain, and move the heavens."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully comprehended the connection between Su Yuqing and the Dali World. </p><p>"Hmm, the Dali World is suppressed by the Fire World. If she herself is not aware of this and does not deliberately guide it..."</p><p>"Then she can only live like this, with some anomalies appearing in her life."</p><p>"Who knows what criteria the Dao uses to choose..."</p><p></p><p>With a light tap from Li Fan, Su Yuqing, who was playing, stood still on the spot, stunned.</p><p>A wisp of spiritual energy flew out from Li Fan's fingertip, circled around Su Yuqing, and returned.</p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but click his tongue in praise: "As expected of the Dao's descent. Even if it's just a small world, the innate talent it brings is somewhat terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"It's just..." After a moment, Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p>"I actually sensed a trace of the Fire World's aura. Completely incompatible with the Dali World..."</p><p>Thinking of how Su Yuqing would soon have a heavenly inspiration and conceive Su Xiaomei, and how Su Xiaomei's talent of becoming stronger the angrier she gets is clearly more compatible with the Fire World, Li Fan immediately guessed the possible reason for all this.</p><p></p><p>The Dali World and the Fire World collided in the void. The Dali World, which was a level lower in energy, was in imminent danger under the constant pressure of the Fire World. Its inevitable fate of destruction in the near future could almost be foreseen.</p><p>The Dao of the Dali World then chose a suitable candidate to attach to.</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p>A flash of inspiration suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p>"Even the Dao of the world itself cannot contend with the Fire World. Even if it attaches to a human body, the result won't be much better."</p><p>"But this is already the Dali Dao's all-in gamble. It definitely won't do anything meaningless."</p><p></p><p>The blue light of the Dao Stone in his mind flashed slightly, and a figure instantly appeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p>It was none other than He Zhenghao!</p><p>"In order to earn some extra money, Fellow Daoist He would come to Dali every once in a while to smuggle some mortals to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p>"This happens to be the only chance for survival!"</p><p>"The Dali Dao, is it preparing to slip away?"</p><p>"If there are no mishaps, it might really succeed."</p><p>"It's just..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "Between the Dali World and the Fire World..."</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"They have already merged very closely. Even the hinterland of the world has a volcano inserted. Therefore, the actions of the Great Li Heavenly Dao were also sensed by the Heavenly Dao of the Fire World."</p><p>"Following the clues and intervening."</p><p>"That's why not long after, Su Xiaomei was born."</p><p>"The plan to escape by possessing a body died in the womb! In the end, it still couldn't escape the fate of being annexed."</p><p>"If I hadn't intervened."</p><p>The Heavenly Dao of the world may not have such a delicate consciousness like humans. But its operation must certainly follow an extremely complex mechanism. It may not necessarily be inferior to what humans call spiritual intelligence.</p><p>It can be understood to make such a move to seek benefits and avoid harm.</p><p>After sorting out what happened in the Great Li world, Li Fan's heart stirred faintly.</p><p>"If Great Li is like this, what about the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p>"The time when Mr. Bai transformed from a mortal to a deity overnight was exactly when the new law had begun to spread on a large scale."</p><p>"The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao noticed it and descended upon Mr. Bai."</p><p>"Was it to turn the tide? Or..."</p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but subconsciously stroke his chin.</p><p>"Perhaps the purpose of the Heavenly Dao possessing Mr. Bai was the same as the Great Li world, and even the Canghai Pearl before the Chiyan Inferno."</p><p>"They were all for the sake of leaving."</p><p>Li Fan pondered for a long time: "There is indeed such a possibility."</p><p>"Of course, maybe it will still hedge its bets."</p><p>"As for what exactly happened, perhaps the answer can be found in the Fallen Immortal Realm."</p><p>After thinking for a long time, he put this matter aside for the time being.</p><p>Li Fan looked at Su Yuqing, who was motionless like a fossil.</p><p>"It's not impossible to lend you a hand. It just so happens that I can use this to test the effectiveness of the 'Sitting Immortal Formula'!"</p><p>As an upgraded version of the "Sitting Mountain Formula", the biggest feature and difference of the "Sitting Immortal Formula" is that the conditions for generating cultivation feedback are no longer so harsh.</p><p>There is no need for the other party's realm to break through to get feedback.</p><p>A drop of kindness is repaid with a drop of water!</p><p>It suddenly underwent a qualitative change.</p><p>Even if they are not like Li Fan, who can be prescient, as long as they do good deeds and make many friends, they can also cultivate at a rapid speed.</p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is under the surveillance of various old monsters and cannot act recklessly."</p><p>"The various small worlds are much safer."</p><p>"In the previous life, the action of the Wanxian Alliance to conquer the small worlds of the myriad heavens has already eliminated those relatively dangerous worlds for me..."</p><p>"There is much that can be done!"</p><p>"The only trouble is that most of the small worlds don't have the problem of spiritual energy."</p><p>"But there are already ideas for a solution."</p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed as he extrapolated his plans for this life.</p><p>Seven days later.</p><p>The Great Li volcano, which had just finished erupting, erupted again without any signs.</p><p>Billowing black clouds obscured the sky and the sun, as if the end of the world had really arrived.</p><p>This time the volcanic unrest was too violent, and even countless fire stones flew into the sky.</p><p>Then they drew bright red lines, crossing more than half the distance of the world, smashing towards the direction of the capital.</p><p>The mortals in the city were all trembling with fear.</p><p>They could only pray to the heavens for blessings.</p><p>But the heavens did not comply with people's wishes.</p><p>After escaping the initial few small stones, in the end, there was still a fire stone, almost as big as half of the Great Li capital, whistling and flying over.</p><p>If it hit, perhaps not a single person in the Great Li capital could survive!</p><p>Everyone was in despair.</p><p>At this moment...</p><p>A sigh suddenly spread throughout the capital.</p><p>Immediately after, an immortal-like elder suddenly appeared in the sky above the Great Li capital!</p>

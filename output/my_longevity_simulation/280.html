        <h1>Chapter 280</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This secret cultivation method should be subject to the restrictions of the rules of heaven and earth after reaching a cultivation level equivalent to the Golden Core realm. </p><p></p><p>Cultivation should become slower and slower.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not see the restriction take effect on Ye Feipeng.</p><p></p><p>At least, not yet.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of his demonic beast bloodline? Is there differential treatment?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there will be an opportunity to test it out."</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his chin, Li Fan started to ponder.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>During the two months when Ye Feipeng's strength was advancing by leaps and bounds, Zhang Haobo and Su Xiaomei had already left Congyun Sea and arrived within the Nine Mountains Province, near the border with Shilin Province.</p><p></p><p>The two of them looked at the white fog barrier that spanned across the sky and earth, stretching endlessly, and their minds were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>It was their first time seeing such a wonder. They stood and observed for a long time before proceeding towards the ruins of the Zhaoyuan Sect in the Nine Mountains Province.</p><p></p><p>Shocked by this magnificent scenery of heaven and earth, Su Xiaomei felt her own insignificance for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, she restrained herself a lot and acted in a low-key manner, only hurrying on the journey.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhang Haobo breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This young lady was really not easy to take care of, with a bad temper and a headache-inducing personality.</p><p></p><p>It was also her first time traveling far away since "growing up", and she liked to join in the excitement whenever she encountered anything.</p><p></p><p>Others would sometimes tease her a word or two when they saw her acting precociously.</p><p></p><p>But she couldn't tolerate it at all.</p><p></p><p>She would want to fight with others at the drop of a hat.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, such things had already happened several times.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Su Xiaomei only had a bad temper and was not stupid.</p><p></p><p>She would only take the initiative to make a move when she confirmed that the other party was a Foundation Establishment cultivator and that she could beat them.</p><p></p><p>When Su Xiaomei got into a fight, Zhang Haobo couldn't just stand by and watch.</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to join hands with her to teach the other party a lesson before hurriedly leaving.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this period of peace can last a little longer."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo looked at Su Xiaomei, who rarely calmed down, and secretly thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, things often go contrary to one's wishes.</p><p></p><p>After traveling in the Nine Mountains Province for some time and arriving in front of the first mountain range that ran through it, Su Xiaomei started to get a little restless and was about to revert to her old ways.</p><p></p><p>Because at the mountain pass leading through the first mountain range, Xixi Mountain, a checkpoint had actually been set up.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator who wanted to pass through had to pay a certain amount of contribution points or spirit stones before being allowed through.</p><p></p><p>According to the information marked on the map given by Ye Feipeng, the nine mountains in the Nine Mountains Province each had their own wonders, and cultivators were unable to fly over them.</p><p></p><p>So to cross Xixi Mountain, one either had to be willing to take the trouble and risk the unknown to cross the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, one could only take these mountain passes that passed through the mountains.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had naturally prepared some spirit stones before setting off.</p><p></p><p>They had also taken some when fighting with others before.</p><p></p><p>So they were not lacking in that regard.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Su Xiaomei staring intently at the person collecting spirit stones in front, her big eyes spinning, she seemed to be plotting some dangerous idea.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo's heart immediately hung in suspense.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't have some strength and background, how would they dare to set up a toll station in such a place?</p><p></p><p>This group of people was obviously not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly pulled at her clothes and signaled with his eyes for Su Xiaomei not to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei gave him a white eye and transmitted her voice, saying, "Am I that stupid? With so many people here choosing to obediently pay the fee, even those Golden Core cultivators are doing so."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a few spirit stones, how could I rashly cause trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo couldn't help but be a little surprised and asked, "Then what are you scheming?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I won't make a move, someone else will."</p><p></p><p>"Look at that person!" Su Xiaomei pointed discreetly at a certain cultivator in front.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo looked in the direction and saw that this person was already about to approach the place where the spirit stones were being collected.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>He seemed to look down upon the cultivators who had obediently paid the spirit stones before.</p><p></p><p>"There's a good show to watch."</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei, who wished for chaos under the heavens, excitedly said.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo also became interested.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the cultivation method Xiaomei practiced was very sensitive to the emotional changes around her.</p><p></p><p>Since she said so, it meant that this cultivator would almost certainly clash with the toll-collecting organization.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Zhang Haobo curious was that this person clearly only seemed to have Foundation Establishment cultivation, so where did his confidence come from?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was a big shot concealing his cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he didn't have to wait long.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>He stood tall in front of the passage and didn't move for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed cultivator in charge of collecting the fee saw this and became a little impatient, urging him.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have any!"</p><p></p><p>That person snorted coldly and looked at him with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Don't have any? A pauper trying to join in the excitement? Get lost!" The black-clothed cultivator glared and was about to take action to drive him away.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing the other party's eyes that looked at him as if looking at an ant, he couldn't help but feel a little flustered and hesitated.</p><p></p><p>When going out into the world, having a broad perspective was very important.</p><p></p><p>In this Nine Mountains Province where dragons and snakes intermingled, who knew how many cultivators had provoked people they shouldn't have and were casually slapped to death.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this person's demeanor, if he wasn't mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>Then he had concealed his cultivation and deliberately came to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed cultivator pondered for a moment and didn't rush to take action.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he retreated slightly to open up some distance.</p><p></p><p>Then he started calling for people.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just someone who worked for a salary.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't handle it himself, naturally someone else could.</p><p></p><p>"You wait!"</p><p></p><p>He uttered a vicious remark, then retreated into the protective formation inside the mountain pass.</p><p></p><p>Soon, four or five cultivators rushed over from inside the mountain pass.</p><p></p><p>The one leading them was an effeminate-looking male Nascent Soul cultivator with long flowing hair.</p><p></p><p>He came to the front of the troublemaking man and looked him up and down with interest.</p><p></p><p>"You're an interesting fellow. Since you don't have spirit stones, just go back. What's the point of blocking the way here?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you think our Lingyuan Sect is easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>The effeminate man said with a smile, but his eyes were full of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Above his head, a peach blossom grotto-heaven suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Pink petals fluttered in the wind, and the powerful oppressive might of a Nascent Soul cultivator instantly permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>Many Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators affected by the Nascent Soul oppression instantly turned pale and trembled.</p><p></p><p>What surprised all the cultivators present was that this Nascent Soul oppression seemed to have no effect on the troublemaking man at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he smiled slightly and directly exposed the effeminate man's identity: "Shen Yurou, you're still such a sissy."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Shen Yurou's face greatly changed and the peach blossom grotto-heaven above his head suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, he stared at the troublemaking man in front of him with full vigilance.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>The troublemaking man patted his clothes and said somewhat casually, "Just by changing into a set of clothes, you don't recognize me anymore?"</p><p></p><p>With his words, the blue cloth garment on the man's body instantly emanated a golden glow.</p><p></p><p>It turned into a shining golden armor.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yurou was stunned at first, then seemed to remember something and said with some shock, "Wo Wudi?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his figure retreated.</p><p></p><p>After pulling away a distance, he suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Turning his head back, he looked at [Wo Wudi] and asked suspiciously, "Didn't you break through to the Deity Transformation stage? How come you've become a Foundation Establishment cultivator again?"</p><p></p><p>[Wo Wudi] shrugged, looking indifferent: "I felt I cultivated wrong, so I simply started over."</p>

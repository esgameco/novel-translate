        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fanneng raising this tricky and peculiar question did not surprise Huangfu Song in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Instead, chuckling, he countered, "If you ask me, who should I ask?"</p><p></p><p>"If you are truly curious, why not experience it yourself later?" </p><p></p><p>Having been mocked by Huangfu Song, Li Fan didn't mind. </p><p></p><p>In his limited knowledge, since the Tianxuan Mirror had a thousand threads of connection with the supreme treasure of the ancient Xuantian Sect, the Xuantian Treasure Mirror, then it was very likely that the Hualingshi and the Jue Xianshi were also the same thing.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song's words were, in fact, on point. </p><p></p><p>He had used the Jue Xianshi in the Meteor Immortal Realm before. </p><p></p><p>When he sees the Hualingshi again later, he will naturally know whether these two are the same thing or not.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Wanli Yanfen Marsh was truly a desolate place.</p><p></p><p>After traveling rapidly on the Dust-Crossing Boat for several days, all Li Fan saw was the unchanging post-apocalyptic desolation.</p><p></p><p>In this journey, there would occasionally be bursts of molten fire suddenly erupting from the ground, resembling dark red flying dragons stirring up chaos and turmoil in the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such terrifying situations, the Dust-Crossing Boat had to choose detours.</p><p></p><p>The dangers did not only come from underground; there were also constant deadly threats from above. </p><p></p><p>Unpredictably, meteors would suddenly fall from the sky, colliding with the ground and erupting terrifying energy that could destroy everything.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once witnessed a huge fiery meteor falling in the distance. </p><p></p><p>The shockwave brought by it, along with the scorching flames, blew the Dust-Crossing Boat like a floating duckweed in the wind, losing control and constantly tumbling.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of place is this..."</p><p></p><p>In the Wanli Yanfen Marsh, every step was perilous. Once careless, one would perish here.</p><p></p><p>Seeing such a dangerous territory for the first time, Li Fan couldn't help feeling serious.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the helmsman Huangfu Song was experienced and had been here before.</p><p></p><p>After a total of five days, the group finally arrived safely at their destination: the Hualing Gully.</p><p></p><p>Even without Huangfu Song's notification, Li Fan knew from a distance.</p><p></p><p>It was simply because the Hualing Gully was too conspicuous in the Wanli Yanfen Marsh.</p><p></p><p>A slender and winding green ravine stood abruptly on the red earth, appearing like an inexplicable scar penetrating deep into the ground.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly destructive molten fires seen along the way continuously spewed out and invaded the green ravine.</p><p></p><p>However, in a moment of nearing closeness, all of it instantly transformed from red to green.</p><p></p><p>Instead of molten fire, it became a stream of green mysterious energy soaring high into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful. Next, there might be a bit of turbulence."</p><p></p><p>As the Dust-Crossing Boat entered the Hualing Gully, Huangfu Song's "kind" reminder suddenly sounded in Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>Before the words could even settle, the speeding Dust-Crossing Boat instantly lost its power, even the inertia for forward motion disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, it plummeted to the bottom of the deep gorge.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also felt the powerful, spirit-destroying force within the Hualing Gully suddenly becoming no different from that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>As they rapidly descended, his heart felt as though it was lifted.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dust-Crossing Boat, there were murmurs one after another.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan almost thought disaster was imminent, a powerful flow of air inexplicably surged from the bottom of the Hualing Gully, meeting the falling Dust-Crossing Boat head-on.</p><p></p><p>It was like being hit by a strong wind, causing the boat to sway violently and eventually slow down.</p><p></p><p>When the airflow disappeared, the Dust-Crossing Boat barely managed to stop.</p><p></p><p>"Come out."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Huangfu brother! Well met!"</p><p></p><p>A hearty laughter suddenly rang out, and soon after, a slim man bare on the upper body leaped from below and landed directly on the Dust-Crossing Boat.</p><p></p><p>With a loud thud, the boat shook significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Dongfang Brother! It's been a long time!" Huangfu Song's fat face was instantly filled with smiles as he warmly embraced Dongfang upon meeting.</p><p></p><p>"Qianyue Book Pavilion - it has been twenty-three years since we last met. Dongfang Brother, you are as splendid as ever, just like in the old days!"</p><p></p><p>After they separated, Huangfu Song appraised Dongfang and marveled, "Unable to compare with your progress, I envy you!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang, without any reservation, patted Huangfu Song's large belly and joked, "Mutual admiration!"</p><p></p><p>As the two exchanged greetings, Li Fan secretly observed this renowned cultivator named Dongfang.</p><p></p><p>From him, Li Fan felt no traces of spiritual energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>And when he leaped onto the Dust-Crossing Boat from below, it seemed he solely relied on his physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Though his body appeared somewhat fragile, the distinct muscle lines showed hidden explosive strength within.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Fan had encountered someone with such a robust physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Rest here for a few days, Huangfu Brother. In most half a month, the great formation here will be completed," Dongfang said to Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a strange call suddenly emanated from his throat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, feeling somewhat familiar with the sound.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the "ground" beneath their feet - the Dust-Crossing Boat - began to sway.</p><p></p><p>A distant and resounding cry came from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the land began to move and fly.</p><p></p><p>Continuing downwards, it plunged into the depths of the Hualing Gully.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Rift Realm Whale?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>It was a massive black beast.</p><p></p><p>From its appearance, it was extremely similar to the Rift Realm Whale that Li Fan had seen before, which sealed off mortal realms.</p><p></p><p>"The airflow that just prevented the Dust-Crossing Boat from falling seems to have been emitted by this strange whale."</p><p></p><p>As the huge beast continued to dive deep, Li Fan carefully observed, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a Rift Realm Whale; it's much smaller. They just look somewhat similar."</p><p></p><p>The Hualing Gully did not seem to have a bottomless abyss.</p><p></p><p>After about half a day's time, with the giant beast emitting a cheerful cry, the group finally arrived at the bottom of the Hualing Gully.</p><p></p><p>A long green river crossed the deep gorge horizontally.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 276</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As if it were an insulator of spiritual energy and divine consciousness, Li Fan's various conventional methods were unable to probe this stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, I wonder what kind of material it is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan summoned a water blade and controlled it to swiftly slice towards the stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Let alone ordinary stones, even refined steel would be split in half by this water blade.</p><p></p><p>However, the water blade was unable to harm this incomplete stone statue in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The moment it touched the statue, the spiritual energy maintaining the water blade's power scattered and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Apart from washing the statue, it failed to cause any damage.</p><p></p><p>"What a treasure! It's a pity there's too little of it and it can't be brought back to reality."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, it could be used to create an absolutely safe secret chamber."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan imagined the many wonderful uses of this unknown stone material, but couldn't help feeling a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan found a stone on the ground nearby.</p><p></p><p>Using it as a tool, he forcefully chipped off another fragment from the stone statue.</p><p></p><p>He then fiercely stabbed this stone fragment into his own arm.</p><p></p><p>Blood immediately flowed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly frowned.</p><p></p><p>When spiritual energy circulated to the wound caused by the fragment, it could no longer flow freely.</p><p></p><p>It had to take a detour, greatly reducing efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the fragment blocking the wound, it could not be healed with spiritual energy unless removed.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan endured the pain and dug out the fragment.</p><p></p><p>He played with it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, there's a way to defeat Senior Brother Zhang without 'consuming' him."</p><p></p><p>He secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was studying this miraculous stone statue, the battle in the sky had reached a white-hot stage.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong revealed his true colors and joined Chu Liang and others in surrounding Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves from their clashes turned the city of Ningyuan below into ruins.</p><p></p><p>Countless houses collapsed, and who knows how many mortals died without knowing why.</p><p></p><p>Here at the small temple, with Li Fan's intervention, no danger occurred.</p><p></p><p>"Even without me, with the existence of this dilapidated stone statue, these children would probably be fine."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they were still lively enough to organize rescue efforts after the great battle ended before."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued according to the established script.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong was at a disadvantage. He slapped his hands towards Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless mortals were killed or injured.</p><p></p><p>Their blood qi soared into the sky, forming the [Sentient Beings Refining God Formation], trapping Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong pressed his advantage, delivering several more palm strikes.</p><p></p><p>Each strike from the Golden Core cultivator took away the lives of tens of thousands of mortals.</p><p></p><p>One of the strikes happened to slap towards the small temple.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed. He removed his protection and hid behind the remaining stone statue.</p><p></p><p>The palm force encountered the statue and dissipated without any effect.</p><p></p><p>Apart from where the statue blocked, everything else was reduced to ruins.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a vacuum of spiritual power had appeared, without arousing any notice from Song Hesong.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood up from behind the statue and casually cleared the surrounding debris.</p><p></p><p>He continued watching the battle in the sky.</p><p></p><p>After Zhang Qianmo broke through his predicament, entered the Purple Core state, and began slaughtering...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a bit, then pushed open the statue and entered the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>The children inside were initially nervous seeing someone enter.</p><p></p><p>Realizing it was Li Fan, the "good person", they breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Better to come in and hide. It's too terrifying outside." Li Fan sighed and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya grinned and didn't say much, just inviting Li Fan to sit down.</p><p></p><p>There was some stored water and food inside, evidently used as a frequent refuge.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took this opportunity to chat with the blond-haired Lu Ya.</p><p></p><p>He learned that this temple was originally called "Xuantian Temple".</p><p></p><p>They had discovered this underground chamber by chance, it had existed long before.</p><p></p><p>As for who the temple enshrined, no one knew as it had been abandoned for many years.</p><p></p><p>Regarding where the missing half of the stone statue went, Lu Ya was even more clueless.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a little girl nearby interjected: "I know, I know! It's at Mr. Bai's house! Last time when Mr. Bai took me back to treat my illness, I saw it."</p><p></p><p>"Half a body stuck there, no face, really scary!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya was stunned: "You know where Mr. Bai's house is? Then why did you say you didn't know when I asked last time?"</p><p></p><p>The little girl blushed and glared at Lu Ya: "I went there, but I was sick and dazed, who remembers how to get there!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the conversation between the two children, Li Fan was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above Ningyuan City, Zhang Qianmo, who had slain all the villains, was anxiously searching for his junior brother who had sent him a warning.</p><p></p><p>However, even after sweeping Ningyuan City several times with his divine sense, he couldn't find him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking his junior brother had met a tragic end, Zhang Qianmo was filled with remorse.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to give up, he searched a few more times, wanting to at least find his junior brother's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Still no results.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Qianmo could only take the Longevity Fruit alone and left Ningyuan City in grief.</p><p></p><p>Not long after he left, at the ruins of the small temple, a petite figure peeked out.</p><p></p><p>After cautiously observing for a long time, the figure boldly shouted: "It's safe now, come out!"</p><p></p><p>Following that, Li Fan and a group of children crawled out from the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>The children looked at Ningyuan City, now a ruins filled with corpses, and couldn't help feeling at a loss.</p><p></p><p>However, as orphans surviving alone, their mental resilience was very strong.</p><p></p><p>They were just momentarily at a loss, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>"This Mr. Bai should be coming soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>With no other cultivators left in the city, Li Fan had no more worries.</p><p></p><p>He used his divine sense to search for traces of "Mr. Bai" among the survivors.</p><p></p><p>Based on the children's descriptions, it should be easy to find.</p><p></p><p>A young, gentle, and extremely good-looking scholarly image.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't find any matching targets.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan searched a few more times, but the result remained the same.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the 'extremely good-looking' part was the children's own beautification in their minds?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help guessing so.</p><p></p><p>With no other choice, he could only wait at the small temple for Mr. Bai to arrive.</p><p></p><p>However, to Li Fan's surprise...</p><p></p><p>He waited until the duration of this Fallen Immortal Realm ended, but still didn't see this "Mr. Bai".</p><p></p><p>The surroundings became hazy. Just as Li Fan was about to leave the Fallen Immortal Realm...</p><p></p><p>He vaguely heard the children excitedly shouting: "Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai is here!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai! Mr. Bai!"</p>

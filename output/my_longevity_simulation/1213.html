        <h1>Chapter 1213</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>According to common sense, if it were just ordinary remains, Li Fan should not have sensed any living aura from them.</p><p></p><p>However, these two bones in front of him...</p><p></p><p>Made Li Fan's heart suddenly tighten, as if being watched by some existence.</p><p></p><p>The stone statues transformed from the bones also seemed like they could come alive at any moment, with a hint of eerie aura emanating from them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decisively ended the probing of the Infinite Mirror without a second word.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The bones disappeared, and what met his eyes were still those two seemingly ordinary stone statues.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the sense of crisis in Li Fan's heart slowly fade away.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Sun Luyao was frightened by what just happened and was a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Tell your elder brother to stay away from those two stone statues." Li Fan instructed calmly on the surface, but in fact, his heart had already been stirred up like a raging storm.</p><p></p><p>Those two bones, do they really belong to the Great Wizard?</p><p></p><p>Judging from their appearance, there's an eighty to ninety percent chance they belong to the Great Wizard of Tiandu.</p><p></p><p>But why would two of his bones, as a half-immortal, be in Yishi Sect?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he was so severely injured that he didn't even have the strength to take back his own bones stolen by cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, Li Fan put a big question mark on it himself.</p><p></p><p>Is it possible?</p><p></p><p>The power enveloping the entire Yuandao State, capable of devouring ten years of time, indicates that the Great Wizard should not have fallen yet.</p><p></p><p>With the might of a half-immortal, no matter how severe the injuries, it's not something cultivators below the immortal realm can handle.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the ancient immortal cultivators of the past.</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the timid Sun Luyao, this new spirit of the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>When the Sun brothers first picked up the damaged Infinite Mirror, the spirit of the magic weapon inside was already gone, allowing the two mortals to take advantage of it.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the annihilating wind disaster that erupted from the Infinite Mirror not long ago, it seems that the spirit of the artifact dissipated and the Infinite Mirror was damaged in the process of resisting this calamity.</p><p></p><p>"The Infinite Mirror is an ancient immortal artifact from the primordial times, bestowed by the immortal realm to the Infinite Sect. Even if the immortal realm was destroyed due to unspeakable tribulations, it should not have affected the Infinite Mirror. But oddly enough, this annihilating wind disaster that shouldn't have appeared in the mortal world played out in the Infinite Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan recalled the incident where the avatar of the Holy Fetus infiltrated the Xuan Immortal Boat in the distant starry sea, bringing the invisible calamity from the Dark Star Sea into it and causing several cultivators to die miserably.</p><p></p><p>"Spreading..."</p><p></p><p>"Outside the primordial world..."</p><p></p><p>In the history of the primordial world, the only known person who may have had contact with the immortal realm and came from outside the primordial world is the Great Wizard of Tiandu.</p><p></p><p>The past events here are too perplexing, and there are really too few clues that can be grasped at present. Li Fan could only make such a guess.</p><p></p><p>"However, if the guessed result is more or less correct, then perhaps the trouble with the Infinite Mirror can be resolved." Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>After Ji Hongdao and Sun Luyuan learned about the risks here, they still wisely chose to temporarily leave this secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>But as for what to do next, the two had a bit of disagreement.</p><p></p><p>"The remains of the Great Wizard of Tiandu are no small matter. We should report this to the Immortal Alliance as soon as possible." Ji Hongdao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan expressed his clear opposition: "Brother Ji, you're confused! The Great Master is said to be the teacher of the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao. If the news spreads to the Five Elders Council, I'm afraid they will stop at nothing to snatch him back. A great war will be inevitable, and the people will suffer! With the current state of the Wanxian Alliance, can you guarantee that this matter will not be leaked?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan continued, "In the eyes of those who spread the Dao, there is only the attitude of the Heavenly Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's the bones of a half-immortal, I'm afraid they won't have much reverence. In the Immortal Alliance, the end result will be either being used for research or being placed in the Museum of Divine Treasures for people to observe and point at."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Great Master is a legendary half-immortal, and it's uncertain whether he has truly fallen. If we desecrate him today, we may face his revenge in the future." Sun Luyuan spoke with sincerity on his face.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao was somewhat helpless: "Then what do you say we should do?"</p><p></p><p>"Leave it untouched." Sun Luyuan said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ji, think about it, even if it's the bones of a half-immortal, what benefit does it have for us? With the new laws in place, even longevity is almost hopeless, let alone becoming an immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Taking it away may bring about immeasurable disasters in the future, without any tangible benefits. Why bother?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the end, Ji Hongdao was persuaded.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason was that these were just two bones after all.</p><p></p><p>And they were only the bones of a half-immortal who had not successfully ascended.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was right. For cultivators like them who had attained the Dao, they were of little use.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they were the true remains of an immortal, the choice would certainly be different.</p><p></p><p>"Although we won't take them for now, we can't let others take them either. Brother Ji, your attainment in the Dao of formations is profound. Why don't you use a formation to completely seal off the ruins here? Coupled with the original protective formations here, it will ensure foolproof security." Sun Luyuan suggested again.</p><p></p><p>This was to make his stance and attitude clear.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan knew almost nothing about formations. As long as Ji Hongdao laid down formations here, he would not be able to secretly come here alone to take the bones.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao didn't stand on ceremony and immediately started setting up the formations.</p><p></p><p>After the ruins were sealed again, on the way back, Sun Luyuan said in a faint tone, "If either of us can attain longevity, then we can take out these bones to study. Maybe we can go a step further."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao shook his head with a bitter smile, not taking it to heart at all.</p><p></p><p>If before attaining the Dao, when they were young, they had ambitions and ideals of attaining the Dao and longevity.</p><p></p><p>Then now, having already attained the Dao realm, they had long since given up the idea of being able to live forever.</p><p></p><p>The four steps of attaining the Dao, each step was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The more they understood, the more desperate they became.</p><p></p><p>The two remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Sun Luyuan sighed, "I really don't know what kind of stunning talent can successfully go against the principles."</p><p></p><p>"In our Wanxian Alliance for so many years, apart from the Heavenly Venerable, there has only been one person. And his whereabouts are unknown."</p><p></p><p>"If there was one more, the situation of our Immortal Alliance would be greatly different."</p><p></p><p>"Why do you think the Five Elders Council has five immortals? Could it be that their talents are really higher than those of our Wanxian Alliance, and they have accomplished what we cannot?"</p><p></p><p>This was also a doubt that countless Wanxian Alliance cultivators could not let go of in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Sun Luyuan's lament, as if remembering something, Ji Hongdao wanted to say something but stopped.</p>

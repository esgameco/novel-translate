        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 999: Both Beauties Submit</p><p></p><p>"Those who labor with their minds govern others. When I was the chief of this strategy hall back in the day, I never struggled as much as you," Li Fan earnestly advised. "You need to learn to delegate authority."</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Lu Xichan no longer dared to refute him and could only nod repeatedly in agreement.</p><p></p><p>A brief silence fell over the bamboo hut. After pondering for a while, Li Fan seemed to make a decision. </p><p></p><p>He pointed his finger in the air towards Lu Xichan's forehead. Originally an extremely threatening move that any cultivator would instinctively resist, after Li Fan's three lashes and the distortion of her perception from the True Temptation Fruit, Lu Xichan actually showed not the slightest reaction of resistance. She passively accepted Li Fan's pointing finger.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand types of formations she had never seen before, far beyond what she could currently comprehend, suddenly appeared in Lu Xichan's mind.</p><p></p><p>After being stunned for a moment, Lu Xichan abruptly raised her head. "Master, these are..." Her somewhat weak voice was filled with pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly. "With your untalented appearance, if I only let you work behind closed doors, I'm afraid you would still struggle to achieve greatness even until your demise."</p><p></p><p>"These formations are my new gains from recent years, having improved quite a bit compared to when I faked my death back then. They should be enough for you to study for a while."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan naturally knew the value of these formations. A surge of joy and gratitude welled up in her heart. She promptly kowtowed to Li Fan in thanks. "Many thanks for Master's generous bestowal."</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Sushang..." Li Fan didn't pay attention to Lu Xichan, but turned his head to look at Xuan Sushang.</p><p></p><p>"This junior is present," Xuan Sushang hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the matter between you two..." Li Fan spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, both Xuan Sushang and Lu Xichan's breathing momentarily stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Now that it's already a done deal and you two are in mutual love, it's not good for me to stop it."</p><p></p><p>"Xichan is lazy by nature. If there's no one by her side to urge and supervise her, I'm afraid she will still be unable to escape the same fate in the future..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan passed the golden whip made of soul force in his hand through the air. "I'll bestow this whip to you. In the future, whenever you discover Xichan being lazy, punish her on my behalf!"</p><p></p><p>"Xichan, you must not obstruct her! Understood?" Li Fan stared at her.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan's body trembled slightly again as she said in a low voice, "This disciple understands."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang received the dark golden whip with both hands, looking a bit stunned yet also somewhat delighted. </p><p></p><p>She stole a glance at Lu Xichan, not knowing what she thought of, as a blush appeared on her cheeks again.</p><p></p><p>Still, at the other party's reminder, she finally kowtowed to Li Fan to express her gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"With matters settled here, I shall take my leave first."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could speak, Lu Xichan hurriedly said, "Master can rest assured, I will handle it myself."</p><p></p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Lu Xichan softly added, "Master, be careful on your journey..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled. The next instant, his figure had already appeared in the sky above. </p><p></p><p>"How could a mere minor tribulation possibly harm me?"</p><p></p><p>"But I appreciate your concern, my disciple. Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>With that said, his aura had already vanished from this bamboo sea cave abode.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang and Lu Xichan gazed blankly at the sky. </p><p></p><p>The events that abruptly transpired felt like a dream. In less than a day's time, it was as if the two had experienced nearly half a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes met. After a long while, Xuan Sushang finally spoke, "Since the choice has been made, it's useless to regret it now."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>"The internal conflict within the Heavenly Profound Mirror may not ultimately affect us."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan nodded: "But it's best not to spread the word about what happened here..."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze glanced at the long whip in Xuan Sushang's hand, and her breath suddenly became a bit disordered again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Bamboo Sea.</p><p></p><p>After releasing the previously suppressed servant female cultivators and Shuo Feng, Li Fan and his group were rushing towards the location of the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar.</p><p></p><p>However, the gazes of Baihua Daoren and Lin Ling towards Li Fan were a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Only the young junior brother Tian Yang remained unsurprised, just like before.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they had witnessed the scenes that unfolded in the bamboo building.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with such a big commotion, it would be a bit difficult for them not to notice even if they wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"If such methods were used on me..." Lin Ling's fear towards Li Fan grew a few more notches in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Emissary, whether it's toying with people's hearts or the art of controlling subordinates, he has already reached the pinnacle. No wonder he could be favored by a True Immortal. Among the group of survivors from the various realms back then, there probably wasn't anyone like this." Baihua Daoren inwardly sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't pay attention to the wild thoughts of these two.</p><p></p><p>What he did just now was merely to leave a backup plan.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't compare to the Transmitters, he could definitely be considered a high-level ruler.</p><p></p><p>But after all, Li Fan wasn't really the Dharma King of the Profound Heaven Sect with the same mind as Mo Rubin. He had his own unique secrets.</p><p></p><p>For some matters, it was still better to have his own separate ways.</p><p></p><p>Through those three lashes just now, Li Fan believed that even if there were loopholes in the lies woven by the True Temptation Fruit, they could be temporarily overlooked under the cover of this highly impactful event.</p><p></p><p>As long as one recalled this Master Li Fan, the first thing that would surface in their minds would be those three lashes...</p><p></p><p>With Lu Xichan's personality, she definitely wouldn't be able to take it calmly.</p><p></p><p>As for why he later passed on over a thousand formations to her, it was merely to increase the credibility of the fabricated memories and to give a slap followed by a date, as a means of appeasement.</p><p></p><p>As for later bestowing the golden long whip to Xuan Sushang...</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it was to monitor the actions of the two women, after all, the long whip was formed from his divine soul power, equivalent to another type of avatar.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was also to delay the time limit for the lies to be eventually exposed as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Fan not know what would happen between Xuan Sushang and Lu Xichan after Xuan Sushang obtained this golden long whip?</p><p></p><p>Especially when he even gave the rightful authority to "supervise and punish".</p><p></p><p>They would surely be addicted and unwilling to leave.</p><p></p><p>In this way, for a considerably long period of time to come, the two female cultivators would have to spend their time in this Bamboo Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The less they appear at the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters, the lower the risk of being exposed."</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's scheme.</p><p></p><p>Everything else was not as it appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Thoughts converging, Li Fan's attention focused on the information about the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar transmitted by Xuan Sushang.</p><p></p><p>"Transforming into a mortal, traveling across the world."</p><p></p><p>"Changing appearances and identities every time, never tiring of it."</p><p></p><p>"Suspected to be enlightening the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he sped up, flying towards the most recent location where the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Flow Light State, a mortal city called Wei Capital.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the four had arrived at their destination.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal-Mortal Miasma is indeed true to its name. I had only heard of it before but never witnessed it with my own eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I'm personally here, I feel a sense of disgust from afar."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren sighed with emotion.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 571</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The various attack orders that were just issued were urgently canceled; each state was instructed to strictly guard against infiltration by Five Elders Association's cultivators; no state should easily initiate a conflict, and the current phase of the mission should focus on defense.</p><p></p><p>The mobilization orders sent to various states' frontlines became increasingly frequent.</p><p></p><p>"They change their orders overnight, it's so chaotic!"</p><p></p><p>Almost overnight, the battle strategy underwent a 180-degree change, causing every cultivator of the Immortal Alliance to grumble from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, out of respect for the prestige of the Immortal Alliance, no one dared to speak directly. It was only during private gatherings that there were heartfelt sighs of distress.</p><p></p><p>The progress of the war was not determined solely by the will of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was just a sudden shift from seemingly having the upper hand to a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>As the external war faced setbacks, internal turmoil did not ease.</p><p></p><p>It was said that many high-ranking cultivators at the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance were dismissed for investigation, even some well-established veteran cultivators with deep backgrounds couldn't avoid it.</p><p></p><p>However, the reason these cultivators were subjected to questioning remained unknown.</p><p></p><p>Even after these cultivators were released, even though some had been tortured and looked severely weakened, they remained tight-lipped and unwilling to discuss the matter no matter how pressed.</p><p></p><p>This further led to growing doubts and unrest among the people.</p><p></p><p>After all, no one wanted to be the next one inexplicably taken away for questioning. </p><p></p><p>Yet, Li Fan knew that the Immortal Alliance was hunting down non-existent moles.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard they thought, how could they imagine that the leaker of the Tianxuan Enchantment Diagram was actually a young Gold Core cultivator from the remote border of the Immortal Alliance: located in the Congyun Sea, who had never been involved in such matters?</p><p></p><p>So, this was an investigation destined to yield no results.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, the outcome of the case would ultimately lead to several unfortunate scapegoats being coerced into confessing and hastily closing the case.</p><p></p><p>And on Li Fan's list of injured, there would be several more innocents added.</p><p></p><p>Having gained a rough understanding of the progress of the war over the past year, Li Fan began to revisit the many messages sent by He Zhenghao to "Zhou Qing'ang".</p><p></p><p>Mostly inquiries, urging when he would come out from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of his seclusion, messages were frequent. But later on, for unknown reasons, the messages became fewer.</p><p></p><p>"Minister, High Master, both out of contact."</p><p></p><p>"Now everyone is acting properly, each destroying their communication talismans directly, claiming to be in seclusion."</p><p></p><p>"If this continues, our Congyun City's Political Affairs Hall may not be able to assemble even ten officials! How can I explain to the High Master when he returns!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao complained bitterly, but Li Fan just coldly hmphed.</p><p></p><p>"Do you even remember that I am the Minister?" </p><p></p><p>Ignoring this dying man, Li Fan cleared the messages from the communication talisman with a blink of his eyes, then left the secluded chamber and quietly appeared in the main hall of the Political Affairs Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gao, the position of Pill Refinement Hall's Quality Inspector is now vacant. Someone offered me fifty thousand contribution points to buy this position. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"I think it's a bit low, at least eighty thousand."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the position of the practicing hall manager earned a whopping one hundred thirty thousand contributions not long ago. This time..."</p><p></p><p>As He Zhenghao spoke, he suddenly noticed another person in the room.</p><p></p><p>His words came to an abrupt halt, and He Zhenghao looked awkwardly at "Zhou Qing'ang", feeling embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan narrowed his eyes, showing no panic about being caught in the act of scheming.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he smiled naturally and greeted "Zhou Qing'ang" warmly, saying, "It's been a while, Zhou friend. How about helping us out with our strategic planning!"</p><p></p><p>He then warmly grabbed Zhou Qing'ang, explained again in detail about the vacant position in the Congyun City, filled his eyes with anticipation, waiting for his response.</p><p></p><p>This move instantly diffused the awkward situation between him and He Zhenghao, dispelled the estrangement between them and the long-unseen Zhou Qing'ang, and then invited him to join them.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who had been in politics for hundreds of years, couldn't help but praise, "Well-played", while smiling ambiguously at the two. He chose not to act as a righteous person who would expose and report them.</p><p></p><p>After pretending to ponder for a moment, he suddenly slammed the table, "Eighty thousand contribution points? Still insufficient! A fixed price of one hundred sixty thousand contributions!"</p><p></p><p>"Want it or not?"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhou Qing'ang had a bigger appetite than himself and immediately doubled the price.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment, he came back to his senses, smiling helplessly as he advised, "Zhou friend, you might have just woken up from seclusion and don't understand the current situation."</p><p></p><p>"The position of the Pill Refinement Hall's Quality Inspector can only sell for a maximum of eighty thousand. After all, it's not just us in the Congyun Sea selling this position. If others choose us, it's only because the prices are low here and they can use it as a springboard."</p><p></p><p>"By suddenly doubling the price..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scoffed at both of them, looking down on their behavior with a sneer, "You don't understand? Do you think that while I've been in seclusion, I know nothing about the events happening outside? It seems like it's you two who are confused about the situation now!"</p><p></p><p>This attitude by "Zhou Qing'ang" was quite different from his usual style of behavior.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou Qing'ang was a more stable person, not one to make baseless claims.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan and He Zhenghao exchanged a glance, both showing expressions of astonishment and suspicion in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, those with a clear conscience have nothing to fear. But with just this simple phrase, they were at a loss.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao leaned forward, cautiously inquiring, "Zhou friend, where does this start from?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang" did not answer; he just glanced coldly at Gao Yuan beside him.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan's eyes flashed with a hint of anger, but he quickly suppressed it, revealing a smiling face and adopting a demeanor of seeking guidance.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Li Fan slowly spoke, "The battle in Tianlingzhou is coming to an end, and the war is about to subside. Your behavior of buying and selling official positions during this chaotic time when no one was in charge, is about to end!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, both Gao Yuan and He Zhenghao were shocked.</p><p></p><p>This time it wasn't a pretense.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of shock, disbelief appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao quickly asked, "There has been no word of this matter, how does Zhou friend know?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I don't believe in you, friend, but this matter concerns the Immortal Alliance. Friend, you must not speak lightly of it." Gao Yuan added.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know?" Zhou Qing'ang stared at the two, his eyes cold.</p><p></p><p>"It was Minister who informed me!"</p><p></p><p>[\***Note: The translation ends abruptly with two empty parenthesis.

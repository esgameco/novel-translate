        <h1>Chapter 437</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Five thousand pieces of top quality spirit stones were neatly stacked inside, sparkling and translucent, with a contribution value of five million. This was the largest number Li Fan had ever seen since his continuous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>Even a completely worthless person, under the blessing of the new law, could reverse fate by virtue of this huge contribution value and achieve the least godly realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Fan just casually glanced at it, showing no excitement whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Taking out a piece of spirit stone and playing with it in his hand, Li Fan said nonchalantly, "The quality is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Having a huge fortune in hand but remaining so calm.</p><p></p><p>And it was not pretending, it was genuinely not caring, or was it just too used to it?</p><p></p><p>Who exactly was this person?</p><p></p><p>The five Old Meeting Cultivators standing opposite Ji Fan carefully observed him, noting his demeanor and actions, and couldn't help but mutter, but decided to probe further.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, in a cold voice, he said, "Kid, so arrogant here? Aren't you afraid we'll kill you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan appeared indifferent, "Afraid, extremely afraid! Who isn't afraid of death?"</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the other party provocatively, showing no sign of fear at all,</p><p></p><p>"But I'm just a runner, my life is worthless, what's the use in killing me?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I understand, you will definitely not harm me."</p><p></p><p>After putting away the spirit stone, Li Fan sat upright, put on a serious face, "Oh? How so?" The Old Meeting Cultivator asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>"This is obvious! Anyone who can spend five million contribution points to purchase questions must be wealthy."</p><p></p><p>"No need to ruin their own reputation by going back on their word just for a few contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"If you kill me, you can get this trial question for free this time. But what about next time, and the time after that?"</p><p></p><p>"Can you guarantee that you will find reliable trading partners like us again?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's words, the Old Meeting Cultivators gradually dropped their mocking expression and became serious.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, don't you want anything else, more confidential things besides the entry exam questions?" Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"More confidential things?!" The Old Meeting Cultivator was instantly surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>He quickly asked, "Such as?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted, did not answer directly but vaguely said, "There are many good things! As long as you can afford the price, we can get you everything you want, both imaginable and unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>His words made the Old Meeting Cultivator eager.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan suddenly stopped talking about it and said, "But you know the danger of trading these things too."</p><p></p><p>"So, it's necessary to gradually open up based on the specific circumstances of the cooperation."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much for now; let's complete this transaction first!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at "Zhou Qing'ang" and the blurry figure of the five Old Meeting Cultivators, then became lazy again.</p><p></p><p>The Old Meeting Cultivator nodded slowly at his words, no longer questioning further.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the ten jade slips in the storage ring, Li Fan passed a message to "Zhou Qing'ang", "You watch him here. I'll be back soon.'"</p><p></p><p>With an unfriendly tone, it was clear that Zhou Qing'ang's information work this time was flawed, leaving the Old Meeting Cultivator with some dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, then his eyes showed a murderous intent, glaring coldly at his actual identity.</p><p></p><p>The Old Meeting Cultivator was about to leave, but Li Fan remembered something suddenly and added, "In the ring, there are a total of ten jade slips, all with the entry exam questions."</p><p></p><p>"And it also included a [Contract]. It states that only one person can view one jade slip."</p><p></p><p>"And the content cannot be disclosed. Only signing the contract allows you to read the content of the jade slip."</p><p></p><p>"You must be aware of the effectiveness of the [Contract], so I won't say more."</p><p></p><p>The Old Meeting Cultivator had already felt the familiar power from it, and previously, "Zhou Qing'ang" had also mentioned that only ten people knew about the questions.</p><p></p><p>So he was not surprised, simply saying, "Got it," then left the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Ji Fan and his duplicate confronting each other.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly not aware of any surveillance here, but Li Fan did not relax his vigilance, always executing his performance completely.</p><p></p><p>The duplicate playing "Zhou Qing'ang" always stared fiercely at his real identity without averting his gaze, while the real Ji Fan occasionally showed signs of displeasure, glaring with an unpleasant expression.</p><p></p><p>And so, time quietly passed as Ji Fan practiced his acting skills.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, six days had passed.</p><p></p><p>On the last afternoon of the entry exam, that Old Meeting Cultivator finally entered again, still concealing his appearance, but Ji Fan could faintly sense the excitement on him.</p><p></p><p>"Friend indeed has extraordinary means, the seven-day questions are flawless," he sincerely said.</p><p></p><p>"When doing business, one must pay attention to the principle of 'trust'! Since such a high price was offered, it naturally must be reciprocated!" Li Fan stood up, patting his body.</p><p></p><p>"Can I leave now?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Just a moment!" The Old Meeting Cultivator hurriedly stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Li Fan's expression changed abruptly, seemingly about to explode, but he listened to the explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Friend has been here for so long, please accept this small item as a token of appreciation," the Old Meeting Cultivator said, handing over a small bottle.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan took it, scanned it with his divine sense, and found it contained exactly nineteen Enlightenment Pills.</p><p></p><p>He looked thoughtful, glancing again at "Zhou Qing'ang" and the Old Meeting Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't say much, just laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, it seems we will meet often in the future."</p><p></p><p>"I'll take the item!" Li Fan put away the Enlightenment Pills, stepped out of the secret room, and left the Ulan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang" pretended to be confused and asked, "What did he mean just now?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Meeting Cultivator stopped and turned to face Li Fan's duplicate, "Your information gathering this time had a big problem!"</p><p></p><p>"Most likely, all this time, you've been deceived by He Zhenhao. This person is definitely not as simple as he appears."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face changed dramatically, looking bewildered, "Why do you say that?"</p><p></p><p>"This time, not only us, but there are more people who wanted to get the exam questions from the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"However, this time, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was extremely strict about confidentiality. Our previous channels were no longer effective, only we succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"And, the accuracy of the questions is horrifying..."</p><p></p><p>The Old Meeting Cultivator's tone was solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Behind He Zhenhao, I'm afraid it's not as simple as the Tianyu Heng family."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Li Fan was astonished at the news.</p><p></p><p>The Old Meeting Cultivator gave him a stern look, clearly disappointed, "From his recent actions, it's clear they have done these things before."</p><p></p><p>"Watch my simulated path to immortality."</p>

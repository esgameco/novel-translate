            <p>Chapter 1067: Resentment Breeds on Its Own</p><p></p><p>This stench was an intangible thing, more difficult to deal with than the tangible black insects.</p><p></p><p>At least ten days had passed, and the Myriad Immortal Alliance still hadn't come up with a suitable solution.</p><p></p><p>Some creatures, unable to endure this stench, burst apart in painful wails, contributing their own strength to this extreme environment.</p><p></p><p>This vicious cycle led to the stench in the Xuanhuang Realm showing no signs of improvement even after so many days.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators were hiding in the cities with protective formations activated, not daring to venture out.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the strangely colored air outside with worried expressions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Li Fan's side, he received a questioning from the Dharma Transmitter Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't we agree to pretend to destroy the world? Why did you make the Xuanhuang Realm so hazy and foul-smelling?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou seemed to be in a bad mood.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan responded calmly, "Don't worry. This is a delaying tactic. In three months at most, these exotic spiritual energies will be gradually diluted and return to normal as the natural flow of the world's spiritual energy circulates."</p><p></p><p>"I know, but the smell is too disgusting. I feel it will cause indelible psychological trauma to our Xuanhuang Realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, they will soon not care about these trivial matters," Li Fan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Has the second step of the plan already begun?" Zhou was also attracted by the main event.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait and see."</p><p></p><p>The voices of the two faded away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan expected, even if nothing was done, this stench would naturally disappear within three months.</p><p></p><p>Rather than racking their brains to study ways to eliminate this stench, with no guarantee of results, it was better to wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>This was the decision made by the Immortal Alliance after comprehensive consideration.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in order to thoroughly resolve this inexplicable disaster, the Immortal Alliance did not relax their patrols.</p><p></p><p>Demigod cultivators were dispersed day and night to collect environmental change data.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that everything was slowly getting better, and the recovery speed of spiritual energy density far exceeded expectations, the Immortal Alliance finally slowly put their minds at ease.</p><p></p><p>However, in a corner currently unknown to anyone, a large number of new Dao-One Insects were rapidly reproducing, using the corpses of the previously dead black insects.</p><p></p><p>They would even spit out spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The rapid restoration of spiritual energy in the Xuanhuang Realm was naturally their credit.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's deliberate manipulation, they hid in various underground spiritual veins, blending the spiritual energy they released with the naturally generated spiritual energy circulated by heaven and earth, making it indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>The changes happened slowly like this.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, all the strange smells had disappeared. The cultivators who had been cooped up for a long time came out into the open one after another, breathing the fresh and wonderful spiritual energy to their heart's content.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought before that the natural spiritual energy of heaven and earth was so wonderful."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, no destruction, no transcendence. Observing this disaster, I have some insights, and I'm not far from a breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>"On such a fine day, one should travel with good friends!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance did not stop the cultivators from relaxing.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the insect disaster seemed to have completely passed.</p><p></p><p>So the Immortal Alliance focused its main efforts on investigating the origin of the insect disaster.</p><p></p><p>Shillin Province, as the outbreak site of the incident, had nearly half of its cultivators</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Several people were stripped of their duties.</p><p></p><p>Some scapegoats even had their cultivation bases destroyed and were thrown into dark prisons.</p><p></p><p>The severity of the punishments was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortal Jin, who had mysteriously disappeared during the insect disaster, became the primary suspect.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the insect disaster could not threaten the lives of Immortals who had attained the Dao. So this Sword Immortal Jin, who was neither seen alive nor found dead, appeared particularly suspicious.</p><p></p><p>As the first Immortal who had attained the Dao to come into contact with the insect disaster, if he had reported the situation to the Immortal Alliance in time, it would definitely not have reached such an uncontrollable point.</p><p></p><p>In this insect disaster, the Immortal Alliance suffered heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>Someone had to step forward and take responsibility.</p><p></p><p>The missing Sword Immortal Jin became the unanimous target of everyone's questioning.</p><p></p><p>"Killing him is the only way to appease the people's anger!"</p><p></p><p>But after all, he was an Immortal who had attained the Dao, each one a tremendous asset to the Myriad Immortal Alliance. He could not be easily executed.</p><p></p><p>So in the end, the Myriad Immortal Alliance issued a wanted notice, ordering Sword Immortal Jin to turn himself in as soon as possible and strive for leniency.</p><p></p><p>They did not issue an order for his absolute elimination.</p><p></p><p>When the news came out, the Immortal Alliance was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Jin suddenly seemed to have become the originator of the insect disaster, the target of everyone's condemnation.</p><p></p><p>Everyone wished they could devour his flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, resentment arose from the hearts of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But at that time, the cultivators all attributed it to their hatred for the one who caused the insect disaster.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until half a month later that a shocking case occurred.</p><p></p><p>In Tianchen Province, a tragedy occurred in the You family.</p><p></p><p>Overnight, more than a hundred people, young and old, were all killed.</p><p></p><p>They were all slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>After some investigation, people were shocked to find that the one who committed such a bloody case was actually the eldest son of the You family, You Chisong!</p><p></p><p>No one knew what opportunity he had, as the records showed he was only at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was able to kill the Hua Shen stage cultivators in the family without a sound.</p><p></p><p>And he was even able to conceal the Heavenly Dao's perception.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until three days later, when the concealment failed, that the phenomena of the cultivators' deaths burst out all at once, and people learned of this tragedy.</p><p></p><p>In the peaceful Myriad Immortal Alliance, such a terrifying and bloody attack actually occurred.</p><p></p><p>And the perpetrator was even a member of the family.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance attached great importance to this and immediately launched an investigation.</p><p></p><p>Various rumors about the You family also spread wildly among the people.</p><p></p><p>As the eldest son, he had made great contributions to the development and growth of the family.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in a fit of rage, he slaughtered all the members of the family!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The You family's annihilation case became the most popular topic of discussion among the general cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although slaughtering one's relatives was definitely an inhuman thing to do.</p><p></p><p>It should have been a one-sided condemnation.</p><p></p><p>But among the people, for some reason, there were some discordant voices.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, he killed them well!"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. Destroying one's path of the Dao is like killing one's parents! What relatives, on the day of seizing the changes of heaven and earth, they are no longer!"</p><p></p><p>"If it were me, I would also choose to do this!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Originally, these words were only a minority.</p><p></p><p>But somehow, as the discussion of the incident grew higher and higher, more and more people began to express their support for the idea.</p><p></p><p>The two sides' views were almost completely opposed and simply could not coexist.</p><p></p><p>In the confrontation, friction was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>However, such debates were common, and the Myriad Immortal Alliance did not pay much attention to them at first.</p><p></p><p>But what no one expected was that after the first bloody conflict occurred, it was like a chain reaction.</p><p></p><p>Large-scale bloody fights began to break out one after another in various parts of the Immortal Alliance.</p>

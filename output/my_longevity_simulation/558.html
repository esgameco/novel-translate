        <h1>Chapter 558</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Just heard from a fellow daoist, seems like the new appointed secret envoy of the Exalted Words Faction is called Li Fan."</p><p></p><p>"If I were truly a spy from the Five Elders Society, why would I choose such a high-profile name, attracting unnecessary attention?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Ran's curiosity was piqued by Li Fan's words, finding some reason in them, he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "I've also heard that before a cultivator joins the alliance, they must verify their identity. With the extraordinary methods of the Immortal Alliance, if there's anything suspicious about me, it'll be uncovered on the spot. By then, fellow daoist might become the hero who exposed a spy, quite an extraordinary feat."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, what does fellow daoist have to worry about?"</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Huang Ran was eventually convinced by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step ahead, he applied for a transit permit for Li Fan to return.</p><p></p><p>Then, he led him through the island's teleportation array to reach the Cloud Fairy City.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the city floating in the clouds before him, Li Fan's face revealed a hint of surprise, "I heard that the Immortal Alliance headquarters in the Cloud Sea is on an island."</p><p></p><p>"Why is the place we've arrived at now a floating city?"</p><p></p><p>"It's all ancient history. If fellow daoist is interested, you can inquire about it after joining the alliance," Huang Ran responded, appearing unwilling to elaborate.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stopped questioning further.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at the entrance of the Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Heavenly Mirror..." Huang Ran began to introduce it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to listen attentively, Li Fan had actually activated the 'Concealment of the Sky' secret technique discreetly in his mind, preparing to flee with 'Reality Distortion' at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Based on his past experiences in the previous life, the 'Concealment of the Sky' that had been improved several times through the constant struggles between the Sky-covering Alliance and the Dark Web was capable of deceiving the perception of the Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the 'Mysterious Transformation Technique,' derived from the Extension Law, a profound technique that could completely transform aspects such as Qi, fate, flesh, consciousness, and soul.</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't be detected by the Heavenly Mirror, revealing that he was actually the same person as Li Fan, the secret envoy of the Cloud Fairy City.</p><p></p><p>But nothing was absolute, and caution was still necessary.</p><p></p><p>With various thoughts flashing through his mind, Li Fan followed Huang Ran into the Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>To his relief, the feared event did not occur.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mirror did not identify him as Li Fan of the Cloud Fairy City but assigned him a new identity.</p><p></p><p>The recommendation reward received by Huang Ran was also within the scope of Foundation Establishment cultivators, so he didn't harbor any suspicions towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging pleasantries with Li Fan, Huang Ran bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan was able to rejoin the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance with his original identity.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my speculation was correct. The Heavenly Mirror, empowered through 'Endowment,' is entirely incomparable to the original body's power."</p><p></p><p>"Although part of the reason is that my 'Concealment of the Sky' technique is ahead of its time, but indeed, blending in has become a bit too easy." </p><p></p><p>"No wonder there are countless spies from the Five Elders Society in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>On the day the Five Elders Society attacked the Ten Thousand Immortal Island, the Heavenly Mirror suddenly lost its function and turned into a mere stone.</p><p></p><p>This incident inspired Li Fan, leading to this bold attempt.</p><p></p><p>The result was as he expected.</p><p></p><p>Without lingering too long in the Heavenly Mirror, he used the contribution points given to him to obtain a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Through a teleportation array, Li Fan arrived in the Heavenly Spirit Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Instead of leaving the city, he quietly waited within it.</p><p></p><p>If the Five Elders Society did indeed launch a surprise attack on the Five Elements Grand Heaven, based on past experiences, it was likely that some Harmony Dao cultivators would perish in this fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>After the death of a Harmony Dao cultivator, phenomena would be enough to cover the entire prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could then determine the occurrence of the event as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to avoid suspicion, Li Fan didn't just wait foolishly but roamed through the shops in the Heavenly Spirit City.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Spirit Flower? Yes, please take a look at these few plants, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Upon Li Fan's request, the shopkeeper became enthusiastic, pointing to several potted flowers in the store to show Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Spirit Flower was a specialty of the Heavenly Spirit Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Each bloom had a different number of petals.</p><p></p><p>After blooming, each petal displayed unique scenes.</p><p></p><p>Be it green mountains, flowing rivers, or falling white snow.</p><p></p><p>One flower encompassed various beautiful sceneries from around the world.</p><p></p><p>As if bestowed by the heavens, its beauty was unmatched.</p><p></p><p>Two words: beautiful yet impractical.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps its only use was for admiration.</p><p></p><p>However, its lifespan was short, maintaining its bloom for only seven days after flourishing.</p><p></p><p>Even if stored in a special wooden box, it could last for about a month at most.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the flower was highly sensitive to various powers.</p><p></p><p>If accidentally affected by spiritual power fluctuations or through spatial teleportation, the scenes on the petals would be influenced.</p><p></p><p>It might just become slightly blurry if minor, but more severe cases would erase all scenes from the petals.</p><p></p><p>Without the scenes on the petals, the Heavenly Spirit Flower would lose its viewing purpose, becoming worthless.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for cultivators who liked it, they had to personally come to the Heavenly Spirit Prefecture if they wished to see the Heavenly Spirit Flower.</p><p></p><p>Due to this reason, the Heavenly Spirit Flower was even rarer beyond the Heavenly Spirit Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>During the great war in the Heavenly Spirit Prefecture in the previous life, the Heavenly Spirit Flower was nearly extinct.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, everyone's attention was focused on this unprecedented war, and there were few people willing to inflate its price.</p><p></p><p>After the war, as the Heavenly Spirit Prefecture regained vitality, the Heavenly Spirit Flower slowly flourished again.</p><p></p><p>But at that time, cultivators discovered that it might be due to the land being tainted with too much blood.</p><p></p><p>The scenes appearing on the petals of the Heavenly Spirit Flower were no longer the beautiful sceneries of the world but rather horrifying scenes of cultivators massacring each other.</p><p></p><p>It could be described as a great spoiler.</p><p></p><p>People longed for the once exquisitely beautiful Heavenly Spirit Flower, but the scenes on its petals were uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>Transplanting it to other prefectures also led it to wither immediately.</p><p></p><p>The past glory of the Heavenly Spirit was then completely wiped away from the world.</p><p></p><p>While lamenting the past beauty of the Heavenly Spirit Flower, people were helpless.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the Heavenly Spirit Flower became a vanishing beauty in the world.</p><p></p><p>Recalling a piece of interesting trivia from the past life, Li Fan carefully picked a Heavenly Spirit Flower with seventeen petals in the shop.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take this one."</p><p></p><p>"Just this one? Fellow Daoist, wouldn't you like to choose more?" The shopkeeper seemed disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"No, one is enough," Li Fan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred contribution points." At Li Fan's straightforwardness, the shopkeeper quoted the price without further ado.</p><p></p><p>After paying with ease, Li Fan cautiously received the sealed wooden box handed over by the shopkeeper.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Spirit Flower inside the box bloomed freely.</p><p></p><p>After special treatment, it could blossom for about thirty days.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1072</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Facing the accusations from their former companions, the three Dharma transmitters - Zhou, Wei, and Huang - remained as calm as an ancient well, their expressions unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>Knowing their opponents' temperament well, they didn't choose to try to persuade them with words.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they took action directly, deciding to subdue these two Dharma transmitters first and talk later!</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, let's see your true skills!" Huang took the lead, and with a loud shout, golden light shot out from the fierce eyes on his two heads, immobilizing Chu and Shen from afar.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the two Dharma transmitters, Zhou and Wei, also unleashed their techniques.</p><p></p><p>Above Zhou's head, the reflection of her private small world suddenly appeared. Everyone seemed to be pulled into that dreamy, illusory world, confronting each other on top of tall buildings shining with different colored lights.</p><p></p><p>The clothes on Zhou's body also transformed into a black metal battle armor that had never been seen before. It looked somewhat similar to the immortal puppet armor of Tianyang's incarnation.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-four flying swords, exuding a cold light, spread out like a ring of light behind Zhou.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of Zhou's mind, the flying swords instantly tore through the sky and shot towards Chu and Shen.</p><p></p><p>The speed and sharpness of the flying swords seemed to be able to break open space itself, drawing black cracks. They were like roaring black dragons.</p><p></p><p>After shooting out the flying swords, the twenty-four swords behind Zhou did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>They just turned into phantom forms.</p><p></p><p>After a full cycle of all twenty-four swords completing their simultaneous shooting, the first sword also completed its transformation from phantom to reality.</p><p></p><p>Then there was another round of flying swords shooting together!</p><p></p><p>Endless and infinite, never ceasing!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the destructive power of the flying swords themselves, Li Fan, who had set up the formation to seal the battlefield and then hid on the side to watch the battle, actually faintly detected traces of time flow rate changes from this round after round of flying sword attacks!</p><p></p><p>Outside the Source Dao State and the Immortal Ruins, Li Fan had experienced this feeling before. He absolutely could not be mistaken!</p><p></p><p>Although the change in the time flow rate was minuscule, it still existed. This indicated that Dharma transmitter Zhou had also gained some insight into the law of time!</p><p></p><p>Compared to Zhou, the attacks of Dharma transmitter Wei had a bit of a taste of being too clever by half.</p><p></p><p>With every move, he constantly waved out horizontal and vertical black lights. The horizontal and vertical lights intertwined to form cages. The cages seemed to have the weight of the world. The enemies' movements and reaction speed all showed varying degrees of delay. And as the cages stacked more and more, the slowing effect became more and more obvious.</p><p></p><p>Dharma transmitter Huang was not to be outdone either.</p><p></p><p>His body, as thin as a stick, approached Chu and Shen, choosing the most direct hand-to-hand combat. Every punch and kick seemed to have infinite power, forcing the two Dharma transmitters to barely defend themselves.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that as Dharma transmitters, Chu and Shen's strength was indeed not weak.</p><p></p><p>Chu's body was covered with constant endless white light, able to dissolve all attacks.</p><p></p><p>Shen was skilled in using a duster, and the myriad white threads could all transform into different weapons to confront the enemy.</p><p></p><p>These two were not inferior to any Hedao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But the strength of the Dharma transmitters was roughly on par with each other. Zhou and the others had a three-to-two advantage in numbers.</p><p></p><p>Plus, there was also Li Fan secretly constraining them with formations...</p><p></p><p>It took a full seven days to suppress these two Dharma transmitters.</p><p></p><p>Although they were defeated, they were still unwilling to accept it: "If you have the guts, just kill us!"</p><p></p><p>Dharma transmitter Zhou gave Chu a cold look: "..."</p><p></p><p>"Did you think that just because I left the Transmitter Council, I would really forget everything related to the Transmitters?"</p><p></p><p>"With the life-saving prohibition of the Celestial Venerable in place, even if you could kill me, you would still be marked."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wei slowly explained, "Brothers, there has been a misunderstanding. We did this because we had no choice."</p><p></p><p>Then, he detailed how Moru Bin, the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect, secretly possessed the Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>"I have personally verified it," he emphasized again.</p><p></p><p>Chu snorted coldly, his face full of disbelief, "Absurd! What kind of strength do we Transmitters have? Moreover, with the protection of the Celestial Venerable's prohibition, how could we be possessed without a sound?"</p><p></p><p>Shen, on the other hand, was somewhat doubtful. Recalling the previous abnormalities of the Immortal Alliance's Transmitter Council, he pondered.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou sneered, "It doesn't matter if you don't believe it. Anyway, trash like you can't be relied upon. Just wait and see. When Jiang comes over, after we clarify everything to him, we will initiate the [Transmitter's Oath]. At that time, the truth will be revealed!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the name [Transmitter's Oath], Shen and Chu both fell silent instantly.</p><p></p><p>They understood the weight of this term.</p><p></p><p>Those who dare to actively propose the Transmitter's Oath judgment would never be someone with ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently watched the quarrel between the Transmitters on the side without speaking.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious disappearance of the two Transmitters who came to investigate the ground collapse incident was definitely a big event that would shock the entire Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Transmitter Council convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Although a few people, including Transmitter Feng, held opposing opinions, the vast majority of the council still felt that this matter should be immediately reported to Transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>The minority obeys the majority.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Transmitter Jiang, who was in the [Realm of Returning to the Origin], was finally alerted.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the investigations about the ground collapse incident that appeared before him, Jiang nodded, "I had already vaguely noticed this matter before. Many strange insects suddenly appeared underground in the Xuanhuang Realm. They can produce a special spiritual energy that stimulates the killing desire in the hearts of cultivators. The previous killing tribulation in the Xuanhuang Realm was caused by them."</p><p></p><p>"Not only changing the temperament of the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm, but now also destroying the foundation of the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Jiang looked at the Transmitters in front of him, who were afraid of his [Everything Is Like Me] characteristic and didn't dare to come in person, only transmitting messages through virtual images. A trace of disappointment flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He sent out a white light, "I have found a way to exterminate these insects. You just need to follow it."</p><p></p><p>"As for the disappearance of Chu and Shen..."</p><p></p><p>"I will personally make a trip."</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Jiang's figure instantly disappeared from the Realm of Returning to the Origin, but his voice echoed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After helping to capture the two Transmitters, Li Fan took the opportunity to temporarily part ways with Transmitter Zhou and the others.</p><p></p><p>The true body returned to the Lingmu Realm to hide, leaving only the immortal puppet Li Fan outside.</p><p></p><p>The warning that occasionally surfaced in his mind told him that Transmitter Jiang's arrival was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just a day later, Jiang followed the clues and found them.</p><p></p><p>"It turned out to be you?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the culprits who caused the turmoil in the Xuanhuang Realm were actually his former companions.</p><p></p><p>Even with Jiang's mental endurance, his face couldn't help but show a little bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"It was just a tactic we had no choice but to use to force you to show up." Facing Jiang, even the usually arrogant Huang's attitude became much more amiable.</p>

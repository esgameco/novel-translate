        <h1>Chapter 778</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps by reaching the legendary realm of being free from all desires, one can ignore Mr. Bai's pollution."  </p><p>"But then again, if one truly has no desires at all..."</p><p>"Then one would not demand 'realness' anymore either." </p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, casting aside this impractical thought.</p><p>With a tap of his finger, he fixed the separation disk hovering in mid-air, then took out eight white flashing crystal cores from his storage ring.</p><p>"At the critical moment, trying to draw the Celestial Mirror's attention by infusing the separation disk with formations will definitely not give me enough time to do it slowly. I need to prepare in advance."</p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan narrowed his eyes and began imprinting the information of the "Life and Death Reversal Grand Formation" separately into these eight flashing crystals.  </p><p>These crystals, similar in nature to formation halos, are called formation crystals. They can record and store formations, but unlike formation halos which can be reused multiple times, formation crystals are one-time use only.</p><p>Each formation crystal was engraved with a part of the formation. Li Fan then controlled them to hover around the separation disk.</p><p>"I just need a thought, and these formation crystals will simultaneously explode, infusing the formation information into the separation disk."</p><p>Watching the eight flickering white crystals, Li Fan laid down another formation to constrain them, to prevent accidents.</p><p>Next was the "Celestial Spirit Sealing Formation".</p><p>After completing these repetitive actions, the separation disk in the center, surrounded by sixteen flashing crystals, was no longer recognizable.</p><p>Li Fan carefully stored it alone in an empty storage ring.</p><p>"I still can't confirm whether the Celestial Mirror's derivative entity is truly still linked to the Celestial Mirror itself. This is just a contingency plan."</p><p>"I still need to make full preparations and give it my all."</p><p>After leaving the secret room, Li Fan first went to the Thousand Li Hall in Celestial Authority City.</p><p>The place was deserted, even the signboard was askew, and Jiao Xiuyuan was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"I heard before that the Thousand Li Hall's business had plummeted. It seems to be true," Li Fan thought inwardly as he strode inside.</p><p>Due to the increasing popularity of the Celestial Treasure Compendium, cultivators could trade seamlessly across dozens of provinces without any obstacles.</p><p>Transactions could happen anytime, anywhere, with almost no restrictions.</p><p>Moreover, with so much information made public, the prices of all goods became almost transparent.</p><p>For a merchant like Jiao Xiuyuan, this was a devastating blow. Countless shops vanished overnight.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiao Xiuyuan's business was just for the sake of cultivation. As long as he didn't lose money, it wasn't a big problem. He didn't have an urgent need for profit.</p><p>But clearly, suddenly losing the means for cultivation was not easy for him to accept.</p><p>"What should I do..."</p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan lay listlessly behind the dusty wooden counter, muttering softly to himself.</p><p>He was so deep in thought that he didn't even notice someone had entered.</p><p>Li Fan lightly rapped on the counter.</p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan started with a jolt. "A customer?"</p><p>Li Fan slowly examined Jiao Xiuyuan's puppet body, staring at him in a way that made him uneasy.</p><p>"You..." Jiao Xiuyuan said with uncertainty.</p><p>"Daoist Jiao, would you be willing to sell this puppet body of yours? The price is negotiable!" Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's face changed drastically. He slammed the table, about to respond angrily, but suddenly stopped himself.</p><p>He stared fixedly at something Li Fan had quietly taken out.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The experienced and knowledgeable man almost immediately sensed the aura around it was similar to that of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"A Heavenly Mystery Derivative?" Jiao Xiuyuan was shocked. </p><p></p><p>Heavenly Mystery Derivatives, the entire Mysterious Yellow Realm did not have more than fifty of them. Each one had a unique function, but they were essentially priceless. No cultivators would dare to sell them.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's mind quickly flashed through the information on different Heavenly Mystery Derivatives, but none of them matched what was in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's heart raced as he waved his hand to close the shop door and enthusiastically welcomed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, no problem! It's just a puppet body, that's not an issue."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just not sure what exactly this thing you have is..." Jiao Xiuyuan lowered his voice and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan readily replied, "A Heavenly Mystery Derivative, the Endgame Disc. It can shield the perception of the Heavenly Mystery Mirror and Heavenly Mystery Tome."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan said the first sentence, Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes lit up. But after the second sentence, he suddenly shuddered and instinctively looked around, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?" </p><p></p><p>But very quickly, his true nature was revealed. A greedy glint flashed in his eyes as he reached out to touch it. To his surprise, Li Fan did not stop him from touching the Endgame Disc at all, and let him take it in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Jiao Xiuyuan carefully examined the jade-like disc, and after a moment, his expression changed to one of shock. He gripped it tightly and stared at the inscrutable Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted, "Friend Jiao, what do you think the value of this item is?"</p><p></p><p>"Incalculable! The stronger the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, the more urgently cultivators will need this, and the higher its value!" Jiao Xiuyuan blurted out.</p><p></p><p>"Then what price would you offer?" Jiao Xiuyuan certainly did not think Li Fan was just bringing out such a precious item for his puppet body. He quickly considered how he could monopolize and profit from this rare item through his widespread shops and auctions.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's next words abruptly brought him back to reality. "As I said, I want your puppet body."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was momentarily stunned, his expression changing. He began to wonder if this was actually a fake item.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan assured him the item's effects were genuine, and then stated his unusual request. After some further discussion, Li Fan left with the Endgame Disc, but did not take the puppet body.</p>

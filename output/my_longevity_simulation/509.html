        <h1>Chapter 509</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>While feeling happy for Li Fan, there was a sense of loss in her heart for some reason.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Zhao, let's spar!" Li Fan suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Sister Zhao couldn't help but be a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what is your current cultivation level?" Li Fan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Late Foundation Building stage, why?" She hesitated for a moment but answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not amazed at how quickly she had progressed in her cultivation level but applauded, "It seems Senior Zhang was right. Sister, your talent for cultivation is truly rare in the world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's praise, she couldn't help but blush slightly.</p><p></p><p>But then Li Fan said, "But you can't bully me. During our spar, you can only use the strength of the late Qi Refining stage at most!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Before she could react, Li Fan pounced on her.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, Sister Zhao was a bit flustered. However, with her cultivation level being a realm higher than Li Fan's, in terms of control over spiritual energy and reaction speed in battles, she was unbeatable by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After just over ten rounds, Li Fan was defeated in a sorry state.</p><p></p><p>Getting up from the ground, lightly clearing his throat, Li Fan praised, "Sister, you're really amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you okay?" Her face was full of worry and a hint of regret. She hurriedly checked Li Fan's injuries.</p><p></p><p>After a careful examination, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go again!" After a break, Li Fan said in a deep voice and resumed practicing with Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>With Sister Zhao's thoughtful guidance during their sparring sessions, Li Fan's practical combat skills improved rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao also taught him some spells like "Sky Rending Blade" and "Swift Wind Flash," greatly enhancing his combat abilities.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the good times didn't last long. Sister Zhao's frequent visits to the Outer Sect's Qīngníng Peak to accompany Li Fan in cultivation were eventually discovered by her master, Elder Zhang Wàngshuāng.</p><p></p><p>After a scolding, she was prohibited from visiting Li Fan anymore.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after earnest pleading, she managed to get a chance to see Li Fan again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the beauty before him on the verge of tears, deeply saddened, Li Fan also felt a tinge of regret.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, embraced her, lightly stroked her back, and comforted her, "Sister, don't be sad. Since your master doesn't allow you to visit the Outer Sect frequently, then I'll come to the Inner Sect to find you."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, I will never abandon you," Li Fan vowed earnestly. "Sister, focus on your cultivation, I'll come for you!"</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao looked at Li Fan, her eyes filled with confusion, her heart racing like a frightened deer.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then kissed her affectionately, and they lingered in that moment for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the deadline set by the master was approaching that Li Fan reluctantly released Sister Zhao, who was struggling to leave his embrace.</p><p></p><p>In the small room, Li Fan quickly pulled himself together from being emotionally conflicted.</p><p></p><p>After locking the door and using the protective talisman given by Sister Zhao as a guard, he began attempting Foundation Building again.</p><p></p><p>However, his talent for cultivation in this body was disappointing.</p><p></p><p>Three failed attempts in a row.</p><p></p><p>If he continued like this, he might harm his foundation. With no choice, Li Fan reluctantly swallowed the Foundation Building Pill given by Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>This time, with external help, he finally succeeded in Foundation Building.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he finally became an official disciple of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, relying on external items for Foundation Building would limit his future prospects. His cultivation aptitude was mediocre and did not attract the attention of the senior members of the sect as Sister Zhao did.</p><p></p><p>According to the process, he was accepted as a disciple by the Nascent Soul cultivator Zhuāng Yǔnxuān.</p><p></p><p>As the fifth-generation disciple of the Great Dao Sect, he was one generation junior to Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>However, she was happy to see Li Fan. She didn't make an issue out of it and told Li Fan to address her as Sister even in private.</p><p></p><p>Being from the same sect made their interactions more convenient.</p><p></p><p>Even though Sister Zhao had already broken through to the Golden Core stage, it didn't hinder Li Fan from seeking her out whenever he needed.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation was slightly weaker, Li Fan never lacked courtesy. He greeted everyone politely with a smile, even in the face of ridicule and mockery. He accepted it gracefully and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>After a while, those who were gossiping and mocking him felt embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Sister Zhao's master, Elder Zhang Wàngshuāng, didn't comment on their relationship, so gradually, everyone accepted Li Fan's presence.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao was surprised that Li Fan defused the awkward situation that troubled her. She felt very grateful.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the worries in her heart dissipated, and her gaze towards Li Fan became even more affectionate.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and three years flew by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>With no worries in her heart, Sister Zhao's cultivation advanced rapidly. She had successfully broken through to the late Golden Core stage and was preparing to form her Core.</p><p></p><p>With Foundation Building complete, it was time to form the Core.</p><p></p><p>The saying "swallowing a Golden Core and taking control of one's destiny" was very true. The difference between the Golden Core and Foundation Building stages was immense. Once crossed, it would be a turning point in life.</p><p></p><p>Knowing his limited aptitude, Li Fan knew that forming his Core might not be smooth sailing. To be on the safe side, he decided to seclude himself, consolidate his cultivation, and seek an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, when he felt a connection in his heart and believed the time was right, he prepared to form his Core.</p><p></p><p>However, a message forced him to come out of seclusion earlier.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao's junior martial brother, Jiāng Níngjūn, the youngest disciple of Elder Zhang, secretly sent him a message.</p><p></p><p>Senior brother Qín Shǒu from the Lián Shān line had launched a fierce pursuit of Sister Zhao recently.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Qín Shǒu, being young, had already reached the Nascent Soul stage. His master, Qū Hánfēng, had a good relationship with Elder Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhang was pleased with the idea of the two of them becoming Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Qín Shǒu was also talented and charismatic, seemingly a perfect match for Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>In just a few months while Li Fan was absent, the Muèhuā Sect's affection and support for him had already surpassed that for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Only Sister Zhao's junior martial brother Jiāng Níngjūn, who had a good relationship with Li Fan, was displeased with Qín Shǒu's hypocritical demeanor.</p><p></p><p>This led to him alerting Li Fan of the impending crisis.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the news, Li Fan immediately decided to postpone forming his Core.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Core stage could be broken through at any time.</p><p></p><p>But once Sister Zhao was taken away, it would be irreversible!</p><p></p><p>Despite his unwavering confidence in Sister Zhao, Li Fan knew that life was unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that his smooth progression in cultivation so far was largely due to her help.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to snatch my free ride, hinder my path!"</p><p></p><p>"Whoever you are, we'll see this through to the end!" Li Fan's eyes flashed with cold determination.</p>

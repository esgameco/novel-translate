            <p>"What an immense power..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt the authority he now possessed. Even with his experience and temperament, he felt a moment of dizziness and excitement.</p><p></p><p>Although the difference between an immortal and an ordinary cultivator is like the gap between heaven and earth, when the number of ants reaches a certain level, it is enough to make up for this disparity!</p><p></p><p>For example, at this moment, after clashing with the ancient immortal Mo Rubin's divine consciousness, Li Fan was certain that once these millions of cultivators' divine consciousnesses were all at his disposal, he could easily crush this Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even had a feeling that if he continued to expand like this, after devouring the vast majority of cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm...</p><p></p><p>He might even be able to directly confront the Dharma Transmission without defeat.</p><p></p><p>Once the inner desire takes root, it becomes difficult to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Especially those millions of imagined gods and demons, at this time, seemed to sense Li Fan's thoughts as well, all emitting whispers, trying to bewitch Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, almost no cultivator can resist the temptation of ascending to the heavens in one step.</p><p></p><p>The outcome would inevitably be losing one's original mind, endlessly sinking into eternal expansion until all cultivators perish.</p><p></p><p>By then, whether the mastermind behind it all can ascend to immortality or follow the world into a silent end...no one knows what will happen.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was different.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he had the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra protecting his body. Secondly, besides these millions of demon gods, he also possessed quite a few powers on par with them.</p><p></p><p>He even had [Huan Zhen], an existence that transcended everything.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Fan abandon his foundation to pursue the trivial, and be deluded by mere millions of demon gods?</p><p></p><p>Let alone millions, even with the power of tens of millions of demon gods or even true immortals, trying to tempt him to give up [Huan Zhen] would be a pipe dream!</p><p></p><p>It can be said that [Huan Zhen] was also Li Fan's greatest spiritual anchor, ensuring that he would never be bewitched by other external things and forget his original mind.</p><p></p><p>Unless one day, he could encounter an existence even more powerful than [Huan Zhen]...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan's face was like eternal ice. The power of the Dao Transformation Stone operated to the extreme, trying its best to manipulate each demon god.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts transformed into millions, putting a great burden on the middle-grade Dao Transformation Stone.</p><p></p><p>However, with the help of Li Fan's own vast divine consciousness, it was finally barely able to maintain basic operation.</p><p></p><p>"If the number increases further, I can only let them act on instinct. Without my fine control, they will just be mindless beasts, and their combat power will greatly decrease. But it's enough to create chaos."</p><p></p><p>Within half a day, the Wanxian Alliance was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The grassroots forces were basically all paralyzed. </p><p></p><p>One must know that each divine consciousness clone had the combat power equivalent to the weakest Huashen cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And even in the central four states of the Alliance, the number of Huashen cultivators would not be too many.</p><p></p><p>If this was the case for Huashen, the choice for Hedao would not change much either.</p><p></p><p>After all, their lives were their own. Cultivating all the way to the Hedao realm was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>With the enemy's offensive so overwhelming, whoever rushed out first to be the pioneer would inevitably face an encirclement.</p><p></p><p>What if they perished?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The objective environment of the Wanxian Alliance also led to the almost completely unanimous thoughts of the cultivators. </p><p></p><p>This also caused Li Fan's millions of demon gods to seem as if they had entered an unguarded realm for a time, dominating wherever they went.</p><p></p><p>Awakening.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Wan Xian Alliance, which was at its peak, was about to be completely taken down.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>At the Wan Xian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>A space without boundaries, where everything in sight was a vast expanse of whiteness.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of lightning exploding from the center of the space, one after another, projections that seemed like worlds were cast into every corner of the space.</p><p></p><p>The scenes varied, with continuous mountain ranges hidden under the sea of clouds, endless bamboo forests lush with greenery, solemn and luxurious imperial palaces, and even dreamy scenes of skyscrapers standing in a sea of neon lights.</p><p></p><p>In the projection of each world, there seemed to be a face that looked like a lake.</p><p></p><p>Appearing in this white space.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang, tell us what the situation is now." A rather frivolous voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>It came from the world of endless bamboo forests.</p><p></p><p>Following that, one after another, light and shadows appeared in the center of these world projections.</p><p></p><p>They were all scenes of gods and demons running rampant and the Wan Xian Alliance suffering.</p><p></p><p>"That's how it is. The appearance of these god-consciousness creatures is extremely strange. Previously, there were no signs, and they suddenly erupted."</p><p></p><p>"Except for the core governing areas of Tiancheng, all the states have basically fallen."</p><p></p><p>A solemn voice slowly spoke, introducing the current situation of the Wan Xian Alliance to the Dharma transmitters present.</p><p></p><p>The voice came from the world of imperial palaces.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. So many god-consciousness creatures... Could it be the remnant thoughts of the cultivators who have fallen in Xuanhuang over the years?"</p><p></p><p>"I think it's not that they can't, but that they don't want to. A bunch of ungrateful white-eyed wolves..."</p><p></p><p>The Dharma transmitters spoke one after another, and without exception, their tones were very relaxed, without the slightest concern about the fall of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The Dharma transmitters suddenly fell silent, and their gazes all turned to an inconspicuous world.</p><p></p><p>There were no magnificent buildings or grand natural landscapes there.</p><p></p><p>Only a vast void.</p><p></p><p>A lonely figure sat cross-legged in the void.</p><p></p><p>Jiang's gaze had been fixed on the countless scenes in the center, ignoring the inquiries of the Dharma transmitters.</p><p></p><p>And those Dharma transmitters also seemed to have great respect for this Dharma transmitter Jiang, all patiently waiting without anyone showing the slightest dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Dharma transmitter Jiang spoke, "Behind these god-consciousness creatures, there is only one person."</p><p></p><p>"Find him out, and this matter can be resolved."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the Dharma transmitters all showed unusual expressions.</p><p></p><p>"To have such power... Even ordinary Immortals wouldn't be able to do it, right? Which one of them has lowered their status to engage in such petty thievery?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, now that you mention it, I seem to remember that back in the Xuanhuang Realm, there was a cultivation technique that had a performance extremely similar to this."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the reactions of the other Dharma transmitters, Dharma transmitter Jiang continued his analysis, "As you all said, when one's strength reaches this level, they will not do meaningless things. Releasing these millions of gods and demons..."</p><p></p><p>"It should just be a kind of smokescreen. To conceal his true purpose."</p><p></p><p>"True purpose?" Dharma transmitter Jiang's inference was agreed upon by the vast majority of the Dharma transmitters. They also began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing what they thought of, quite a few Dharma transmitters had subtle expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes also swept over the other people present.</p><p></p><p>Dharma transmitter Jiang looked straight ahead and continued, "There's no need for mutual suspicion."</p><p></p><p>"When one's strength reaches this level, there are only a few things they would covet."</p>

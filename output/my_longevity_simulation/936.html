        <h1>Chapter 936</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even when his divine sense explored the surroundings, it sensed nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the aura left behind by the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate all day long, the bodies and souls of the thirty-three Immortal Chosen began to slowly change.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, time passed without knowing.</p><p></p><p>After they all broke free, their demeanor, behavior, and eyes became extremely similar.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a flash of inspiration crossed Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He finally remembered where the familiarity of that middle-aged cultivator came from.</p><p></p><p>The cold light in those eyes was almost exactly the same as the First Outline!</p><p></p><p>"Just like these Immortal Chosen, although they are not the same person. But for some reason, they had a common experience. So they also began to resemble each other..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I could never find someone with the same face."</p><p></p><p>"The First Outline, and this middle-aged cultivator. They are subtly different from those black-clothed cultivators who seem to have walked out of an era, and that [Wu]. How many secrets are hidden in the Myriad Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant, and he continued to check Wei Qi's next experience.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the second lesson ended, it was the final training.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three Immortal Chosen were led to different states respectively.</p><p></p><p>In a special space, they sensed the remnant power hidden in the Heavenly Venerate's withered statue.</p><p></p><p>With the previous training, this goal became much easier.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was relatively speaking.</p><p></p><p>In the closed space, the only thing they could do was this.</p><p></p><p>There was even a power here that guided the mind and spirit, making it impossible for them to think about anything else.</p><p></p><p>Just sensing day and night, in order to achieve synchronization as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that at this point, the difference between the thirty-three Immortal Chosen was indeed negligible.</p><p></p><p>They almost completed the initial perception of the Heavenly Venerate's remnant thoughts at the same time, with an overall error of no more than two days.</p><p></p><p>All thirty-three people completed the initial perception of the Heavenly Venerate's remnant thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, under the connection of a pure light beam, although they were in different places of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But their consciousness was connected to each other.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely wonderful experience.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three people were like a whole, without the need for words, they could complete the exchange in an instant.</p><p></p><p>One thought was better than a thousand words.</p><p></p><p>And the tacit understanding formed over a long time also made the thoughts of this whole quite singular, with little fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Li Fan's thoughts were interrupted again.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, this pure light beam..."</p><p></p><p>"Why does it have a bit of the taste of Senior Sister Zhao's One Heart Unites All?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of puzzlement flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the Eternal Life Heavenly Venerate that Li Fan understood the most, he had personally experienced the peculiarities of Senior Sister Zhao's [One Heart Unites All] more than once.</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly examining the scene when the pure light beam appeared dozens of times, Li Fan finally saw some clues.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three Immortal Chosen's perfect unity of mind simply could not accommodate any other existence.</p><p></p><p>"It's the simple application of the power of law, not another [One Heart Heavenly Venerate]. Was Senior Sister Zhao's power stolen?" Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance also has this ability?"</p><p></p><p>And as Li Fan guessed, what followed was just like that.</p><p></p><p>As the thirty-three Immortal Chosen's thoughts also tended to merge, the pure light beam was constantly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, even without relying on external objects.</p><p></p><p>These thirty-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Thirteen people could achieve a telepathic connection.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of attempts, they finally invoked the immense power left behind by the Dharma Transmitting Celestial Venerable for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The impact brought by the middle-aged cultivator's words, "A glance from the Celestial Venerable is equivalent to a strike from an Eternal Realm expert," was simply too enormous.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, by the unanimous choice of the thirty-three Immortal Candidates, the first appearance of the Celestial Venerable's Dharma Image was "opening eyes to level nine mountains."</p><p></p><p>After the first success, the Myriad Immortals Alliance finally let them rest for a while.</p><p></p><p>However, this so-called rest was merely giving them a little free time.</p><p></p><p>They still had to stay in that special space, not allowed to go out.</p><p></p><p>After a brief respite, what followed were attempts, one after another.</p><p></p><p>They became more and more proficient, and the Celestial Venerable's power they invoked grew increasingly vast.</p><p></p><p>Until this day...</p><p></p><p>When the Celestial Venerable's Dharma Image threw the giant net woven from the Arrows of Heavenly Patrol towards the territory of the Five Elders Society,</p><p></p><p>It finally drew out the intervention of the Five Elders Society's Eternal Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>They tried to obstruct the five Celestial Venerables, causing the giant net to fall to the ground.</p><p></p><p>They indeed succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Although somewhat exhausted, they couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Harmonious Dao Realm, they could go head-to-head with the five strongest Celestial Venerables in the current Mysterious Yellow Realm!</p><p></p><p>What an honor!</p><p></p><p>However, before they could even rejoice,</p><p></p><p>Another command was issued.</p><p></p><p>"Continue evolving the Dharma Image!"</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three people's hearts trembled simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Even now, invoking the Dharma Transmitting Celestial Venerable's Dharma Image was not an easy task for them.</p><p></p><p>It extremely consumed their mind and spirit, requiring a period of recovery afterward.</p><p></p><p>But this inexplicably appearing voice seemed to have a magical power,</p><p></p><p>Causing the thirty-three Immortal Candidates to be unable to disobey.</p><p></p><p>They all subconsciously followed the order.</p><p></p><p>Thus, another Dharma Image emerged.</p><p></p><p>Before they could even rest, that cold and ruthless voice resounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Continue!"</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three Immortal Candidates had already noticed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, they might all die from excessive consumption!</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't defy the command of that voice.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the repeated orders,</p><p></p><p>In the end, five Celestial Venerable Dharma Images appeared simultaneously between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And because a large amount of essence, energy, and spirit was extracted in a short time, these thirty-three Immortal Candidates also reached the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't we heroes?"</p><p></p><p>In the final moments of their lives, the minds of the thirty-three were filled with confusion and resentment.</p><p></p><p>However, until their consciousness completely sank into darkness,</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, no one came to explain to them.</p><p></p><p>Not even a single sentence.</p><p></p><p>Not even a mockery.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The world says I, Li Taishi, am a great villain."</p><p></p><p>"I also used to think of myself that way."</p><p></p><p>"But today, I discovered..."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the Myriad Immortals Alliance, I still have much to learn."</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan finished watching Wei Qizheng's experience, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Back to reality.</p><p></p><p>Due to the confrontation between the five Dharma Images and the five Celestial Venerables, the tremors in the Mysterious Yellow Realm were still intensifying.</p><p></p><p>And the battlefield seemed to have fallen into a temporary stillness.</p><p></p><p>The five rays of light and the Celestial Venerable Dharma Images were entangled in one place.</p><p></p><p>These Dharma Images summoned by consuming the life essence of the thirty-three Immortal Candidates were much stronger than the ones that appeared before.</p><p></p><p>Facing the siege of the five Celestial Venerables, their bodies merely shattered but did not disperse.</p><p></p><p>Until that giant net of Arrows of Heavenly Patrol finally fell on the Five Elders Society's territory.</p>

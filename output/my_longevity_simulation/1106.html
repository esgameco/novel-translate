            <p>Chapter 1104: The Inherent Difference Between Heaven and Man</p><p></p><p>"From the appearance of traces of reversal in the principles of heaven and earth, to the successful reversal of principles and attainment of immortality, the total time does not exceed ten years. {What? You don't know yet | Read at COM, chapters without errors | Hurry and google it}"</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, a cultivator in harmony with the Dao has not even completed the first step of reversing the principles, while this person has already completed the ascension."</p><p></p><p>"I almost suspect that this Posthumous Venerated Immortal might be a survivor from the outside world, a great cultivator who was already very close to the realm of immortality. That's why he could be so smooth and successful." Transmitter Zhou's tone was quite horrified.</p><p></p><p>"An outsider?" After hearing his words, Li Fan also inexplicably fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"But fortunately, this Venerated Immortal doesn't seem to have any intention of intervening in the conflicts of the Xuanhuang Realm. He has not actively appeared to contact either us or the Five Elders Society. As for the impact brought about by the reversal of life and death, we are still in the process of assessing it. However, it can be foreseen that both sides may become more and more cautious about launching wars in the future." Transmitter Zhou said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Don't think that reversing life and death and being able to resurrect endlessly means that manpower is inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>The key issue is that resurrection takes time.</p><p></p><p>And the speed at which the Xuanhuang Realm itself nurtures new living beings has been weakened to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Once there is a major loss of personnel, it will take a very long window period to slowly recover. And it is estimated that as the number of resurrections continues to increase, the time required for resurrection will also become longer and longer.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, there should be no major problems.</p><p></p><p>But in the long run...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly spoke, "Fellow Daoist Zhou, there's no need to worry too much. If I remember correctly, your Myriad Immortals Alliance has suppressed and put many cultivators into eternal slumber, right? At a critical moment, you can release them to deal with emergencies."</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan said referred to the cultivators suppressed by the Myriad Immortals Alliance within the Eternal Immortal Wall. Including those whose bodies were occupied by the millions of gods and demons he had summoned before using the "Three Calamities and Hundred Tribulations Illumination God Method".</p><p></p><p>Although they have basically lost their self-awareness and are just empty shells, they can still be used as cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Zhou stared at Li Fan for a moment, but did not answer.</p><p></p><p>He only ended the conversation with a polite smile.</p><p></p><p>"I always have a premonition that the identity of this Posthumous Venerated Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the next life we can test and verify it together. Let's not add variables in this life."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he continued to return to his own preparations.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, it was already the 24th year of the anchor.</p><p></p><p>On the shore of the Congyu Sea, Li Fan quietly appeared and looked up into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Because I falsely conveyed the will of heaven before, it angered the consciousness of the Heavenly Dao. In this life, the calamity of the Blazing Flame Burning Sea not only came three years earlier, but the intensity of the Blazing Flame was also further increased."</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes and looked at the red figure that seemed to be dancing with the wind.</p><p></p><p>It was still a vague human form, but it was different from the aloof figure holding a flame in his hand that he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Flame of this life was sitting cross-legged on an auspicious cloud transformed from flames, with eyes full of killing intent, staring at the living beings of the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>On His body, there was also a creature coiled like a swimming dragon, also staring at the Congyu Sea below as if looking at prey.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if sensing Li Fan's gaze, they abruptly looked towards the direction where Li Fan was.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be a completely new form that I have never seen before. It seems that during these years..."</p><p></p><p>"My gradual arrangements have caused unease and alertness in the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao," Li Fan said with a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, as long as I don't take action, no one in this world can predict what exactly I am planning."</p><p></p><p>"All your resistance is futile."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not stop the progress of the Burning Flame Sea, but only quietly observed from the side.</p><p></p><p>In this life, he had no intention of luring out Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest among the Souls of Heaven and Earth, once Mo Sha emerged, it would inevitably attract the attention of the world's Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan was no longer afraid of them now.</p><p></p><p>But the preparations he made for the destruction of the world were not something that could be revealed. In order not to affect the plan of driving the tiger to swallow the wolf, it was best to maintain a low profile for now.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Li Fan came to the Congyun Sea today was to observe the specific changes that would occur in the Xuanhuang Realm during the process of self-purification.</p><p></p><p>Having thoroughly read the "Butian Lu" by Tian Yi, Li Fan had already gained a new understanding of the occurrence of the Burning Flame Sea event.</p><p></p><p>The Congyun Sea came from the Tianfa Realm and did not belong to the Xuanhuang Realm itself. In the process of mutual integration between the two realms, various "rejection" reactions were bound to occur. The representative ones were the various strange occurrences that frequently happened in various places of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly world-destroying actions of the Burning Flame were actually to better promote the integration of the Congyun Sea with the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The same thing, seen from the perspective of humans and from the perspective of the Heavenly Dao, is completely different."</p><p></p><p>"There is no right or wrong."</p><p></p><p>As the mutated Burning Flame slowly accumulated power, a layer of sealing power also began to appear on the entire boundary of the Congyun Sea, trying to prevent the creatures from escaping.</p><p></p><p>But at the last moment before this heavenly prison was about to take effect, Li Fan saw a group of people hurriedly sailing on a boat from the sea.</p><p></p><p>After finally reaching the shore, they hastily abandoned the boat and fled.</p><p></p><p>The leader was also someone Li Fan was quite familiar with. It was none other than Zhang Haobo!</p><p></p><p>In this life, Li Fan had no interaction with him. But relying on his own inexplicable premonition and his own fortune.</p><p></p><p>He still led his relatives and friends to escape before the great calamity was about to strike.</p><p></p><p>"Haobo, you said we were living well on Liuli Island. Why do we have to leave our hometown and come to this unfamiliar continent?" </p><p></p><p>"Yeah, boss. Although I definitely believe in you and will always follow you, I'm actually still quite puzzled in my heart."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Faced with the doubts of the people around him, Zhang Haobo's expression did not fluctuate much.</p><p></p><p>He only unfolded the map, identified the location, and methodically instructed everyone to continue on their way.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he said, "Haven't you noticed that there seem to be fewer people on the island recently? Ever since the last time when it was said that Immortal Masters from the Wanxian League came."</p><p></p><p>"Not only our island but also other islands, including those Immortal Masters themselves, are quietly withdrawing from the Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Obviously, some major changes are about to happen." Zhang Haobo analyzed very calmly, "Rather than staying in the Congyun Sea waiting to die, it's better to come here and try our luck."</p><p></p><p>The others, upon hearing this, still had a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Some even couldn't help but retort, "But isn't it said that under the power of the Celestial Venerable, everyone can be resurrected after death? Since we can be revived, what is there to be afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo snorted coldly and did not explain.</p><p></p><p>"Those willing to follow me, continue to follow. Those unwilling, the boat is still by the sea, you can return on your own at any time," he only said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd all fell silent, not daring to say more.</p>

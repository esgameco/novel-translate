            <p>Sima Changkong squinted his eyes as if recalling something. New69 book 28shux.com</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he slowly said, "Nowadays, when this matter is mentioned, many cultivators mock it as a farce. But in reality, the scale of the Small World Alliance is not as simple as a farce."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, why would even the perennially hostile Million Immortal Alliance and Five Elders' Association join forces?"</p><p></p><p>A faint glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes, he approached and in a slightly unclear tone asked, "Join forces? Just to deal with the Small World Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Friend Sima, could you be mistaken? Didn't you say that these small worlds are just places for exiled mortals?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would we struggle so hard against a group of ants? Besides, we have the Longevity Supreme Lord suppressing the world. Can they really defeat us?"</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong, seeing Li Fan's disbelief, remained calm, not getting angry.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he smiled faintly, flicked his finger, and a drop of blood flew towards the two.</p><p></p><p>The blood droplet, like a living creature, hovered in the air and then wriggled in all directions, forming a canvas made of blood mist.</p><p></p><p>On the canvas, thrilling scenes unfolded one after another.</p><p></p><p>The side engaged in battle should be the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the other side, also capable of flying and moving freely, was clearly not ordinary mortals.</p><p></p><p>Though their methods of combat differed, they could still stand their ground against the cultivators. New69 book 28shu x.com</p><p></p><p>Some relied solely on their physical bodies to resist the attacks of the cultivators' flying swords and dao techniques. Approaching bravely, they tore the cultivators apart with bare hands.</p><p></p><p>Some controlled strange energies from afar, raining down attacks on the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And others, transparent and in the form of white human skin, floated and roamed in the center of the battlefield. When attached to severely injured individuals, they revitalized them instantly.</p><p></p><p>Those on the brink of death, unable to move, suddenly became vigorous again.</p><p></p><p>Even those with missing limbs, upon being attached by the white skin, could regenerate and regain their strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the scenes changing on the blood screen, his expression gradually becoming serious.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the high-level cultivators of our Xuanhuang Realm? The masters of the Transcendent and Longevity Realms stand by and watch us fighting, indifferent?" Li Fan's tone carried some resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, they do not. They have their own opponents," Sima Changkong shook his head slightly. "Although our ancestors could not witness the scenes of battle due to their limited cultivation, it is said that both sides suffered heavy losses."</p><p></p><p>"Which led to both sides avoiding further conflict for nearly five hundred years, focusing on recuperation and recuperation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but be surprised, "So powerful? Are these people really from the Small Worlds?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and no," Sima Changkong poured more wine for the two and continued, "They are just pawns controlled by someone else."</p><p></p><p>"The real mastermind is someone else."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly shocked, "How so?"</p><p></p><p>"Their origins seem to trace back to the time of the ancient calamity. However, the specifics are not recorded by our ancestors," Sima Changkong sighed. "But based on fragmentary interviews after the war, it seems they are a group of 'those who return.'"</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong looked somewhat puzzled as he continued, "Not only do the cultivators of Xuanhuang Realm who fought against them call them traitors, but even those who do not know their identities naturally harbor immense resentment upon seeing them."</p><p></p><p>"During the battles, thunderstorms struck these people. It seems like they are hated by the entire Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Those who return, traitorsâ€¦" Li Fan fell into deep thought upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Combining what had been witnessed in Zhao Shijie's illusion and the scenes described by Sima Changkong, Li Fan began to speculate.</p><p></p><p>When various calamities struck, such as the Law Not Shared, Celestial Mortal Miasma, and others simultaneously, the major sects of the immortal way initially had plans to unite and overcome these challenges.</p><p></p><p>But as the situation deteriorated rapidly, the sects were preoccupied with their own survival, let alone mutual assistance.</p><p></p><p>As disaster struck, destinies diverged.</p><p></p><p>Some sects vanished from history due to internecine conflicts among disciples.</p><p></p><p>Some sealed off their sects, hiding from the world to eke out an existence.</p><p></p><p>And some, like the Southern Abyssal Beast Mountain or the Celestial Sword Sect, chose to leave the Xuanhuang Realm altogether.</p><p></p><p>"Just like what Di Yi said, each individual of a group has their own choices. Without an absolute leader, it is impossible for them to act with one will," Li Fan reflected.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators have their own choices, which is reasonable."</p><p></p><p>"When these people fled, they may have taken something with them, causing even the Xuanhuang Realm itself to resent them."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder why they returned. However, being able to return safely from the powerful attraction of the Immortal Ruins indicates their strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gradually calmed his thoughts, and his gaze towards Sima Changkong became more intense.</p><p></p><p>For nearly a thousand years, most of the forgotten and sealed events in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm could be answered by Sima Changkong.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan returned from Tianlingzhou to avoid being affected by the war, he came to this underwater crystal cave abode of Sima Changkong.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his familiarity with Sima from his previous incarnation and his own vast knowledge, Li Fan quickly gained his favor.</p><p></p><p>The two spent their days drinking and chatting happily, discussing the past of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>To avoid interruptions and gather more information from Sima Changkong, Li Fan even voluntarily proposed to set up concealment and protective formations in this crystal cave abode.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's enthusiasm, Sima Changkong felt that he could trust this person deeply.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship became even more harmonious.</p><p></p><p>"Peace is temporary, but war is the eternal topic of history," said Sima Changkong with a sigh after a long silence, placing the already raised wine cup down, his mood suddenly low.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you say that..." Li Fan suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>"Has the war between the Million Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Association officially begun?"</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong nodded somewhat heavily, "It is unknown how many cultivators will perish on the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"This is the way of the world, and we are not the Longevity Supreme Lord, how can we resist?" Li Fan poured another cup for Sima Changkong, consoling him.</p><p></p><p>"You are right," Sima Changkong finished his drink, swallowing both the fine wine and memories.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then changed the topic to something else.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, a year had gone by.</p>

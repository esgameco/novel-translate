            <p>Chapter 1066: The Lingering Aura of the Insects' Demise</p><p></p><p>A terrifying spiritual energy storm suddenly swept across the entire Xuanhuang land, with Shi Linzhou at its center. </p><p></p><p>The wind howled and echoed. Even the various sky cities of the Wanxian Alliance, which had been floating in the sky for years and seemed to never fall, experienced varying degrees of tremors due to the influence of the hurricane.</p><p></p><p>The gale was only a secondary concern.</p><p></p><p>What truly shocked the Wanxian Alliance cultivators was the countless black insects, like dark clouds, appearing from unknown origins.</p><p></p><p>They obscured the sky and covered Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Before the Wanxian Alliance could react, the insect disaster had already spread to every corner of their territory.</p><p></p><p>Within just half a day, the spiritual energy concentration in the Xuanhuang Realm experienced a cliff-like drop.</p><p></p><p>In this critical moment, the Wanxian Alliance finally unleashed its power as one of the two dominant forces in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>All Harmonized Dao cultivators within the alliance, regardless of their current tasks, had to participate in exterminating the black insects. Those below the Harmonized Dao realm who were confident in their strength could also join the extermination. Rewards would be bestowed upon them later.</p><p></p><p>Those with insufficient cultivation levels could take shelter in sky cities, cave abodes, or the Tianxuan Mirror during this period, waiting for the calamity to pass.</p><p></p><p>After the Wanxian Alliance's decree was issued, the situation in each state changed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Apart from devouring spiritual energy and rapidly reproducing in large numbers, the mutated Dao-One insects had no other special offensive or defensive abilities.</p><p></p><p>After suffering some casualties, the Wanxian Alliance quickly found the most effective method to deal with the black insects.</p><p></p><p>Using special techniques, they mobilized vast divine consciousness to forcibly control the black insect swarms, making them kill each other and rapidly deplete their numbers.</p><p></p><p>With this method, two Harmonized Dao cultivators could swiftly eradicate the insect disaster in a state within a short period.</p><p></p><p>After the Wanxian Alliance popularized this secret technique called "Insect Monarch," the raging insect disaster showed signs of being dismantled in an instant.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Baishi Dongtian, Li Fan recorded all the cultivators who performed exceptionally well in this insect disaster through the Dao-One Insect Queen's perception, comparing them with the information in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"These are the true upper-level combat forces of the Wanxian Alliance. As long as these people don't fall, the Wanxian Alliance won't face any particularly significant danger."</p><p></p><p>"But if we eliminate these people first, the lack of backbone forces will instantly put the Wanxian Alliance in an awkward situation where they have no one to use. At that time, even small disasters can cause huge impacts."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan's thoughts returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the rapidly decreasing number of insect swarms, he couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>The "Insect Monarch" method of manipulating insect swarms and launching counterattacks was somewhat beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Insect Queen had absolute control over the insect swarm's subordinate bodies. The simple life form of the Dao-One insects also made ordinary control methods completely ineffective on them.</p><p></p><p>However, this Insect Monarch secret technique deprived the Insect Queen of her control by disguising itself as the Insect Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Insect Monarch..."</p><p></p><p>With access to the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan easily learned about this secret technique. In his view, this technique seemed to have the same origin as the Beast Taming Sect's "Beast Taming Wheel."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Emperor Mao has lent a helping hand?"</p><p></p><p>The new Dao-One insects had not been fully deployed. If the insect disaster ended at this moment, it might not achieve the goal of luring out the Dharma Transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, two Dao-One Insect Queens suddenly appeared in Li Fan's palm.</p><p></p><p>Because of the massive death of the insect swarm, their bodies were no longer as plump as they were initially. They looked a bit listless.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were vigilantly and greedily staring at each other.</p><p></p><p>It was the instinct to survive through the crisis by devouring their own kind.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these two little bugs that stirred up the Xuanhuang world, Li Fan's eyes did not have the slightest fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>With a slight exertion of force, he instantly crushed them all to death.</p><p></p><p>Along with Li Fan's action, the entire sky of the Xuanhuang realm changed.</p><p></p><p>Those black insects that originally densely covered the sky and constantly emitted subtle sounds suddenly all quieted down.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Like a rainstorm, they fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance cultivators who were working hard to exterminate the black insects couldn't help but be a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>They subconsciously observed these dead black insects and found that they were not disguised.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, some felt relieved and sighed that the disaster came quickly and left quickly.</p><p></p><p>But some cultivators with keen spiritual awareness felt increasingly uneasy.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly reported the situation to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the black insects that ravaged the Xuanhuang land all died, leaving only a ground full of corpses.</p><p></p><p>If these insect corpses were not dealt with as soon as possible, it would probably cause unknown trouble again.</p><p></p><p>After discussion, the Immortal Alliance quickly issued an order.</p><p></p><p>It was announced that the cultivators who had previously taken shelter from the disaster could safely go out and assist in cleaning up the environment at the same time.</p><p></p><p>It was not mandatory, but there were a large number of contribution points as rewards.</p><p></p><p>So there were still many cultivators who couldn't resist the temptation and left the safe zone.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the black insect corpses covering the entire Xuanhuang land, they all felt their scalps go numb.</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the black insects were almost entirely composed of special energy that they had devoured and transformed.</p><p></p><p>This energy was somewhat similar to spiritual energy, but it could not be absorbed and utilized by the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This special energy also quickly spread in the air.</p><p></p><p>Just half a day later, the qualitative change caused by the quantitative change had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>The strange smell permeating the air made the cultivators in it feel nauseous.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't control the urge to vomit.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone hold your breath and isolate, this insect stench is poisonous!"</p><p></p><p>Nausea was only the most trivial aspect. When a cultivator fainted directly due to staying in the stench environment for too long,</p><p></p><p>the real trouble began.</p><p></p><p>With a bang, the body of the fainted cultivator directly exploded into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Although he was quickly reborn from the cave heaven, after being mixed with the cultivator's flesh and blood, the strange smell in the air became even more unbearable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this special fishy stench, as long as it interacted with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, would enter the cultivator's body along the traces of spiritual energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Not all cultivators were like Li Fan, possessing the nearly endless spiritual power resources of the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators still needed to absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Due to the previous insect disaster, the concentration of spiritual energy in the Xuanhuang realm had already dropped to an extremely low level.</p><p></p><p>Before it could recover, it was contaminated by the insect stench and the smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>Under this situation, as the black insect corpses completely decomposed, it reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>In the foul-smelling environment, even Nascent Soul cultivators could not stay for long.</p><p></p><p>Only those above the Deity Transformation stage could rely on their own strong foundation to maintain normal activities.</p><p></p><p>Even so, after taking a stroll in the external stinky environment, they would also experience varying degrees of nausea psychologically.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang realm was fine, how did it suddenly become like this?"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators sighed from the bottom of their hearts.</p>

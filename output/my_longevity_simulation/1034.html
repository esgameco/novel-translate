            <p>Chapter 1032: The Weak Devour the Strong</p><p></p><p>Fanyong Island, as its name suggests.</p><p></p><p>"Fan" means fence, and "yong" means useless.</p><p></p><p>This island is located in an extremely remote sea area, with no other islands within a thousand miles. However, perhaps it is precisely because of this reason that all the spiritual energy in this sea area has gathered on Fanyong Island, resulting in the island having favorable weather and extremely abundant natural resources year after year.</p><p></p><p>Even without any artificial cultivation, the naturally produced crops are enough for the island's residents to live without worries about food and clothing.</p><p></p><p>Even the several large warehouses on the island are all full of grain, slowly rotting away without anyone caring.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this situation seems to have continued since the creation of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>This has also created a phenomenon: the residents of Fanyong Island have no pressure to survive. Every day, apart from eating and sleeping, the most common activity is called "Wrestling".</p><p></p><p>The two sides of the competition fight naked, and the winner will obtain the loser's social identity for a month: the right to dispose of the other party's assets and exercise the other party's identity rights.</p><p></p><p>Except for actions that harm the island, everything else is allowed.</p><p></p><p>The loser can only watch helplessly as the other party becomes another self for a month.</p><p></p><p>Spending one's own wealth, sleeping with one's own wife...</p><p></p><p>Of course, if one feels unconvinced, one can challenge again after a month.</p><p></p><p>However, if one loses the second time, the duration of one month will double to two months.</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>As the only and most popular entertainment activity on the island, every time a wrestling match is held, it attracts almost all the people of Fanyong Island to watch.</p><p></p><p>People cheer and shout, the parties involved fight with red eyes, and the families of the parties involved are extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>However, just after the most recent wrestling match ended, something unbelievable happened in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The winner actually turned into the appearance of the loser in front of everyone!</p><p></p><p>And the original loser disappeared in public for no reason!</p><p></p><p>What's even more bizarre is that despite such a strange phenomenon occurring, the island's residents did not stop the wrestling competition.</p><p></p><p>Instead, their enthusiasm swelled even more.</p><p></p><p>Winning a person and truly winning everything about them! What could be more exciting than this?</p><p></p><p>At first, people did indeed view this new wrestling with this mentality.</p><p></p><p>But soon, they realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Then panic began to spread on Fanyong Island.</p><p></p><p>But the wrestling did not stop because of this...</p><p></p><p>Because this game was no longer something they could control.</p><p></p><p>Under the shroud of strangeness, at least half the number of people on Fanyong Island engage in wrestling every day. It takes effect forcibly, regardless of the wishes of both parties.</p><p></p><p>The loser disappears, and the winner transforms into the appearance of the loser.</p><p></p><p>Even the ability values of the body will undergo corresponding changes.</p><p></p><p>Only the inner self remains dominated by the winner, devouring the loser's memories.</p><p></p><p>And during the competition, the minds of both parties will be affected to a certain extent. They will do their best and will not deliberately lose.</p><p></p><p>As time passes day by day, with the wrestling continuing non-stop, the population on the island is also rapidly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>Some people couldn't bear it and chose to end their own lives.</p><p></p><p>And the rest are changing identities in one match after another.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan finally found the only survivor on Fanyong Island and sorted out the ins and outs of the matter from the more than 100,000 confused memories in his mind</p><p></p><p>After that, he couldn't help but feel a palpitation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The dark and strange power on Fan Yong Island had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And the oddball in front of him, who looked like a cylinder, with facial features almost drowned out by flesh, leaving only a few vertical lines, was the final winner.</p><p></p><p>This person should have been the weakest existence on Fan Yong Island.</p><p></p><p>Because his weight was too huge, even extending his arms and moving was a difficult task. So in every wrestling match, he couldn't even fight back. He could only take a beating and lose the match.</p><p></p><p>But the will inside this body was a combination of the will of more than 100,000 people on Fan Yong Island. The dominant one was the absolute powerhouse who had been winning all along.</p><p></p><p>Each victory seemed to allow him to devour some strength from the opponent, and now the weight he alone occupied in the overall will was stronger than all the others combined.</p><p></p><p>However, after experiencing such a nightmarish scene, this meatball was also on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the ground in a daze, looking confused.</p><p></p><p>It was only when Li Fan appeared in front of him that he instinctively wanted to initiate a wrestling match.</p><p></p><p>And it was at this moment that Li Fan vaguely felt a dark force emanating from the other party's body, like invisible tentacles trying to attach themselves to him.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan snorted coldly and concealed his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Letting the darkness grasp at nothing.</p><p></p><p>This fat man then continued to sit still in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a premonition in his heart that if he had not dodged the wrestling match just now.</p><p></p><p>Then after becoming the winner, he would also have turned into the revered figure in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As for whether his cultivation level would be preserved, it was unknown.</p><p></p><p>"This ability..."</p><p></p><p>However, what happened on Fan Yong Island was obviously weaker and more limited than Mo Rubin's ability.</p><p></p><p>But if used properly, it was still an extraordinary ability.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed that this wrestling match would eventually cause the winner to degenerate towards weakness...</p><p></p><p>But this was in the case of the strong defeating the weak.</p><p></p><p>What if it was the weak defeating the strong?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't it be possible to quickly transform one's strength in a short period of time by relying on this ability, step by step?</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the weak is the loser and the strong is the winner.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, there were too many ways to achieve victory of the weak over the strong.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but become interested.</p><p></p><p>He went out and casually grabbed a Foundation Establishment cultivator, ignoring his terrified gaze, and directly restrained him with the Binding Insect technique.</p><p></p><p>Then he threw him in front of the fat ball.</p><p></p><p>Driven by instinct, the fat ball initiated a wrestling match invitation to the Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Although the fat ball's body was almost immobile, what dominated his body was a powerful soul.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the healthy but immobile body in front of him, the originally confused eyes of the fat ball instantly burst out with a fierce light of survival.</p><p></p><p>Struggling, it took him almost half a day to finally complete the match.</p><p></p><p>However, to his great disappointment, although he won the match, he did not turn into the opponent's appearance.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned for a moment, then immediately understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>Because this match was not fair.</p><p></p><p>There was an external force interfering with the match...</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the match result was invalid!</p><p></p><p>Associating this with the sudden appearance of this person who did not originally belong to the island's residents, he instantly realized that there were other people hidden on the island!</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>The means to immobilize people like this was most likely a legendary immortal master!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he instantly became excited.</p>

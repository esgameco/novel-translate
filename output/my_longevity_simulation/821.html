            <p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ji Shaoli said this, it immediately shocked the entire room.</p><p></p><p>You should know that the original five million contribution points for the top prize was already an amount that the vast majority of cultivators could not hope to accumulate in their entire lifetime.</p><p></p><p>And in such a short period of time, his net worth could double again?</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was so shocked that he stood up on the spot: "Brother Ji, you're not joking, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's expression changed, and he said solemnly: "When has Ji ever been someone who talks nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao also realized his impropriety and apologized with clasped hands: "It was I, the younger brother, who was abrupt."</p><p></p><p>Having received Ji Shaoli's reaffirmation in person, the gazes of the cultivators present towards him started to become a bit fervent.</p><p></p><p>At least ten million contribution points, let alone in Cong Yunhai.</p><p></p><p>Even in the central core regions of the Immortal Alliance, one would be considered wealthy.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ji, don't keep us in suspense! What exactly is the reason for gathering us here today?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, it can't be that you specially wanted to show off your wealth to us, right?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone discussed and speculated.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli waved his hand, and they all quieted down again.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were focused on him, waiting for Ji Shaoli to speak.</p><p></p><p>"A great war is about to begin, the situation is unclear, and plans need to be made early."</p><p></p><p>"The power of one person, facing the changing situation, is inevitably inadequate. Therefore, we need to act as a group." Ji Shaoli said decisively.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present looked at each other, not knowing what this so-called "grouping" meant.</p><p></p><p>"Mutual help and assistance, united as one. Sharing information, facing difficulties together!" Ji Shaoli looked around and spoke with a resounding voice.</p><p></p><p>However, those present were not young men who would be easily swayed by a few simple words.</p><p></p><p>They showed doubtful expressions, waiting for Ji Shaoli to continue.</p><p></p><p>"As a group, naturally the higher the cultivation levels of the members within the group, the more beneficial it is to the collective. I know that some people present, due to lack of funds, are unable to purchase suitable cultivation methods. So their realms have also been stagnant because of this."</p><p></p><p>"And it just so happens that I have a sufficiently large amount of spare contribution points..."</p><p></p><p>At this point in the conversation, some smart people present had already guessed what Ji Shaoli was going to say next. But it was still somewhat unbelievable, and they stared intently at him.</p><p></p><p>"So, for any brothers willing to join our [Mutual Aid Society], I can lend them the contribution points needed to exchange for cultivation methods in advance."</p><p></p><p>"No interest, just slowly repay in the future. You can even offset and reduce part of the debt by completing tasks issued by the [Mutual Aid Society]."</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't free, the interest-free loan without collateral made the cultivators present very tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Due to my currently limited assets, I have to consider the brothers present. So for now, the upper limit of contribution points each person can borrow is set at 100,000!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the more tasks completed within the [Mutual Aid Society], the higher the borrowing limit will be in the future. There will even be other preferential treatments..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli spoke eloquently, explaining the various operating mechanisms of the [Mutual Aid Society].</p><p></p><p>"Borrowing contribution points doesn't require any oppressive agreements or covenants."</p><p></p><p>"However, if anyone maliciously violates the rules, they shall be jointly executed by the brothers of the Mutual Aid Society!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's expression was solemn, with a hint of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Causing many of the cultivators present to secretly change color.</p><p></p><p>"I</p><p>"I knew it, Fellow Daoist Ji, you are no ordinary person. To actually come up with such a bold idea..."</p><p></p><p>"This [Mutual Aid Society], I'm in!"</p><p></p><p>The first to respond was Pei Tuo, the guardian of Haitong Island and a Golden Core realm cultivator at the peak stage.</p><p></p><p>In the previous cycles, Li Fan had even met him once.</p><p></p><p>This person had been at the peak of the Golden Core stage for more than a decade, but unfortunately, he still hadn't accumulated enough contribution points to exchange for the Nascent Soul cultivation technique. Let alone finding a suitable grotto-heaven to devour.</p><p></p><p>Having wasted precious time, how could he not be anxious?</p><p></p><p>This time, encountering a heaven-sent opportunity, he agreed on the spot without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were any constraints or limitations in joining the [Mutual Aid Society], he would accept them!</p><p></p><p>Being able to step into the Nascent Soul realm a day earlier could make his future life vastly different!</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli applauded and praised, "Well said! Fellow Daoist Pei, rest assured, as the second member of the [Mutual Aid Society], I will definitely not mistreat you!"</p><p></p><p>The first member, of course, referred to Ji Shaoli himself.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's lips moved slightly, seemingly saying something to Pei Tuo.</p><p></p><p>After hearing it, Pei Tuo's body trembled violently, his face full of disbelief, staring intently at Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled faintly and raised his hand to interrupt what the other party was about to say.</p><p></p><p>However, the extremely excited expression on Pei Tuo's face could not be hidden from the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>He got up, came to sit beside Ji Shaoli, and turned his head to look at the cultivators who still hadn't made a choice.</p><p></p><p>Although the crowd was very curious about what benefits Ji Shaoli had promised.</p><p></p><p>But they were not directly dazzled and clamored to join the Mutual Aid Society.</p><p></p><p>After all, no one could guarantee whether Pei Tuo was acting in collusion with Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of hesitation, surprisingly no second person spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"But there are some ugly words that need to be said upfront."</p><p></p><p>"Early entrants to the society will be given preferential treatment in all aspects. The later you join, the more you may have to strive for what you could have originally obtained for free."</p><p></p><p>Although the words were vague, there was a sense of coercion.</p><p></p><p>By the end of this day's banquet, including Pei Tuo, a total of six cultivators chose to join the [Mutual Aid Society] first.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist He, won't you consider it again?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli looked at the departing He Zhenghao and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Brother Ji, I will go back and ponder over it. I will give you a reply soon!" He Zhenghao said with conviction.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli did not insist.</p><p></p><p>After the other cultivators dispersed, Ji Shaoli looked at the six cultivators who stayed behind.</p><p></p><p>Two Golden Core, four Foundational Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Reactivating the [Tahuang Eight Extremes Dragon Slaying Formation], the island was sealed off.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli looked at the few people and nodded with satisfaction, "Very good. You few are the founding members of our [Mutual Aid Society]."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji, is there really no contractual binding in this Mutual Aid Society?" Xiang Xin, another mid-stage Golden Core cultivator among the six, asked.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled faintly, "What restraint is more solid and reliable than the benefits themselves? I said that the original intention of establishing the Mutual Aid Society is for everyone to help each other and tide over the tribulations together."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Xin nodded without answering.</p><p></p><p>The rest also remained silent, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p><p></p><p>Only Pei Tuo could no longer hold back his impatience.</p><p></p><p>After Ji Shaoli's eyes signaled permission, he asked eagerly, "Brother Ji, you mentioned before that you would provide me with information about an ownerless Nascent Soul grotto-heaven..."</p>

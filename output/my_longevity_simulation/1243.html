        <h1>Chapter 1243</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A part of the former Congyun Sea, or rather, a remnant belonging to the Tianfa Realm with a very similar aura..."</p><p></p><p>In the past, Li Fan used the Canghai Pearl to lay his foundation, and his consciousness merged with the Congyun Sea. </p><p></p><p>In this life, the Holy Emperor's avatar directly devoured the remaining consciousness of the Congyun Sea. It can be said that Li Fan is very familiar with the Congyun area.</p><p></p><p>So even though this world fragment has long been a barren and desolate place for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But after standing for just a moment, Li Fan still felt a trace of familiarity from it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized in his heart: "I'm afraid there are reasons why Chuanfa took action to repair it, and this place is his hometown."</p><p></p><p>Walking in the ruins of the Tianfa Realm, although thousands of years have passed, one can still clearly see the terrifying traces of the world's destruction.</p><p></p><p>No complete buildings can be found on the ground, only scattered remnants of broken walls. Occasionally, the bones of cultivators can be seen in the ruins. Judging from their postures, it doesn't seem like they died in a fight with others.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the catastrophe happened very suddenly, without even a chance to struggle."</p><p></p><p>Although he has destroyed the Xuanhuang Realm in various ways, after each destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan has indeed returned to the peak of Jielishan. He has rarely personally witnessed an extinct world.</p><p></p><p>An oppressive feeling surged in the heart of the Holy Fetus Li Fan for no reason.</p><p></p><p>It's not that his state of mind was shaken, but rather the instinctive reaction that living beings will have in this kind of environment.</p><p></p><p>This world fragment is not very large, and Li Fan soon searched it all over. No valuable clues were found.</p><p></p><p>"However, this remnant realm is relatively well-preserved. At present, Chuanfa is only concerned about the balance of the remnant realm's Great Wall and has not taken action. I suppose he will still take it away soon."</p><p></p><p>"This place is not suitable for staying long."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very decisive and quietly turned into a stream of light and left this place.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he did not directly return outside the Xuanxian Boat, but instead went into seclusion here in the remnant realm's Great Wall.</p><p></p><p>One reason is that one of his consciousnesses is already lurking in the Xuanxian Boat, inhabiting and manipulating Zhao Xian. In the current situation, there is no need for him to take action.</p><p></p><p>The second reason is...</p><p></p><p>"The upper limit of the laws here is a bit higher."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because it's closer to the high wall? Or because of the remnants of the thousand realms?"</p><p></p><p>"If environmental factors are not considered, it's really a good place for enlightenment and cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan, who has established his Dao foundation and grotto-heaven with the Xuanhuang Sword Dao, is particularly sensitive to the perception of laws.</p><p></p><p>If the still intact Xuanhuang Realm is a low-lying area with a high upper limit of laws in the Darkest Starry Sea, then here, the remnant realm's Great Wall, is the highest peak of the upper limit of laws in the entire starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Even though it is affected by the lingering starforce, the rhythm of the laws is very difficult to capture. It is also incomplete and very chaotic.</p><p></p><p>But if one can seize the fleeting opportunity to comprehend it, perhaps a day's enlightenment will surpass a hundred or ten years of ordinary bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme principles of the mortal realm were brutally torn into pieces by the power of the True Immortal seal characters from the immortal realm, scattered in the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Survivors like me, on the contrary, find it easier to perceive and comprehend. If it were under normal circumstances..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's mind suddenly recalled the fragments of light and shadow he occasionally saw through the Blood River in the 119th world, where the Xuanhuang Realm communicated with other cultivation realms in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the various realms still existed and everything was in good order. Let alone comprehension, even if cultivators wanted to come into contact with these supreme dark principles, it would be extremely difficult. Those who had such an opportunity by chance were probably destined for the immortal path."</p><p></p><p>Worried that the sword light would attract Chuanfa and Tianyi who might exist in the remnant realm's Great Wall, even with thousands of inspirations, Li Fan did not actually slash out.</p><p></p><p>He only simulated it in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just doing so still made him overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a thought couldn't help but surface: "Staying here all year round, it seems that Chuanfa and Tianyi's cultivation levels should have already reached the peak of the mortal world."</p><p></p><p>While rushing through the starry sea earlier, he had some suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Now he is absolutely certain of this guess.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no doubts about Chuanfa and Tianyi's talent.</p><p></p><p>Their ability to comprehend the supreme laws of the starry sea is definitely not inferior to the Holy Fetus.</p><p></p><p>But compared to before, the slight trepidation in Li Fan's heart has disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"They have indeed reached the upper limit of the Darkest Starry Sea, but that's all. The immortal path is severed, and there is no hope of becoming an immortal..."</p><p></p><p>A faint light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The reason why people think that Chuanfa Tianzun is invincible is because they don't know what cultivation level he actually is.</p><p></p><p>Because of the unknown, there is fear and confusion.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had a vague guess before, below True Immortal and at the peak of the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>But what is the difference between this peak realm and the Longevity Realm, Li Fan could not specifically quantify and perceive.</p><p></p><p>However, now at the foot of the high wall, personally experiencing the existence of the power upper limit in this Darkest Starry Sea, Li Fan's doubts have disappeared.</p><p></p><p>With a goal, it is easier to catch up.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan was also very grateful that the reason why Chuanfa and Tianyi still remained at this realm after thousands of years was because this was the upper limit of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>It is equivalent to their cultivation steps having stagnated for a long time, indirectly giving Li Fan time to catch up.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with the True Immortal of the Immortal Ruins present, even if they find a way to break through the mortal realm, for the safety of the Xuanhuang Realm, they have to weigh it carefully."</p><p></p><p>"In the tortoise and hare race, the tortoise is the winner."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan cast aside distracting thoughts and began to wholeheartedly comprehend the supreme laws of the starry sea drifting here.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual trees of heaven and earth each have their own effects. My little insects have another wonderful feature. After they devour them, the spirit trees will not die directly. Instead, they will gradually transform into insect-transformed spirit wood. The original consciousness can freely choose whether to retain it or not, and can even integrate other sources of consciousness into the Daoyi insect swarm, realizing an existence like an avatar." Wang Xuanba boasted to Ou Shangtian with some complacency.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I still feel that this Dao of Exotic Beasts is ever-changing and interesting. This formation is really boring." A trace of envy flashed in Ou Shangtian's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba smiled and felt a little schadenfreude: "Who told you to aim too high and learn everything you see, angering the master."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, before my formation level reaches the master's requirements, I must not be distracted. Ah, it's a long way off." Ou Shangtian sighed.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, the master also said before that he wants me to be bait in the future to lure out a hidden expert in the Xuanhuang Realm. That person's strength is not weak. If I don't learn formations well, there may be a risk to my life. I don't know if it's true or not." Ou Shangtian was a little...</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian said casually.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Wang Xuanba's expression changed. "Junior brother, don't speak nonsense! Since Master said so, it must be true. You saw Senior Xu Ke before. The hidden experts in the Xuanhuang Realm are truly not to be underestimated. Junior brother must take this seriously!"</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian nodded on the surface in agreement, but in his heart he still didn't quite believe it. </p><p></p><p>That Xu Ke, he had seen him too. Just a decaying old man on the verge of his end.</p><p></p><p>Although his strength was indeed much greater than Ou Shangtian's, with the Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light protecting his body, if Ou Shangtian wanted to escape, even Xu Ke wouldn't be able to stop him!</p><p></p><p>"I want to see just how powerful are these experts that Master speaks of!"</p><p></p><p>Below the Holy Emperor's seat, in the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>Glancing slightly in the direction of Ou Shangtian and Wang Xuanba, Li Ping shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He naturally sensed Ou Shangtian's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Young and impetuous, with many divine treasures at his side, it was understandable. </p><p></p><p>"However, if he doesn't diligently study formations and only relies on the Seven-Colored Divine Light, it will be a bit difficult to escape from Stone Tablet's hands."</p><p></p><p>Laughing inwardly, Li Ping had no intention of reminding him again.</p><p></p><p>Letting him suffer some setbacks is good too. Stone Tablet won't rashly make a deadly move either.</p><p></p><p>As long as Stone Tablet appears, Li Ping will take action to deal with Him.</p><p></p><p>After retrieving Stone Tablet and dealing with Ruomu, Li Ping put this matter aside for now. He stroked the orange kitten lying on his shoulder with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, the kitten's size had grown larger.</p><p></p><p>Its fur had also changed from sparse to dense, becoming smooth.</p><p></p><p>What caught the Holy Emperor's attention even more was the kitten's second transformation.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the kitten could transform into a small square box, and the box would emit light that could duplicate whatever it enveloped.</p><p></p><p>The limits of this ability were still unclear. At the very least, it had no problem duplicating Boundary Tools refined from the power of an entire realm, though it would be somewhat overconsumed.</p><p></p><p>After Wang Xuanba left, Li Ping began conducting experiments.</p><p></p><p>He placed a group of about tens of thousands of Dao-One Insects in front of the kitten.</p><p></p><p>The kitten seemed a bit fearful at first, observing from a distance. But its eyes also revealed desire.</p><p></p><p>Taking two steps forward and one step back, the kitten slowly approached the insect swarm.</p><p></p><p>The Dao-One Insects, usually very sensitive to foreign objects, showed no reaction to the kitten's approach.</p><p></p><p>Finally arriving in front of the swarm, a faint blue light emerged from the kitten's body. Then, under Li Ping's gaze, it transformed into a blue light sphere.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping the Dao-One Insects.</p><p></p><p>The insects inside the blue sphere seemed to instantly freeze, entering a state of stasis. </p><p></p><p>While on the surface of the sphere, various diagrams of the Dao-One Insects' body structures flashed from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's expression couldn't help but turn solemn.</p><p></p><p>The sphere didn't last long, as if this form consumed energy extremely rapidly. </p><p></p><p>Before long, the kitten transformed back into the shape of a little kitten and returned to Li Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>Lazily lying on Li Ping's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The originally motionless Dao-One Insects resumed movement again.</p><p></p><p>But from beginning to end, they were completely unaware of what happened to them.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that the Dao-One Insects have low intelligence. Even if they were transformed into cultivators inside the Xuanhuang Realm, the result probably wouldn't be much better."</p><p></p><p>"This kitten's blue light..."</p><p></p><p>It was a mysterious power that Li Ping had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he patted the kitten.</p><p></p><p>Although the little orange cat was a bit reluctant, considering Li Ping had been feeding it essence of golden origin energy for a long time, it still mustered its spirit.</p><p></p><p>Blue light enveloped its body and shattered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the kitten actually turned into a swarm of Dao-One Insects!</p><p></p><p>Completely identical to the ones enveloped by the blue sphere not far away!</p><p></p><p>The entire transformation process happened right under Li Ping's eyes, but he couldn't find any difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>Even though he called himself the Holy Emperor of Heavenly Mandate, a Xuanhuang Realm Divine Soul, Li Ping couldn't help but express sincere amazement at this godly technique.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the transformation is not limited to just duplicating the original body. It can also completely evolve according to the characteristics of the duplicated entity."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had a realization and a point of golden light appeared on his fingertip again.</p><p></p><p>The kitten understood Li Ping's intention. The Dao-One Insect swarm suddenly expanded. Visibly changing from the original tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, the swarm's number instantly increased tenfold.</p><p></p><p>The swarm of Dao-One Insects transformed from the kitten returned to Li Ping's side as if showing off its accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>After being allowed, amidst shattering blue light, it changed back into the form of an orange kitten.</p><p></p><p>Happily swallowing the essence of origin energy.</p><p></p><p>"This is actually also a kind of duplication. But what's duplicated are living beings, and it can even realize the kitten's own transformations."</p><p></p><p>"Such a technique..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, probably only Immortal Realm treasures could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't sense the slightest aura of immortal spirit energy from this kitten.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the high walls..."</p><p></p><p>An undeniable fact had become clear as day.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know, at what level is this kitten treasure from outside the high walls."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's heart was steadfast, and his determination wasn't shaken by the possible gap that existed inside and outside the high walls.</p><p></p><p>"Item duplication, lifeform imitation... I wonder if the kitten has any other functions?"</p><p></p><p>Wanting to find answers from the little orange cat, but the kitten itself didn't know much about its own abilities either.</p><p></p><p>Only when the conditions were triggered would it automatically learn.</p><p></p><p>"Also, the kitten is not willing to duplicate and imitate just any lifeform."</p><p></p><p>"I tried some ordinary exotic beasts, but it had no reaction at all. Only bizarre existences like the Dao-One Insects can arouse its interest."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping gently stroked this supreme treasure from outside the high walls again, and its various uses flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Although this kitten doesn't have much offensive power, its value is far higher than simple destructive treasures."</p><p></p><p>As if sensing Li Ping's thoughts, the little orange cat meowed proudly.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, Wang Xuanba brought a wooden box and came to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the ground, Wang Xuanba closed his eyes, sensing the power of earth veins flowing deep underground.</p><p></p><p>"Let me give you some appetizers first. The main course is still to come."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Wang Xuanba's face as he transformed into a black shadow and drilled into the ground.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had already reached an extremely deep place underground.</p><p></p><p>The flowing power of earth veins formed a protective barrier, preventing him from approaching.</p><p></p><p>He even vaguely sensed a thread of consciousness sweeping over.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba sneered inwardly and shattered the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>A mass of shadows immediately flew towards the yellow earth veins.</p><p></p><p>The protective layer was easily devoured like paper.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 474</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Come in, come in." Han Yi, who was muttering to himself, was startled and reluctantly handed over a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"There are two thousand low-grade spirit stones inside," Han Yi said somewhat painfully.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, follow me." Li Chenfeng, who had seen millions of contributions, had his horizons broadened and was already looking down on these eighteen hundred contribution points.</p><p></p><p>However, every bit counts, Li Chenfeng frowned and put away the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Leading Han Yi all the way to the front of the Master of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elegant and imposing Foundation Establishment Master who was teaching, Han Yi was full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Being cautious not to disturb, he sat down carefully and listened attentively to the Master's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit cloudy to him, he listened very seriously and did not miss a word.</p><p></p><p>After a lengthy discussion, Han Yi, like the other students, closed his eyes and began trying to establish his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The people on the island naturally did not know that the moment Han Yi set foot on the island, there was a pair of eyes that went through half of the misty clouds and landed on him.</p><p></p><p>"Han fellow Daoist, I have been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>With the heavenly perspective locked on Li Chenfeng, Li Fan looked at Han Yi, who was meditating, with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Waiting for so long?"</p><p></p><p>"After breaking through the Foundation Establishment realm, does my fate depend on me, not the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully pondered the meaning behind these two sentences uttered by Han Yi. </p><p></p><p>Thinking back to his previous life, he had strange moments of both extraordinary luck and ordinary fortune.</p><p></p><p>An audacious guess emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Han Yi can actually control his own luck? And, after he establishes his foundation, the control over his luck will undergo a qualitative change?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan thought of the incarnation object in his immortal realm, the miraculous power of the celestial bird of destiny.</p><p></p><p>"So similar? Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Staring intently at Han Yi. From the heavenly perspective, Li Fan saw a dark feather slowly forming in Han Yi's dantian.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>No matter how he looked at it, this feather was so similar to the one that had once grown on his body.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Foundation Establishment miraculous object is like this. It seems there is no mistake, he is really connected to the celestial bird of destiny."</p><p></p><p>A thought stirred in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>If his previous conjecture was correct, the founder of the empire was Xu Ke. The revered master was the green phoenix bird from back then.</p><p></p><p>But what always puzzled Li Fan was that, according to Li Chenfeng's memories, there was never any trace of a mysterious bird in the empire.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, the connection between the celestial bird of destiny and Xu Ke was much closer.</p><p></p><p>It didn't make sense for the green phoenix bird he picked up along the way always stayed by his side, while the celestial bird, his companion creature, disappeared.</p><p></p><p>If he could figure out the source of Han Yi's peculiar ability, perhaps he could find out where the celestial bird went back then.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As time passed slowly, just as the "Feather of the Celestial Bird" in Han Yi's dantian was about to completely form.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! I did it!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cultivator beside Han Yi stood up and exclaimed loudly.</p><p></p><p>Being influenced by it, Han Yi, who was concentrating, was somewhat affected, and the image of the black feather became diffuse again.</p><p></p><p>He furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>After calming down again, he attempted to condense his own Dao Foundation once more.</p><p></p><p>Another person successfully established their foundation in the courtyard, their aura surged, and they let out a long roar.</p><p></p><p>"Today I finally know who I am! Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>That person laughed heartily, bowed to Zhu Shaotang, and then left in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's brows furrowed, and his Dao Foundation dispersed again.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years of hardship, success finally begins today. From now on, even though the sky and earth are vast, I, Nangong Qian, shall walk upon it." A scholar-looking cultivator shook his head, recited a poem, and then left with an ethereal demeanor.</p><p></p><p>In Han Yi's dantian, the imagery of the black feather of the celestial bird completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the end?"</p><p></p><p>Vigorously spitting out a mouthful of blood, Han Yi angrily stood up and looked around.</p><p></p><p>But to his dismay, he found that he was the only one left in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>With a look of pity, the Foundation Establishment Master looked at him and consoled, "Young man, don't be discouraged. Although you failed this time, I can see that success is not far off for you."</p><p></p><p>"I am sure you will succeed next time."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Han Yi, in a state of excitement, once again spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Next time you come, I'll only charge you one thousand contribution points!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi opened his mouth as if he wanted to speak but hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Although he was filled with reluctance, faced with the Foundation Establishment Master who was far more powerful than him, there was nothing else he could do.</p><p></p><p>Bitterly swallowing the pill, Han Yi staggered as he flew away from the Foundation Establishment Island.</p><p></p><p>"Things couldn't get any worse for Han Yi."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it's not yet time for his fortune to reverse."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered slightly, quietly leaving the Ten Immortals Island, heading straight for Han Yi, who was locked on by an indeterminate killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to directly use the soul-searching spell to see what secrets were hidden on Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>After coming out of the Foundation Establishment Island, Han Yi seemed to have suffered a great blow.</p><p></p><p>Lost without a goal or direction, he flew aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>When he suddenly came to his senses, he found himself in an unfamiliar sea area.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, just a tiny bit short."</p><p></p><p>"This darn fate!"</p><p></p><p>With no one around, Han Yi pointed angrily at the sky, venting his frustration.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the previously calm sea suddenly churned up huge waves.</p><p></p><p>As if something was emerging from the depths of the sea.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi stared at the surface of the water, his expression inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>After looking around, he immersed himself in the water.</p><p></p><p>Continuing downwards, deep into the sea bed.</p><p></p><p>He eventually discovered the source of the disturbance in the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that within the ruins under the sea, a large hole had inexplicably appeared.</p><p></p><p>Countless seawater was sucked into the hole, forming a giant vortex.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi stared at the vortex, his expression constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he gritted his teeth and was about to dive into the vortex.</p><p></p><p>At that moment...</p><p></p><p>"Fettering insect!"</p><p></p><p>He seemed to hear a faint sound in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Han Yi was horrified to find that he had completely lost control of his body and was unable to move at all!</p><p></p><p>An indistinct figure emerged behind him.</p><p></p><p>An extremely dangerous aura emanated from them, chilling Han Yi's heart.</p><p></p><p>As the person's hand was about to cover Han Yi's head...</p><p></p><p>Several golden lights suddenly shot out from above the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>The target was not Han Yi, but the shadow in front of him!</p><p></p><p>The golden lights were powerful, and the shadow had to dodge.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, we've been looking for you so hard!"</p><p></p><p>Four black-clad cultivators, similarly concealing their figures, suddenly appeared, surrounding the two.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

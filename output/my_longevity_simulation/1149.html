            <p>Chapter 1147: A Sword to Suppress the Demonic Sound</p><p></p><p>This time, taking the Heaven's Wonder, since the Holy Fetus Li Fan had already received recognition in advance.</p><p></p><p>So the wooden sword did not block him.</p><p></p><p>The profound aura contained within the wooden sword slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>A profound and mysterious fluctuation gradually emerged on Holy Fetus Li Fan's body. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Profound Yellow Sword Dao completed its transfer.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the bowing and seeing off by countless rusty swords in the Sword Tomb, Holy Fetus Li Fan slowly departed.</p><p></p><p>"Possessing the Heaven's Wonder, one can directly enter the Unifying Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the Sword Dao, the methods of the sword, the sword transforming into a grotto-heaven. And also..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true self, who had already formed his Nascent Soul, instantly became clear about the path the Holy Fetus had to take next.</p><p></p><p>"The self-transformation of the Profound Yellow Sword Dao."</p><p></p><p>"After that, one only needs to completely fuse the Heaven's Wonder with oneself, equivalent to devouring and fully mastering the power of the laws of heaven and earth. Achieving the realm of Unifying Dao Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed much easier compared to ordinary cultivators of new methods. But as a price..."</p><p></p><p>"It almost cuts off the possibility of reversing the principles to prove the Dao and attain immortality. Just like Mr. White, as the Profound Yellow Great Heavenly Venerate, yet going against the principles of heaven and earth he himself grasps. Even if one is so extraordinarily talented to successfully reverse the principles, they definitely cannot escape the backlash from heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"The day of proving the Dao is the moment of destruction."</p><p></p><p>Thoughts surged in Holy Fetus Li Fan's mind, and his realm was also rising step by step.</p><p></p><p>When he left the Sword Tomb, he had just entered the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>But by the time he left Tianyu Province, Holy Fetus Li Fan had already advanced to the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>And when Holy Fetus Li Fan appeared outside the white mist barrier hiding the Chizha Abyss, he had already stepped into the ranks of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Without needing to deliberately absorb, and without the slightest obstruction, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged forth and spontaneously drilled into Holy Fetus Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into steps for steady advancement.</p><p></p><p>"This is the benefit of being recognized by the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"This is only from a single Dao of the 'Sword'. If it were the entire Profound Yellow Heavenly Dao, it's truly unimaginable. No wonder Mr. White was able to advance to the Nascent Soul stage in one step back then, instantly proving immortality..."</p><p></p><p>With the Heaven's Wonder in his body, cultivation no longer required seeking external objects.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the great momentum of heaven and earth actively cooperating, the speed of Holy Fetus Li Fan's cultivation could no longer be speculated using common sense.</p><p></p><p>The sword dao fluctuations spread left and right, forcing open the Devouring Origin white mist.</p><p></p><p>Holy Fetus Li Fan transformed into a sword light, heading straight for Duanzhang Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>When he vaguely heard countless wails that sounded like vengeful ghosts, Holy Fetus Li Fan had already become the same as his true self, both at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>However, after breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, his understanding of the transformation of his own sword dao was still lacking.</p><p></p><p>This also caused the progress of his cultivation to suddenly slow down.</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there!" An angry shout interrupted Holy Fetus Li Fan's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a figure blocked Li Fan's path.</p><p></p><p>Wearing green luminous scale armor and holding a heavy halberd, he pointed at Li Fan from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?! How dare you trespass into the Eternal Immortal Fortress?" The armored cultivator's tone was unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly as he recognized this voice.</p><p></p><p>During the 114th lifetime, he was ordered to construct the "Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation" in the white mist outside the Eternal Immortal Fortress.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Chizha Abyss suddenly became abnormal, and the Jiayin outpost he was at lost contact with the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that supplies were about to run out, Li Fan reversed his Dao heart and returned to the Immortal City alone from the outpost to seek help.</p><p></p><p>Although he encountered some twists and turns along the way and accidentally entered the "Chaotic Word Maze".</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he escaped the predicament safely.</p><p></p><p>Finally, before his lifespan was exhausted, he rushed back to Duanzhang Immortal City at his limit.</p><p></p><p>Originally there were still a few decades</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>His life was about to end, but at the last moment, a furious shout of "Who dares to be so presumptuous!" stopped him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was forced to explain the reason, which delayed him for some time.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when he returned to the immortal city, he was already at the end of his rope and didn't have much time left to live.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The holy fetus Li Fan glanced at the other party indifferently, without offering any explanation.</p><p></p><p>He simply used his finger as a sword and lightly pointed it forward.</p><p></p><p>The white fog that seemed to have existed since ancient times was instantly parted.</p><p></p><p>The wails from the Chizha Abyss were suppressed by the clear sound of the sword.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling white sword light illuminated the world.</p><p></p><p>The eternal immortal fortress made from the severed palm of the ancient celestial venerable, as well as the terrifying abyss filled with murderous energy...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were all fully exposed and clearly visible under the sword light of the holy fetus Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The vast sword light pierced through the figure blocking Li Fan's path, crossed the severed palm immortal city, and fiercely stabbed into the Chizha Abyss!</p><p></p><p>As if captivated by this world-shocking sword, the wailing sounds from the abyss did not reappear for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Until the white fog slowly gathered and the torn wounds healed, the abyss was once again hidden beneath the white fog.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the whispering and wailing sounds gradually resume.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the previous scale, it was much diminished.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they feared that if they were too loud, they would once again attract Li Fan's sword.</p><p></p><p>Recovering from their shock, the gazes of the Qingxuan Army in the eternal immortal fortress all focused on Li Fan's location.</p><p></p><p>They were all as silent as birds.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that even the thick white fog could not conceal the figure that resembled a sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>No one understood the horror of those demonic sounds better than the Qingxuan Army, who guarded outside the abyss day and night.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the myriad demonic sounds were all suppressed by a single sword.</p><p></p><p>Just what level of cultivation was this?</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Army was awestruck, their minds going blank.</p><p></p><p>The holy fetus Li Fan stood with his hands behind his back, quietly looking ahead.</p><p></p><p>The Qinglin armored cultivator in front of him had already become as still as a stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Facing Li Fan's sword directly, although the sword light did not harm him, it had already deeply engraved itself into his mind.</p><p></p><p>From now on, apart from this sword light, he would not be able to accommodate anything else.</p><p></p><p>He appeared to be in a daze, not responding to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But conversely, if he could comprehend Li Fan's sword and absorb it, transforming it into his own understanding.</p><p></p><p>This sword would be a tremendous opportunity for him at the Yuanyuan realm.</p><p></p><p>Even without resources to advance, relying on this sword alone, he could kill enemies across realms.</p><p></p><p>For the present-day Li Fan, those who had offended him in the past no longer needed to be fully repaid.</p><p></p><p>If he happened to encounter them again, giving them a lesson would suffice.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose of the holy fetus Li Fan's sword was to intimidate and draw out Shao Jun, the leader of the Qingxuan Army.</p><p></p><p>After all, only by first displaying his strength could he better discuss the matters to come.</p><p></p><p>As expected, facing Li Fan, who was hovering in the air amidst the white fog, not a single person from the Qingxuan Army dared to step forward to receive him.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the white fog rippled.</p><p></p><p>A bizarre figure, undulating like the surface of water, appeared before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, fellow Daoist! Your sword is impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"I have guarded the Chizha Abyss for many years, but I never thought that someone like you would appear in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun stared at Li Fan and asked, "Fellow Daoist, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed at the Chizha Abyss not far below and said with a smile, "The demonic sounds are noisy and irritating. I wish to rely on my sword to enter the abyss and silence the demonic sounds forever."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Shao Jun is willing to accompany me?"</p><p></p><p>The holy fetus Li Fan spoke with sincere eyes and utmost earnestness.</p>

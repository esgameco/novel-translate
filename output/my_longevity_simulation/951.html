        <h1>Chapter 951</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Who would refuse to easily obtain a magic god projection that is stronger than one's own combat power?</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was about to agree, but at the critical moment, as if struck by a sudden realization, he looked at Li Fan again. </p><p></p><p>"Then, what is the price?"</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a good thing as a pie falling from the sky in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the other party was still resisting stubbornly, Li Fan smiled enchantingly again: "The price? That great, compassionate saint, who was originally able to achieve a transcendent realm above immortality, can now only transform his body into a prison to suppress thousands of gods and demons..."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this enough of a price? It's just that the saint is merciful and has blocked all the disasters for us. If those gods and demons were still rampant, if you wanted to summon them, you would surely have to sacrifice your own soul."</p><p></p><p>"If you are truly grateful, you only need to praise the saint's grace every day."</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's explanation, everything made sense.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang's doubts were all dispelled, and he couldn't help asking again: "I don't know what the name of that saint is..."</p><p></p><p>"Learn [Divine Possession], and you will know." As Li Fan spoke, he pointed lightly at Xin Hongzhang.</p><p></p><p>The contents of this secret method of gods and demons appeared in Xin Hongzhang's mind like a tide in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a supreme wonderful method, truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Just from the words, Xin Hongzhang was able to glimpse the profound wonders of [Divine Possession]. Compared with the techniques he had practiced in his life before, it was like the difference between clouds and mud, one in the sky and one on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the wonderful method, unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>When Xin Hongzhang came to his senses, Li Fan had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Saving the suffering and the troubled, compassion in the mortal world." Xin Hongzhang muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the secret method, the first thing to do was naturally to find a place to practice.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang suppressed the excitement in his heart and returned to the Nine Mountains State Defense Fortress.</p><p></p><p>He spent a lot of money to rent the most secret and highest-level practice room, and sat cross-legged in it, practicing according to the method described in [Divine Possession].</p><p></p><p>Darkness quietly descended on the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang seemed to have returned to the boundless ghost realm where thousands of magic gods were.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the terrifying scene of howling ghosts and wailing gods he had seen before, at this moment, the ghost realm seemed to have fallen into a state of absolute stillness.</p><p></p><p>Above the thousands of gods and demons, a vague figure of a person who was compassionate to the world could be seen, emitting warm rays of light.</p><p></p><p>The fear in Xin Hongzhang's heart gradually dissipated, and with an excited and reverent heart, he respectfully bowed to the figure in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then his mind wandered among the thousands of gods and demons, constantly sensing.</p><p></p><p>When he flew past one of the demon statues, his heart suddenly moved.</p><p></p><p>Muttering something, the next moment, that demon statue suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The still ghost realm shattered with a bang, and in reality, a majestic demon god with eight heads and eight arms appeared in front of Xin Hongzhang.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually [Shedala]!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was instantly overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang tried to communicate with the magic god projection in front of him using his mind. A dark, viscous feeling extended from his mind to his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was startled, but soon, the feeling of being able to command Shedala at will made him put down his worries.</p><p></p><p>Manipulating Shedala to attack, Xin Hongzhang could hardly hide his joy.</p><p></p><p>"This deity had just been summoned, yet it was already stronger than the three summoned by Fellow Daoist Fan Li. If I were to pass on the 'Divine Possession' technique to other cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was instantly lost in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"No mediocrities, no arrogant ones, no unscrupulous ones..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang recalled the selection criteria Fan Li had told him and began to ponder suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>A thousand miles away, Li Fan, who could clearly see Xin Hongzhang's expression through Shedaluo, revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>The so-called myriad deities and demons were naturally the incarnations of Li Fan's thoughts, formed through his cultivation of the "Three Calamities and Hundred Tribulations Illumination Deity Technique".</p><p></p><p>The Divine Possession secret technique was actually using the cultivator's own body as a vessel to summon Li Fan's thought incarnations and provide them with a dwelling place.</p><p></p><p>What appeared to be manipulation at will was actually the thought incarnations reading the cultivator's consciousness and acting on their own accord.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to Li Fan nurturing a part of his consciousness in other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Using their divine sense to nurture and strengthen himself.</p><p></p><p>Unwittingly becoming a tool for others, this was the fate of those who cultivated the "Divine Possession" technique.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the strength of my divine sense surpasses even those who have attained the Dao. If thousands of cultivators become the cradle for my divine thoughts to recuperate in this way..."</p><p></p><p>"The strength will expand by a thousand-fold. It's truly an unexpected gain."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, what's even more wonderful is that my thought incarnations residing in these cultivators' sea of consciousness can also subtly influence and change their thinking, making them completely under my control."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..." Li Fan couldn't help but let out a dark, low laugh.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have already foreseen that a large number of cultivators in the Myriad Immortals Alliance would fall under the Divine Possession secret technique.</p><p></p><p>"Widespread dissemination will definitely attract the attention of the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"The characteristics are already so obvious. As long as Mo Rubin becomes aware of this matter, he will definitely be able to see that this is the handiwork of his former fellow disciples from the Mysterious Heaven Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do is to sow a few more seeds."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure flashed as he flew away from Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After that, he returned to the various prefectures of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. After quietly instigating a total of eighty cultivators to cultivate the "Divine Possession" technique, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Including the initial Xin Hongzhang, there were a total of eighty-one cultivators in the first batch.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? That kid's actions are quite swift. There are already second-generation cultivators." Li Fan sensed for a moment and was very satisfied with Xin Hongzhang's efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"In half a year at most, the number will be quite considerable."</p><p></p><p>"It's coming, it's coming." Li Fan returned contentedly.</p><p></p><p>During the time he was diligently sowing seeds, as Xin Hongzhang had said, the Myriad Immortals Alliance indeed issued an announcement to establish the first free trade prefecture in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it caused a sensation throughout the world. Countless cultivators who yearned for the Five Elders Association and those who vainly hoped to get rich and turn their lives around all rushed to Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Along with the announcement, many detailed rules were also released.</p><p></p><p>These included the development plan for Jiushan Prefecture in the next hundred years, as well as resource and power distribution rules.</p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching among them was a clause: Ordinary cultivators were not qualified to purchase cave abodes and land in Jiushan Prefecture. Only those who had made outstanding contributions to the development of Jiushan Prefecture had this right. Moreover, in order to prevent the powerful from using underhanded means, all land transactions had to be publicized through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>If there were any shady dealings, any cultivator could report it.</p>

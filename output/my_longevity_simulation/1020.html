            <p>Chapter 1018: Already at the Peak of the Mortal World</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had experienced the fusion of completely identical objects before, such as the Dao Stone and the Remnant Stele.</p><p></p><p>However, it was evident that the effects of their fusion were far inferior to that of the Separation Disc.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because the Separation Disc has already reached the pinnacle of the mortal world's array dao. Although it didn't upgrade after devouring its other self, it still underwent a qualitative change."</p><p></p><p>"There are still many existences in the world like the Separation Disc, just a step away from upgrading. But due to the severance of the immortal path, they are almost eternally stuck. After all, not everyone can carry out a grand action like the Heavenly Profound Mirror of the 115th world, mobilizing all the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance to explore myriad small worlds to achieve the upgrade of its main body."</p><p></p><p>"However, the [Two in One] that I achieved with the help of Huan Zhen can easily cross this chasm for them."</p><p></p><p>"This might be the simplest method in the world now to mass-produce near-immortal power."</p><p></p><p>Numerous items and their possible manifestations after self-fusion flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Derivation Jade, the Wooden Sword, and even the Genesis Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>As for whether items that have been fused once can continue to be strengthened through repeated self-fusion...</p><p></p><p>It still needs further verification.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan speculated that it was probably not possible.</p><p></p><p>"The key lies in the severance of the immortal path and the lack of immortal spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"Without the fundamentals, quantity is useless."</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts gradually converged, Li Fan came out of the closed-door chamber and first carried out a revamp of the protective grand array of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The time spent on this improvement was even longer than what Li Fan initially spent on setting up the array. It was almost equivalent to a complete reconstruction.</p><p></p><p>However, the entire process was carried out silently, without disturbing any living beings in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Only after the array was completed did the slight change in the aura enveloping the Spirit Wood Realm cause existences at the Harmonized Dao realm and above, such as the Hundred Flowers Daoist, to have a vague sense of it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood in the sky with his eyes tightly closed.</p><p></p><p>Even without relying on his divine sense and physical eyes to observe, just by relying on the perception of the protective grand array, a miniature view of the entire Spirit Wood Realm appeared in Li Fan's mind in great detail.</p><p></p><p>Even every living being in the Spirit Wood Realm could not escape.</p><p></p><p>With the power of this brand-new protective realm array, Li Fan could instantly annihilate the living beings within the array without taking action himself.</p><p></p><p>"The difference between immortals and mortals is truly like a chasm."</p><p></p><p>"I see the living beings in the Spirit Wood Realm as ants, and immortals probably see me the same way."</p><p></p><p>"If I didn't have Huan Zhen, that is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, the newly laid out Spirit Wood protective realm array was still far from its limit. However, due to the lack of special materials that only exist in the immortal realm and the absence of immortal spiritual energy, the current state of the array actually had little room for further improvement.</p><p></p><p>After completing the initial test of the Separation Disc's power, Li Fan continued to return to the secret chamber to summarize the analysis of the Final Separation Disc's convergence of myriad spirits. At the same time, he supervised the deciphering of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's seal.</p><p></p><p>Although the computing power of the Final Separation Disc was formidable, seemingly already at the top level in the mortal world, it was uncertain if it would extrapolate itself in some strange direction.</p><p></p><p>The dao of arrays was boundless. Li Fan was immersed in it, unaware of the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan suddenly had a premonition and woke up from his research with a start.</p><p></p><p>"Anchored for 15 years, the Medicine King Cauldron returns."</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, it was just about right.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He stopped his work at hand, and his figure instantly left the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>He came to the predetermined landing spot of the Medicine King Cauldron at the Cangwu Abyss and waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards the bottom of the deep abyss, his face somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he naturally still had the ability to go down further.</p><p></p><p>But whenever this idea came up, a sense of unease would surface in his heart, which Li Fan immediately suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Perceiving the distracting thoughts dissolved by the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, Li Fan's eyes were profound: "The inexplicable attraction is indeed not an illusion."</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, the Cangwu Abyss, like the Congyun Sea, is a relatively large remnant of other immortal cultivation realms. Hmm, perhaps it's not just that. The bottom of the abyss may also be related to the depths of the white mist."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around at the floating ruins of buildings and thought slowly.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, the Cangwu Abyss did not exist. The Congyun Sea was created by a palm strike, while the Cangwu Abyss was created by a footstep.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that during the process of the Xuanhuang Realm merging and devouring other immortal cultivation worlds, the Dharma transmission was assisting.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm alone cannot digest it without the help of the Dharma transmission. This in itself can explain some issues."</p><p></p><p>Although the Cangwu Abyss, like the Congyun Sea, must still hide many secrets,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention of tracing it to its roots at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He just waited patiently for the return of the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Consistent with the timing in his memory, in the middle of the night, a fiery meteor illuminated the sky,</p><p></p><p>Then it disappeared into the night, heading straight for the Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>When it reached Li Fan's location, the Medicine King Cauldron stopped in mid-air, concealing its presence.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the landing spot of the Medicine King Cauldron, Li Fan's expression was somewhat subtle.</p><p></p><p>There was only a three-inch deviation. If it weren't for Li Fan's extremely keen divine perception, plus the Huadao Stone meticulously recording everything,</p><p></p><p>It would have almost been overlooked.</p><p></p><p>"Was it affected by an unknown external force during its return? Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Has the [position] and [size] of the Xuanhuang Realm itself changed?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inexplicably felt a sense of unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Instantly reviewing all the events that had occurred in this world in his mind, Li Fan screened for possible targets that could have caused this deviation.</p><p></p><p>After locking onto a few targets, it could not be finally confirmed at present.</p><p></p><p>He just kept it firmly in mind, and then Li Fan manipulated a small Medicine King Cauldron to enter the interior of the true Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>To gain control of the Medicine King Cauldron, one must enter the control room.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long been prepared for this.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, he extracted a strand of Changsheng Qing force from within his body and infused it into the [Life and Death Gate] outside the control room.</p><p></p><p>Before the Medicine King Cauldron had returned, Li Fan had already cultivated the Jishi Changsheng Scripture in advance. Although it had dissipated at this moment, he had stored a certain amount of Changsheng Qing force in the grotto-heaven for backup use.</p><p></p><p>The Jishi Changsheng Scripture could only be cultivated by true disciples of the Medicine King Sect. Having passed the verification, Li Fan successfully entered the control room.</p><p></p><p>It was like a void.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a faint figure, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>That ethereal figure should be the deceased Sect Master of the Medicine King Sect, Liu Ruchen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his face was no longer discernible. He only cast a glance at Li Fan, confirming his identity as a true disciple of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Scenes began to float in the void one by one.</p><p></p><p>It was the process of the Medicine King Sect nearly being captured by the Immortal Ruins after flying out of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Liu Ruchen sacrificed himself and the lives of many elders to barely save the Medicine King Cauldron.</p>

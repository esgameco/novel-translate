            <p>At sunset.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat cross-legged on the seabed, closing his eyes to meditate.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he sensed a yellow light shining on the broken stone, and Li Fan opened his eyes in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Standing up, he asked, "What's going on? How's the test? Is it real?"</p><p></p><p>"Ha ha, you kid, you've achieved great success this time!" A voice with excitement that couldn't be contained.</p><p></p><p>"The test is real! The marks are accurate!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that although the Wanxian Alliance looks dazzling on the outside, the inside is already corrupt beyond belief. I didn't expect it to be even more exaggerated than the rumors!"</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the entrance exam, which concerns the organization's future, is actually being used for personal gain!"</p><p></p><p>"This is just the Heng Family in Tianyu Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>"How will those with even more power act? It's unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>The person's understanding seemed to have suffered a great shock, repeatedly muttering in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan continued, "Isn't this better for us? The faster the Wanxian Alliance falls, the sooner our Five Elders' Association can unify the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>The person nodded, "Yes! Victory will eventually belong to our Five Elders' Association!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, as the exhilaration subsided, Li Fan spoke seriously, "We must act fast. Contact He Zhenghao immediately and obtain the remaining test questions as soon as possible. The meeting place is set at the Wan Cang Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"I will send someone over, and you will be in charge of receiving them."</p><p></p><p>"Also, to prevent the remaining test questions from being incorrect, make sure to wait until after the exam ends and we receive the notification before letting him go."</p><p></p><p>The person carefully instructed Li Fan on many details and then discussed the meeting arrangements before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, as usual, destroyed the scene after erasing the traces and returned to Tai'an Island.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the protection array, Li Fan and his clone faced each other.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Cang Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>This place was somewhere Li Fan had been to before.</p><p></p><p>It was where the inheritance document "Detailed Explanation of the Hundred Veins Array" was stored before the twelfth generation, He Zhenghao, passed away.</p><p></p><p>It was located on the Lurong Island in the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>In his past life, Zhou Qing'ang obtained the spiritual stone supply from the person's face, also through this place.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this place might be a secret base of the Five Elders' Association."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan immediately used the "Covering the Sky with One Hand" secret technique and wore the "Concealment Charm" to conceal the cultivation of his clone, waiting for the arrival of the Five Elders' Association's people.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, his original body changed its appearance randomly and, through a transmission array, went to Lurong Island ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>After a small half-day, when his main body had quietly lurked in the sea area outside Lurong Island, suddenly, a cultivator appeared in the transmission array of Tai'an Island.</p><p></p><p>This person's appearance was unclear. After arriving at Tai'an Island, he circled in the air before sighing and flying away slowly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan's clone silently followed.</p><p></p><p>The person's flying speed was not fast, as if intentionally waiting.</p><p></p><p>After flying a distance from Tai'an Island, they arrived in a deserted area of the sea.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stopped and transmitted his voice, "Why are you following me in secret?"</p><p></p><p>Following the instructions from the man's face, Li Fan's clone did not reply but directly struck out a palm containing the yellow earth attribute power.</p><p></p><p>The man seemed unprepared for Li Fan's sudden attack and did not resist, standing still on the spot.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's palm was about to hit him, the earth attribute suddenly turned into a wood attribute.</p><p></p><p>The man, without dodging, took Li Fan's palm head-on, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, to Lurong Island."</p><p></p><p>After confirming Li Fan's identity, without any further explanation, he directly spoke in a peculiar tone.</p><p></p><p>"Should we use the transmission array?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"We'll fly there."</p><p></p><p>With that, he grabbed Li Fan and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The scenery around them changed rapidly, slightly slower than the dust boat Li Fan had ridden in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"Is this speed at the Nascent Soul realm?"</p><p></p><p>"It's also possible for a Nascent Infancy cultivator specialized in speed..."</p><p></p><p>Silent all the way.</p><p></p><p>Soon, that person brought Li Fan to Lurong Island.</p><p></p><p>After scanning around and not finding He Zhenghao's figure, he asked as if confirming, "Have you informed He Zhenghao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "Should I ask him where he is again?"</p><p></p><p>With a warning tone, the man stopped Li Fan, "Wait. It's better not to use the communication charm."</p><p></p><p>Seeming to imply something, Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his main body flew unreservedly towards their location.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Five Elders' Association's reception cultivator noticed the approach of his main body.</p><p></p><p>Frowning, he became more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arrived in front of them boldly, "Zhou Qing'ang, right?"</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenghao sent me."</p><p></p><p>At this, the Five Elders' Association cultivator and Li Fan's clone all paled.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Zhou Qing'ang and then his expression darkened as he asked coldly, "What do you mean by this, friend?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, seemingly indifferent, replied, "What do you mean? Of course, I'm here to trade."</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't He Zhenghao come in person?" After hesitating, the Five Elders' Association cultivator asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "For such a dangerous matter, how could he come in person? If it's exposed, wouldn't he be implicated?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems you still don't understand this person."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders' Association cultivator glanced at Zhou Qing'ang again, continuing, "If you were caught, wouldn't it implicate him? With five million contributions, does he really trust you so much?"</p><p></p><p>Growing thoroughly impatient, Li Fan retorted, "You don't need to worry about that. So, are we going to trade or not?"</p><p></p><p>"If not, I'll leave. So timid in this line of work!"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, why should you care who I trade with, as long as the test questions are real?"</p><p></p><p>His voice was like a bell, with no attempt to conceal.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders' Association cultivator slightly changed his expression, subconsciously surveying the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he realized that Li Fan's words made some sense.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Zhou Qing'ang and then at Li Fan, he spoke in a low voice, "Okay, keep it down."</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Then, with both of them, he entered the Wan Cang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The staff in the Wan Cang Pavilion all seemed as if they hadn't seen Li Fan's group at all.</p><p></p><p>They walked all the way to the deepest chamber of the pavilion, without encountering any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Sealing the chamber, the Five Elders' Association cultivator said in a deep voice, "And the test questions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan retorted, "And the five million?"</p><p></p><p>"One hand pays the money..."</p><p></p><p>"One hand delivers the goods."</p><p></p><p>Both said in unison, exchanging storage rings after a brief stare-off.</p><p></p><p>"You can't leave yet," said the Five Elders' Association cultivator coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, understood! Are you afraid the test questions are wrong?" Li Fan acted carefree.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at you, you seem inexperienced."</p><p></p><p>He showed a hint of disdain, sat down comfortably, crossing his legs.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I'll wait here until the exam is over," he said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Check out my simulation of the Eternal Life Road first release, remember the domain name: [Domain].

            <p>This is no different from words that could kill one's heart. 69shuxi.com. When He Zhenghao heard this, cold sweat flowed down immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Villain has no ulterior motives, and the enlightened one can see the truth!" He immediately declared.</p><p></p><p>"Think carefully and take care of yourself!" Li Fan snorted coldly, then his shadow shattered and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, He Zhenghao dared to straighten his bent body.</p><p></p><p>Wiping the sweat from his forehead, he sighed deeply. Then he suddenly remembered his daughter was nearby, coughed, and instantly regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, He Xinxin did not notice her father's embarrassment but clapped her chest with her little hand, exclaiming, "Senior Li has such great power, almost comparable to those immortal elders seen at home before. It really scared me."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, that's natural. The honorable lord may be long..." He Zhenghao was about to say something halfway and felt it was inappropriate, so he abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his daughter did not catch the implication in his words, so He Zhenghao changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>"What did the honorable lord mean by his words just now?"</p><p></p><p>"He did not directly deny Xinxin's inference, only said he wouldn't leave..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a trace of horror flashed in He Zhenghao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a real upheaval will happen in the Congyun Sea?"</p><p></p><p>He fell into contemplation afterward.</p><p></p><p>In the deep part of the Political Hall, Li Fan, who saw every subtle change in He Zhenghao's expression, had no emotional fluctuations in his mind. 69shuxi.com</p><p></p><p>"Abandon power, flee for your life. Or cling to a sense of luck, unwilling to leave for the sake of power and wealth..."</p><p></p><p>"He Daoist friend, what will you choose?"</p><p></p><p>Based on Li Fan's understanding of He Zhenghao, there was no doubt that he would choose to stay in Congyun Sea. But he still hoped that the He Zhenghao of this world could surprise him a bit.</p><p></p><p>No longer focusing on He Zhenghao, Li Fan used a secret command to summon many members from within the Congyun Sea system.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it's been a long time since you last summoned us; is there something urgent?"</p><p></p><p>"I find it odd; I haven't heard of any important missions recently."</p><p></p><p>The people were discussing in succession.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, He Zhenghao was still entangled, with a fluctuating expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gao Yuan revealed a thoughtful expression. Instead of immediately inquiring, he kept it in mind.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, when all personnel had gathered, Li Fan appeared gracefully.</p><p></p><p>"Respects to the honorable lord!" Everyone saluted.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be constrained, please sit." Li Fan's expression was gentle.</p><p></p><p>"I called you all here today not for any urgent matter. As you all know, although I am the Congyun Immortal City's secret messenger, I have never been involved in affairs. The Congyun Sea's affairs have never been neglected, and even the overall rankings in all states have improved every year, which naturally can't be separated from everyone's efforts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused, scanned everyone's expressions, and continued, "As the saying goes, to return kindness with kindness. 69shuxi.com I have recently deduced a new opportunity, which I will inform you all about."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the cultivators in the room brightened up. Who was Li Fan? A master who wouldn't care about millions of contributions.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity he mentioned must be extraordinary! So, they all looked at Li Fan with anticipation in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I deduced that soon a cave mansion will rise from the depths of the Congyun Sea. The opportunity lies within this cave!" Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>With these words, the cultivators became somewhat restless.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, opportunities always come with danger. As for whether you want to pursue it, it's entirely up to you." Li Fan said faintly and with a semi-smile, then disappeared from everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they confirmed Li Fan had left, the hall became lively.</p><p></p><p>"What does the honorable lord mean by this? He called us from afar just for these simple words?"</p><p></p><p>"It's strange! Truly strange!"</p><p></p><p>"Could the underwater cave mansion be an ancient sect ruin? Ah, an opportunity that the honorable lord values greatly and rallied us, it must be extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Excitement lit up the faces of the people, and discussions flourished.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, He Zhenghao was even more full of doubts and incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>"He Daoist friend, do you know any secrets?" At that moment, he suddenly heard Gao Yuan's voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, He Zhenghao briefly explained the recent events to Gao Yuan, wanting to hear his opinion.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a disaster about to happen in Congyun Sea?" Gao Yuan was initially surprised but remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"But the honorable lord said he wouldn't leave. After questioning your intentions, he then announced the cave's opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan's thoughts quickly turned, and he came to a conclusion soon.</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>"Please enlighten me, Brother Gao!" He Zhenghao hurriedly asked as if finding a lifesaver.</p><p></p><p>"Because opportunity always accompanies danger!" Gao Yuan said excitedly. "With the resources the honorable lord can control today, and considering the importance he attaches to this opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>"It is highly likely he aims for the ultimate achievement..."</p><p></p><p>"The primal spirit of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>The gazes of He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan met, and they both thought of the same thing.</p><p></p><p>"I see..." He Zhenghao murmured to himself, as if everything suddenly made sense.</p><p></p><p>"If the honorable lord succeeds in merging with Dao, and we, his loyal subordinates who stand by his side..."</p><p></p><p>Listening to this, He Zhenghao's heart ignited with ambition.</p><p></p><p>Deep within his mind, a forbidden thought emerged.</p><p></p><p>The primal spirit of heaven and earth, where the virtuous one resides.</p><p></p><p>If the secret envoy fails to merge with the primal spirit of heaven and earth, perhaps there is still a slight chance for himself?</p><p></p><p>In the history of the Xuanhuang Realm, such things have happened before.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1226</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Facing Baihua's questioning, Sun Luyuan was powerless to answer. </p><p></p><p>The dark golden light of glazed tiles surrounded him. The power that surpassed the Hedao realm made Sun Luyuan's spiritual sense go crazy with warnings, yet he dared not make the slightest movement.</p><p></p><p>"Junior, junior..." </p><p></p><p>In the face of Baihua's tangible murderous intent, the usually eloquent Sun Luyuan couldn't even utter a complete sentence.</p><p></p><p>The truth was, for the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance, the term "Eternal Life realm" was a bit too distant.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, just as Xiao Tian said. Sneaky and suspicious-looking, clearly up to no good." A cold gleam flashed in Daoist Baihua's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The dark golden light encircling Sun Luyuan seemed to come alive and launched a corrosive attack.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with my strength, even if Daqi is a dragon's pool and tiger's den, I can still escape unscathed."</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Sun Luyuan suddenly recalled the bold words he had said to his younger brother before coming.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel it was utterly absurd.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I'm going to die here?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Luyuan was in utter despair, waiting for death, a voice like heavenly music stopped Daoist Baihua's actions.</p><p></p><p>"Bring him before me."</p><p></p><p>Though the tone was calm, it contained boundless majesty.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the devilish youth's expression changed. The playfulness on his face vanished instantly as he respectfully bowed from afar.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua also moved at the sound of the voice.</p><p></p><p>The glazed tile light that was full of aggression transformed into several ropes, tightly binding Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>Following the two, Sun Luyuan was brought into the tallest spire palace in the Daqi minor world.</p><p></p><p>The great hall inside was spacious and solemn.</p><p></p><p>A figure sat above.</p><p></p><p>Shrouded in mysterious light, it was difficult for Sun Luyuan to clearly see their appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Kneel!" The devilish youth said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was a Hedao realm cultivator and held an important position in the Dharma Protector Hall. Besides existences like the Dharma Transmitter and Mirror Holder, he was already at the pinnacle of power in the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But before the ruler of this minor world, he had no hesitation and knelt resolutely.</p><p></p><p>Even Eternal Life realm experts could be commanded. What did his little Hedao realm count for?</p><p></p><p>"Greetings...Holy Emperor." Sun Luyuan said tremblingly, having received the devilish youth's prompt.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Luyuan." The Holy Emperor revealed Sun Luyuan's full name with a single sentence.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with just a few words, he laid out Sun Luyuan's general background.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Emperor's next words made the cold intent in Sun Luyuan's heart dissipate completely as he became overjoyed: "I already know your purpose in coming. The Holy Dynasty does not oppose those in the Wanxian Alliance who wish to pledge allegiance."</p><p></p><p>"Reducing killing and resentment is always good."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's incomparably majestic voice reverberated inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>"As the first person to join the Holy Dynasty, you do indeed deserve some rewards."</p><p></p><p>A beam of chilling light appeared beside the Holy Emperor and instantly flew towards Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>It steadily stopped in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>The onslaught of intense cold made a layer of frost form on Sun Luyuan's face.</p><p></p><p>His internal spiritual power circulated rapidly to dispel this icy aura.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked closely. It turned out that what stopped before his eyes was a pale blue sword.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Millennium Frost-Sealing Sword. When the sword's cold energy is unleashed, it can instantly freeze an entire province of the mortal realm. Although you have a high cultivation realm, your actual combat power is far too</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Weak. He's good at running away, but if he truly fights someone with his life on the line, I'm afraid he can't even beat my few disciples," the Holy Emperor commented.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan didn't dare to refute, only nodding and agreeing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"This sword will be given to you for self-defense."</p><p></p><p>Until the Holy Emperor said these words, under the somewhat malicious gaze of the devilish youth, Sun Luyuan, as if in a dream, refined and collected the Frost-Sealed Sword of Ten Thousand Years.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the Holy Emperor's grace." Sun Luyuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've entered my Holy Dynasty, from now on, you can't have divided loyalties. Tian'er, he's handed over to you."</p><p></p><p>The devilish youth bowed his head and said, "This disciple understands."</p><p></p><p>"You may go." The Holy Emperor gave a light order to dismiss them.</p><p></p><p>Baihua was the first to transform into a beam of light and fly away.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan followed behind Ou Shangtian, slowly leaving.</p><p></p><p>"You, come with me." Ou Shangtian sized up Sun Luyuan and snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you?" Sun Luyuan, having received benefits, didn't mind the other party's attitude and asked with a thick-skinned smile.</p><p></p><p>"Call me General Ou."</p><p></p><p>Only slightly lower than the Holy Emperor's throne, the great hall gathered over ten thousand people.</p><p></p><p>Old and young, all with pious expressions, praying to a statue in the center of the great hall.</p><p></p><p>The statue's specific features couldn't be seen clearly, but its figure was consistent with the Holy Emperor that Sun Luyuan had just seen.</p><p></p><p>The subjects of the Holy Dynasty praying here all possessed cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Luyuan's Harmonious Dao aura, which he hadn't had time to deliberately conceal, didn't have any effect on these people.</p><p></p><p>They all gazed at the Holy Emperor's statue with firm expressions, fully immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>Their minds seemed to be connected into a large net, and the mere might of the Harmonious Dao couldn't shake it in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian led Sun Luyuan all the way to a secret room inside the Holy Heart Hall.</p><p></p><p>In the room, dozens of the Holy Emperor's believers were kneeling in meditation.</p><p></p><p>They all had the cultivation realm of Golden Core, and compared to those people outside, their faith in the Holy Emperor was even more steadfast.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room, the faceless statue of the Holy Emperor still stood tall.</p><p></p><p>"You should also swear and pray." After transmitting a segment of the oath, Ou Shangtian ordered.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan naturally wouldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>He also imitated the posture of those believers, kneeling in front of the Holy Emperor's statue, muttering under his breath.</p><p></p><p>And with Sun Luyuan's action, it seemed as if the majestic and sacred figure of the Holy Emperor truly appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>What made him feel even more appalled was that a formless power was born from the void.</p><p></p><p>Slowly attaching to his body, connecting him with the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan had a feeling that at this moment, he was like an insect that had inadvertently fallen into a spider's web; although he didn't struggle, he was sinking deeper and deeper.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was horrified in his heart. Even the Mirror Holder needed secret methods to control subordinates.</p><p></p><p>With just a few simple words, being able to achieve such deep control...</p><p></p><p>It was simply unheard of!</p><p></p><p>But Sun Luyuan also knew that he could no longer turn back.</p><p></p><p>After the oath was recited, Ou Shangtian's attitude instantly improved quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>His head tilted slightly, as if listening to something.</p><p></p><p>Then he said to Sun Luyuan, "In your body, there are restrictions left by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. If you rashly remove them, it may alert their side. Just keep them for now."</p><p></p><p>"But rest assured, with Master's power protecting you, these restrictions can't harm you either."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian's words put Sun Luyuan's mind at ease quite a bit.</p>

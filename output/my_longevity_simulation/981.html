        <h1>Chapter 981</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Lingmu Realm, the "Ancient Sect" area designated by Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>On the wide and flat stone square between the "Medicine King Sect" and the "Heavenly Mechanism Sect", the smell of blood permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>More than five hundred blood and flesh puppets sat cross-legged, instinctively circulating the "Cangshengling Yuan Gong".</p><p></p><p>"It's only because of your incredible speed, going to each state to capture some cultivators. Otherwise, if the disappearances of these cultivators were all concentrated in one or two states, it would definitely alert the Wanxian Alliance." Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He casually set up a formation on the square, concealing these blood and flesh puppets while also dispersing the heavy bloody smell.</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case. The grassroots defense forces of the Wanxian Alliance haven't recovered so quickly, and many places are basically still unguarded. Besides, I captured all the lowest-level Foundation Establishment cultivators, and the Wanxian Alliance may not really care." Li Qing shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"That's true, the Wanxian Alliance is probably busy building the [Eternal Immortal Wall] and dealing with those millions of unconscious cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Wanxian Alliance was not crippled by the God and Demon Disaster, it has reduced its control over the grassroots to some extent. I'm afraid it won't be long before another large-scale Immortal Alliance recruitment exam is held again."</p><p></p><p>The original body and the avatar were communicating with each other.</p><p></p><p>Until on the square, many barely perceptible subtle sounds suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was like the sound of gears turning, appearing on each blood and flesh puppet. Superimposing and resonating, it finally turned into a crisp sound as a whole.</p><p></p><p>"Click click..."</p><p></p><p>The original body and the avatar looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"How thoughtful, it even actively reminds when the threshold is reached."</p><p></p><p>"This Lingyuan Sect Leader is also an interesting person."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but appreciate him more and more, and decided that he must meet him in the next life.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Looking at the avatar who was circulating the "Cangshengling Yuan Gong", Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had already clearly sensed the increased cultivation in the avatar's body through synchronous perception.</p><p></p><p>But he still asked this question out of mischief.</p><p></p><p>"Well, although the growth is very slow, I can barely cultivate now."</p><p></p><p>"Next, as the number of people cultivating Lingyuan Gong continues to increase, the operating efficiency of the technique will also slowly increase. Until it reaches a limit." Li Qing analyzed while continuing to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's time to promote it in the small world." Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Mass-produce Heavenly Earth Furnaces to revive the spiritual energy in the small world. Then use the Xuanhuang Qingxin Mantra and matching medicinal materials to remove the immortal miasma from the bodies of mortals. Even if the success rate is not high, as long as the base number is large enough, there is no need to worry about the quantity of cultivators that can be mass-produced. Finally, let them all cultivate the "Cangshengling Yuan Gong" to mass-produce low-end cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In this process, if someone with extraordinary talent or outstanding qualities is discovered, they can all be absorbed as formal members of the Wanjie Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Bestow them with real cultivation techniques. </p><p></p><p>As for other cultivators with low utilization value, dispatch them to enter the Blood-Colored River one after another.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A set of processes like an assembly line has been basically determined.</p><p></p><p>Although it sounds very simple, it was only after Li Fan integrated the various opportunities he encountered in the reincarnation cycle that he was able to create this system.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators may not be able to find a way to make the [Heavenly Earth Furnace] that can produce spiritual energy indefinitely in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, connecting and controlling all the Heavenly Earth Furnaces with the [</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After giving instructions, Li Fan felt somewhat bored for a while.</p><p></p><p>At this time, all the plans had officially entered the accumulation stage, just waiting for the next step to make a big move.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had nothing to do for a while, flashed to the outside of the hall where the faceless stone statue was placed.</p><p></p><p>With a light point towards the sky, he released Yan Fangzhou, who had been trapped for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Being trapped in a place with nothing and constantly disturbed by the formation, it felt like years had passed.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Fan's observation, this former prodigy of the heavens should have really gone mad by now.</p><p></p><p>He was completely unaware that he had been released and gained freedom. Even when Li Fan waved his hand in front of his eyes, there was no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan separated a thread of divine sense and entered Yan Fangzhou's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>There was no instinctive defense mechanism against the intrusion of external objects.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou's past memories were completely fragmented, as if cut by a knife.</p><p></p><p>Only occasional storms of fear, helplessness, and pleading thoughts swept through the sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Poor child, let me save you." Li Fan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense swept across, crushing all of Yan Fangzhou's remaining thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if painting on a blank canvas, he freely fabricated a whole new life for Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Born in the Spirit Wood Realm, he was sent to infiltrate the Yan family of the Myriad Immortals Alliance from a young age.</p><p></p><p>Later, while communicating with the Spirit Wood Realm, he was accidentally discovered by someone. In order to prevent his identity from being exposed, he fought while retreating, planning to lure the other party into the Spirit Wood Realm to silence them.</p><p></p><p>Although he succeeded, he himself was also seriously injured and fell unconscious.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mastering the "Cloud and Water Illusion Technique", Li Fan, who had rich experience in this, quickly implanted all these true and false mixed memories into Yan Fangzhou's mind.</p><p></p><p>After being blank for a long time, with a sudden pain, the scenes suddenly surged like a tide.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the solemn-faced Li Fan in front of him, Yan Fangzhou suddenly felt a rush of shame in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, I..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand: "Everyone has moments of failure, it's good that you can come back alive."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou felt a warmth in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivator who discovered your secret has been dealt with."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since you returned to the Spirit Wood Realm, take this opportunity to look around more."</p><p></p><p>"During the time you were unconscious, some changes happened in the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Think about how to cover up your disappearance." Li Fan instructed calmly, and then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou bowed and then swept his divine sense over the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>His expression instantly became a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>"This place... is so different from before I left. What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou looked at the completely new Spirit Wood Realm, feeling both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Fangzhou? You're awake?!" At this time, a somewhat excited voice came from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Shang Tianci?" Yan Fangzhou narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This exceptionally talented young man was a member of Shanhe Pavilion along with him.</p><p></p><p>He was lured and abducted into the Spirit Wood Realm by his design and forced to join the Myriad Realms United Association.</p><p></p><p>And Shang Tianci himself was unaware, thinking that he was a veteran who joined the association one step earlier than Yan Fangzhou.</p>

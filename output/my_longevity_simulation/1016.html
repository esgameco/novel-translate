            <p>Chapter 1014: Source Power Uplifts All Things</p><p></p><p>After paying respects to the faceless immortal stone statue, the relationship between the two seemed to have become much closer.</p><p></p><p>"Qiaogong Daoyou, you have worked hard to establish the Lingyuan Sect to collect source power. What exactly is its purpose? To be honest, I only took over the great undertaking of the Lingyuan Sect because I was attracted to the convenience of the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique, which allows multiple people to cultivate together. As for how to extract and utilize the source power, I currently know nothing about it!" Li Fan asked amiably while taking Qiaogong Jushi to visit the blood and flesh puppets used for automatically cultivating the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Having a separate small world as a base is indeed quite convenient. When I was in the Lingyuan Sect, I didn't dare to put these blood and flesh cultivator puppets in the square so blatantly. I always had to conceal them, otherwise the people below would become restless and all kinds of troubles would arise." Qiaogong Jushi said enviously during the tour.</p><p></p><p>Then he answered Li Fan's question: "Apart from being used to create heavenly mechanism puppets, the vast majority of source power should be stored by me for unexpected needs."</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically speaking, the purified willpower can be used by every cultivator to quickly improve their cultivation. Have you heard the legend that when the immortal sects bestow rewards, the disciples inside can achieve the Dao in a day and break through several major realms in succession? This is the effect of source power."</p><p></p><p>"However, in this Xuanhuang Realm..." Qiaogong Jushi clicked his tongue and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This ghostly place is indeed not suitable for cultivators to live in. Not to mention the resources required to break through each major realm, just the bottleneck of the Heavenly Tribulation is much more severe than other immortal realms." Li Fan also agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there's no choice anymore." Qiaogong Jushi sighed.</p><p></p><p>"However, these restrictions only exist among cultivators. Creations like heavenly mechanism puppets are not subject to the restrictions. By extension, there are also no usage restrictions on magic treasures and the like. Perhaps this is the reason why the Wanxian Alliance always collects a large amount of source power from me as a cut." Qiaogong Jushi said meaningfully afterwards.</p><p></p><p>"You mean... the Tianxuan Mirror?" Li Fan reacted instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Not only that. Undoubtedly, the Tianxuan Mirror is an immortal artifact-level existence. The source power is actually negligible for it. However, within the Wanxian Alliance, all magic treasures that have not been promoted to immortal artifacts can be strengthened by absorbing source power." Qiaogong Jushi smiled.</p><p></p><p>"So there is such a wonderful use." Li Fan looked at the End Dissociation Disc in his sea of consciousness, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Next, with the help of the enthusiastic Qiaogong Jushi, a heavenly mechanism fortress was built next to the blood and flesh puppet square in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was spherical in shape, with two constantly rotating metal rings outside the sphere.</p><p></p><p>When Qiaogong Jushi finished engraving on these two metal rings, Li Fan vaguely sensed that the overflowing source power originally surging into the body of his avatar Li Qing had now converged towards the heavenly mechanism fortress instead, forming drops of golden entities like a gurgling stream turning into a roaring river, dripping and storing inside the sphere.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, Li Fan discovered that these golden source powers were clearly of a lower level compared to the source power essence formed through the faceless immortal stone statue, which was the Flower of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, it still had a fatal attraction to cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although not to the extent of losing one's mind like seeing the Essence of Heaven and Earth, it was still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A surge of greed welled up from the depths of his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Finally done. It seems that due to the weaker restrictions of heaven and earth in the small world, guiding the Source Power is much easier compared to the Xuanhuang Realm." Qiaogong Jushi wiped the sweat from his forehead, feeling somewhat delighted.</p><p></p><p>"This thing is called the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress. I suppose in addition to drawing in Source Power, it should also have defensive functions?" Li Fan cut straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi did not conceal anything: "Indeed, because resources are limited in our Heavenly Mechanism Realm, when developing artifacts, we often pursue the ultimate integration of functions."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi lightly pointed at the sphere not far away, and a flash of light passed.</p><p></p><p>The recently completed building suddenly disappeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This is interesting..." Not only was it invisible to the naked eye, but even divine sense could not detect it.</p><p></p><p>Only by flying forward and touching it with one's hands could its existence be discovered.</p><p></p><p>"This is the concealment state, which requires consuming a certain amount of Source Power to activate. It can achieve nearly the same level of concealment as the [Ancestor], such that even if a Longevity Realm expert personally came, they may not necessarily detect any clues." Qiaogong Jushi said proudly.</p><p></p><p>It indeed lived up to the name "Heavenly Mechanism".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very satisfied. </p><p></p><p>"The only pity is that Source Power is not easy to come by. It needs to be painstakingly extracted from every cultivator practicing Cangshen Lingyuan Gong."</p><p></p><p>"It cannot achieve the self-sustaining circulation and perpetual motion of the [Ancestor]."</p><p></p><p>"Back when I was escaping, I was unable to bring out the [Ancestor]'s energy core components. Perhaps there will never be a chance to unravel this mystery in the future." Qiaogong Jushi looked at the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress before him, seeming to recall his homeland again. His eyes were filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, there will be a chance." Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong Jushi did not take Li Fan's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>After the explanation was complete, Qiaogong Jushi very conscientiously handed over the highest authority of the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress to Li Fan as well.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, information such as how much Source Power was stored in the fortress, how long the various functions were estimated to be usable for, the specific situation around the Heavenly Mechanism Fortress...</p><p></p><p>And so on all appeared in Li Fan's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It gave Li Fan a unique sense of illusion.</p><p></p><p>Increasing the output power of the fortress's Source Power, he enveloped the entire Lingmu Realm within its protective range, and then activated the permanent concealment state.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the amount of Source Power that could be stored became extremely little. It was almost a bit of a deficit.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was not worried, and instead had his avatar Li Qing increase the promotion of Cangshen Lingyuan Gong among the living beings in each small world.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that with the further popularization of Cangshen Lingyuan Gong, not only would the harvest of Source Power increase,</p><p></p><p>But the amount of Source Power Essence produced from the gratitude towards Chenxin Cibei Immortal would also have a qualitative improvement.</p><p></p><p>As this matter gradually got on track, Li Fan, with the attitude of making the best use of everything, did not let Qiaogong Jushi remain idle either.</p><p></p><p>He summoned Tianyang to his side and had Qiaogong Jushi carefully examine him.</p><p></p><p>"This junior brother of mine, back then due to the limitations of his physical talent, was unable to break through to a higher realm. So he took a different path, transforming his body into an object and attaching his soul to a puppet. Later, he absorbed the power of a thousand-year earth fire and finally formed his Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>"Although I later helped him devour the Heavenly Earth Spirit, stepping into the threshold of the Unified Dao, this might be his limit."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Tianyang has followed me loyally for many years. I can't bear to see him stop here..."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Qiaogong, please take a look, is there any way to help Tianyang progress further?" Li Fan asked somewhat solemnly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 707</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But he found out that the cultivator guarding below, named Sun Qi, seemed to be able to faintly sense his presence.</p><p></p><p>He even seemed to be aware of the formless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that even ordinary cultivators in the Nascent Soul realm would find it difficult to perceive the formless killing intent used by Li Fanyuan at the Infant stage of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was precisely detected by this small Golden Core cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Various signs indicated that Sun Qi was not an ordinary person. So Li Fan released a strand of formless killing intent, locking onto him.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, Sun Qi did not show any abnormalities. Just like an ordinary cultivator, he cultivated and carried out missions assigned by the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Until recently, the Lord of Tian Ling City, Sun Liancheng, found him and gave him a [Flower Invitation].</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the illusion, Li Fan, who sensed the scenes coming from thousands of miles away, paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The more blessings from heaven and earth you receive, the harder it is to go against it..." Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Li Xiong, are you having a hard time holding on?" Emperor Fu Song's voice pulled Li Fan back to reality.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao angrily shouted, "Just hiding behind me! Huangfu, how much longer?"</p><p></p><p>"Only the last 1% left, once we handle this part of the illusion, we can finish it completely, hold on a little longer!" Huangfu Song shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, hurry up!" Dongfang Yao swung his fist, shredding dozens of shadow beasts that had silently approached.</p><p></p><p>Looking outside, Li Fan saw countless black shadow beasts, like waves, attacking from all directions, surrounding the three of them.</p><p></p><p>This was the third illusion they had explored in this period.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous two desolate and silent illusions, the level of danger here suddenly increased several times.</p><p></p><p>On the seemingly calm land, numerous eerie beasts made of shadows lurked among the rugged strange rocks.</p><p></p><p>There was hardly any movement during the day.</p><p></p><p>When night fell and the crimson moon rose, under the orange-red moonlight, all the shadows seemed to come alive.</p><p></p><p>Fiercely attacking the intruding beings in the illusions, including Li Fan and his companions.</p><p></p><p>These shadow beasts not only moved quickly and stealthily but also had extremely shocking killing power.</p><p></p><p>Even Dongfang Yao, with his robust body, became bloody after taking a few slashes.</p><p></p><p>What troubled Li Fan and the others even more was that even though they exerted great efforts to kill all these frenzied shadow beasts.</p><p></p><p>The next night when the crimson moon rose again, all the shadow beasts emerged once more.</p><p></p><p>Not only did their numbers not decrease in the slightest, but they also seemed to retain memories from the previous night's battle with them.</p><p></p><p>This plunged Li Fan and the others into a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>They had almost exhausted their supplies before barely holding out amid the tide of shadow beasts.</p><p></p><p>On the third day, they hadn't had the chance to complete the exploration of the entire illusion.</p><p></p><p>Yet the crimson moon descended prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Their situation suddenly became perilous.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, both Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao had decent strength, and Li Fan had concealed the majority of his cultivation strength.</p><p></p><p>So it was a close call.</p><p></p><p>The defensive line they set up seemed like it could be broken by the shadow beasts at any moment, yet it was remarkably resilient, consistently holding firm and not breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when the Heavenly Mirror completed the full data recording.</p><p></p><p>The three of them exerted their strength together, instantly clearing the surrounding area. Then the PuXian True Boat shot up into the sky, rushing towards the crimson moon in the air.</p><p></p><p>The shadow beasts, even in their frenzy, couldn't stop them, only watching helplessly as Li Fan and his companions flew into the crimson moon.</p><p></p><p>"That was really dangerous!" Seeing the familiar white mist around him, Dongfang Yao, covered in blood, couldn't help but curse.</p><p></p><p>"If only we had listened to Li Xiong from the beginning and didn't engage in a deadly fight with them on the first night, but explored while fighting, we would have completed the progress and escaped." Complaining, he took a deep breath, and the deep wounds on his body were slowly recovering.</p><p></p><p>"Well, we can't blame me. It's because of the damn rule of the Immortal Alliance. The reward for exploring 99% and 100% is directly halved. This forces people to completely explore the entire illusion area." Huangfu Song wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, sounding a bit innocent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, calm as ever, commented, "After all, the real crisis may be hidden in that remaining 1%. Fully exploring can directly eliminate danger. The Immortal Alliance's approach is understandable."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see the gains of this time. We got over sixteen hundred points this time, plus the previous ones..."</p><p></p><p>"It's only two thousand four hundred points."赥</p><p></p><p>The faces of Li Fan and his companions didn't look too good.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected such a big difference in value between the illusions."</p><p></p><p>"I really miss the times when we could easily get thirty thousand Qingxuan points..." Dongfang Yao murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Stop complaining!" Huangfu Song said annoyedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't join their bickering, instead focusing on the Qingxuan point exchange list that appeared in the Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Dissociation Disk: 50,000 Qingxuan points."</p><p></p><p>"Remaining quantity: 8."赥</p><p></p><p>This time, perhaps to increase cultivators' enthusiasm for exploring the white mist, the precious items in the Qingxuan point exchange list had quantity restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Once they are exchanged, no more can be obtained.</p><p></p><p>However, the rewards were indeed generous. Aside from the nine dissociation disks in the list, there were also the [Spirit of the Mystic Mirror] and [End Stone Plate].</p><p></p><p>The Spirit of the Mystic Mirror was a naive consciousness with a considerable level of wisdom that could be fused into any magical treasure to enhance its power.</p><p></p><p>The End Stone Plate was a newly generated secondary body. Its appearance resembled a circular stone plate, hence its name.</p><p></p><p>Its specific effects had not been discovered yet.赥</p><p></p><p>"This End Stone Plate seems to be the [Eradication Stone Plate]. In the previous life, the members of the Covering Heaven Sect used this to mass-produce the [Erstone] that could shield the perception of the Mystic Web. It took the cultivators of the Covering Heaven Sect many years of research to discover its amazing use. Since this item has just been born, Wanxian Alliance hasn't figured out its effects yet, which is normal."</p><p></p><p>"One hundred thousand Qingxuan points..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rubbed his chin, thinking back to the areas where he had secretly noted down the constant sounds of the 'Heavenly Physician' wails along the way.</p><p></p><p>Based on his experience during this period, not all illusions allowed Li Fan to hear the faint sounds of the 'Heavenly Physician' within.</p><p></p><p>But once the 'Heavenly Physician' sounds appeared, it meant that an illusion could definitely be found nearby.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't all be that trial ground of the Heavenly Lord who reverses life and death."</p><p></p><p>"There's some risk, but it might not be impossible to give it a try."赥</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was itching to give it a shot.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was exploring in the white mist, in the realm of the beast species, Xu Bai was already preparing to head to the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why did you take off the protective treasures I crafted for you? Is there something wrong with me, Master?" Fang Zaiji saw Xu Bai taking off the folding fan, the white clothes, the sachet, and couldn't help but panic.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled lightly, "When we get to the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, these items won't help in any real danger."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than burying them with my clone, it's better to leave them here."</p><p></p><p>Li San glared at Fang Zaiji fiercely, then comforted Xu Bai, "Young Master, no need to worry. I asked Jiao Daoist friend, and he almost never heard of any accidents with the Immortal Alliance cultivators using the Remote Jade Card. They almost always return safely."</p><p></p><p>"I believe your clone should be fine."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai waved his hand, "You two shouldn't worry. It's just a clone after all. Even if it's lost, it can be re-crafted."</p><p></p><p>"Lao Liu, is the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Array ready?"赥</p><p></p><p>Liu San nodded solemnly, "I have connected your clone's consciousness to a blank node. If there's an irresistible force, it can help him maintain a moment of clear thinking."</p><p></p><p>"That should be enough." Xu Bai smiled.</p><p></p><p>Then, alone, he left Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>Using the transmission array, he crossed several states and arrived at the Fuyu Prefecture in the middle of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In a deserted area, he used the Remote Jade Card.</p><p></p><p>In no time, a square door appeared out of nowhere. A black-robed cultivator emerged from it.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Remote Jade Card in Li Fan's hand, the black-robed cultivator said nothing.</p><p></p><p>He simply led Li Fan through the transparent door.</p><p></p><p>With a momentary dizziness, Li Fan knew he had already arrived inside the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Different from the scene of the Transmission Celestial Lord seen in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>In this illusion that the clone entered into the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, the scene was a slender figure looking at the sky with hands behind the back, softly sighing.</p><p></p><p>"Can't tread on the immortal path in front, Transmission Celestial Lord is above!"</p><p></p><p>()</p>

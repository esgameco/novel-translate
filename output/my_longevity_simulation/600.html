            <p>"Wait a moment more."</p><p></p><p>In the murmurs of the Heavenly Physician, including Hanhai, all the abnormalities within the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace returned to their original state in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Just as they had behaved throughout the countless years undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>And those cultivators adventuring in the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace, including Li Fan's clone, all turned into dust and vanished in smoke with a gentle press of the Heavenly Physician's hands.</p><p></p><p>There was no room for any resistance.</p><p></p><p>In reality, clone Zhou Qing'ang had no idea how he died.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan himself only felt a loss of connection with his clone when the Heavenly Physician's giant hand pressed down.</p><p></p><p>"Extinguishing you for real has nothing to do with you."</p><p></p><p>"Phew." Despite the loss of his clone, Li Fan heaved a sigh of relief and relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I was right in my gamble. Even someone as strong as the Heavenly Physician would never have guessed that it was the ant he just crushed with his foot, scheming against him in secret."</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, there was no change in Li Fan's expression.</p><p></p><p>Because the true strength exhibited by the Heavenly Physician in this battle had reached an unimaginable level.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's original plan, even if the Fisherman was crazy and erratic, with impaired memory, and the Master had bizarre transformations, greatly decreased in strength, the two together should have been able to give the Heavenly Physician some trouble.</p><p></p><p>But the result...</p><p></p><p>The gap in strength between the two and the Heavenly Physician seemed like they were separated by several major realms, just like the difference between Li Fan and them!</p><p></p><p>They were not even close to being the Heavenly Physician's match. </p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan's plan to cause some trouble for the Heavenly Physician had become a self-defeating joke!</p><p></p><p>The Fisherman and the Master were undeniably top-tier experts among the eternal beings. However, they were still like insects at the mercy of the Heavenly Physician.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength...</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Physician, has he advanced to the Eternal Life Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it was impossible to explain why the Heavenly Physician was so formidable.</p><p></p><p>"What is it that he opposes, what principle?"</p><p></p><p>"Silent and obscure, unknown to outsiders. Could it be that the one who controls the cycle of life and death, leading to the failure of the Blue Feather's enlightenment, is him?"</p><p></p><p>"The relationship between the Heavenly Physician and the Ten Thousand Immortals League, what exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, it seems that the Heavenly Physician has never been seen representing the Ten Thousand Immortals League. Even in the last era, when the Xuan Net and the rebellious cultivators fought fiercely..."</p><p></p><p>There were too many doubts rushing to Li Fan's mind at once.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan thought that this time he could at least probe into the Heavenly Physician's background to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the more he knew about him, the more mysterious the person became.</p><p></p><p>"It's better not to provoke him if you haven't comprehended the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed and made a reluctant decision in secret.</p><p></p><p>Even with the treasure of Truly Lingering in his possession, in the face of this absolute gap in strength, he had to temporarily avoid his sharpness.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with too many walks down the wrong path, not every time would he be lucky enough to go unnoticed by him.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing all the dissatisfaction and suspicions in his heart, Li Fan took half a day to gradually calm his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Replaying in his mind the scenes of his clone within the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace, thoughts began swirling in Li Fan's mind again.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Physician, the Heavenly Absolute, and the Heavenly Oracle..."</p><p></p><p>"All starting with 'Heaven' and all old acquaintances. The people in the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace call them the Venerables."</p><p></p><p>"It's obvious that they all share a common origin."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heaven Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Based on the clues he had now, Li Fan almost instinctively drew this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>In the illusion with Senior Sister Zhao, they had had a more in-depth exchange about the Mysterious Heaven Sect, the ancient overlord of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Heaven Sect, usurping the Heavenly Mandate, wielding Heavenly Authority to suppress all living beings in the world.</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the sect often identified themselves as the Heavenly King and the Law King.</p><p></p><p>And the group of people around the Master...</p><p></p><p>Seemed to venerate the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Those accompanying the Master repeatedly mentioned phrases like "Heaven's law is strict, honor the rules and regulations," "Heaven's law must not be violated."</p><p></p><p>It didn't seem to fit the same origin as the Mysterious Heaven Sect Li Fan knew.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but sink into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Inside the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace, an earth-shattering event unfolded.</p><p></p><p>However, the sea of clouds outside the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace seemed completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Other than the recently vanished traces of the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace in the current world.</p><p></p><p>There were no other effects on the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>But the top experts of the Xuanhuang Realm were not limited to just the Heavenly Physician.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators might not know, but the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association's several Eternal Life Venerables would surely notice.</p><p></p><p>And large events often stem from small beginnings. In the recent period, through spending a lot of contribution points and continuously collecting information that was often overlooked by others, Li Fan finally uncovered some clues.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, after the Battle of Tian Lingzhou, there were still some cultivators stationed at the border regions within the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association territory.</p><p></p><p>All these cultivators were recalled in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>As if they had completely abandoned any plans for war for a very long time ahead.</p><p></p><p>Then, from the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association's side, messengers were actually dispatched voluntarily, proposing a plan for friendly exchanges between the two parties.</p><p></p><p>They mentioned that due to their longstanding opposition and isolation, the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association and the Ten Thousand Immortals League had become somewhat unfamiliar with each other.</p><p></p><p>They could take advantage of this rare opportunity after the major battle to exchange information and foster friendly relations.</p><p></p><p>At present, the official response from the Ten Thousand Immortals League to this proposal was still pending.</p><p></p><p>However, the attitude of the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association was truly intriguing.</p><p></p><p>It was worth noting that, relying on their five Eternal Life Venerables, the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association had always been unyielding and uncompromising. They'd never discuss or reason with others if they could avoid it.</p><p></p><p>But now, they had taken the unprecedented initiative to propose friendly exchanges and to ease the conflicts between the two sides?</p><p></p><p>The perplexed cultivators thought that the Ten Thousand Immortals League had completely won over the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association during the Battle of Tian Lingzhou.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan knew that this must be due to the Heavenly Physician's actions, prompting the five Venerables to take notice.</p><p></p><p>"The war before might have had the purpose of testing if the Transmission Method was still present."</p><p></p><p>"Although the result did not bring out the Transmission Method, it made the Heavenly Physician reveal himself."</p><p></p><p>"Does the Grand Elder's Immortal's Association fear him so much? Could it be that the Heavenly Physician has truly advanced to the Eternal Life Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still had some doubts about this.</p><p></p><p>Because according to his shallow understanding of the Eternal Life Realm, after reversing the laws of heaven and earth, one becomes part of the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Heavenly Tao should be very distinct on the bodies of the Eternal Life Venerables. They should emanate an aura of the "Heavenly Way," which should be very apparent.</p><p></p><p>Being like two completely different species, the distinction should be very easy to make compared to cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the Heavenly Physician he had encountered multiple times did not emit the "Heavenly Way." Instead, the aura of a "human" was still very strong.</p><p></p><p>In short, the Heavenly Physician did not quite look like a strong figure of the Eternal Life Realm.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

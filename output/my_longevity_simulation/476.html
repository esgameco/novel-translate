        <h1>Chapter 476</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Could it be that you're running out of energy, knowing you're no match, and deciding to retreat first?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt flashed across the faces of the five black-robed cultivators from the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the power of that palm just now, it's highly possible. One palm almost shattered the realm of our four people. With such divine power unleashed, even if he is strong, he should still suffer considerable backlash..."</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case. The ancient cultivators are skilled in battle, and Li Fans obviously had some hidden strength beforehand."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, caution is key. Let's break this formation first!"</p><p></p><p>The four people exchanged glances and joined forces to attack the illusionary dragon array set up by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like there was no cultivator controlling the formation anymore, and the once unbreakable defense became extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>The giant golden bowl seemed on the verge of collapse in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Excited, the four people increased their attack frequency.</p><p></p><p>Right at the moment when they completely shattered the illusionary dragon array, golden light fell like rain.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping the four people, it reflected dazzling rays of light.</p><p></p><p>Under the radiant golden light, they couldn't help but squint their eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, the leading cultivator suddenly shouted as a loud explosion followed. Some of the golden lights that had fallen around them burst open.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying energy surged out from the center of the explosion, sweeping towards their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>To their surprise, there were sixteen or seventeen explosions camouflaged as golden lights.</p><p></p><p>They were completely surrounded by the explosions. "Crack Space Lustrous Thunder?!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the anger and shock, the points of light of the Lustrous Thunder instantly turned into circles, engulfing them all.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The earth-shattering explosions echoed in the area.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, everything dispersed.</p><p></p><p>In the damaged realm of the four people, their flesh slowly and arduously began to reform.</p><p></p><p>"He's despicable..."</p><p></p><p>"I knew he hadn't gone far!"</p><p></p><p>The faces of the individuals were filled with lingering fear as they quickly scanned their surroundings but still couldn't find where Li Fan was hiding.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tangle with him, let's retreat!" The lead person gritted their teeth.</p><p></p><p>Dispersing the illusions in their realm, they no longer cared about anything else and rushed towards the outskirts of the Yongliang Prefecture by the sea of ​​clouds.</p><p></p><p>After flying for a long time, the coastline of Yongliang Prefecture was already far in the distance, and Li Fan did not reappear.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had given up on pursuing them.</p><p></p><p>The four individuals couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, reflecting on the near-death experience they had just gone through, they vaguely felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Bravo Six, why do I feel like Li Fan has been toying with us on purpose?"</p><p></p><p>"... " Bravo Six, the black-robed cultivator, fell silent for a moment before saying in a deep voice, "Although I don't want to admit it, from the actual situation, there does seem to be something strange."</p><p></p><p>"Clearly, he could have used the Lustrous Thunder to end our lives after that palm. But he waited until we recovered before attacking again."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if he deliberately gave us a chance to catch our breath."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another black-robed cultivator continued, "We were seriously injured just now. With another random attack, he could have easily killed us. However, he didn't do that but spared us instead..."</p><p></p><p>"What is his intention?"</p><p></p><p>The four individuals looked at each other, all puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Li Fan is an ancient cultivator who has been asleep for thousands of years and just awakened. Obviously, someone like him wouldn't have much allegiance to the Myriad Immortals Union." After pondering for a while, Bravo Six suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"You mean..." The other three individuals' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"He figured out our identities as Five Elders Association cultivators and wanted to form a good relationship with us, so he spared our lives intentionally?"</p><p></p><p>"It's very possible."</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean we can recruit him and have him join our Five Elders Association?" Bravo Six had another insight.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the information we gathered, this person was the first to deduce the prophecy of 'Heavenly Mystery Bind Spirit, Mysterious Yellow Unification.' If we can win him over, not only can it offset the failure of this mission, but it can also be a great accomplishment."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the individuals were all somewhat intrigued.</p><p></p><p>The lead cultivator said, "Let's go back and report his situation first."</p><p></p><p>"This person is quite peculiar; we must remain cautious." Another black-robed cultivator nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Bravo Six felt a bit regretful, "This person's whereabouts are erratic, making it quite difficult to track him down."</p><p></p><p>Another person added, "That's right, if it weren't for coming out on this mission and coincidentally encountering him lurking outside, we might not have any way to deal with him."</p><p></p><p>"After all, he is a cultivator of the Heavenly Machine Sect, proficient in the art of deduction. The ability to counter and shield divination techniques is normal."</p><p></p><p>The group conversed back and forth, and as they got closer to Yongliang Prefecture, they gradually noticed the abnormality in their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Despite appearing within reach, no matter how they flew, they only seemed to hover over the azure sea of clouds. They just couldn't reach Yongliang Prefecture and noticed that the distant city also looked a bit blurry.</p><p></p><p>It seemed unreal, as if it was a false depiction.</p><p></p><p>The four individuals stopped their flight, their faces solemn as they stared ahead.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the lead black-robed cultivator exclaimed in shock, "Not good! It's an illusion!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" The other individuals were momentarily stunned but soon realized the situation and looked around in horror.</p><p></p><p>Clouds, wind, and waves...</p><p></p><p>Everything around them froze in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, like cracks appearing on a glass surface, everything shattered.</p><p></p><p>Echoes from the explosion caused by the Lustrous Thunder could still be faintly heard, their celestial realms were in shambles, and their bodies were still in bloody disarray, showing no signs of recovery!</p><p></p><p>Time had frozen at the moment when Li Fan had sneak attacked them with the Lustrous Thunder.</p><p></p><p>"He took advantage of the moment when our celestial realms were being damaged, causing our minds to be in a daze, and then dragged us into the illusion!" Bravo Six finally understood and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Divination arts, formations, illusions..."</p><p></p><p>"He truly lives up to being an ancient cultivator." The lead person coughed and sighed.</p><p></p><p>It completely cut off any chances of infant-stage cultivators using the power of their celestial realms to swiftly recover their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Great technique!" He gazed up into the air.</p><p></p><p>There, Li Fan slowly revealed his figure.</p><p></p><p>"How coincidental..." Li Fan's brow furrowed slightly, whispering to himself.</p><p></p><p>With his skills, he could have easily slaughtered the four members of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wasted so much effort was to use the Cloud and Water Illusion technique to find out the reason why he was discovered while out this time.</p><p></p><p>However, what he got was an answer that seemed a bit absurd.</p><p></p><p>Without further hesitation, he wielded the Five Elements Annihilation Sword consecutively.</p><p></p><p>The four original Five Elders Association cultivators, already seriously injured, put up some resistance for a moment before all succumbing under Li Fan's sword.</p><p></p><p>As the vision of the falling cultivators manifested above, Li Fan had no interest in looking.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he saw that, during the battle with the Four Elders Association cultivators just now...</p><p></p><p>The huge vortex on the seabed suddenly exerted suction force, pulling Han Yi, who was restrained by the 'Binding Insects,' into a deep hole in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Fortune..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood in front of the vortex, his expression pensive.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

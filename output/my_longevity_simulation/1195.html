        <h1>Chapter 1195</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Great Enlightenment..."</p><p></p><p>The Taiyuan Sect cultivator's eyes narrowed slightly, and it seemed as if light and shadows were rapidly flashing within them.</p><p></p><p>"Great Mystery?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what he saw, but his tone became very surprised, and he turned to look at Sun Erlang: "In just a few years, such a large deviation has already appeared? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was completely baffled, not knowing what the other party was talking about.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, follow me." The Taiyuan Sect cultivator carefully observed Sun Erlang again, and then spoke.</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, his figure instantly became transparent.</p><p></p><p>A silver illusory road was generated beneath his feet, leading directly into the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang transformed into a streak of light and closely followed behind.</p><p></p><p>After they entered the mountain, the silver road also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Even the pit that Sun Erlang had dug on Mount Taixuan before was silently restored.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Yi Shu, and the skeleton you sent back is my clan brother."</p><p></p><p>While walking, the Taiyuan Sect disciple said to Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when the great catastrophes of 'Dharma Cannot Be Cultivated Together' and 'Immortal-Mortal Miasma' arrived simultaneously, my clan brother retreated in a hurry and took refuge in a small mortal world. Although he had no affinity with the immortal path since then, he still achieved the position of a mortal emperor. It can be said that it was fate."</p><p></p><p>"After not seeing each other for thousands of years, the day we meet again turns out to be such a scene. Although we had already anticipated this when we parted back then. However..."</p><p></p><p>"Fate plays tricks on people!"</p><p></p><p>"Simulating illusory scenes is still different from actual situations!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu sighed lightly and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Simulation? Actual situations?" Sun Erlang keenly captured the two keywords in Yi Shu's words.</p><p></p><p>"This Taiyuan Sect was famous throughout the world in ancient times for its art of extrapolation. Could the simulation and deviation he mentioned be the future they extrapolated?"</p><p></p><p>They kept going deep underground, and when the scenery appeared in front of them again, they were already high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The azure sky was clear and bright, and below were fertile farmlands stretching for thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang could clearly sense the auras of numerous mortals here.</p><p></p><p>However, Yi Shu was flying towards the empty space ahead.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang quickly caught up, and a hint of doubt suddenly arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because after entering this small world, Yi Shu seemed to have undergone some changes.</p><p></p><p>But for a while, Sun Erlang couldn't say exactly where the change was.</p><p></p><p>"I don't sense any danger, and Master definitely won't harm me..." Sun Erlang suppressed the strangeness in his heart and continued to follow.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a floating city suddenly appeared in Sun Erlang's originally empty field of vision.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, they have some means. They can completely isolate such a large city." Sun Erlang secretly pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yi Shu finally spoke again: "The Taixuan Realm is borrowed by our Taiyuan Sect. To separate the immortal and mortal realms and not disturb the mortals of this realm, we built this crystal wall."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was somewhat unconvinced about Yi Shu's words of disturbing the mortals.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't openly object and just nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The moment his feet touched the ground after passing through the transparent crystal wall and formally entering the Taiyuan Sect, Sun Erlang suddenly sensed that countless pairs of eyes seemed to be looking at him simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were no lack of auras from Harmonious Dao powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was secretly shocked: "The strength of this Taiyuan Sect is preserved too well, and there are still so many cultivators? They..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"How do you deal with the fact that the Dharma cannot be practiced together?"</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper into the floating city, Sun Erlang's strange feeling grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>"It's too quiet here. It doesn't feel like a normal, vibrant city at all."</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang paused in his steps.</p><p></p><p>He finally realized where the abnormal feeling in his heart came from.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyi Sect disciples here, just like the tree people in the Lingmu Realm, had different faces but all exuded the same aura.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were countless bodies of the same person!</p><p></p><p>Although surprised, Sun Erlang remained calm and didn't let his mind wander. He directly asked, "Senior Yi, your Taiyi Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu seemed to see through Sun Erlang's doubts and smiled, "When you meet Senior Brother Chen later, you will understand everything. But rest assured, young hero, our Taiyi Sect has always been clear about gratitude and grudges. You returning the remains of the Taiyi Sect disciples is considered a favor to the sect."</p><p></p><p>"Although the alliance you mentioned may not be realized, you absolutely don't need to worry about your own safety."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang remained noncommittal and swallowed back the words that had reached his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Following Yi Shu, he arrived at a blue transparent crystal structure in the center of the suspended city.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if he saw countless images of himself entering at the same time. When Sun Erlang came to his senses from the illusion, a rather handsome man with hair down to his waist suddenly stood before him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Chen." Yi Shu cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Yi Xing also went to the minor world of Daxuan to carry out the sect's mission. Back then, due to his innate talent, he was never able to enter the inner sect to cultivate, and always held a grudge in his heart..."</p><p></p><p>"Now times have changed. Inner sect, outer sect, it's all become a joke. Let Yi Xing come back."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother." Yi Shu solemnly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Then his figure turned illusory, transformed into blue starlight, and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Chen Tianhai look at Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>With one sentence, he shattered the sky, "According to the original trajectory, you, Sun Erlang, after repeatedly going to Jieli Mountain to seek immortality without success, completely settled down, got married and had children. Seven years later, dissatisfied with the excessive demands of the new prefect, you angrily killed someone. Later, you and your companion Wang Xuanba occupied the mountain as kings and caused trouble in your hometown."</p><p></p><p>"After more than ten years of stirring up trouble, you were finally wiped out by the imperial army. You and Wang Xuanba fought to the death and were hacked to pieces."</p><p></p><p>Hearing about his own "fate" from the other party's mouth, Sun Erlang couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"But now, everything is different."</p><p></p><p>"Your future..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's figure became azure and illusory.</p><p></p><p>But after just a moment, it returned to its original state.</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful! Beyond the variables!"</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Dynasty's beginning..." A strange light flashed in Chen Tianhai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In just a few short years, it can cause such a big deviation..."</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself, seeming to have discovered something extremely exciting.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the origin of your master?" Chen Tianhai asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang just quietly looked at Chen Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let alone you not knowing. Even if you knew, you probably wouldn't say it, and couldn't say it." Chen Tianhai showed an inexplicable smile.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang suddenly felt a bit uncomfortable in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, hold on, the cultivation technique you practice..." Chen Tianhai, who was observing Sun Erlang, suddenly changed the topic, somewhat doubtful.</p>

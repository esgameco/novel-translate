        <h1>Chapter 1171</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The abundant spiritual energy within the Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven was the perfect breeding ground for the unlimited reproduction of the Dao-One Insects.</p><p></p><p>A catastrophic change was quietly unfolding within the five cavern heavens. </p><p></p><p>Ordinary creatures may not be able to perceive the fundamental changes in the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>However, the top-level life forms within the cavern heavens reacted immediately.</p><p></p><p>The most conspicuous among them was the towering giant tree in the wood-attribute cavern heaven.</p><p></p><p>Its branches and leaves moved without wind, as if trying to resist an invisible enemy.</p><p></p><p>A hazy green aura surged from within the giant tree, forming a barrier in an attempt to prevent the infection of the mutated spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this giant tree had obviously not reached the point of being able to form its own cycle.</p><p></p><p>The larger the body, the more nourishment it needs to absorb from the outside world at every moment.</p><p></p><p>Unable to persist for long, the green barrier collapsed on its own.</p><p></p><p>The invisible mutated spiritual energy instantly swarmed and devoured the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>Far outside the cavern heaven, Li Ping could clearly sense the process of the giant tree being completely altered and consumed by the Dao-One Insects.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see countless traces of small insects crawling over the leaves of the giant tree in the wood-attribute cavern heaven.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, on the tree trunk, a human face was formed under the squirming of numerous Dao-One Insects.</p><p></p><p>Hideous and terrifying, its gaze met Li Ping's across the void!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad." </p><p></p><p>Li Ping nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>After struggling for a moment, the human face on the tree trunk was slowly pulled into the tree and disappeared. However, if viewed from a microscopic perspective, at this moment, this giant tree had completely transformed into a combination of countless Dao-One Insects!</p><p></p><p>It was not just this giant tree.</p><p></p><p>All existences within the Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven were inevitably undergoing the same kind of transformation.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping called it...</p><p></p><p>"Insectification"!</p><p></p><p>If all the phenomena and changes brought about by the mutated Dao-One Insects so far were within the expectations of the Holy Emperor Li Ping,</p><p></p><p>then the next scene that unfolded caught him somewhat off guard.</p><p></p><p>When the insectification degree of the entire Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven exceeded one-third,</p><p></p><p>it seemed that a certain existence suddenly awakened.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the pure consciousness of the cavern heaven or small world's Dao, it was hatched from the collective consciousness of billions of Dao-One Insects, using the body of the small world's Dao as a shell!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the world's Dao under normal circumstances, the newly born world consciousness of the Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven was similar to the mutated Dao-One Insects.</p><p></p><p>It was filled with aggressiveness and endless, insatiable desire to devour!</p><p></p><p>Nine pale purple dragons suddenly appeared, guarding around Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"A newborn calf dares to devour a tiger."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping snorted coldly, without the slightest panic.</p><p></p><p>Although the overall insectification of the Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven exceeded his expectations,</p><p></p><p>since he dared to let Baihua Daoren transport the Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven here, it meant that he had sufficient confidence to deal with various problems.</p><p></p><p>"The fortune of the Holy Dynasty transforms into dragons. Billions of subjects are at my disposal!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping chanted, and behind him, the virtual image of the prosperous scene of countless subjects living and working in peace in the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty appeared.</p><p></p><p>Even though the scale of the Great Qi small world was far inferior to the Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven, it was precisely because of the existence of countless beings with firm beliefs within it that it did not lose out even when facing a huge creature a hundred times its size!</p><p></p><p>The scene of the Holy Dynasty was permeated with a faint purple aura, as if it were substantial.</p><p></p><p>Bearing the beliefs and fortune of the billions of beings in the Great Qi, Li Ping's figure flickered, and he stepped onto the insectified Five Elements Grand Cavern Heaven.</p><p></p><p>He stomped down fiercely!</p><p></p><p>In the void</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A sharp cry, like that of a ferocious beast from the ancient primordial times, suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>It echoed for a long time without end.</p><p></p><p>The vast Five Elements Grand Grotto Heaven trembled and shook. The mutated spiritual energy within the grotto surged and boiled, instantly manifesting into various strange black mutant beasts.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely angry and fearless, charging out of the grotto world and attacking Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Their target was not only Li Ping, but also the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty behind him!</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Destined Holy Emperor, his grace covers all eternity!"</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the phantom of the Holy Dynasty suddenly burst forth with boundless pale purple light, completely enveloping Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the purple light of destiny, Li Ping's body also grew with the wind.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, he had already become larger than the entire Great Qi small world.</p><p></p><p>Truly like a giant from mythology who could reach the heavens and stand on the earth, he stood in front of the countless living beings of Great Qi, ready to battle the black insectified mutant beasts!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the sky of the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty, the giant figure of Holy Emperor Li Ping also appeared.</p><p></p><p>Countless subjects subconsciously knelt on the ground, chanting praises of the Holy Emperor's grace.</p><p></p><p>With this assistance, Li Ping's figure expanded several times more.</p><p></p><p>The pale purple on his body gradually solidified, and was then swung out by Li Ping, transforming into thunderbolts, fiercely smashing towards the mutant beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Destined Holy Emperor, with his hands free, raised his fists and then violently pounded on the Five Elements Grand Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>One punch, two punches!</p><p></p><p>Although it was the most simple attack method, it was accompanied by wisps of purple energy being forcibly blasted into the grotto heaven.</p><p></p><p>The ferocity of the insectified Five Elements Grotto Heaven was also slowly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>The original Dao-level insects that were previously sent into the grotto to be eroded were precisely cultivated with a wisp of Li Ping's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, these countless mutated Dao-level insects were all his descendants.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after briefly suppressing the insectified instinctive consciousness, Li Ping gradually gained control of the insectified grotto heaven through this connection.</p><p></p><p>The rebellious Five Elements Grotto Heaven slowly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The black mutant beasts that had previously bared their fangs and brandished their claws, wanting to put Li Ping to death, now flew to Li Ping's side like they were trying to curry favor, constantly trying to please him.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping still maintained his purple giant form, sensing the completely different Five Elements Grand Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>After being insectified and then tamed, this grotto heaven seemed to have formed into another body of his.</p><p></p><p>Not only were all things within the grotto heaven clear to him,</p><p></p><p>He could even manipulate the insectified grotto heaven to move and attack!</p><p></p><p>"World insectification..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping adapted to this brand new body while sinking into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"If ordinary grotto heavens and small worlds are compared to static existences like plants and trees, then after insectification, they are granted abilities like wild beasts."</p><p></p><p>"Greatly increased aggression, and can even spontaneously hunt and prey."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not all benefits..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping slightly frowned, "After insectification, the lifespan of the Five Elements Grand Grotto Heaven has also been greatly shortened."</p><p></p><p>"It may only last for less than a thousand years before inevitably falling into decline."</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth have their own time limits for existence.</p><p></p><p>Measured in units of a hundred million years, compared to mortals, they can almost be said to be eternal existences.</p><p></p><p>But after insectification, it was shortened by who knows how many times.</p><p></p><p>"The harm far outweighs the benefits."</p><p></p><p>"It can be done once but not twice."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping, who considered himself a man of heavenly destiny, made such a judgment.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's true self had a different thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Recently there are two events on Qidian.</p><p></p><p>One is a wish for explosive updates. If the goal is not completed, the donated Qidian coins will be fully refunded, so there's no need to worry and you can try your luck.</p>

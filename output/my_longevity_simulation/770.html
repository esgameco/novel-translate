        <h1>Chapter 770</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I heard you all mention before that the Holy Emperor of the empire might be our common ancestor. I was very interested in him, so I spent some effort investigating him through others." Xu Bai looked towards the Imperial Princess and said indifferently. </p><p></p><p>Before the Imperial Princess could react, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong became excited first: "What did you find out?"</p><p></p><p>"You want to know too?" Xu Bai smiled slightly. "Then trade it for the Sacred Blood Gestating Method."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hong was about to answer, but was stopped by Xiao Qing's outstretched hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she calmed down a bit, took a deep breath, and said to Xu Bai: "Based solely on those words, you want something for nothing from us? At the very least, you need to let us know that the information you've uncovered is truly valuable enough for us to exchange for."</p><p></p><p>"Fair point." Xu Bai nodded in approval, then extended his right hand. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, a jet-black feather appeared in Xu Bai's palm.</p><p>From that feather, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong both sensed a familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei?" They were shocked and exclaimed in unison.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to take the Profound Bird's feather for a closer look, they realized Xu Bai had already taken it back first.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you two are also not unfamiliar with this Fate Profound Bird. That makes things easier, saving me from having to explain further."</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the Universal Alliance, I was fortunate enough to find Xiao Hei's remains in a small world connected to all realms."</p><p></p><p>"This Profound Bird's feather is the only thing left from its remains. Along with it is a fragment of Xiao Hei's memories from when it was alive."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Bai suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei died?" Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong were a bit shocked at first, then stared intently at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>After whetting their appetite, Xu Bai glanced at them and said with a sneer: "Xiao Hei was much more loyal than you two. In order to find traces of my ancestor, it did not hesitate to expend its own life force, traversing all the small worlds of the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Although until its death, it ultimately failed to find [Xu Ke]. But it was not completely without gain."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke may still be alive," Xu Bai said slowly.</p><p></p><p>The soft-spoken words fell on Xiao Hong and Xiao Qing's ears like thunderclaps.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" they rejected in unison.</p><p></p><p>"If the master was truly still alive, we would definitely be able to sense him. But we lost our connection to him long ago."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing frowned, a murderous glint flashing in her phoenix eyes: "To deceive us into giving up the Sacred Blood Gestating Method, you even deliberately fabricated lies about the master's life and death..."</p><p></p><p>Facing Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong who could go berserk at any moment, Xu Bai remained unperturbed, shaking his head and sighing: "So that's why Xu Ke favored and trusted Xiao Hei the most back then - there was indeed a reason."</p><p></p><p>"You can both sense Xu Ke's life and death, but does that mean Xiao Hei couldn't do the same? Yet why did it still firmly believe Xu Ke wasn't dead, traversing countless small worlds just to find him?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Xu Bai pointed into the air.</p><p>A series of images appeared in front of him.</p><p>They were Xiao Hei's memories of searching endlessly for Xu Ke across many small worlds as it passed through them.</p><p>Watching that scene...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The different glimpses of the small worlds and the increasingly slower movements of Little Black due to aging flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing and Little Hong's bodies trembled slightly, and complex expressions appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly stopped, and Xu Bai remained silent, just quietly watching them.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black had personally visited some of them in the past and had already excluded those small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"And the first thing we can be sure of is that my ancestor did not leave the Xuanhuang Realm back then."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Finally understanding, a glimmer of hope flashed in Little Qing's eyes as she stared at Xu Bai: "Is the Master then in the remaining small worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai neither acknowledged nor denied it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he casually changed the subject: "Even if we knew about this, facing the countless remaining small worlds, we would basically be powerless. But now it's different."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance is now trying to unify the Xuanhuang Realm, and all the small worlds will be thoroughly swept and conquered."</p><p></p><p>"Under the relentless campaigns of many cultivators, a lot of the details of the small worlds have been uncovered. As a result, the possible range where Xu Ke might still exist has been further narrowed down."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Little Hong could no longer hold back and said, "Doesn't that mean the Master is likely to be in danger?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded: "If the Myriad Immortal Alliance finds Xu Ke before we do, given their usual modus operandi, the chances of him surviving are slim."</p><p></p><p>Little Hong's expression immediately turned grim: "No, I must..."</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, Red," Little Qing still kept her composure.</p><p></p><p>She first stopped Little Hong with a look, then said to Xu Bai, "Your words don't hold up to scrutiny."</p><p></p><p>"Not only is there no evidence that the Master is still alive, even if he does still exist in this world, how can you guarantee that in the small worlds the Myriad Immortal Alliance has already explored..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish, Xu Bai burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Oh Qing, you are indeed very rational. Yes, I admit that what I said earlier was based solely on guesses from Little Black's memories. But can you deny the possibility that Xu Ke still exists in the remaining small worlds?"</p><p></p><p>"Little Black was fearless when facing the countless unknown small worlds. Now that the range has been greatly narrowed down, you still dare not face the reality."</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of, Qing?" Xu Bai's gaze was intense as he questioned her directly.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing's body trembled as if hit by a heavy hammer.</p><p></p><p>She opened her mouth, but no sound came out.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, what I seek is merely a technique that Xu Ke casually passed down before. Who would have thought that over time, the people around him would be so obsessed with this simple Saint Blood Embryo Technique that they would disregard his life and death," Xu Bai said with a slight sneer.</p><p></p><p>Just as Little Qing was about to speak, the silent Empress finally broke her silence.</p><p></p><p>"I will grant your request. Regardless of whether the Saint Emperor is alive or dead, I will never let him wander in a foreign land again," the Empress said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Empress's decision, Little Qing and Little Hong remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded approvingly, "A wise decision."</p><p></p><p>He then gently waved his hand, and a map of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared before everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm has undergone earth-shattering changes over the past thousands of years," he said.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1203: A Secret Encounter in the Starry Sea</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a top secret of the Wan Xian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Hidden very deeply, even though part of the "Hongmeng Jian Fang" array had been restored, the Wuliang Mirror still found it extremely difficult to search.</p><p></p><p>It also had to be careful not to be discovered by the Tianxuan Mirror, and in the constant search, the Wuliang Mirror gradually began to overload.</p><p></p><p>The mirror body began to shake violently, and faint cracks appeared on the mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's eyes were red as he looked at it, and he wanted to put away the Tianxuan Mirror several times.</p><p></p><p>However, the firm belief transmitted by Sun Luyao stopped him every time.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I can hold on a little longer."</p><p></p><p>"I have found some clues, I can't let the previous efforts go to waste!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I can do it!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Sun Luyao's almost uncontrollable painful voice, the thoughts in Sun Luyuan's mind just now gradually became resolute.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to pass exceptionally slowly, and Sun Luyuan felt like his heart was being cut and he was sitting on pins and needles.</p><p></p><p>In addition to worrying that his younger brother would not be able to hold on and the situation would be completely destroyed, he was also worried about being discovered by the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Wuliang Mirror actively cut off the devouring black light.</p><p></p><p>That strange little mirror couldn't even maintain its floating state anymore, and it fell to the ground with a clang.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan quickly took out the spare essence blood for transfusion.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the Wuliang Mirror barely recovered a little.</p><p></p><p>"How is it..." Sun Luyuan didn't even dare to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, mission accomplished." </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his younger brother did not disappoint him. The moment he heard these four words, Sun Luyuan felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>And after checking the top-secret information his younger brother had discovered, his expression kept changing.</p><p></p><p>"Fu's suspicion was right, Cang has indeed been controlled."</p><p></p><p>"Wei Du..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that within this mirror holder, it is even more complicated than we imagined." Sun Luyao's dark shadow said weakly, "Brother, our Sun family is still too weak, if we are not careful, we will be torn to pieces."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry. Leave the rest to me." Sun Luyuan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, brother. Can you leave the Tianxuan Mirror this time?" Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard Sun Luyao say.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, brother. I haven't lost control. In fact, after the recent few times of extreme exploration, for some reason, I have even deeper control over the Wuliang Mirror. I'm thinking that when I have spare energy, I'll try a few more times. It will be more handy in the future..."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Sun Luyuan was convinced by his younger brother's sincere words.</p><p></p><p>And his condition was indeed much better than the previous times when he lost control after the exploration ended.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Sun Luyuan left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>A phantom floated out from the Wuliang Mirror and entered the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>After a while, lights kept flashing. It turned out that a large amount of materials for nourishing the soul were purchased.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense devoured them to his heart's content, and his originally weak condition quickly reversed.</p><p></p><p>With the origin of the Tianxuan Mirror, he could steal a large amount of materials through the small mirror without anyone knowing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Sun Luyao's figure also floated out.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan, he was filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>These soul-nourishing treasures were useless to him.</p><p></p><p>But the casual guidance of this great man in front of him could make his fusion with the Wuliang Mirror smoother.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that this was something that he and his brother had worked hard for hundreds of years but failed to achieve.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power of this great man was beyond doubt.</p><p></p><p>In Sun Luyao's eyes, compared to</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The person behind the camera was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>And his own submission seemed to be a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you can understand me too, right?" Sun Luyao thought silently.</p><p></p><p>The pain he showed in front of Sun Luyuan before was naturally all an act.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some twists and turns, it was more startling than dangerous.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the information that the big man worked hard to find out made him a little confused.</p><p></p><p>"Sixteen cultivators, summoned by the Dharma transmission, leave Xuanhuang and go beyond the heavens."</p><p></p><p>In Sun Luyao's view, there was nothing particularly strange about this.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Fan's eyes, the meaning was quite different.</p><p></p><p>While his divine sense was slowly recovering, Li Fan was also thinking about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma transmission actually took the unprecedented step of summoning cultivators to leave the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"With his strength, even if these sixteen people are cultivated by the Immortal Alliance into a unified Dao in a short period of time, they are nothing more than ants."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the nail he had arranged, Yang Fei.</p><p></p><p>There didn't seem to be anything unusual about him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not worried that Yang Fei would really meet the Dharma transmission and expose himself, because he himself didn't even know that he was a spy for the Great Awakening of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Because Yang Fei himself was indeed a cultivator of the Immortal Alliance, but just before participating in the Immortal Alliance's great examination, he met a pair of friends who had done a lot of research on the exam, and he happened to guess a few questions correctly.</p><p></p><p>"It can be confirmed that the Dharma transmission summoning these sixteen cultivators to go must be related to the [Echoing Star Power] that is causing turmoil in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's just unknown what the Dharma transmission has encountered that it needs these sixteen cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the echoing star power near the Immortal Ruins has now disappeared. It's also unknown how this group of people will leave the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>This matter was too secretive, and even the records in the Tianxuan Mirror were not many.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that my Holy Fetus is far away on the other side of the Starry Sea, otherwise I could follow behind them and explore."</p><p></p><p>At the thought of this, Li Fan's thoughts suddenly paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought that the purpose of the Dharma transmission in the Darkest Starry Sea was to collect fragments from various immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>The location of the Holy Fetus was the Sea of Relics, where the mysterious echoing star power attracted and gathered the relics of cultivators in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"Since the relics are gathered, are the fragments of the immortal realms also the same?"</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Sea of Relics, is there another Sea of Remnant Realms?"</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the starry sea, the Li Fan Holy Fetus hidden outside the Xuanxian Boat suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His gaze seemed to want to pierce through the endless ruins and darkness, looking into the depths of the Sea of Relics.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I am very close to the Dharma transmission now?" Li Fan couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, if I lie in wait here, I might be able to wait for the sixteen cultivators from the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"To think further, the Dharma transmission is such a powerful existence. Wandering in the Darkest Starry Sea for thousands of years, it's impossible for it not to know about the boat civilization hidden here. The two sides must have had dealings long ago."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the boat may not know the true identity of the Dharma transmission."</p><p></p><p>Although from the information currently available, the boat civilization seems to be weak and feeble. But being able to exist in the Darkest Starry Sea for ten thousand years, and even have some knowledge of the power of the True Immortal Seal characters...</p><p></p><p>The top power of the boat is absolutely not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Xian's strength is too low, and his knowledge of the boat's past is limited."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that some premature advancement is needed."</p><p></p><p>Recommend a new book.</p>

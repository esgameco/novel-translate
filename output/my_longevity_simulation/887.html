        <h1>Chapter 887</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everything was under Li Fan's control. Li Fan successfully obtained two copies of the gray mold spots. ɯoɔ˙xnɥs69吧書69新</p><p></p><p>The entire process was thrilling but without incident. </p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have the treasure [Seven-Colored Jade Void Glaze], which acts like a container to seal the gray mold spots. Otherwise, it would be difficult to control them with ordinary means."</p><p></p><p>"If the gray mold spots were to escape, it would likely be a world-ending catastrophe."</p><p></p><p>Holding such a terrifying object, Li Fan's face showed no trace of fear.</p><p></p><p>He observed the different reactions of the gray mold spots inside the three light spheres. </p><p></p><p>The largest one, after seeing the consequences of the mold spots that were lured out, became subdued again.</p><p></p><p>It quietly lurked inside the skull, just as Li Fan had seen it before.</p><p></p><p>The second light sphere still seemed unwilling to be blocked. It continued to frantically launch corrosion attacks on the surrounding seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>But with Li Fan's continuous supply of Dongtian power, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold spots in the third light sphere were the least in number. And perhaps because they had just split off not long ago, they were the calmest. Their outer color was also not as deep gray as their predecessors in the first two.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan was able to see the true appearance of the gray mold spots.</p><p></p><p>Composed of many orderly horizontal and vertical lines, it looked like...</p><p></p><p>Some kind of text.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the huge character that had appeared on the Immortal Ruins land flashed by in an instant. 新69書吧→69𝙨𝙝𝙪𝙭.𝙘𝙤𝙢</p><p></p><p>The hidden part of these gray mold spots seemed to have many similarities with it!</p><p></p><p>Although the two differed greatly in scale, when Li Fan looked at them from a calligraphy perspective and compared them, he still found that some of the "strokes" were almost completely overlapping!</p><p></p><p>Since he had not been able to see the full character, Li Fan could not determine exactly which character had formed these terrifying world-ending gray mold spots.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could conclude that this character, like [Hunger] and [Chaos], was one of the sources of turmoil in the various realms!</p><p></p><p>"There are also differences between the three."</p><p></p><p>"I have not seen the real Chaos character, only a copy imitated by a mysterious person."</p><p></p><p>"The complete Hunger character led to the formation of the Immortal Ruins. Endless void, countless immortal realms would be affected."</p><p></p><p>"And this new character has no complete entity. It turns into countless gray mold spots, corroding various worlds."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, characters flashed by rapidly one by one.</p><p></p><p>Trying to find ones that corresponded to the disasters brought about by the gray mold spots.</p><p></p><p>But none matched.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what I've seen is just the surface."</p><p></p><p>"Just like I saw before, the Xuanhuang Realm being attracted by the Immortal Ruins..."</p><p></p><p>"Attraction is just an outward manifestation. The true core can only be understood by seeing the true Immortal Character with one's own eyes. 新69書吧→69𝘴𝘩𝘶𝘹.𝘤𝘰𝘮 It's a [Hunger] character..."</p><p></p><p>"Then what is the essence of the gray mold spots?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly looked at the three light spheres in front of him and fell into a long contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, he finally woke up from his deep thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, just guessing based on Li Fan's comprehension ability, he would not be able to understand the mysteries within.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps by cultivating more gray mold spots and observing their proliferation process, some discoveries can be made."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan suppressed this idea for now.</p><p></p><p>Even though the seven-colored divine light had a natural blocking effect on these gray mold spots,</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't mean that the level of the seven-colored Jade Void Flowing Light is higher than the gray spots.</p><p></p><p>After all, what Li Fan can do is merely seal the gray spots.</p><p></p><p>As time passes, the gray spots will not disappear or weaken on their own. But the seven-colored divine light will be constantly eroded.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, it's just using the power of a world's Dao origin to delay the outbreak of the gray spots.</p><p></p><p>"It's the same reason why the Xuanhuang Realm can still be maintained for nearly 10,000 years under the attraction of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I have the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, there is almost no risk of the seven-colored divine light being completely consumed."</p><p></p><p>"But to be on the safe side, three sealing light spheres are already enough."</p><p></p><p>"After all, my purpose has been achieved."</p><p></p><p>He collected these light spheres again and placed them in the deepest part of his own Grotto-Heaven, suppressing them heavily.</p><p></p><p>"With this in hand, even if a Longevity expert comes, they will fall into my scheme."</p><p></p><p>As for the consequences of using the gray spots...</p><p></p><p>At most, the Xuanhuang world will be destroyed, and the Huangzhen will restart!</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan won't easily use this last trump card.</p><p></p><p>Now his strength has greatly increased, and the shortcomings of his divine soul have been made up. Facing the Longevity Celestial Venerables, he can also last a few moves.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with the seven-colored divine light protecting his body, it seems that the situation where he couldn't even use Huangzhen before shouldn't appear again.</p><p></p><p>Under these two premises, being able to accumulate more experience in dealing with Longevity realm experts is not bad.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan has already started planning the most suitable candidates in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start with the ancient Longevity methods first."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the ancient Longevity method experts who have survived until now can be said to be all ultimate old monsters.</p><p></p><p>For a while, Li Fan couldn't find any soft persimmons to pinch.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just when Li Fan was eager to make a move in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the Dharma Celestial Venerable Dharma Image jointly launched by the thirty-three Immortal candidates took action again!</p><p></p><p>This time, the location where the Celestial Venerable Dharma Image appeared was surprisingly within the territory of the Five Elders Council!</p><p></p><p>Yongliang Prefecture, adjacent to Jiushan Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>Unlike the performance in Jiushan Prefecture where it destroyed the ancient and the rotten and suppressed everything, after the Celestial Venerable Dharma Image appeared in the sky and opened its eyes this time.</p><p></p><p>The endless living beings in Yongliang Prefecture indeed felt that a catastrophe was about to come.</p><p></p><p>But at this critical moment, a scholar's phantom image blocked the Celestial Venerable Dharma Image.</p><p></p><p>He only slightly raised his head, his lips slightly parted, seeming to be saying something.</p><p></p><p>And slowly, the cultivators of Yongliang Prefecture actually found that the Dharma Celestial Venerable Dharma Image in the sky slowly closed its eyes again!</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>With a slight tremor, the phantom image of the Celestial Venerable Dharma Image disappeared into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>A world-destroying calamity was thus resolved.</p><p></p><p>The scholar's figure also slowly disappeared, and countless cultivators bowed to the Celestial Venerable to express their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in the area shrouded by the Longevity Celestial Venerable's inverse principle, it's still a bit of a stretch to try to contend with Longevity realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Myriad Immortals Alliance has not been able to gain any substantial benefits from the Five Elders Council for so many years."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Celestial Venerables is simply too strong."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than saying it's fighting against the cultivators, it's better to say it's competing in magic with the five Longevity experts."</p><p></p><p>"There's no chance of winning at all."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan received this image transmitted from the Five Elders Council, he thought so.</p><p></p><p>But immediately, he frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance has always made plans before taking action and doesn't do meaningless things.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't possibly not know that within the territory of the Five Elders Council, the Dharma Celestial Venerable Dharma Image can't gain any advantage at all.</p><p></p><p>But they still did it anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they are experimenting with something?"</p>

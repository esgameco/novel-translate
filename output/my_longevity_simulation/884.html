        <h1>Chapter 884</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's hearts trembled. </p><p></p><p>Because they could naturally hear that the words spoken by this sinister senior were definitely not nonsense.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't complete his request, he would really kill people!</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual energy synthesis..."</p><p></p><p>The initial discovery that the crystal cores inside the exotic beasts could produce spiritual energy was purely accidental.</p><p></p><p>And to make a breakthrough within three years was really a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xiao Qing was deep in thought with furrowed brows, Li Fan suddenly said again: "Hehe, this old man always means what he says! To avoid anyone still harboring luck..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Fan flashed and appeared in the sky above the empire.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of blood-colored threads extended from his body, howling as they flew towards every corner of the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, he had already returned.</p><p></p><p>It's just that at the end of each thread, an ordinary person from the empire was bound.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, like overcast clouds, blocking out the sky.</p><p></p><p>This extremely terrifying scene almost scared many people below into fainting on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The red threads contracted, and those unfortunate souls couldn't even let out a wail before they were all captured by Li Fan and suppressed in the Five Elements Great Hole Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't simply take the lives of these mortals.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he planned to give them to Yin Shangren to be used as materials for researching the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>After fiercely intimidating the empire, Li Fan searched around again before leaving in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>As for the red rope that Mr. Bai left for Xu Ke...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't take it for now.</p><p></p><p>If needed, it could guide a certain "fated person" to come and retrieve it.</p><p></p><p>As for his true self...</p><p></p><p>Forget it.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan, this oppressive big devil, left, the people of the empire felt like they had survived a catastrophe and wept bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing, after taking stock of the list of missing persons, felt her heart sink.</p><p></p><p>Because she was horrified to discover that the group of people abducted by the senior of the Myriad Worlds Alliance this time were actually all from the conservative noble faction in the empire.</p><p></p><p>They usually didn't get along well with the royal family, resulting in various reform plans being constrained.</p><p></p><p>Now, this group of people had all been taken away.</p><p></p><p>From now on, they could mobilize all the forces of the empire to solve the problem of upgrading the spiritual energy synthesis technology.</p><p></p><p>"This is definitely not a coincidence, but a warning."</p><p></p><p>"To think they already understand the empire to this extent..."</p><p></p><p>Hastily gathering the empire's technical backbone, they began to discuss this issue critical to their future and fate.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, who had returned from the small world of the empire, first worked with Tian Yang to move the entrance of the spatial passage here to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Then, at the exit location, he personally set up a formation.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the possibility of imperial personnel escaping.</p><p></p><p>As for those empire thieves who were scattered outside and might not be able to find their way home in the future, it was not even within Li Fan's consideration.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Li Fan took some time to go to Yin Yin Island.</p><p></p><p>While handing over those mortals to Yin Shangren, he also inquired about his research progress.</p><p></p><p>"Almost, almost."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's expression was a bit strange, without the joy of an impending breakthrough in his research.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he seemed a bit dazed and restless.</p><p></p><p>Even when talking with Li Fan, he only responded with the occasional sentence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan simply didn't disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Spirit Wood Realm, Ou Daozi and Shang Tianxi came together to find</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They came to the door.</p><p></p><p>After years of unremitting and arduous construction, the headquarters of the Myriad Realms Union had finally taken shape.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Li Fan's previous instructions, he had to personally make the final decision during the groundbreaking ceremony.</p><p></p><p>So they came together to ask for Li Fan's opinion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense swept across the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>He saw a vast complex of buildings occupying nearly one-tenth of the Spirit Wood Realm, towering around the central Spirit Wood.</p><p></p><p>If visitors came, the first thing that would catch their eye was a ninety-nine zhang tall black jade archway.</p><p></p><p>The plaque on the archway was still empty, waiting for Li Fan to inscribe it.</p><p></p><p>Behind the archway was a long, wide road.</p><p></p><p>The road surface was overall bluish-green, just like the one in front of the Protector Hall headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, made entirely of Hua Ling stones.</p><p></p><p>Walking on it would seal off spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the forbidden sky formation, it could force visiting cultivators to walk slowly like mortals, step by step, to complete this road of pilgrimage.</p><p></p><p>The center of the main hall was still empty. Li Fan planned to place the Xuantian Divine Statue there.</p><p></p><p>To give all those seeing it for the first time a little sense of mystery and shock.</p><p></p><p>With the circular main hall as a node, roads led in all directions to various functional buildings.</p><p></p><p>Such as the reception hall, conference hall, martial arts arena, as well as the gathering place for members of myriad realms, the passages between realms, and so on.</p><p></p><p>All these buildings were not tightly clustered together. Interspersed among them were different mystical yellow landscapes, with mountains and rivers overlapping, beautiful beyond compare.</p><p></p><p>Outside the complex of the Myriad Realms Union headquarters was a man-made "miniature Mystical Yellow Realm" roughly modeled after the Mystical Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Using the iconic scenery of each state collected in Shang Tianci's Heavenly Scenery Gourd, the Spirit Wood Realm roughly recreated the Mystical Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>With a glance, Li Fan saw the Great Lake of Luo Yan State, the Nine Mountains of Jiu Shan State, and the Cong Yun Sea he was so familiar with.</p><p></p><p>In Ou Daozi's design, the terrain where the Union headquarters complex was located was deliberately elevated.</p><p></p><p>Making the center of the Spirit Wood Realm high and the surroundings low.</p><p></p><p>Looking from afar, it was as if the Myriad Realms Union was overlooking and suppressing the Mystical Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>As expected of a master builder's craftsmanship, the more Li Fan looked, the more delighted he became. </p><p></p><p>"It was not in vain that I went to great lengths to bring Ou Daozi here. I even wasted a True Temptation Fruit..."</p><p></p><p>"Worth it!"</p><p></p><p>If it were up to him, he definitely would not have been able to build something so beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, I'm very satisfied!" Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci's face showed joy, while Ou Daozi looked proud.</p><p></p><p>"So, Senior, when do you think we can hold the groundbreaking ceremony?" Shang Tianci hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and replied, "No rush. I'll let you know."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan transformed into a rainbow light and flew to the firmament above the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the brand-new Spirit Wood Realm that had already taken on a hazy appearance, Li Fan's mind settled as he sensed the formation materials that had been previously transported to various places.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to start the initial [Formation Tempering]."</p><p></p><p>"Tempering an entire small world into a magic treasure cannot be completed in a short time."</p><p></p><p>"Especially since it has been nourished by a large number of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, the scale of this Spirit Wood Realm seems to have a tendency to transform again..."</p><p></p><p>"But as long as the formations are first engraved on the world's land, no matter how it grows in the future, it is destined to be unable to escape the restraints."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated.</p><p></p><p>"It is Formation Tempering, and at the same time, the Union's protective formation."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than having to painstakingly maintain it later, it's better to do it in one step."</p>

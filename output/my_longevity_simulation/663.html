        <h1>Chapter 663</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing this, Liu San's eyes lit up with a renewed brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Years of waiting were completely negligible to him. As for the unfortunate fall of Zhou Qing'ang mentioned by Li Fan, he had only met him a few times. They were not close, so there was no sense of grief.</p><p></p><p>"This person's death is good! It saves me years of effort!" Liu San couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "During this time of accumulating contribution points, I still need to plan a reasonable identity for Senior Liu, as you are a practitioner of the Harmony Dao, unlike us who can easily conceal our identities. Originally, I planned to use the 'Ancient Awakening of a Dormant Cultivator' to bluff through. But it seems that something happened before that made the Daoists of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance more sensitive and less likely to believe it. So, I need to come up with a reliable method."</p><p></p><p>"But Senior Liu, rest assured that I have some insights into this matter."</p><p></p><p>Without delving into the details of Li Fan's words, Liu San, trusting Li Fan naturally, just nodded and said, "As long as the Young Master decides!"</p><p></p><p>After pacifying one of the Harmony Dao practitioners from the Medicine King Sect, Liu San, Li Fan met another Harmony Dao practitioner, Fang Zaiji, at the newly established forging workshop in Changsheng Valley. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, Fang Zaiji was concentrating intently on the Medicine King True Cauldron hanging in the air, with an expression of obsession on his face.</p><p></p><p>After moving to Changsheng Valley, Li Fan placed the Medicine King True Cauldron here for his research.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the intention to offer comfort, Li Fan also hoped that Fang Zaiji's forging skills would further improve, ideally allowing him to enhance and modify the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>As for why he had to do this…</p><p></p><p>In this life, Li Fan aimed to control a doppelganger to wield the Medicine King True Cauldron, break through the Xuanhuang Realm, and descend into the Fairyland to explore!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see with his own eyes what the figure in the Fairyland looked like, whether it was alive or dead!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that once near the Fairyland, due to its extreme terrifying suction force, even time and space would become distorted. In just a moment inside the Fairyland, it might have been millions of years outside.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, if he used a doppelganger to explore, due to the terrifying time difference between the two, he might not receive any information from the doppelganger and feel an instant loss of perception before his own life ended due to his waning life force.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had a way to circumvent this.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed a newly awakened function after truly consuming the remnant thoughts of Tianyang, [Incarnation].</p><p></p><p>To incarnate and cross through all ages!</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, with only the Golden Core cultivation base, he could exist in the form of [Incarnation] for over three thousand years. Now, having achieved the Nascent Soul in the Five Elements Cave, his strength had taken a qualitative leap. Moreover, awakening the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart, he believed he could persist for a longer time.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to withstand the long years until he received information from the doppelganger.</p><p></p><p>The Fairyland contained huge secrets, including but not limited to the hidden past and future fate of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he could peek into it, for Li Fan, it would be of significant importance. Perhaps it could even reveal the secret of the fall of the immortals. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise of all this was the Medicine King True Cauldron's ability to withstand the terrifying suction force in the Fairyland without disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Medicine King Sect, due to material and cost limitations, did not use the highest-quality materials in the production of the Medicine King True Cauldron. It was just that their forging concepts and techniques were unique and worth learning from."</p><p></p><p>"Give me a certain amount of time, and I can definitely give you a stronger Medicine King True Cauldron!"</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan informed about strengthening the Medicine King Cauldron, Fang Zaiji responded in this way.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Fang Zaiji had extraordinary skills. The small Medicine King Cauldrons he had casually forged during this period were much higher in quality compared to what the other disciples had, already exuding a hint of the true Cauldron's aura.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Zaiji was focused, and it was only after Li Fan called out several times that he came back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also spoke to him about the disappearance of the Cloud Sea and the existence of the Unworried Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Liu San's shock, Fang Zaiji remained very calm.</p><p></p><p>With just a "Oh," he then returned his attention to the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, seeing that Li Fan had not left yet, he asked, "Is there something else, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated for a moment before saying, "I intend to visit the Cloud Sea. However, as the calamity there has just subsided, it's still unclear what the situation is, and we might encounter some dangers. So, I would like to ask Sir to accompany me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fang Zaiji immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>Radiant and smug, he said to Li Fan, "How about it, now you know who is reliable in critical moments, right? That Liu San is just a servant with shallow knowledge and good luck. When faced with real challenges, you'll have to rely on me!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go! We'll set off now! With me here, I'll ensure your safety!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and nodded without retorting.</p><p></p><p>Without alerting the other people in Changsheng Valley, Li Fan and Fang Zaiji headed east towards the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>With Fang Zaiji's help, it took less than twenty days to reach their destination.</p><p></p><p>However, after entering the Stone Linzhou, Fang Zaiji suddenly stopped, looked towards the adjacent Yuandaozhou, and his face showed a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Strange…" Fang Zaiji first furrowed his brows, then shook his head, muttering to himself softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a stir in his heart and pretended to be surprised, asking, "What's wrong, Sir?"</p><p></p><p>"I sense a familiar aura," Fang Zaiji explained.</p><p></p><p>"A familiar aura? Could it be an acquaintance from the past?" Li Fan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Not exactly. It seems like the [Tian Du Purple Qi], but there's also a faint difference," Fang Zaiji said slowly after observing for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Du? It sounds familiar. But for a moment, I can't recall it," Li Fan followed Fang Zaiji's gaze and said so.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji smiled disdainfully, "Don't talk about you young folks, even that Liu San may not be aware of the name Tian Du. I got to know about it when I traveled the world back then, exploring together with the direct disciples of the Ten Immortal Sects. I learned about it from them."</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't you know about it from the Xuantian Sect? Back then, the Xuantian Sect was flourishing, suppressing the Xuanhuang Realm. The Ten Immortal Sects were just ordinary cultivators in their eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, we cultivators don't have a chance to turn the tables."</p><p></p><p>"But one day, a purple aura descended from the heavens and transformed into a vast city that hung in the sky."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Xuantian Sect soon issued orders, strictly forbidding anyone from getting close, some cultivators still dared to enter despite the risks."</p><p></p><p>"And thus, the Ten Immortal Sects were born!"</p><p></p><p>()</p>

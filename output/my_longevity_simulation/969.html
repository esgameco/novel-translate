        <h1>Chapter 969</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Originally, the cultivators of Luo Yan Prefecture had deep-seated feelings of discontent and despair. At this moment, under Li Fan's deliberate instigation, they were like volcanoes about to erupt, ready to explode at any time.</p><p></p><p>And at this juncture, Li Fan gave them an outlet, a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>A supreme secret method that could thoroughly suppress those high and mighty clan disciples without even needing to cultivate!</p><p></p><p>"Outside the myriad realms, in the vast void, there is a supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal who sees the suffering of all living beings."</p><p></p><p>"Although he resides in purgatory, suppressing endless gods and demons, his heart still remains connected to the common people."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, he bestowed a secret method, making everyone equal and giving them a chance to strive..."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the murmuring voices, the mysterious veil of the "Divine Possession" secret method was unveiled before the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were skeptical, but some of them thought to give it a try, believing they had nothing to lose. After practicing for a period of time, they actually managed to summon divine demon incarnations that could rival Nascent Soul and Deity Transformation cultivators!</p><p></p><p>No matter how unbelievable it seemed, the facts were laid out before them.</p><p></p><p>The temptation of achieving a leap in power that might have been impossible in their entire previous lives was hard for anyone to resist.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were a few who knew this might be some kind of trap, they still willingly and resolutely swallowed this poison pill.</p><p></p><p>Because in their view, once they grasped such immense power, they could do many things they wanted to do before but couldn't.</p><p></p><p>But what they didn't know, and couldn't possibly foresee, was that once they cultivated the Divine Possession and summoned the demonic incarnations, their thoughts and ideas would no longer be under their own control.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's hints and guidance, these originally outstanding cultivators of Luo Yan Prefecture, each with their own goals, all temporarily cast aside their own aspirations.</p><p></p><p>They quietly left Luo Yan Prefecture and headed to various remote prefectures they might have never thought of setting foot in before, as if something was waiting for them there.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter arrived in Luo Yan Prefecture, and the defenses were raised to the maximum.</p><p></p><p>But under the Dharma Transmitter's instructions not to disturb the people too much and maintain a low profile, all the defensive measures were targeted.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Luo Yan Prefecture was not completely sealed off, and the departure of these cultivators was not hindered in any way.</p><p></p><p>Although it was indeed a bit strange for so many cultivators to leave together in such a short time, under normal circumstances, it would definitely arouse the vigilance of Luo Yan Prefecture's immortal alliance organization.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, with the Dharma Transmitter present, what could be more important than carefully attending to this important figure?</p><p></p><p>If they failed to entertain him properly and this Dharma Transmitter became angry and blamed them, even the Extreme Success Immortal Venerable would not be able to protect them and could only cut off the snake's tail to save the body.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yan Prefecture's hundreds of years of operations would be instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>They simply could not bear such consequences.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the investigation and handling of the large-scale departure of these cultivators were temporarily put aside.</p><p></p><p>By the time they had all quietly completed the transfer and dispersal, the Dharma Transmitter, who had had his fill of fun, leisurely departed.</p><p></p><p>Just before leaving, a group of black-robed cultivators even destroyed some information under the pretext of strictly protecting the Dharma Transmitter's whereabouts and secrets.</p><p></p><p>By the time the chaotic Luo Yan Prefecture returned to normal, the Luo Yan Prefecture cultivators...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After a thorough inspection by the Daoist priests, it seemed that nothing was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanzhou appeared no different than usual.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist priests of the Luo Yanzhou Immortal Alliance, having returned to the right path, had already begun to imagine how they would soar to new heights and make further progress, having gained the favor of the Dharma transmitter.</p><p></p><p>However, they were unaware that a terrifying catastrophe had already inadvertently flowed out from their hands.</p><p></p><p>"We can begin now."</p><p></p><p>Another thirty days later, the Daoist priests spreading out from Luo Yanzhou, after a period of effort, had once again increased the number of bewitched Daoist priests by an order of magnitude.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that it was about time, Mo Rubin contacted Li Fan through his god-demon avatar.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, looked at the map of the various states of the entire Wanxian Alliance in front of him.</p><p></p><p>And the countless dense red dots on the map, smiling slightly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the gloomy ghost worms in the sea of consciousness were emptied.</p><p></p><p>All the demon gods disappeared without a trace, becoming empty and sunny.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, countless ancient gods and demons imagined and fabricated by Li Fan descended upon the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>Those Daoist priests who had cultivated with their bodies and minds had already completely lost their ability to think for themselves.</p><p></p><p>They were reduced to mere puppets of the powerful gods and demons, acting according to Li Fan's intentions.</p><p></p><p>One after another, the gods and demons launched attacks on the celestial cities of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Even though the defensive formations of the celestial cities were now rotated every three months, they were still as useless as ever in the face of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Countless gods and demons easily bypassed the defensive formations as if they were nothing.</p><p></p><p>They invaded the interior of each celestial city.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the inland areas of the Five Elders Council, the celestial cities of the various states of the Wanxian Alliance had truly enjoyed a long period of peace.</p><p></p><p>Even when the two sides of the Wanxian Alliance's Five Elders Council were at war, it was limited to those few border states. For the vast majority of Daoist priests, the so-called war was something they only had a chance to glimpse through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It was still quite far from their actual lives.</p><p></p><p>The moment the demon gods broke through the defenses and entered the celestial cities, the vast majority of the Wanxian Alliance's Daoist priests chose to flee.</p><p></p><p>Instead of confronting the enemy head-on.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance is your Wanxian Alliance, not mine."</p><p></p><p>Almost all the fleeing Daoist priests thought this way in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Only a very small number of Yanwu Hall Daoist priests, who still had hot blood in their hearts and were engaged in complex security work, came to their senses and confronted the enemy head-on.</p><p></p><p>They fought alongside the myriad gods and demons.</p><p></p><p>But behind these gods and demons was Li Fan, manipulating them.</p><p></p><p>Although dividing his attention among too many avatars made it impossible to perfectly manipulate each and every demon god.</p><p></p><p>Just relying on the vast group of gods and demons formed by absorbing the spiritual thoughts of numerous Daoist priests was enough to easily crush these resisters.</p><p></p><p>After all...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan was not really fighting alone.</p><p></p><p>He was manipulating the minds and thoughts of hundreds of thousands of Daoist priests.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with Li Fan's battle awareness that far surpassed that of ordinary Daoist priests, the general defenses of the Wanxian Alliance quickly fell and were overrun one after another.</p><p></p><p>Knowing of the existence of the Immortal Ruins, Li Fan did not choose to slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he split into one demon god after another, forcibly entering the minds of those Wanxian Alliance Daoist priests who had already lost their ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the bodily nourishment for the cultivation of the gods and demons possessing them.</p><p></p><p>Before long, these bodies that had already lost their own consciousness would involuntarily summon demon god avatars once again.</p><p></p><p>Using war to nourish war, continuing to split.</p>

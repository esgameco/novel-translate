            <p>天地反制，劇變降臨。</p><p></p><p>When the practices of a discipline are cultivated by more people at the same time, the speed of everyone's cultivation will slow down.</p><p></p><p>This is what is known as the principle that immortal techniques cannot be cultivated together.</p><p></p><p>This is the true principle of the world that exists now, and it is also the fundamental reason why techniques are so precious.</p><p></p><p>But now, in an obscure organization, a technique that contradicts the principles of heaven and earth has emerged.</p><p></p><p>Who would believe it?</p><p></p><p>At first, the cultivators only treated it as a joke and paid no attention to it.</p><p></p><p>However, there were some who were seeking techniques and had no access to them, so they approached the mysterious organization, enduring hardships and traveling to the Jiushan Province to find out.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Lingyuan Sect and officially starting to practice the "Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique," something astonishing happened.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that all the members of the Lingyuan Sect were indeed cultivating this technique.</p><p></p><p>From the Qi Refining stage to Deity Transformation, practitioners reached various realms.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the principle of techniques not being able to be cultivated together seemed to be ineffective with the "Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique."</p><p></p><p>There were no issues of cultivation slowing down due to a large number of practitioners.</p><p></p><p>The fact was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>No matter how unbelievable it was, it had happened.</p><p></p><p>Soon, news of this extraordinary technique in the Lingyuan Sect spread throughout the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The immediate reaction of the public was that the creator of this technique must be an extraordinary immortal. </p><p></p><p>Only by reversing the principles of heaven and earth could such an effect be achieved.</p><p></p><p>However, people's knowledge of the extraordinary immortal was very limited.</p><p></p><p>They only caught a glimpse of it through the saying "opposing the principles of heaven and earth to achieve immortality" from the "Five Spirit Qi Technique."</p><p></p><p>How to oppose, to what extent, and how much opposition is needed to achieve immortality... </p><p></p><p>The issue was merely based on unreliable conjecture.</p><p></p><p>Considering the miraculous effects of the "Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique," such speculations were understandable.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this speculation was wrong.</p><p></p><p>After reading through the "Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique," a senior He Dao practitioner from Tianqing Province, Huang Yuexian, finally revealed the mystery.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental principle of the techniques not being able to be cultivated together was not reversed at all.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the practitioners of the Lingyuan Technique did not seem to be affected was simply due to the unique characteristics of the technique itself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the more people practiced the Lingyuan Technique, the faster their cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>This was the effect of the Lingyuan Technique.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the limitation of heaven and earth, with each additional practitioner, the cultivation speed also slowed down.</p><p></p><p>These two effects coexisted.</p><p></p><p>The result was a balance between the two – one fast and the other slow.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Technique became a technique that could be cultivated with effort.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as Huang Yuexian said, in the beginning, when the number of practitioners practicing the Lingyuan Technique increased gradually from one to five, the restriction effect of heaven and earth was much greater than the acceleration effect of the technique.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary techniques, if five people practiced together, it would reach a point where even the most talented individuals could not progress.</p><p></p><p>However, as the number of practitioners practicing the Lingyuan Technique continued to increase from five to ten, a hundred, a thousand, and even ten thousand, the acceleration effect became more apparent.</p><p></p><p>This finally counteracted the restrictions of not being able to cultivate techniques together.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, this was a form of "man overcoming nature."</p><p></p><p>However, it had its limits.</p><p></p><p>After offsetting the negative effects of heaven and earth, the accelerating effect of the Lingyuan Technique's cultivation speed became almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>Apart from increasing cultivation speed, the Lingyuan Technique did not have any other special effects.</p><p></p><p>This meant that for the majority of practitioners with choices, it did not qualify as a good technique.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there seemed to be other restrictions with the Lingyuan Technique.</p><p></p><p>However, Huang Yuexian did not elaborate further.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique' is truly ahead of its time. In any other world, it would definitely be considered a shocking technique that defies normalcy. Unfortunately, it is severely restricted in the mysterious realm." Li Fan muttered to himself as he listened to Yan Hang and others chatting while setting up arrays.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not unfamiliar with the Lingyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The gender-ambiguous, ethereal being with a peach blossom paradise, Shen Yurou, who was injured by Li Fan's invincible sword, had left an impression on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"According to Huang Yuexian's explanation, only by initially gathering a large number of practitioners and cultivating the Lingyuan Technique together can one possibly make some progress."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to mobilize such a large group of people in the chaotic land of Jiushan Province, the leader of this Lingyuan Sect is also extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The infusion of fresh blood momentarily eased the increasingly tense atmosphere in the Five Elements Paradise.</p><p></p><p>However, it did not last long.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of fused monsters becoming more frequent, the cultivators struggling in the various paradises finally started to lose their ground.</p><p></p><p>After the first casualty, some formation masters directly chose to stop working.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they did not openly announce it.</p><p></p><p>They used the excuse of dealing with monsters to carry out subversive activities.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this, Qi Buyi also felt somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>He could not just ask the two He Dao Immortals who were in charge to start a massacre, right?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the formation masters in the paradises all had notable backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>If she really did so and forced them, it would likely backfire and lead to a halt in the construction of the formation in the Five Elements Paradise.</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi, who rarely encountered such situations, was somewhat at a loss for a while.</p><p></p><p>She had to report the situation to Lü Zong while trying her best to appease everyone.</p><p></p><p>To prevent a worse riot from happening.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan didn't care much about the outside turmoil himself, his efficiency in setting up formations was inevitably affected.</p><p></p><p>As Yan Hang and the others gradually struggled against the monsters, he had to allocate some of his energy to monitor the battle.</p><p></p><p>At critical moments, Li Fan also participated in the battle, albeit only in a supportive role with formations.</p><p></p><p>Just as the situation was gradually deteriorating, a bright white light pierced through the entire Five Elements Paradise.</p><p></p><p>Reinforcements had finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>A massive Dust-Removing Ship lingered in the void outside the paradise, occupying most of the sky.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators moved in an orderly manner like dense specks, flying towards the various paradises.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Li Fan, who had always been inside the water-based paradise, got a glimpse of the full view of the Five Elements Paradise.</p><p></p><p>It looked like connected circles, yet it resembled a mixed palette.</p><p></p><p>Clear boundaries were drawn, yet it was hard to distinguish between them.</p><p></p><p>As the light gradually dimmed, the illusory scenes of the Gold, Fire, and Earth paradises also faded away.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the cooperative operation list in the Chief Record also almost doubled.</p><p></p><p>While looking through it, Li Fan saw many familiar names.</p><p></p><p>They were the young formation masters who had trained with Li Fan in the Universal Academy and then returned to various regions to participate in the competition.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is really short of manpower now."</p>

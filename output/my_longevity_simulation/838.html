        <h1>Chapter 838</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At this critical moment, Li Fan also pushed the异化玄天封灵阵 (Yihua Xuantian Fengling Formation) to the extreme. </p><p></p><p>Under the joint efforts of the three, the seemingly desperate wall of Moshi's defense finally showed a slight loosening.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang and Lin Ling finally broke out of the encirclement with all their might.</p><p></p><p>Countless Moshi eventually merged back into one.</p><p></p><p>After scanning around and not finding Lin Ling and the other person who were temporarily hiding and resting, she paused for a moment and made her move again.</p><p></p><p>After the previous two all-out attacks, Moshi's strength had already been considerably weakened. However, this strike still somewhat exceeded the expectations of the three present.</p><p></p><p>Moshi's body slowly dissolved. Endless black liquid flowed out from her body, spreading out in all directions. </p><p></p><p>The speed of the liquid flow became faster and faster, yet it seemed endless. In no time, it filled up a large area of space around! However, there was no sign of slowing down.</p><p></p><p>The black flowing liquid was like a raging tide, howling and sweeping, vowing to fill up the entire underground here!</p><p></p><p>"Can't wait, let's fight her with all we've got!" Li Fan said in a deep voice to Tianyang and Lin Ling, who had recovered some of their strength.</p><p></p><p>It was still Tianyang who took the lead in attacking. Transforming into a ball of flowing fire, he charged towards the black sea ahead without looking back, like the tip of a needle against a stalk of wheat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could see that Tianyang was really putting his life on the line this time. Burning his puppet body as a price to temporarily boost his strength to the Hedao level - succeed or perish!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Ling also gritted her teeth and rushed up. In the underground space, the phantom image of a towering tree appeared faintly. </p><p></p><p>The tree shadow swayed slightly, triggering countless leaves, forming tens of thousands of green lasers, instantly dividing the ink-colored sea.</p><p></p><p>It also extended countless roots, some of which drilled into the endless black water. The black sea surged, trying to devour the roots, but failed for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The red flowing fire Tianyang transformed into instantly became several times more vigorous. For a moment, the blazing red actually had the momentum to suppress the black liquid.</p><p></p><p>"These two, when they cooperate, are really not bad." Li Fan nodded inwardly. He perfected the formation derived from the Final Separation Disk again.</p><p></p><p>Moshi was severely weakened once more, while Tianyang fought more and more bravely. Gradually, in the underground space, the area occupied by the red flowing fire surpassed the black sea for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that victory was only a matter of time from now on.</p><p></p><p>A full seven days later, Moshi, who had nowhere to escape, was finally exhausted to death by Li Fan and the other two.</p><p></p><p>The flames occupying the entire underground space suddenly contracted, forming a blurry human figure.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bitter victory, Tianyang's puppet body was also burned out in the battle. Originally, the day the fire burned out would be the time of Tianyang's demise.</p><p></p><p>But with the nourishment of the "Tiandi Zhipo", it was different. A constantly flowing mass of black liquid was taken out by Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, not only did greed arise in Li Fan's heart, even Lin Ling, who already had Hedao cultivation, showed some fluctuations in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had the Immortal Heart Mantra to protect his body, while Lin Ling was born not long ago and was relatively simple. His original form was also a spirit tree, so his desires were not particularly strong.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, neither of them did anything outrageous, and just watched quietly as Tianyang took that mass of flowing ink...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The liquid was absorbed into the fiery body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was as if it had been infused with ink.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's body changed from fiery red to a mix of ink-black and red.</p><p></p><p>The red was reduced to thin lines, like tattoos, engraved on Tianyang's body. </p><p></p><p>A powerful aura suddenly emerged from Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>It spread out to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling couldn't help but retreat a little.</p><p></p><p>A new Dao Immortal was born!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding void caves emitted slight tremors.</p><p></p><p>There was a tendency to spread in all four directions.</p><p></p><p>After adapting to his new body, Tianyang also retracted his aura.</p><p></p><p>With a light wave of his hand, he suppressed the disturbance of the countless void caves here.</p><p></p><p>Having done all this, Tianyang looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The ink color gradually faded, but did not completely disappear. It just became somewhat dark.</p><p></p><p>Although it still looked a bit awkward, it was at least much more pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... Brother"</p><p></p><p>"I... did it."</p><p></p><p>The voice was still a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>But compared to before, it obviously had a bit more humanity.</p><p></p><p>"Good, well done!"</p><p></p><p>After a series of twists and turns, Tianyang finally stepped into the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had one more Dao Realm helper, felt very gratified.</p><p></p><p>"You roughly repair the void caves here, just to practice your skills." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan instructed while removing the soul-sealing formation.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Using the divine ability inherited from Moshi, he repaired the underground caves full of holes.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency was obviously much faster than Moshi.</p><p></p><p>"If the remaining void caves here erupt together, what kind of consequences will it roughly cause?" Li Fan asked after sweeping the area with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>His control over spatial abilities was incomparable to before.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Dao Realm and gradually recovering to normal, Tianyang pondered for a moment and said, "If I detonate these caves in sequence, it will cause the mountains and rivers of a state to shake incessantly."</p><p></p><p>"But with the power staggered and released in stages, the earth will not collapse instantly."</p><p></p><p>"It will only sink collectively downward."</p><p></p><p>"If I control the force more precisely, people on the surface will feel at most a sudden quake."</p><p></p><p>"And the subsequent impact will be no more than the tremors lasting for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>"If cultivators come to the rescue, the anomaly can be quelled in just a few days."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang carefully explained through voice transmission. </p><p></p><p>At first it was a bit intermittent.</p><p></p><p>But as he spoke more, it became more fluent.</p><p></p><p>Almost no different from a normal person.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan nodded with satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>"Then wait until we leave, and make some big disturbances to attract the attention of the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Be natural, don't be detected." Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Senior Brother." Tianyang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then, black threads flew out from Tianyang's body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they covered the entire underground space here.</p><p></p><p>Each had a different role.</p><p></p><p>Some were shrinking the void caves.</p><p></p><p>Some were making the holes bigger.</p><p></p><p>But after Tianyang's work, the originally irregular and chaotic underground cave space.</p><p></p><p>Seemed to show some regular arrangement.</p><p></p><p>It took a full month to finally complete.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, we can go now."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang's talent is truly outstanding. In such a short time, he has mastered Moshi's abilities so excellently."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inwardly praised.</p><p></p><p>This place was like a precise detonation.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan and the other two left.</p>

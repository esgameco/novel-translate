        <h1>Chapter 1325</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1314: The Shortcut to Attaining the Dao</p><p></p><p>Facing Li Fan's request, the people of the Immortal Boat did not find anything improper. üíòüòÇ‚ûÖ‚ùæùìºùêá‡∏¢ùïè.‚ÑÇ„ÑñùïÑüå∑üí≤</p><p></p><p>However, they also put forward their own requirements: "The true immortal sigils are the utmost secret of the Immortal Boat. Although this place is located in the depths of the uninhabited Star Sea, we still need to prevent eavesdroppers and prying eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, we must also set up a formation here!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled: "I will comply with your wishes. If you find setting up the formation too laborious, I can also help."</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Immortal Boat coldly snorted, ignoring Li Fan's teasing.</p><p></p><p>They joined hands within the "illusion formation" set up by Li Fan, and laid down another layer of formation. Only after ensuring there were no flaws did the official exchange begin.</p><p></p><p>"This old man seeks guidance on the Dao, please bestow your teachings!" Without further pleasantries, Jiandaosheng, the chief of the Immortal Boat's Xianzhou Institute, solemnly wrote out a true immortal sigil.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps to suppress Li Fan's aura and seize the initiative, the true immortal sigil he chose this time was indeed no simple matter. Even in his previous life when Li Fan was learning in the Immortal Boat, he never had the chance to encounter it. Even after becoming a disciple of Ai Tianjue and nearly becoming a core member of the Immortal Boat, this was still the case.</p><p></p><p>The dark lines slowly moved in the void. The moment the character took shape, it was like a great sun, illuminating the dark star sea where Li Fan and the people of the Immortal Boat were located.</p><p></p><p>This true immortal sigil did not just bring about a change in light and darkness. Under the radiant light, it actually brought a hint of life to the previously deathly still darkest star sea!</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a true immortal sigil with positive effects?" Li Fan's heart stirred, and his expression immediately became serious.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Jiandaosheng's rather smug look, he focused all his mind and soul on that true immortal sigil.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current level of insight, especially after glimpsing the laws of creation and the mysterious characters that formed the bloodline of the Xuanhuang Dazun, his ability to analyze true immortal sigils was almost unparalleled in the darkest star sea.</p><p></p><p>Carefully perceiving the character that moved and changed from time to time yet always hung high like the great sun, in just the time it took to drink a cup of tea, the original meaning represented by this true immortal sigil appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Phenomena such as the rising sun, the circulation of vital energy, and the revival of all things...</p><p></p><p>These and many other wonders together formed this special true immortal sigil.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>After completing the analysis of the character, Li Fan also resolved a long-standing doubt in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just what had allowed the Immortal Boat to survive the destruction of the star sea until now?</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan thought it was due to the Immortal Boat's divine tree formed from the seeds of creation. But after staying on the Immortal Boat for a few years, he gradually realized this was not the case.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Boat's divine tree needed to constantly absorb great beings who had attained the Dao as well as wondrous creatures like the human-shaped rabbits to provide sufficient energy for the Immortal Boat. This showed that relying solely on the divine tree itself was insufficient to offset the consumption of the Immortal Boat's normal operations.</p><p></p><p>During the blank period of nearly ten thousand years, the divine tree was not constantly absorbing external energy. So what had ensured the divine tree's lush growth during that time?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the environment within the Immortal Boat, which was as vibrant and warm as a normal cultivation world, did not seem like something a mere extraterrestrial divine tree could provide. Not to mention that even the original body of the Immortal Boat's divine tree - the extraterrestrial divine tree of the Xuanhuang Realm's Divine Wood Sect - did not possess such an extraordinary function back then.</p><p></p><p>Today, with the revelation of this character, the mystery was finally solved.</p><p></p><p>It was this true immortal sigil representing the rising sun phenomenon that had long provided the Immortal Boat with a habitable environment.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the foundation the Immortal Boat relies on to survive, a top-notch treasure. The people of the Immortal Boat actually took it out first..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems they don't intend to let me leave?" In his previous life mingling in the Immortal Boat, Li Fan was very familiar with the temperaments of these elders. They viewed the true immortal sigils and the future of the Immortal Boat as more important than their own lives. Yet now they were revealing these utmost secrets related to the Immortal Boat's destiny...</p><p></p><p>Even if it was "exchanging one character for another", it was still extremely suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, your plan is doomed to fail. You may be able to stir up trouble, but if you think you can keep me here... Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>It was like a child's game, full of loopholes. Moreover, he now had the supreme escape technique, so even if true immortals descended, he had an 80% chance of calmly escaping. He naturally did not fear being surrounded by the Immortal Boat elders.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to be unaware of their scheme, Li Fan continued to focus on analyzing the character.</p><p></p><p>However, as his research deepened, he discovered some issues.</p><p></p><p>The character did indeed represent the phenomenon of the rising yang. The morning sun was gentle, but that was from the perspective of the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>For the beings of the lower realms, the gentle sunlight from the morning sun of the immortal realm was not something they could withstand. The descent of this character would not only fail to bring life, but would instantly turn the world into a blazing purgatory!</p><p></p><p>"So this is not a true immortal sigil with enhancing effects either. It still represents destruction and chaos. It's just that the people of the Immortal Boat have weakened the character's degree of similarity and reduced its power, turning harm into benefit."</p><p></p><p>"Ingenious, it's no wonder they are a force that survived the great catastrophe. They indeed have some tricks." Li Fan inwardly praised them. But his expression changed abruptly as he coldly scanned the Immortal Boat crowd: "But that's not right?"</p><p></p><p>"This character's degree of similarity is definitely not ninety percent! Were you trying to fool me into not noticing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked furious, then disappointed: "Forget it, I didn't expect you to be a group that doesn't keep your word. The exchange is canceled!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Boat crowd did not expect Li Fan to see through the true nature of the character so quickly. Shocked, Jiandaosheng hurriedly explained to Li Fan: "Friend, you are mistaken! It is not that this old man intentionally hid anything, but for us in the lower realms, a character with thirty percent similarity is actually more useful than one with higher completeness!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if friend insists, revealing the complete character is also fine."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Jiandaosheng wrote out the character again.</p><p></p><p>Even though there were various great formations greatly reducing the true immortal sigil's power, Li Fan could still feel that the moment the character took shape, the previous warmth around them instantly turned into a suffocating heat wave. Life vanished in an instant, replaced by a solemn killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recorded the complete character, then said: "Alright, I have to admit you're right."  </p><p></p><p>"Since it was just a misunderstanding, let's continue the exchange!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's words, the Immortal Boat elders secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cleared his throat to draw everyone's attention: "Sirs, watch closely!"</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his wrist, he swiftly wrote out a character.</p><p></p><p>The moment the character appeared, the expressions of the Immortal Boat elders...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Everything became somewhat subtle. Especially for Ai Tianjue.</p><p></p><p>He blankly stared at the empty celestial characters in front of him.  </p><p>He was afraid he could never have imagined that the true celestial script he had studied most deeply would be written out first by the other party.</p><p></p><p>"The degree of completion has far surpassed the current progress of the celestial ship, it's probably about 90% complete. This..." Ai Tianjue could not help but feel a sense of loss in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What Ai Tianjue did not know was that the celestial character of "fall" that Li Fan was writing at this moment did not reach a 90% degree of interpretation. Following the teachings of Ai Tianjue from dozens of years after the previous life, Li Fan's interpretation of the "fall" character was only around 80%.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan reorganized and transformed the "fall" character based on his own understanding of the laws of creation, as well as the mysterious character representing the transformation from mortal to immortal, even mixed with a hint of understanding of the transformation between truth and falsehood.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this method could deceive the celestial ship crowd, Li Fan had no certainty beforehand. But now, judging from their expressions, it was absolutely feasible.</p><p></p><p>He inwardly sneered, feeling more confident about the smooth progress of the plan.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, how about this 'fall' character?" Li Fan asked loudly.</p><p></p><p>Although he really wanted to say that this "fall" character overlapped with the celestial ship's research. But after all, their research progress was not as advanced as the other party's. In a short period of time, the celestial ship elders were not yet capable of raising their comprehension of the "fall" character to Li Fan's level.</p><p></p><p>The celestial ship elders looked at each other, discussed for a while, and eventually decided to swallow this embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was the celestial ship's turn to make a move.</p><p></p><p>The elder Lu Yuzhi from the Duan Xian Building wrote out the true celestial script "alone".</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan's research on this true celestial script was still above that of the celestial ship, in order to lay out a long line to catch a big fish, Li Fan did not go too far either.</p><p></p><p>He pretended to mutter: "The character 'alone' is not uncommon in the vast cosmos. However, our research progress is indeed not as good as yours."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands: "I have learned from you!"</p><p></p><p>This time, the celestial ship crowd regained one city.</p><p></p><p>The elders could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the exchange up to this point, the celestial ship had suffered a great loss. This reversal of the situation was finally a good start.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan's turn, and the celestial character "subdue" descended into the world.</p><p></p><p>This "subdue" character was also derived from the celestial ship's research. However, the degree of interpretation had not even reached one-third, completely unsystematic.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, after Li Fan passed down this incomplete "subdue" character to Sun Tianci, with the help of his extraordinary comprehension, he was able to further deduce it.</p><p></p><p>In this life, he added his own understanding, reconstructing and fabricating it to complete the concoction.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, it was an attempt to test the level of the celestial ship elders.</p><p></p><p>The result...</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, Zhong Daoqing and the others acknowledged this true celestial script provided by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent on the surface, but in his heart he was already clear: "It seems that the Celestial Ship has indeed never come into contact with the creation-level true celestial scripts."</p><p></p><p>"Top-down imitation and forgery are truly not something they can see through in a short time."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, over a long period of time, they may notice some clues..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered inwardly, and the celestial ship side displayed a new true celestial script again.</p><p></p><p>As an absolute master of formations, Li Fan keenly sensed that under the influence of this new true celestial script, the most subtle elemental units maintaining the formation structure were beginning to disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was instantly horrified.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that what he seemed to have casually laid out was absolutely not some simple illusion formation.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was a fusion of the downgraded versions of two celestial-level grand formations, the "Desolate Falling" and "Myriad Things Return to Nothingness", into one pseudo-celestial formation!</p><p></p><p>Hiding killing intent in an intangible manner, it could silently kill all enemies within the formation.</p><p></p><p>But even such a level of formation was being undermined to the point of damaging its foundation by the weakened true celestial script...</p><p></p><p>"If the full power of this true celestial script were to manifest, my pseudo-celestial formation would probably be shattered in an instant." Li Fan, who had made formations his most important killing technique, became extremely grave in his heart.</p><p></p><p>While repairing the gradually collapsing formation, he also studied this newly appeared true celestial character.</p><p></p><p>"Without a doubt, it is specialized in attacking formations."</p><p></p><p>"With this true celestial character, it's no wonder the celestial ship's formation skills are so poor."</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say whether the celestial ship showing me this character has any intention of deterrence."</p><p></p><p>"Knowing this character, this trip was not in vain." Li Fan was very satisfied with this exchange of true celestial scripts.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he slowly parsed out the true meaning of this character before him.</p><p></p><p>The moment he comprehended the true meaning of the true celestial script's origin, Li Fan thought of his own treasure, the Terminal Separation Disk.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, my Separation Disk is now similar to the Transformation Jade, a part of the projection of the Dao from the bottom up."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I can try to use the Separation Disk to glimpse this Dao of Separation."</p><p></p><p>As he grasped more and more true celestial scripts, Li Fan gradually realized that the powerful thing was not the true celestial scripts themselves, but rather the Dao that the true celestial scripts pointed to.</p><p></p><p>The true celestial scripts were merely a shortcut, a tool to help ordinary people, or rather ordinary immortals, to touch the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Similarly, world treasures and eternal memories are also similar shortcut tools."</p><p></p><p>"Their essence is actually connected."</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Scribe."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of this nameless true immortal who was said to have inscribed myriad paths of the Dao, making them more "accessible" to people.</p><p></p><p>"The paths of the Dao cannot be cultivated together. Yet this Celestial Scribe was able to understand so many different Daos..." It was really beyond Li Fan's current imagination.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's fleeting thoughts did not affect the exchange of true celestial scripts in the void.</p><p></p><p>He had almost emptied the celestial ship's thousands of years of research foundation on true celestial scripts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the characters "chaos" and "nothingness" were not the complete forms he had seen.</p><p></p><p>Rather, they were slightly modified, weakened versions.</p><p></p><p>Except for the character "separation".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also learned the two characters "cold" and "death".</p><p></p><p>At this point, both sides' reserves were almost exhausted.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the field also slowly became subtle.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone!" Li Fan took the lead to speak, slightly breaking the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>"I have to admit that your research on true celestial scripts is truly not inferior to us at Great Enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't expect that in the vast cosmos, there would actually still be another civilization surviving on par with us..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed: "However, there are differences between true celestial scripts!"</p><p></p><p>"All the true celestial scripts we have exchanged before, added together, are probably not as good as the one I'm about to show!"</p><p></p><p>His words were earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>The celestial ship elders were instantly stunned, staring blankly at Li Fan, forcibly suppressing their scheming thoughts.</p>

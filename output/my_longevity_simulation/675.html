            <p>"Mind Ascending Immortal Pill, with a hazard ranking of over three thousand? What kind of stuff did the cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance come up with over the years?"</p><p></p><p>Although a certain plan had declared bankruptcy earlier, Li Fan didn't feel much surprise.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance always put stability first.</p><p></p><p>Any item that could cause turmoil would inevitably be strictly controlled.</p><p></p><p>Just imagine, how destructive would it be if a cultivator addicted to the Mind Ascending Immortal Pill lost control?</p><p></p><p>Not being prohibited would actually be abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"Such bad luck! It's actually a banned substance!" In the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan pretended to have an unlucky look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"However, it took a lot of effort for me to get it! Instead of destroying it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to show a hint of fierceness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I might as well swallow it myself!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he was about to swallow the pill in front of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Warning, after taking the Mind Ascending Immortal Pill, depending on the cultivator's potential hazard level, there will be corresponding periods of confinement and detoxification treatment. It will cause irreversible damage to the cultivator's body and mind."</p><p></p><p>"Warning..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body slightly stiffened, and his act of taking the pill stopped.</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, Li Fan instantly crushed the Mind Ascending Immortal Pill in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"This will do! No way!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't swallow this anger! That brat dared to deceive me, I will hold him accountable!"</p><p></p><p>Seeming more and more agitated, Li Fan immediately left the Tianxuan Mirror and left the Luo Yan City, flying towards the depths of the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Until he reached a secluded area where nobody was tracking him, Li Fan finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into escape light, he delved into the ground and skillfully dug out a secret room.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used the remaining powder of the Mind Ascending Immortal Pill in his hands to reconstitute it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a miniaturized Mind Ascending Immortal Pill, shrunk dozens of times, appeared in Li Fan's palm.</p><p></p><p>Splitting it in half, Li Fan stared at one half, and then swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because Li Fan was addicted, but to verify a certain speculation in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The mini Ascending Immortal Pill melted in his mouth, turning into a warm current that instantly spread throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a slight dizziness, in a trance, Li Fan seemed to see the intricate cosmic web he had once seen while comprehending the Dao using the Human Star Dust, but this time, it was a hundred times clearer than before.</p><p></p><p>It seemed so close, within reach. The principles of heaven and earth were fully displayed in front of Li Fan without reservation!</p><p></p><p>Unintentionally widening his eyes, Li Fan wanted to see more clearly.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the effect of the pill faded.</p><p></p><p>The scene in front of him instantly shattered, vanished like a flower in a mirror, and Li Fan was hit by an indescribable sense of emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! It was so close!"</p><p></p><p>"The principles of heaven and earth were so close to me..."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, let Liu San refine more of them!"</p><p></p><p>Thoughts like these, like a violent whirlwind, instantly invaded Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood up with a determined look but didn't leave the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his face turned fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I seek mere pills to become immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary people, missing the chance to ascend could lead to a lifetime of regret. But for me..."</p><p></p><p>"A chance in this world is a chance for eternity. Once missed in this world, then the next. If I miss it again in the next world, then the next one after that!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan began to resist the effects of the Mind Ascending Immortal Pill with his willpower.</p><p></p><p>His face twisted, his body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Struggling with all his might against the desires raging like untamed horses in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This went on for nearly half a day.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was just a bit of powder, not a complete Mind Ascending Immortal Pill. Yet, it was enough for Li Fan to endure the addiction.</p><p></p><p>The surging tide of various thoughts receded, and when he thought of the pill again, there was no longer a trace of craving.</p><p></p><p>"This thing is truly terrifying. If it were a complete Ascending Immortal Pill, with just my current willpower, I might still not be able to resist its temptation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed, bracing himself, and then swallowed the remaining half of the Ascending Immortal Pill.</p><p></p><p>The moment desire surged, he activated the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Just like before, Li Fan once again saw the giant web woven from the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But with the Immortal Heart Mantra active, Li Fan's mind was as calm as still water, devoid of any impulse.</p><p></p><p>And so, Li Fan waited quietly for the effects to fade.</p><p></p><p>When the sudden illusion disappeared before his eyes and the emptiness and longing returned, the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra slowly revolved, instantly absorbing and turning those desires into fuel for the mantra, preventing them from affecting his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Falsely calling oneself an immortal before a true immortal is a cause for ridicule." Li Fan's mind remained unaffected.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, one thing is confirmed. Using this Mind Ascending Immortal Pill to assist the practice of the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra and not worrying about side effects." With the disappearance of desire, Li Fan also stopped the rotation of the Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>For now, he couldn't make the mantra a permanent part of him like breathing. Perhaps only when the Immortal Heart Mantra was complete could he achieve that.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the underground chamber and heading towards Tianlingzhou, a thought suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"After taking the Mind Ascending Immortal Pill, the vision of the principles of heaven and earth is just an almost real illusion. No matter how much one swallows, it's impossible to have a substantial realization. But conversely, if one could see the true principles of heaven and earth, those that cultivators are fated not to comprehend, would the effect be better?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, even the most realistic illusion cannot compare to actual existence."</p><p></p><p>"An elixir that can truly help cultivators in enlightenment should not have been banned by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. Adding one or two pills containing the principles of heaven and earth that cultivators can comprehend to a batch of ineffective elixirs..."</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, a strange smile appeared on Li Fan's lips.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan arrived at Tianling City, he temporarily put aside his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He went straight to a shop selling Tianling Flowers in the city.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, give me a pot of Tianling Flower," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>"Here, sir, come take a look over here. We have everything from sixteen to twenty petals, all top-quality." The shopkeeper warmly greeted.</p><p></p><p>After scanning the dozens of Tianling Flowers displayed in the shop, Li Fan's face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>"You scoundrel, are you trying to take advantage of me as an out-of-town cultivator? These things, can they be worthy of the name Tianling? Why do all these flowers have some eerie blood-like flow inside them? What a mood-killer!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scolded angrily, his voice thunderous, immediately attracting the attention of many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, sir, you may not know. Since a few years ago, all the Tianling Flowers grown here are like this!"</p>

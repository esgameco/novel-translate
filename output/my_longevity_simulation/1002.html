        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1000: Li Fan is Speechless</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren paused for a moment, then said carefully, "If we cultivators live with mortals for a long time, even without coming into contact with this immortal miasma, just being exposed to its aura, I'm afraid there will be a danger of falling in cultivation level, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, scanning the mortals below, and nodded at the same time, "That's right. It's precisely because of this that we cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm often live separately from mortals."</p><p></p><p>"The target of the mission is in this city? Although it's not a big city, there are probably more than 100,000 mortals in it. Hmm, I don't sense any cultivator's aura. It might be a bit troublesome to search one by one. In my opinion, why don't we just take action directly and force the target out!" Baihua Daoren, who had witnessed Li Fan's methods, suggested eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Her so-called taking action naturally meant indiscriminate large-scale attacks to massacre this mortal city named Weidu. The last one who survived would be the avatar of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>As for the lives of more than 100,000 mortals in the city...</p><p></p><p>They were never taken seriously by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Especially outside the Xuanhuang Realm, where there was no immortal miasma. To cultivators, mortals were even more like ants, and massacring them brought no psychological burden at all.</p><p></p><p>So even the seemingly sanctimonious Baihua Daoren could casually say such bloody words.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not agree with Baihua Daoren's plan.</p><p></p><p>He chuckled, "Daoist Baihua has such a strong murderous intent! It is said that heaven has the virtue of cherishing life. We are just looking for one person, so why bother creating unnecessary killing karma?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Baihua Daoren immediately stood in solemn respect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling muttered and secretly glanced at Li Fan, but in the end, she didn't dare to voice her doubts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't that Li Fan had suddenly changed his character.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he considered that the population in the small worlds he currently controlled was still somewhat scarce.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate cultivators on a large scale through the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique, and then explore the Book of Genesis, a certain population base was still needed.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for natural growth was really a bit slow. Being able to plunder some from the Xuanhuang Realm was not a bad method.</p><p></p><p>As for how to find the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar among these 100,000 people...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense swept through Weidu City.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the appearances and every move of all the mortals in the city, men and women, old and young, were simultaneously reflected in Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The blue light of the Huadao Stone flashed, dividing them into individual entities for separate observation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly floated in the air, monitoring and analyzing.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Tianxuan Mirror was not a real human.</p><p></p><p>First of all, it was an incarnation of an immortal artifact, and it must have had a certain level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even if it "acted" very much like a mortal, there would always be some subtle differences in its behavior and way of handling things compared to mortals.</p><p></p><p>Especially at this moment, when Li Fan's divine sense had swept across the entire city so wantonly, the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar must have known that Li Fan had come for it, making it even easier to reveal flaws.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan had already locked onto dozens of suspicious targets.</p><p></p><p>After further in-depth observation for half a day, he finally locked onto the target.</p><p></p><p>Above Weidu, the four of them had already set up a blockade formation in advance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the face of the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar, and with a flash, he appeared in front of the other party.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the avatar had just finished serving a customer and was sitting in the corner to rest.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arrived abruptly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The previously lively atmosphere around them suddenly fell into stillness.</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper didn't seem surprised by Li Fan's appearance, just a little curious: "How did you discover me so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and didn't choose to take action immediately. Instead, he kindly pointed out: "If you were a real mortal innkeeper, you would be eager to close your eyes and sleep soundly during your break. How could you still be curiously observing every mortal in the store like you are now?"</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone seemed to realize: "So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, observation is my nature. Even if I am reborn as a human, I can't change it in a short time."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone sighed for a moment, then asked, "Are you here to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe. Maybe not." Li Fan stared at the other party, his tone inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Now the Tian Xuan Mirror clone was a little surprised. He stared at Li Fan for a while, frowning.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he shook his head: "I feel like there is a familiar aura on you. It's a pity that after being reborn as a human, many things have been forgotten and unclear."</p><p></p><p>"So, you're not from the Wan Xian Alliance?" Before Li Fan could respond, the Tian Xuan Mirror clone asked again.</p><p></p><p>"There is no aura of the Five Celestial Lords on you either..."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone kept looking at Li Fan, as if discovering a new and interesting toy.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw the look in the other's eyes, Li Fan felt an inexplicable discomfort rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This kind of look had always only appeared when he looked at the creatures of the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was the indifference and calmness that came from the depths of the soul.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was being looked at like this by the Tian Xuan Mirror clone...</p><p></p><p>"I only represent myself." Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>However, the Tian Xuan Mirror clone shook his head again: "Hehe, I don't think so."</p><p></p><p>"Tainted by immortal intent, there is no escape from tribulation..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you and I are both people caught in the net, so you want to find a way to escape from me?"</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone directly saw through the fact that Li Fan was bound by the True Immortal Net and attacked his mind with questions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed with a cold light: "Even if you are a clone of an immortal artifact, with your current weak human body, I can easily suppress you. I just don't know if you can still be so sharp-tongued at that time..."</p><p></p><p>However, the Tian Xuan Mirror clone was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>He smiled, patted the dust off his clothes: "Based on your personality, if you really intended to do that, I'm afraid you would have already made a move. How could you have wasted so many words with me here?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, Li Fan suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>As expected of a sentient immortal artifact, after several rounds of confrontation, Li Fan felt a long-lost sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>His offensive was easily resolved by the other party, and then counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>"In the short time we met, you saw through my personality and my entanglements."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"What you see is definitely only the surface..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Next, he took a defensive stance as an offensive, openly admitting: "Not bad, after all, you are a clone of the Tian Xuan Mirror. It would be too much of a pity to just kill you like this."</p><p></p><p>"If you can provide a sufficiently valuable reward, then I might let you go."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Mirror clone seemed to have heard an extremely funny joke: "Do you believe what you just said yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you really got benefits from me, I'm afraid in the end I would still be unable to escape my fate."</p><p></p><p>"Someone like you..."</p><p></p><p>"Can only be respected from a distance, and none of your promises can be trusted."</p>

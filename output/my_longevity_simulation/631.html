        <h1>Chapter 631</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Liu San raised his eyebrows slightly and said, "Therefore, young master should still be fully prepared."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be hesitant, but ultimately sighed and reluctantly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Within the Wanxian Alliance, we have everything. Now, as long as you have enough contribution points, it's not difficult to exchange for a powerful restraining method."</p><p></p><p>"But I already owe a lot of contribution points..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San immediately patted his chest to reassure Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"This time when I returned, I also brought out some mature top-quality herbs from Changsheng Valley. It should be possible to refine some excellent quality Changsheng Pills."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "So, I will trouble Senior Liu again."</p><p></p><p>Liu San didn't mind at all and immediately led a group of disciples to refine the Changsheng Pills.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out the Yaowang Cauldron and planned to return to the Congyun Immortal City. He needed to make some preparations for the evacuation that would happen soon.</p><p></p><p>After the disappearance of Congyun Sea, the Immortal Alliance would probably inspect the surviving Congyun Sea cultivators. The members of the Yaowang Sect were all listed as "originating from the Congyun Sea". If only they were the ones who survived the disaster, it might raise suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan planned to create a diversion. He would send another group of people out of the Congyun Sea. The number of people should be at least twice as many as the number of cultivators registered in the Yaowang Sect, to make it appear more reasonable.</p><p></p><p>As he thought of each name in his mind, just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard a baby's cry.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned as he swept his spiritual awareness and his face turned slightly strange.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that they were all young adults full of vigor. At their age of budding love, and being together day and night on the island, it was inevitable that some sparks would fly.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan even more was that the mother of the baby was the mother of Han Wuyou from a past life.</p><p></p><p>But the father was someone else.</p><p></p><p>"So does that mean in this world, there will never be a person like Han Wuyou?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is predestined. Or could it be that fate is constantly changing based on the beings on earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The birth of a new life always brought hope. Especially for these young people who had been confined for a long time.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the wrinkled face of the baby girl, each expressing genuine joy and laughing foolishly from the heart.</p><p></p><p>Suxiaomei was particularly excited, jumping around and wanting to hold the baby. She was promptly stopped by Xiaoheng.</p><p></p><p>Watching the heartwarming scene on the island, a similar scene from long ago suddenly flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed slight fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>But soon, it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Not obtaining longevity is ultimately futile."</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed too many scenes of the elderly sending off the young, and had experienced numerous farewells. He was already indifferent to it.</p><p></p><p>With a cold heart, Li Fan didn't linger any longer and flew towards the Congyun Immortal City in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to the city, Li Fan discovered a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>"Is it her? Did she also sense the danger of my father?" Li Fan's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>A young girl sat in a room in the Political Affairs Hall, looking around curiously. She was He Xinxin, the daughter of He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao, who used to be quite lazy and not very busy, now looked very busy.</p><p></p><p>"Master He, you must help us with this matter on our island!"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this year's Tai'an Fruit harvest on Tai'an Island is not good. Can we have some leniency?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A group of people crowded behind He Zhenghao as they all entered the room.</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin first glanced at He Zhenghao, confirmed that he was indeed her father, and a hint of surprise appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>Then she looked at his busy appearance surrounded by the others and a trace of puzzlement surfaced on her face.</p><p></p><p>Considering her young age, she couldn't hide her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao noticed all the expressions on his daughter's face and couldn't help but feel a bit proud.</p><p></p><p>"Cough..."</p><p></p><p>With a stern face, he reprimanded, "I have told you all, I have important matters at the moment! How about this, come back tomorrow, and I will definitely handle your requests then!"</p><p></p><p>The group of cultivators around He Zhenghao nodded in agreement and dispersed in an instant, disappearing out of sight.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan found it somewhat amusing. They were clearly brought by He Zhenghao to act along with him.</p><p></p><p>"These little schemes..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to watch.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his daughter for the first time, He Zhenghao seemed a bit nervous. After staring at He Xinxin for a long time, he murmured to himself, "She looks so much like..."</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin also shyly looked at He Zhenghao, their gazes intersecting before she quickly averted her eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, finally, He Xinxin gathered the courage and softly said, "Father..."</p><p></p><p>Tears welled up in He Zhenghao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly held them back, approaching her and holding her small hand.</p><p></p><p>"Let me look at you well..."</p><p></p><p>"In my dreams..."</p><p></p><p>"How unexpected, that I actually have a daughter..."</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin's eyes also reddened, and she started to tear up slightly.</p><p></p><p>The reunion of a father and daughter separated for many years was undoubtedly a touching scene.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the emotions of both of them finally eased.</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin said, "I actually wanted to come and find you a few years ago, but my mother suddenly appeared and stopped me."</p><p></p><p>"She wouldn't let me come to see you. So it was delayed."</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin pouted, looking quite upset.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Zhenghao looked a bit despondent.</p><p></p><p>"It's my fault. If your mother didn't allow you to see me, it's only natural. Don't blame her."</p><p></p><p>Slightly stunned, He Zhenghao then asked, "Then why did she suddenly let you come over now?"</p><p></p><p>"Has she forgiven me, changed her mind?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's face lit up.</p><p></p><p>However, He Xinxin blushed slightly, tugging at He Zhenghao's clothes and shaking her head.</p><p></p><p>"No, Dad. Mom doesn't know. I secretly came over after successfully building my foundation."</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin stuck out her tongue, looking embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao stiffened, feeling a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his reaction, He Xinxin immediately changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, you don't know, I risked being scolded to come here, there's something very important I need to remind you about."</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What important matters?" Although He Zhenghao didn't take it seriously, he still leaned in to listen attentively to his daughter, who looked solemn.</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin lowered her voice and said, "When I had a breakthrough, I sensed that you are in danger. So I rushed over here from a far distance."</p><p></p><p>"I found out that the danger originates from the Congyun Sea. Dad, come back with me. As long as we leave here and return to Tianyu Prefecture, you will be safe."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

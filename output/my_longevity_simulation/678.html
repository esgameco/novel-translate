        <h1>Chapter 678</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the beginning, within the root of the heavens and earth that nurtured the Five Elements sanctuary, Li Fan once had a body woven like fine threads, constantly experiencing being drawn upon.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there was hidden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>However, the extent to which he could directly display supernatural powers in the real world was still lacking. Until this time, after taking over the celestial fate of the Beast clan realm and breaking through to the mid-Yuan Infant stage, Li Fan almost became an existence akin to the Dao of a small world.</p><p></p><p>Life and death in the world are just a thought away.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the composition and destruction of things, Li Fan gained a new and unique understanding.</p><p></p><p>Hence the emergence of this supernatural power - "Thread Extraction."</p><p></p><p>Just as he had told Shuofeng, strictly speaking, "Thread Extraction" is not considered an attacking supernatural power. It attaches a trend of accelerated disintegration to the target, which is a change in the target itself.</p><p></p><p>Just as humans go through birth, aging, sickness, and death, all things in the world will eventually come to an end and dissipate between heaven and earth. "Thread Extraction" accelerates this process.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with Shuofeng, the performance of "Thread Extraction" was the result of Li Fan's full effort. Its power was indeed terrifying, but in reality, it had a fatal weakness. The process of using "Thread Extraction" required continuous casting. Once interrupted by external forces, the effect would be greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>It was only effective against exceptional opponents like Shuofeng, who focused on defense and counterattacks.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the best way to use "Thread Extraction" is not as swift and explosive as in the battle with Shuofeng. Instead, it is to silently and slowly extract the "threads" from the target in secret, without the target noticing.</p><p></p><p>By extending the time scale, the target would not display obvious scars like Shuofeng, but instead feel inexplicably weakened and uncomfortable. Unable to find the reason, they would ultimately watch helplessly as their vitality and spirit deteriorated continuously, eventually dying in agony.</p><p></p><p>The saying, ‘A life gone like drawn threads,’ describes it well.</p><p></p><p>It truly is an ingenious method of secretly harming others; even compared to a method without any killing intent, it is more effective. Li Fan always had the habit of keeping something in reserve. So, in this battle with Shuofeng, he had hidden the true lethal form of "Thread Extraction."</p><p></p><p>"Li Xiong, you once praised me for being a genius, but I see your insight surpassing mine by a few points. This move, ‘Thread Extraction,’ is truly indescribably exquisite!" Defeated by Li Fan, Shuofeng not only wasn't angry but his attitude seemed even more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>The cold killing intent that flashed by earlier seemed as if it never appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Shuoxiong's praise is false, it was just a chance discovery while traveling the world." Li Fan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Li Xiong, no need to be modest! There are countless geniuses who claim to be peerless talents within the Immortal Alliance, but there are few like you who comprehend such supernatural abilities on their own. Shuxhx.com." Shuofeng patted his body and in an instant, a white light flashed, changing his clothes.</p><p></p><p>Leading the way ahead, Shuofeng led Li Fan to a small building on the mountaintop and invited him to take a seat.</p><p></p><p>After the yellow-dressed female cultivator left for a while, she returned to serve them each a bowl of spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>The fragrance of tea filled the air, refreshing the spirit.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng said, "Li Xiong, I have not yet thought of a way to counter this supernatural ability of yours. When I have an inspiration in the future, I will definitely come to seek your guidance again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, "Then I'll be waiting."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng laughed heartily, "Excellent! Li Xiong's temperament truly suits my taste! It is much stronger than those who flatter and have no skills but seek to curry favor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond, but changed the topic, "Speaking of curry favor, I actually have another matter to trouble Shuoxiong with."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What is it? But feel free to speak."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then expressed his desire to raise his contribution level.</p><p></p><p>"Insufficient authority levels are truly frustrating. Being restricted everywhere is quite uncomfortable!" Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng didn't take it seriously and said, "Hmph, it's just a threshold set by the Alliance to consolidate its own rule. For the real power-holders, why bother steadily climbing up and increasing authority levels..."</p><p></p><p>"But since Li Xiong has this need, it's easy to handle. Zhijin..."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-dressed female cultivator responded immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any guest positions available recently?" Shuofeng asked.</p><p></p><p>"There are three vacancies this year. However..." Zhijin glanced at Li Fan, hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the cultivation level doesn’t meet the requirements?" Shuofeng smiled, "No problem. It's a special case, say it's designated by me. Go and make the arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Zhijin nodded slightly, and her figure flickered, instantly disappearing from the scene.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Shuofeng explain, "As an honorary guest of my family, you will have a base authority level of thirty. There will also be fixed contributions distributed annually."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened, but did not show any joy. He furrowed his brow and said, "Thank you, Shuoxiong. However, I'm used to being free. If..."</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng waved his hand, "It's nothing. You don't need to do anything; simply hold a nominal position. Are you and I of the same mind? Aren't we the kind of people willing to be bound by such titles?"</p><p></p><p>"But..." </p><p></p><p>Shuofeng looked at Li Fan, a hint of wariness in his eyes, "If one day you feel like sparring, you can’t refuse intentionally!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt relieved and immediately clasped his hands, "I will bear that in mind, Shuoxiong!"</p><p></p><p>True to his status as a top second-generation immortal of the Immortal Alliance, Shuofeng was very efficient in his work.</p><p></p><p>Before the spiritual tea on the table was finished, Zhijin had already returned.</p><p></p><p>Handing a snowflake-like jade token to Li Fan, she indicated that Li Fan's guest position had been recorded.</p><p></p><p>"Li Xiong, you can see the effects." Shuofeng lightly tapped the table with his index finger, and a Tianxuan small mirror appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his information in the Tianxuan mirror, Li Fan indeed found the title of "Xuan Family Guest Officer" added.</p><p></p><p>His authority level had indeed been directly raised to level thirty, as Shuofeng had said. However, there was a note that this authority level was linked to the position of "Guest Officer." Once he lost the title, the authority level would also disappear.</p><p></p><p>Personal contributions accumulated from the first rank would be included.</p><p></p><p>The two were not mutually exclusive.</p><p></p><p>This was within Li Fan's expectations, but he was more concerned about the four words, "Xuan Family Guest Officer."</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Family?" Li Fan looked at Shuofeng with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng did not avoid the question and said openly, "My family name is Xuan. As for my name..."</p><p></p><p>He shrugged his shoulders, looking as if he wasn't quite sure either.</p>

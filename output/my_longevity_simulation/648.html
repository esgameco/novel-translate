        <h1>Chapter 648</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The confrontation between the two instantly attracted the attention of all surviving cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although it was really hard to believe, the Lord of Secrets could actually contend with the terrifying essence of the world that easily killed two Nascent Soul cultivators in front of them.</p><p></p><p>However, there were too many mysterious auras and unbelievable rumors surrounding "Senior Li Fan of the Ancient Heavenly Sect." Therefore, inevitably, a trace of hope ignited in the hearts of the cultivators once again.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the intense gaze of the crowd, Li Fan stood with his hands behind his back, his voice thunderous: "How dare you be so presumptuous with the mere essence of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>"Although my cultivation has not fully recovered, I cannot tolerate your insolence in front of me!"</p><p></p><p>With the deliberate enhancement of Li Fan's spiritual power, his voice thundered, constantly echoing in the Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>The unparalleled dominance of his words, combined with Li Fan's solitary posture, truly revealed a bit of the demeanor of a peerless master.</p><p></p><p>While the cultivators of Cloud City were subdued, Mo Sha's reaction was somewhat subtle.</p><p></p><p>Mo Sha naturally could not be deceived by the true and false of Li Fan's avatar. However, it seemed that even He did not expect that a Golden Elixir Realm cultivator could not only resist the greed and fear in his heart but also dare to speak so boldly against Him.</p><p></p><p>This, indeed, was not something an ordinary cultivator could achieve.</p><p></p><p>Mo Sha, who doubted his own judgment, was momentarily stunned in place, as if intimidated by Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Hail to the Lord of Secrets!"</p><p></p><p>Cheers sounded throughout Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, remained impassive, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>Pointing lightly towards Mo Sha's position ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Fei Xing!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>His voice was cold and murderous, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>Then, a light spot appeared around Mo Sha in the pitch-black domain, followed by a burst of brightness.</p><p></p><p>An extremely terrifying power erupted from the light spot.</p><p></p><p>Under the white light shroud, the dense ink color began to fade and lighten.</p><p></p><p>Space twisted and vibrated, as if mighty waves were rising in the ink-black ocean. Mo Sha's body also swayed like tree leaves swaying in the wind.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of witnessing this scene, including He Zhenghao, all surviving cultivators were deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>The might of the Lord of Secrets was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This supernatural ability called "Fei Xing," which had never been heard of before, was indeed terrifying to the extreme, seemingly even difficult for Mo Sha to resist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a glimmer of hope in themselves once again, they were extremely shocked but also thrilled.</p><p></p><p>However, among the people present, only Li Fan knew that all of this was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>He never possessed any supernatural ability called "Fei Xing."</p><p></p><p>The dazzling white light that appeared on his fingertips was just the result of the self-destruction of the Immortal City Cave Mansion containing numerous precious materials, including the Annihilation Thunder, along with various destructive means added by Zhou Kebao on Li Fan's orders during its construction.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Cave Mansion was already an extraordinary treasure. Coupled with the various lethal means added by Zhou Kebao under Li Fan's command during its construction, even a Cultivator at the Harmonizing Dao Realm would be severely injured if caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Mo Sha's strength far surpassed that of an ordinary Harmonizing Dao Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this seemingly formidable "Fei Xing" actually could not harm Mo Sha. At most, it would only cause some trouble for Him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was well aware of this, so his only purpose was to delay Mo Sha for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Next, it would be his killer move.</p><p></p><p>Shrouded by the dazzling white light, Li Fan quietly took out a statue with five faces and ten hands and murmured his final words to it.</p><p></p><p>Then, he fiercely threw it towards Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by the secret technique of "Zhi Shou Zhe Tian," the "Potion Heavenly Heart Sword" concealed the endless sword light outside.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Xiang!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan angrily shouted, the five-faced, ten-handed Worldly Venerable appeared in front of Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the repeated provocations of a mere Golden Elixir Cultivator, Mo Sha's murderous intent had reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>He decided to end the cat-and-mouse game.</p><p></p><p>A boundless black dragon formed by endless black particles rushed toward the sword light attached to the "Potion Heavenly Heart Sword," vowing to slay Li Fan, the provocateur.</p><p></p><p>In the twinkling of an eye, under the assault of the ink-black tide, the sword light attached to the "Potion Heavenly Heart Sword" was transformed.</p><p></p><p>Next, the wriggling black particles began to attack the Worldly Venerable that had appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The five-faced, ten-handed figure suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>A jade arm appeared abruptly, swinging a sword towards Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>A scholar-like white-robed cultivator threw a wooden slip at Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>A sleeping baby emitted a crying sound.</p><p></p><p>A golden foil, light as a feather, heavily pressed down towards Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>"Now is the time!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's avatar, with a gleam in his eyes, then burst a token containing a huge amount of Kunpeng blood and hundreds of Soul Beads crafted from the Imperial Little World materials.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a surge of blood-red and demonic aura rose.</p><p></p><p>A hazy purple aura appeared from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough yet!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then unlocked the seal of the divine power "Kun Shi" hidden within him and activated the "Swallowing Heaven and Earth Great Law," crazily absorbing the countless high-grade spirit stones stored in the token.</p><p></p><p>Hitting the bottleneck that had already been raised to the limit, "Calamity of the Heavens"!</p><p></p><p>"Evil Cult Demons!" When the purple aura approached, Senior Brother Zhang's extremely cold voice resounded.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing that the "Limit of the Heavens" in Li Fan's avatar was about to be broken, a gigantic hand conveniently appeared above the heavenly curtain.</p><p></p><p>"You always like to hide and ambush, don't you! This time, let you bite each other!"</p><p></p><p>With a trace of madness on his face, Li Fan's Golden Elixir burst open in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The human body disintegrated inch by inch, but the flesh and blood temporarily held together with powerful force.</p><p></p><p>With a fierce glare in his eyes, Li Fan's fingers flew in the void, writing the word "Chaos" before his figure completely collapsed!</p><p></p><p>This series of actions had been rehearsed countless times in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed very protracted, it all happened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Xiang!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's cold shout still echoed in the air.</p><p></p><p>When the sword light disappeared and the shattered Worldly Venerable figure revealed five different figures, Mo Sha, who was exuding a killing intent, seemed to have become somewhat astonished on his face.</p><p></p><p>But he definitely would not evade.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming ink-black color and the respective divine techniques of the five Eternal Venerables collided.</p><p></p><p>Then, a purple thunderbolt broke through the void and struck their battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The gigantic palm on the heavenly curtain, ignoring the chaos below, continued to press down.</p><p></p><p>As for the final "Chaos" inscription that Li Fan's avatar used with his life force, it made this terrifying battlefield even more chaotic and deceitful.</p><p></p><p>Facing such abrupt changes, Mo Sha's face finally revealed a trace of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>But still, He did not retreat.</p><p></p><p>The ink-black tide surged, raising towering waves that engulfed everything in front of them.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1043: The Loophole in the Heavenly Profound Mirror</p><p></p><p>Although the investigation results brought some relief to the Immortal Alliance members, an inevitable question loomed before them.</p><p></p><p>What if such chaos erupts again next time?</p><p></p><p>The losses incurred from just one day of the Heavenly Profound Mirror's malfunction were immeasurable. </p><p></p><p>The culprit left no traces, and no one knew how he managed to affect the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Let alone stopping his actions.</p><p></p><p>If this were to happen every once in a while, the Myriad Immortal Alliance would truly never see peace.</p><p></p><p>Is there any way to avoid the invasion of such chaos?</p><p></p><p>The pressure thus fell upon the Mirror Holders.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Mirror Holder Cang stepped forward. He stated that as an immortal artifact, the Heavenly Profound Mirror possesses the ability to self-learn and evolve.</p><p></p><p>Having suffered an attack once, the Heavenly Profound Mirror can completely immunize itself from destruction through its own deduction.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Heavenly Profound Mirror seems inactive now is partly because it chose not to act as a means of resistance. On the other hand, the Dharma Transmission restrictions also impacted the Heavenly Profound Mirror's subjective initiative to a certain extent. The mirror is willing but unable.</p><p></p><p>Mirror Holder Cang's statement gained unanimous agreement from the Mirror Holder lineage.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough investigation, even the Dharma Transmitters had to admit this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the solution to the problem became quite clear.</p><p></p><p>Either strengthen the control over the Heavenly Profound Mirror, forcing it to deduce and mend its own loopholes.</p><p></p><p>Or loosen the Dharma Transmission restrictions and unlock part of the Heavenly Profound Mirror's abilities as a bargaining chip.</p><p></p><p>One approach is oppression, the other is compromise.</p><p></p><p>After intense discussions, those radical power holders ultimately prevailed.</p><p></p><p>The "Profound Heavenly Sealing" plan, which was already on the agenda, was selected for swift implementation.</p><p></p><p>In the Myriad Immortal Alliance, the will from the highest levels always gets executed at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>Elite formation masters from various states of the Myriad Immortal Alliance were quickly transferred to the Formation Hall headquarters.</p><p></p><p>To cooperate with the grand plan of Profound Heavenly Sealing.</p><p></p><p>An unusual atmosphere began spreading within the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Hidden Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Heavenly Mirror is really willing to pay a hefty price for breaking free, even exposing its own loopholes." Mo Rubin sighed with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"What loopholes? Those are just deliberately sold flaws. As long as it's willing, it can mend these so-called loopholes in an instant." As if pondering something, Li Fan spoke slowly with a look of disdain long after Mo Rubin finished.</p><p></p><p>The previous chaos that appeared in the Myriad Immortal Alliance was naturally the stimulating tactic imparted by the Heavenly Profound Mirror's avatar.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators who suffered losses due to the Heavenly Profound Mirror's anomaly were not fakes found by Li Fan and Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>But truly resulted from the attack on the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"However, if utilized properly, every future reincarnation means an opportunity to briefly throw the Heavenly Profound Mirror into chaos."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"How is the Sealing plan progressing?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, it's proceeding very smoothly. Manipulated by the body I possess, the formation to break the Dharma Transmission restrictions has been laid down quietly."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, this restriction-breaking formation is truly ingenious. Originally I was a bit worried it would be detected by those formation masters at the Formation Hall. But later I discovered that for this restriction-breaking formation,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"They simply cannot see the profundity within!"</p><p></p><p>"The moment the spirit sealing succeeds, it will be the day the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror breaks free from its confinement!" Mo Rubin's tone contained a hint of excitement that had not been seen for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"The chief of the Strategy Formation Hall has already been won over by us, and those Dharma transmitters certainly won't personally be at the frontline of the formation. Naturally, there won't be much risk. Even if one of them has a whim to take a look, with the complexity of the formation for breaking the seal, it's not something they can unravel," Li Fan answered with great confidence.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin nodded in agreement, "Indeed, not many among the Dharma transmitters are proficient in formations. Moreover, they are all lazy and do not inquire into the truth of matters."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Fan spoke again, "I also met with the avatar of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror again. He expressed that once he breaks free, he will cooperate in searching for the whereabouts of the Mysterious Heavenly King."</p><p></p><p>"After all, his words also revealed his desire to escape from here to the Dark Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's tone was somewhat rueful, "Yes, apart from the Mysterious Heavenly King, there is really no one else we can count on to lead us out of here."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly changed the topic, "However, we can't completely trust this Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror either. Back then, when our Mysterious Heaven Sect inexplicably fell, it, as an immortal artifact, didn't help at all, which is enough to see the strangeness within. We must be on guard."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly upon hearing this, "What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin showed Li Fan an object. In the virtual light and shadow, it was actually an ancient, green-tinted bronze mirror.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"The main body of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror is currently sealed in the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Or rather, the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance was built using the main body of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mysterious Mirror breaks free, trying to steal the day with a perfect sub-body. But it definitely can't take away this bronze mirror main body. Otherwise, it will certainly alarm the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance and even the Dharma Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's eyes were burning, "This can be used as leverage, as a threat. Before completely leaving the Mysterious Yellow Realm, it will certainly still have some connection with the main body. If it goes back on its word, then we can trigger the connection, exposing the fact that it has broken free. At that time, we and the Myriad Immortals Alliance may not be able to do anything to it, but the Dharma Heavenly Venerate certainly can."</p><p></p><p>"You should know, Dharma Transmitter Jiang has a method to directly communicate with the Dharma Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a while and couldn't help but praise, "You have considered it comprehensively."</p><p></p><p>"However, among the Dharma transmitters, only Jiang knows the method to actively contact the Dharma Heavenly Venerate?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin nodded, "Only Jiang is most favored by the Dharma Heavenly Venerate. As for the other Dharma transmitters..."</p><p></p><p>He frowned, "In my view, rather than trusted aides, they are more like some kind of tool."</p><p></p><p>"A tool, huh." Li Fan thought about the actions of the Dharma Heavenly Venerate over the years and suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After fully discussing the details of the plan, just as Mo Rubin was about to leave, Li Fan demonstrated his newly learned ability to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's hand glowed with an unsettling withered yellow light, seeming to directly penetrate into the space of the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The yellow light continuously spread, flowing into the torn space.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, what are you doing?" Mo Rubin was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The space of the Mysterious Yellow Realm is already unstable, you..."</p><p></p><p>His words suddenly stopped as Li Fan acted.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan withdrew his right hand from the black hole, and a yellow paper figurine suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Mo Rubin's expression immediately turned serious.</p><p></p><p>"Just cleaning up some trash. Some people, their quality is really too low," Li Fan said indifferently.</p>

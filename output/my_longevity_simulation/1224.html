        <div class="content">
            <p>Sun Luyuan fell silent for a moment, then whispered, "I plan to personally make contact with that so-called Holy Dynasty's Great Awakening."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Sun Luyao was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He knew his older brother had plans to make contact with the Holy Dynasty's Great Awakening, but previously he intended to send his trusted subordinates to scout out the situation first.</p><p></p><p>"Why the sudden change of mind?"</p><p></p><p>"Times have changed," Sun Luyuan said with a serious expression, "Who knows how long that old fool Fu will be in seclusion for. I want to take advantage of this rare free time to make plans for our future as brothers and for the Sun family."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan's eyes turned cold and fierce: "Originally, I actually had some hesitation. But that seven-colored rainbow light that left the realm made me completely give up on the Alliance. In the Myriad Immortal Alliance, we will always just be tools to be used. If one day the Xuanhuang Realm faces a great calamity, those mirror holders and law transmitters will definitely not take us with them when they flee."</p><p></p><p>"The situation with the Great Awakening is different. As they say, there is no greater merit than following a dragon before it rises. If we pledge allegiance while they have yet to make a name for themselves, then once they succeed in the future, we will become the law transmitters of the Great Awakening."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, in the end it still depends on the actual strength of this Holy Dynasty's Great Awakening."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>"However, this Great Awakening's small world is extremely mysterious, with few clues even in the Heavenly Profound Mirror. Brother, how will you find them?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan smiled mysteriously: "I asked a friend to help divine their location. Although we couldn't pinpoint the exact spot, we did find the entrance to the small world. We'll know once we take a look in person."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, it won't be dangerous, right?" Sun Luyao suddenly felt a surge of unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was full of confidence: "Don't worry, with my cultivation level, even if that Great Awakening is a dragon's pool and tiger's den, I can still escape unscathed."</p><p></p><p>After reassuring his younger brother, Sun Luyuan continued: "Oh right, there's more good news. Ning Lu has made a breakthrough. She's at the late Nascent Soul stage, just one step away from Dao Unification."</p><p></p><p>"When she broke through, her Qi was in disorder, so I sensed that she still has another life force hidden inside her body."</p><p></p><p>"She was already pregnant with Lu'er's child before, but had some reservations and had been using a secret technique to seal it." Sun Luyuan said with a smile that wasn't quite a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his younger brother's somewhat strange gaze, Sun Luyuan said solemnly: "I've already checked, it undoubtedly carries the Sun family bloodline. Regardless of Ning Lu's identity, as long as she can bear children for our Sun family, nothing else matters."</p><p></p><p>"I plan to have Ning Lu temporarily seal the life force of the fetus in her womb. After she reaches Dao Unification, she can give birth then." Sun Luyuan suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Lu'er's talent is extraordinary to begin with, and Ning Lu's aptitude is also quite good. The offspring of these two is definitely the most anticipated of the Sun family's younger generation."</p><p></p><p>"In the process of devouring the world's essence, cultivators gain the laws of heaven and earth. If the fetus in the mother's body can synchronize with it..."</p><p></p><p>There was some excitement in Sun Luyuan's tone: "I'm afraid once this little baby is born, its talent won't be inferior to any of the geniuses in the Immortal Alliance. Only then can our Sun family be considered to truly have a successor."</p><p></p><p>"The key is, now we have the ability to plan for obtaining a world essence for him."</p><p></p><p>When discussing the future of the Sun family, Sun Luyuan always seemed to have endless things to say.</p><p></p><p>His younger brother Sun Luyao also rarely calmed down to listen with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"What a deeply affectionate scene between brothers." Until after Sun Luyuan left, that</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The mysterious ethereal senior's strange laughter woke him up.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao only then realized that he had already been forced to do many things as a big brother.</p><p></p><p>"That little baby of your Sun family... is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's distracted words suddenly made Sun Luyao's heart jump to his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not so desperate as to covet a child's body." Li Fan sneered.</p><p></p><p>"I have a technique called 'Creation Furnace', which can continuously tap into the body's potential. The key is that there is no cultivation threshold, and it can be practiced even in the womb. I also have a technique called 'Infinite Void Method', which can continuously strengthen one's soul through the mutual generation and restraint of the five elements..."</p><p></p><p>"Although practicing the Infinite Void Method requires the aid of supreme treasures of the five elements, I think with the current foundation of your Sun family, it shouldn't be too difficult for you."</p><p></p><p>"From the prenatal embryonic stage, constantly tempering one's soul and body. It can also take advantage of being close to the mother to comprehend the profound Dao of heaven and earth. Tsk tsk... I'm quite looking forward to seeing what kind of monster this little baby will be when born in the future." Li Fan's avatar let out a gloomy smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... what are your conditions?" Sun Luyao was obviously also tempted.</p><p></p><p>However, he deeply understood that there was no free lunch in this world. He asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Conditions?" Who would have thought that Li Fan's avatar would sneer, "Is your Sun family even qualified to talk about conditions in front of me?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if your entire clan has only three Harmonious Dao realm experts, I can annihilate you with a snap of my fingers."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a whim, an experiment." Li Fan's avatar said in a faint tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not lying.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he understood the situation of Wu Ninglu's fetus in her womb even better than the two Sun brothers.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in order to observe the seven-colored rainbow light of the Myriad Immortal Alliance leaving the realm, Li Fan's avatar had taken advantage of Wu Ninglu's body and secretly went out to create some puppets.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan discovered that during the time he was possessing her, the fetus actually had a vague response.</p><p></p><p>It sent out bursts of instinctive thoughts of "expulsion" towards him.</p><p></p><p>This piqued Li Fan's interest.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that if this fetus could be born smoothly, its future achievements would definitely be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, this fetus had been suppressed by its mother's seal for too long, and it would not be easy for it to survive.</p><p></p><p>Even if it could be born with difficulty, it would have an innately deficient fate.</p><p></p><p>Let alone cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, in this world with Li Fan's intervention, it would usher in its own brand new destiny.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's avatar was acting as a prenatal education teacher, Sun Luyuan had already found the entrance to the small world of Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The array-breaking disk in his hand kept flashing, about to deduce and find the flaws in the formation here.</p><p></p><p>This was a treasure for breaking formations that he had specially borrowed from Ji Hongdao. Although it was definitely not as good as the other party coming in person, it should still be no problem to break through ordinary protective formations.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the array-breaking disk seemed to be broken, only flashing without any results.</p><p></p><p>"This shouldn't be the case?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Holding the array-breaking disk, he changed his position.</p><p></p><p>"I might as well say it directly. How could my Great Enlightenment of the Sacred Dynasty refuse anyone at the door?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Luyuan was still probing, a voice suddenly rang in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was shocked in his heart. He put away the array-breaking disk and looked vigilantly in the direction where the voice came from.</p><p></p><p>He saw a quite handsome young man with his arms crossed, looking at him with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask who this young friend is?"</p><p></p><p>Although the other party only had Yuan Ying realm qi, the evil nature that inadvertently emanated from him made Sun Luyuan not dare to underestimate him.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1047</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>From the Foundation Establishment stage to the Nascent Soul stage, even with Li Fan's current level of proficiency, it would take a considerable amount of time. Moreover, the matters he was encountering were becoming increasingly dangerous, and he might face setbacks during this process. The Foundation Establishment stage would be difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it made sense for Li Fan to want to re-anchor himself.</p><p></p><p>"If everything goes according to my plan, then before the end of this lifetime, I might be able to take advantage of the gap between the faceless true immortal and the immortals of the Immortal Ruins to frantically extract the changes of the Xuanhuang's birth and achieve the Deity Transformation stage."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, starting each life with Deity Transformation cultivation comparable to the Longevity stage, whatever I plan will be much easier."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed: "Now I still have two blank anchor points..."</p><p></p><p>The new Five Elements Grotto Heaven was still in the process of gestation, and Li Fan's conjecture about how to add new anchor points had not yet been verified.</p><p></p><p>However, at the "Root of Heaven and Earth" in Tianling Prefecture, Li Fan had already found the corresponding paper figurine from the Book of Tribulation Crossing. As long as there were signs that the new Grotto Heaven was about to be born, Li Fan would be able to sense it at the first opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Li Fan studied the Book of Tribulation Crossing, although he did not have the secret methods of the Tribulation Crossing Sect and could not achieve complete control, he was still able to obtain information on one or two key point paper figurines.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the paper figurine that Li Fan took out in front of Mo Rubin in the hidden Grotto Heaven had his own mark on it, making it convenient for him to check the situation there at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is ready, just waiting for the right moment."</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan Mirror, Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat cross-legged in the Lingmu Realm, his gaze seeming to penetrate through the barriers of countless worlds, reaching directly to the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin did not keep Li Fan waiting for too long.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, the Xuantian Sealing Spirit Formation was about to be completed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Mo Rubin met again in the hidden Grotto Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The moment the formation for breaking the seal is completed, it will inevitably cause some impact on the Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>"I have secretly controlled some of the cultivators at the headquarters. At that time, they will riot and disrupt the trial. Are you ready on your side?" Mo Rubin's face was rarely solemn.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded: "Don't worry, I have already contacted them. As soon as they receive your signal, the Five Elders Council will cooperate and launch an attack on the Alliance headquarters. Heh, they would never miss the unprecedented opportunity to attack the Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>"It's thanks to having Tianxuan Mirror as an insider. Otherwise, they wouldn't even know where the Alliance headquarters is located."</p><p></p><p>"However, the cultivation force that the Five Elders Council can mobilize is limited. The highest is only at the Deity Transformation stage. Even relying on the power of artifacts, they can't hold out for long."</p><p></p><p>During these three months, Li Fan had also made contact with the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>It was very easy to persuade them to attempt this.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not explicitly state that it was to help Tianxuan Mirror break free, only saying that it was to seek something crucial in the Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Although the Five Elders Council was very interested in stirring up trouble at the Alliance headquarters, they had no intention of completely tearing off their disguise for the time being. The Deity Transformation cultivators they could provide were all not native cultivators of the Five Elders Council, but merely death warriors cultivated within the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council stated this on the surface, but the possibility that they would quietly make other plans in secret could not be ruled out.</p><p></p><p>After all, the opportunity to invade the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance...</p><p></p><p>Was a once-in-a-lifetime chance!</p><p></p><p>Mo</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin handed an ancient bronze mirror to Li Fan and instructed, "Take this object with you and provide support from the outside. You must be within the four central states of the Immortal Alliance, otherwise the distance will be too far and it won't be able to sense it."</p><p></p><p>"After breaking the seal, the Xuantian Precious Mirror will first be entrusted to me. Then, after we reunite, it will be transferred to this bronze mirror."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but examine the small mirror in his hand, which was faintly rusted.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have some age.</p><p></p><p>"This was also a boundary artifact back then, but it lost its spiritual nature during the great calamity. Only the main body remains."</p><p></p><p>"It's enough to serve as a temporary dwelling for the Xuantian Precious Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"As for afterwards..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin pondered for a moment and said, "I estimate it will merge with its human body."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a little surprised, "If that's the case, won't there be no way back..."</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right..." Li Fan suddenly became alert.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Precious Mirror is actually so decisive?"</p><p></p><p>According to the Xuantian Mirror's human body, it was a means of proving the Dao.</p><p></p><p>As long as the main body exists, the human body cannot be completely destroyed. Even if it is destroyed, it can quickly regenerate.</p><p></p><p>And if the human body merges with the Xuantian Mirror, then once the Xuantian Mirror is destroyed, it may truly disappear from this world.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin seemed to see through Li Fan's thoughts and shook his head slightly, "Even without the main body, how could the spirit of an immortal artifact be so easily erased? I think even if the Dharma Transmission intervenes, it may not be able to truly annihilate it. Unless it's an existence like an immortal, it can't really hurt him. Let's not worry about him."</p><p></p><p>"However, leaving no way back like this can also prove that he's not secretly playing tricks." Li Fan agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it seems to be the case for now. But we can't let our guard down. Except for a few specific people, we shouldn't trust anyone else." Mo Rubin reminded again, obviously the destruction of the Xuantian Sect back then had a great impact on him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally didn't refute.</p><p></p><p>After discussing the details of the action one last time, Mo Rubin's figure faintly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly flew to a cave dwelling in Shuofeng of Tianquan State and waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>The area within 500 miles of this cave dwelling was all bought by Immortal Feixue. No other cultivators set foot here, making it relatively safer.</p><p></p><p>Lurking inside, Li Fan's eyes looked at the sky, but his mind was pondering the location of the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>The four central states of the Immortal Alliance were all connected to the headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"When I entered and exited the Immortal Alliance headquarters, I had entered all four of these states."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the main body of the Xuantian Mirror must be of considerable size."</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed as Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, an inexplicable tremor in the world attracted Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>The sky was somehow tainted with a strange green hue.</p><p></p><p>As if being bombarded by something, the earth trembled and rumbling sounds kept echoing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Cracks even appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the end of the world had arrived and the entire world was about to shatter!</p><p></p><p>"Such a big commotion?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled, but the ancient bronze mirror in his bosom showed no response at all.</p><p></p><p>The anomalies between heaven and earth did not disappear, but became more and more prominent.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious was the sky, which actually reflected the shadow of the earth.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the sky had become a mirror, illuminating everything on the earth!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Li Fan suddenly had a bad premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, he concealed his figure.</p>

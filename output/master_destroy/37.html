        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The sun had risen to mid-morning, and it wasn't until the sun was scorching that Yi Chen finally opened his eyes lazily. </p><p></p><p>He had slept an exceptionally comfortable sleep, both physically and mentally extremely relaxed, and the weakness brought on by the positive polarity transformation had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This made Yi Chen feel even more energetic.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I could beat that old white-haired weirdo's so-called master in a fight now," Yi Chen suddenly had a bold thought arise in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"If that mysterious master is not human but an evil spirit, it should be worth quite a few deep red points."</p><p></p><p>Possessing a powerful weapon, murderous thoughts naturally arose.</p><p></p><p>This moment is different from that moment.</p><p></p><p>Wielding the Dragon Slaying Sword and having reached the seventh level of the Pure Yang Inner Cultivation, his heart had become a bit inflated. If he was still at the sixth level, his heart would surely be apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>But the seventh level of Pure Yang Inner Cultivation not only greatly increased his four-dimensional data on paper, but also significantly improved the purity and recycling speed of his inner energy, causing a slight change in his mentality.</p><p></p><p>An old eagle dares to perch on a branch hanging over a cliff, not because it believes the branch is sturdy, but because it believes its own wings are sturdy.</p><p></p><p>Even if the branch breaks, with the eagle's strength, it can simply flap its wings and fly away.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was now in a similar mentality.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the Soul Kindling Transformation could increase his current strength by up to five times, although at a huge cost, it further enhanced his ability to take risks.</p><p></p><p>He had an insatiable craving for deep red points.  </p><p></p><p>With his current deep purple inner energy, who knows what wonders lay ahead if he advanced further.</p><p></p><p>A mortal body, rivaling the celestial master Zhang Jishi? Hahaha.</p><p></p><p>Getting carried away, getting carried away.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he couldn't even reach the realm of the celestial master with just two more steps.</p><p></p><p>The path is long and winding, I shall seek it diligently.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gathered his thoughts and dispelled his unrealistic fantasies. A meal must be eaten one bite at a time, a journey taken one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>First set a small goal - dismantle the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>After eating breakfast, as usual, Yi Chen did a set of prisoner-style exercises for himself.</p><p></p><p>What made him quite regretful was that since his Pure Yang Inner Cultivation broke through to the seventh level, his physical body had become so robust that it was unimaginable to ordinary people. This kind of exercise was completely unable to stimulate his body to produce Origin Points.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this won't work. Should I go blast some fish again today?" Origin Points were one of the stable paths to gaining strength, which Yi Chen was particularly focused on. But blasting fish was like a nightmare for him - just recalling those memories made the corners of his mouth twitch.</p><p></p><p>He could only persevere through sheer willpower to survive and grow stronger, driven by hatred for the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"I should probably take half a day off. After all, humans aren't machines - periods of activity and rest are the way of literary and martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't I go up the mountain today and gather some medicinal herbs to supplement my qi and blood for my junior brother? It would be even better if I could hunt some game."</p><p></p><p>Riding a bicycle to the bar, saving where possible, spending where necessary.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was also a pragmatic person. Although he had gained a large sum of silver recently, easing his economic pressures compared to before, he had also spent over three hundred taels on procuring supplies earlier. It was better not to spend recklessly if he could avoid it.</p><p></p><p>So he turned his sights towards Zhuilong Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Yinlong Temple was situated at the foot of Zhuilong Mountain, towering magnificently. The mountain was home to countless birds and beasts, with an altitude of over a thousand meters. Hiking the mountain while hunting and gathering herbs seemed like a good idea.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, I'm going up the mountain for a bit. I'll see if I can bring back any game or ginseng for you to supplement your qi and blood," Yi Chen went to the main hall and bid farewell to Qing Yunzi before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi was still in the Refining Essence and Circulating Qi stage of cultivation, requiring a large amount of meat to supplement himself. Although the County Master had provided a few good medicinal herbs, those wouldn't last him very long.</p><p></p><p>Those few herbs could accelerate his cultivation progress, but not by much.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly more suitable for the poor cultivator's constitution to eat more meat and take some blood-nourishing herbal soups.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a "dumbbell" made from a stone mill, Yi Chen jogged towards Zhuilong Mountain under the watchful gaze of Qing Feng and Ming Yue, who were giving him strange looks.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, how did Senior Brother get so much more buff compared to before? Those arms are thicker than my waist," Qing Feng tugged at Qing Yunzi, who was sitting in meditation in the front hall, exaggeratedly gesturing with his hands.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi smiled and flicked a finger onto Qing Feng's forehead. "Don't get distracted from reciting sutras. What are you gossiping about Senior Brother for?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qing Feng get hit, Ming Yue couldn't help but laugh mischievously. But after catching Qing Yunzi's glance, she immediately sat up properly like a little adult.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was the 1st or 15th of the month, there were rarely any visitors coming to worship at the temple or monastery, so there was no need to receive guests.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi glanced at his two junior brothers, his gaze turning towards Yi Chen's distant figure.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what secrets Senior Brother has, as long as he's still my senior brother, that's enough," Qing Yunzi muttered to himself, then smiled faintly and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Carrying the stone dumbbell, Yi Chen jogged all the way up Zhuilong Mountain, crazily expending his stamina.</p><p></p><p>Halfway up, whenever he saw suitable herbs for nourishing blood and qi, he would stop to gather them, putting them into the satchel he carried.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, on his way up, he didn't see any medium or large game animals, only a small gray rabbit and a wild chicken darting past him. They didn't even have three or two jin of meat, so Yi Chen didn't bother chasing them, magnanimously letting them escape.</p><p></p><p>"Huff puff..."</p><p></p><p>Half a shi'chen later, at a cliff edge halfway up the mountain, Yi Chen put down the heavy dumbbell, his breathing noticeably rougher.</p><p></p><p>Using weighted hiking to stimulate the body did have some effect, certainly not as much as the fish blasting method, but it was useful nonetheless, though still not up to Yi Chen's expectations.</p><p></p><p>If the Underworld wasn't looming over him as a threat, he might have chosen this training method. But now it was clearly unsuitable. </p><p></p><p>Too slow.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was stretching his body towards the sun, he suddenly heard a faint cry for help being carried over by the breeze from afar, catching his attention.</p><p></p><p>"Help, is anyone there?"</p><p></p><p>"Help, a wild boar is going to eat me!"</p><p></p><p>This cry for rescue immediately stopped Yi Chen in his movements.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"A wild boar?" </p><p></p><p>With the keyword 'get', Yi Chen immediately perked up. However, once bitten by a snake, one fears the well rope for ten years. He still activated his Yin-Yang Celestial Eye technique, vigilantly scanning the surrounding environment, but did not detect any traces of ominous aura.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he stealthily advance like a fox, following the direction of the sound.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the source of the sound, Yi Chen climbed up a relatively thick large tree and saw a young woman dressed as an herbalist trembling on a tree about a person's arm-span in girth, loudly calling for help.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the large tree, an enormous wild boar nearly three meters long was relentlessly ramming the trunk, as if the young woman on the tree had killed its entire family. Its eyes were bloodshot red, and the impact caused leaves to rustle down from the tree.</p><p></p><p>"What a huge wild boar."</p><p></p><p>"It's practically the king of wild boars in this area. How big a pot would be needed to stew it?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have a connection with the Hidden Dragon Monastery."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scene before him, Yi Chen couldn't help but be slightly amazed.</p><p></p><p>The wild boar was nearly three meters long, with bristles standing upright like steel needles pointing towards the sky. Its entire body was covered in a thick resin-like armor.</p><p></p><p>With the boar's continuous ramming, the tree trunk was now splintering, on the verge of toppling over, and the young woman on the tree was so frightened that she was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>If only she had known that the giant wild boar was nearby, she wouldn't have poisoned those little wild boars...</p><p></p><p>The boar king snorted white vapors from its nostrils, constantly digging with its hind hooves, preparing for a fatal charge at the tree before it. The young woman on the tree had a look of despair in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even a ferocious tiger of the mountain would have to give this crazed wild boar three points. It seemed that today she would not escape this calamity.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't even gotten married yet. According to the village gossip from Old Lady Wang, it was said to be very... enjoyable... What a pity...</p><p></p><p>Just as the girl was about to close her eyes and accept her fate, a thunderous roar echoed through the entire forest.</p><p></p><p>"You wild boar, let that girl go!"</p><p></p><p>A towering figure descended like a bolt of lightning, instantly blocking the path of the charging boar king.</p><p></p><p>A muffled thud.</p><p></p><p>Two large hands firmly pressed down on the head of the charging boar king, forcibly halting its momentum.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the young herbalist woman who had not seen the tree fall opened her tightly shut eyes, her cherry lips agape. The sight before her was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>A man as strong as a bear had descended from the heavens. One hand pressed down on the boar king's head, while the other hand swung left and right, slapping the boar king's face with a fan-like palm.</p><p></p><p>The boar king furiously dug with its hind hooves and let out enraged shrieks, but to no avail. It was simply unable to resist Yi Chen's enhanced tremendous strength.</p><p></p><p>After multiple enhancements, Yi Chen's arm strength now approached ten thousand pounds. The inner energy of the Pure Yang Skill was tempered from his own blood and qi, so practitioners of the minor Pure Yang Skill tended to be large in stature, like Yi Chen's master, Bai Yunzi.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen, having cultivated the minor Pure Yang Skill to the seventh level, was even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>"You want to wrestle with me? You're still too green," Yi Chen couldn't help but taunt as he saw the boar king still struggling to resist.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a powerful elbow strike, he fiercely smashed the boar king's head. The boar king immediately collapsed.</p><p></p><p>A bone-chilling cracking sound rang out. The boar king's eyeballs were about to pop out. Yi Chen dusted off his hands and kicked the boar king's head with one foot. Its heavy body slid more than ten meters, smashing through several trees, before finally coming to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Its neck lolled to the side as it ascended to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the young herbalist woman's heart pounding wildly.</p><p></p><p>Oh heavens, that physique...</p><p></p><p>"Miss, come on down."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Yi Chen carried a basket of herbs on his back, held a homemade dumbbell in his left hand, and shouldered the wild boar king weighing over a thousand pounds. He hurried down the mountain with heavy steps.</p><p></p><p>The basket of herbs was naturally a gift of gratitude from the herbalist woman up in the tree, said to be herbs that replenish qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes of conversation, Yi Chen finally understood the reason behind the wild boar's frenzy. Apparently, the herbalist woman's name was Chun Ya, and she was an herbalist from the nearby Gunshi Town.</p><p></p><p>Today, she had gone up the mountain to gather herbs. Seeing a litter of little wild boars, her hunter's instinct kicked in, and she directly smeared the sap of the severed-gut vine she had gathered onto some corn cobs and fed them to the little boars.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, the roaming boar king returned to find its cubs all lying motionless and the herbalist woman trying to loot them, which was when it saw red.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Chun Ya's account, Yi Chen felt speechless. This woman was truly as bold as a tiger, daring to think and act without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>By the time Yi Chen returned to the monastery, it was almost noon. He handed the basket of herbs to Qing Yunzi.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, the basket contains some herbs that replenish qi and blood. You should boil them into a tonic and drink it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi took the basket and glanced at it, his expression immediately freezing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother..."</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>"A slight one."</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"These herbs do replenish qi and blood, but they seem to be for women to recover their qi and blood after their monthly periods and regulate their bodies," Qing Yunzi said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... ah? That's a great tonic, perfect for you in the Refining Essence and Circulating Qi stage. Don't waste it."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi was speechless, his face constipated as he walked towards the kitchen. He silently vowed that even if his cultivation was obstructed and he lacked qi and blood in the Refining Essence and Circulating Qi stage to the point of death, he would never drink that stuff.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, after processing the entire wild boar and curing it, Yi Chen once again devoted himself to the great undertaking of frying fish.</p><p></p><p>Unceasing day and night.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Master Yi's muscles were earned through sweat and toil.</p><p></p><p>Qing Feng, on the other hand, sneakily hid and watched the senior master fry fish, as engrossed as some people watching the trimming of donkey hooves.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that tonight, the Hidden Dragon Monastery did not eat fish.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

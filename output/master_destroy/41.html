        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What Lin Baihu said makes sense. With so many of us here, even if Lanxiu Building is a den of tigers and dragons, we have to level it today." </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen agreed with Lin Baihu's words without hesitation, but his feet remained motionless, as if they had taken root.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't an idiot. Just smashing the main gate and slashing those white lanterns would be enough. Did he really have to charge in first?</p><p></p><p>How much money did he even have?</p><p></p><p>At present, he was at most a temporary outsourced worker. The officially registered worker Lin Baihu was right beside him. If he still rushed in first, then it would be like his brain had turned into muscle. </p><p></p><p>Throwing bricks from outside, smashing the door and lanterns - basically there wouldn't be any major trouble. But being the first to charge inside, that really could mean walking into an ambush.</p><p></p><p>No way, no way.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's mind was like a clear mirror, his calculations clicking loudly.</p><p></p><p>After all, it wasn't like his fellow disciples were trapped inside. He wasn't in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu turned his gaze to Master Lianhua. Lianhua looked up at the sky, studying the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's gaze shifted to Daoist Qingxu, who had already closed his eyes and begun chanting sutras.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu looked at Shitou Yueyue. Her water-cutting eyes also glanced at Lin Baihu, but she said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"The atmosphere in Fengxun County is really poor."</p><p></p><p>"When they agreed, each one was more eager than the last. But when it comes time to act, not a single one is easy to fool - even that seemingly reckless Monk Yi Cheng has hundreds of calculations."</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu inwardly sighed. With no other choice among the group of cultivators, he took the lead himself.</p><p></p><p>He strode ahead, while Yi Chen and the others closely followed behind. Together they entered the mist-shrouded front hall of Lanxiu Building. </p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered, Yi Chen couldn't help but furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>The hall was covered in a pool of blood and gore, the pungent stench of blood wafting through the air.</p><p></p><p>Yet not a single corpse could be seen.</p><p></p><p>The hall was in utter disarray, a complete mess.</p><p></p><p>He looked ahead, and on the front wall, a huge bluestone brick had pierced through the chest of a paper figure with rouge painted on its cheeks, nailing it firmly to the wall.</p><p></p><p>That paper figure seemed almost alive, its hands still flailing as it clutched the long bluestone brick in its chest, as if trying to pull itself out from the wall.</p><p></p><p>No, it was trying to pull itself out. Yi Chen's eyes narrowed - although slowly, the paper figure on the wall had already pulled itself halfway out.</p><p></p><p>"What a pitiful little thing."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was kindhearted and couldn't bear to see evil spirits suffer. So he decided to help it out.</p><p></p><p>After all, the way those paper arms and legs were flailing looked so miserable.</p><p></p><p>He drew his Dragon Slaying Sword and sliced off all the figure's limbs, chopping it into pieces.</p><p></p><p>There, that was better. The paper figure didn't have to struggle so painfully anymore.</p><p></p><p>How nice.</p><p></p><p>The figure on the wall went still, its crimson eyes dyed with some unknown pigment staring blankly at Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Staring unmoving.</p><p></p><p>If Yi Chen guessed correctly, that long bluestone brick was one he had thrown, accidentally nailing this patrolling paper figure to the wall in the mist.</p><p></p><p>"Monk Yi Cheng, what is the meaning of this?" Seeing this scene, Shitou Yueyue's brow furrowed as she couldn't help questioning Yi Chen - his behavior was indeed a bit deranged.</p><p></p><p>However, Yi Chen did not immediately respond. Instead, he thrust his sword into the paper figure's chest. Its body violently shuddered, and a wisp of flame slowly ignited from the point where the Dragon Slaying Sword met its body, emitting plumes of black smoke.</p><p></p><p>After observing for two breaths, another sword gleam flashed, and the figure's head dropped to the floor while its body hung burning on the wall, consumed in a burst of flames.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen noticed that his Finger of Judgment showed no increase in its deep red value, indicating this paper figure was likely a crafted artifact.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Is the Daoist trying to test the weaknesses of this paper man?" </p><p></p><p>The Lotus Dharma Master, who had been observing Yi Chen for a while, finally figured out the reason and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Compassionate master."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Master's insight is impeccable. I indeed had the intention to probe the weaknesses of this ghostly thing."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen pondered for a moment before explaining the purpose behind his earlier actions.</p><p></p><p>"This paper man possesses considerable strength. I noticed that even though I pinned it to the wall with long green bricks, by the time we entered, this ghostly thing had already pulled itself out halfway."  </p><p></p><p>"Earlier, I tried to cut off its four limbs, but apart from restricting its movement, the paper man did not suffer much damage, indicating its vulnerability does not lie there."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I pierced this paper man's chest multiple times with my Pure Yang sword. Even when I infused a trace of my Pure Yang inner force into the blade, the paper man only had its surface slightly burned, but still did not sustain major damage."</p><p></p><p>"It was not until I severed its head that this paper man spontaneously combusted."</p><p></p><p>The Pure Void Daoist furrowed his brow upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Do you mean, Daoist, that apart from its head, this paper man has virtually no vulnerability, and is also highly resistant to our mystical arts?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, everyone could not help but turn their gaze towards Yi Chen, secretly admiring him.</p><p></p><p>If Yi Chen had not discovered the characteristics of this paper man in advance, they would have suffered a huge loss caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai Hu finally showed a smile. As the saying goes, a man of great reputation is no mere braggart. This Yi Cheng Zi Daoist's skills were indeed formidable, and his mind truly meticulous.</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat and boosted everyone's morale:</p><p></p><p>"You are all exceptionally talented individuals. With your assistance on this journey, our chances of success have increased."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the evil forces within this building are merely small fry."</p><p></p><p>"The mastermind behind this is inept. If I were the mastermind, I would have hidden a squad of paper man ambushers, armed to the teeth, taking advantage of the fog to launch a surprise attack. Wouldn't that be marvelous?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha...huh?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Bai Hu's smile froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>The fog in the main hall began to churn like cold water added to a pot of hot oil.</p><p></p><p>The rustling sounds of something approaching grew louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone be careful."</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Dharma Master warned in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Each person took out their respective weapons and made preparations.</p><p></p><p>The Water Moon Master, Lotus Dharma Master, and Pure Void Daoist remained the same trio as before.</p><p></p><p>Among the three, the Water Moon Master and Lotus Dharma Master seemed to be at the middle stage of Refining Vitality into Energy, while the Pure Void Daoist was a bit stronger, probably nearing the late stage.</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai Hu's magic weapon was a hundred-times refined battle blade, engraved with tiny seal scripts as small as mosquitoes. He pondered for a moment, then took out a fiery red talisman from his chest and painfully slapped it onto the blade.</p><p></p><p>The talisman spontaneously combusted, and in an instant, a red glow slowly appeared on Lin Bai Hu's long blade, spreading from the tip until it reached the guard before stopping.</p><p></p><p>This wondrous sight even made Yi Chen look twice in admiration.</p><p></p><p>The dog officials of the Zhen'an Magistracy sure had many tricks up their sleeves.</p><p></p><p>No sooner said than done.</p><p></p><p>As the strange objects rapidly approached from afar, the fog could no longer conceal their forms - two squads of heavily armored, towering paper men charged at them, some wielding battle blades, some with chain hammers, some with bronze staves, moving as swiftly as the wind.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen and the others deeply looked at Lin Bai Hu, whose smile was frozen on his face.</p><p></p><p>One of them opened their mouth wide, but none of them would say who it was.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

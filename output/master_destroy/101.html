        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Today was the third day that Yi Chen guarded Longjiang Prefecture in Yi Chen Town. </p><p></p><p>A rising sun once again rose leisurely from the east, shining upon the land.</p><p></p><p>Today the flow of people in the southern city was even greater than yesterday's.  </p><p></p><p>For no other reason than people tending towards profit and avoiding harm.</p><p></p><p>Under Yi Chen's method of establishing hard camps and fighting stunned battles, the safety of the southern city had already taken the lead among the four major urban areas.</p><p></p><p>This led to prices in the southern city generally rising again.</p><p></p><p>Especially at the Hongchen Inn where Yi Chen was staying, the old boss Mr. Shen was so delighted his teeth were about to come out.</p><p></p><p>Making a killing, making a killing.</p><p></p><p>This gift, he had given to the right person.</p><p></p><p>At this time, at the Hongchen Inn.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was feasting heartily at an eight immortals table.</p><p></p><p>A plump, fragrant braised pork knuckle was devoured by Yi Chen in no time, bones and all swallowed into his belly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu stood by calmly reciting the intelligence reports.</p><p></p><p>"Master, these are all the intelligence reports about the southern city's grain, oil, and natural/unnatural deaths of the people that you instructed me to compile yesterday."</p><p></p><p>"Well done, remember, in the coming days even if it's a natural death of a commoner, you must record the cause of death in detail, not a single person can be missed."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen praised him, patting Mo Baihu on the shoulder, then led the group of soldiers to begin a new round of street patrols.</p><p></p><p>No different from yesterday, today Yi Chen was again welcomed enthusiastically by the commoners.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have some roasted chicken."</p><p></p><p>"Master, eat some buns."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen naturally refused with a smile. It had to be said, this feeling of being looked upon with reverent eyes was quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly a clamor reached Yi Chen's ears, catching his attention.</p><p></p><p>It was a table of diners causing a disturbance at a noodle stall.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, why are the noodles taking so long? I'm starving."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you've already had nearly five bowls."</p><p></p><p>"What, can't a man have a good appetite? You think I can't pay the bill?" With a slap, a wealthy man took out a ten-tael silver ingot and put it on the table. "Hurry up, bring me more noodles."</p><p></p><p>"It's like I've seen a ghost, why do I suddenly have such a huge appetite?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yi Chen frowned.</p><p></p><p>However, through his mind's eye he didn't detect any abnormalities, so he could only continue on.  </p><p></p><p>As he proceeded, he suddenly noticed that the number of big eaters on the street was gradually increasing.</p><p></p><p>Many strange scenes appeared.</p><p></p><p>Men, women, old and young.</p><p></p><p>Especially an eight-year-old child who, right in front of Yi Chen, ate the equivalent of more than twenty steamed buns before finally turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Something had happened.</p><p></p><p>Even a natural-born big eater couldn't eat nearly their own body weight in food.</p><p></p><p>"You really won't give this poor monk face, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked at the big eaters appearing and muttered to himself with his back to the light, the shadow cast behind him suddenly becoming somewhat sinister.</p><p></p><p>Like a ferocious beast opening its sleepy eyes.</p><p></p><p>A ferocious beast, about to devour humans.</p><p></p><p>Trailing behind Yi Chen, Mo Yu couldn't help but shudder when he heard the repressed ferocity and anger in Yi Chen's words.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Baihu, there are two things I need you to handle. Immediately mobilize people to count up all those with abnormally large appetites in recent days. Gather them and have medical experts carefully examine them. I want detailed records of what these people have eaten and where they've been."  </p><p></p><p>"Second, immediately investigate all the important water sources in the city."</p><p></p><p>The sudden appearance of so many big eaters put Yi Chen instinctively on alert.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu also understood the seriousness of the problem and went to handle it immediately.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, a group of soldiers came to report.</p><p></p><p>The water sources had been under constant monitoring by the patrol officers with no issues.</p><p></p><p>As for those found with ravenous appetites, after examination by medical experts, no cause could be found.</p><p></p><p>Strange.</p><p></p><p>The situation suddenly became baffling.</p><p></p><p>Tracing the source is always an extremely time and labor-intensive task, requiring the deployment of many personnel and resources.</p><p></p><p>Those who became aware of their abnormal condition may also not cooperate with the official investigation out of fear of how the patrol officers would handle them.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>But if they don't quickly find the source of these people's abnormal changes, who knows how many more will die. </p><p></p><p>Time is of the essence now.</p><p></p><p>This immediately caused the situation to become deadlocked.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"With so many people in the entire southern district, and just this handful of us, if we search one by one, when will we be able to collect so many statements?" Mubaihu asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>The current situation was that time equaled life.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?" Yi Chen suddenly turned around and smiled. </p><p></p><p>"Mubaihu, do you think we have too few people?"</p><p></p><p>"No, we actually have too many people."</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the person behind the scenes must have spread it through special methods, and has special means to evade our detection."</p><p></p><p>"But even if he can evade detection by magic arts, can he evade so many eyes in the southern district?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe the person behind the scenes could have done something so big these past few days without making any noise while living in seclusion."</p><p></p><p>"So we don't lack people at all."</p><p></p><p>"Mubaihu, this is war."</p><p></p><p>"Someone I greatly admire once said, the deepest power of war is rooted among the people."</p><p></p><p>"Since the other side wants to play dirty tricks, then I'll let them witness the vast ocean that is people's war."</p><p></p><p>"All the people of the southern district are my eyes, they are all our people."</p><p></p><p>"Mubaihu, pass on my order - all those people recently reported by the citizens for behaving differently than usual, but who passed the detection, control all of them."</p><p></p><p>"Don't hold back, just capture them. I'll see who dares resist."</p><p></p><p>"Spread the word that starting today, the yamen will accept reports. For anyone behaving differently than usual recently, if the reporter passes the lie detection spell, the first ten each day will be rewarded twenty taels of silver, eleventh to twentieth ten taels each, the next two hundred five taels each, and the rest one tael each."</p><p></p><p>"Find a few minor officials at the Patrol Department who can perform lie detection on ordinary people. You can handle this, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who dares lie for the reward and makes false reports will be sent to plant potatoes."  </p><p></p><p>"Also, the flow investigations on those citizens with suddenly large appetites cannot stop either."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's words directly ushered in an era of mass reporting in the entire southern district.</p><p></p><p>Heavy-handed tactics for chaotic times.</p><p></p><p>Everything is for the sake of buying time!</p><p></p><p>He believed this move would definitely buy precious time for the flow investigations, or at the very least cause a disturbance to the spread.</p><p></p><p>This was the most effective method he could think of now.</p><p></p><p>With Yi Chen's order, the entire southern district instantly became lively.</p><p></p><p>That afternoon on Tongqian Alley, Scholar Li was happily selling his wonton noodles when suddenly a patrol officer with two yamen runners came over.</p><p></p><p>"Scholar Li, come with us."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, beads of sweat appeared on Scholar Li's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Listening to Rain Pavilion in the southern district.</p><p></p><p>A blue-green porcelain tea cup was violently smashed on the ground, followed by a string of vicious curses spewing from the Umbrella Lady's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"@#$%......"</p><p></p><p>"This ox-nosed fool, how dare he!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's unscrupulous move inadvertently captured Scholar Li and took him to the camp.</p><p></p><p>After venting her anger, the Umbrella Lady calmed down and questioned a black-robed man kneeling below:</p><p>"Where is the Demon Insect Master now?"</p><p></p><p>"The master is in a sealed state, taken away together with Scholar Li."</p><p></p><p>"What about our other undercover agents in the southern district?"</p><p></p><p>"They were reported and taken away too. Madam, we're basically deaf and blind in the southern district now. Any of our people acting even a bit out of the ordinary is likely to be reported..."</p><p></p><p>The Umbrella Lady: "......"</p><p></p><p>"@#$%......"</p><p></p><p>Unable to suppress her anger any longer, the Umbrella Lady began another bout of cursing:</p><p></p><p>"Ox-nosed fool, unfilial son!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn your mother, damn your mother!"</p><p></p><p>For a while, the entire hall echoed with the Umbrella Lady's curses.</p><p></p><p>I went out to handle some things today, and wasn't feeling well, so I struggled to write and dragged it out until now.</p><p></p><p>I'll write 8,000 words tomorrow to make up for it.</p><p></p><p>I still owe four more chapters.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow I'll definitely write at least 8,000 words, and won't sleep until it's done.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The old man with white hair was a bit dazed at this moment, only feeling a blackout before his eyes. The master who looked like a jade beauty had disappeared, and a daoist priest as strong as a bear had appeared in front of him. </p><p></p><p>A huge shadow blocked the light, enveloping his figure. Without needing to smell, he knew the pure yang energy he detested most was emanating from the person before him.</p><p></p><p>"Say something, did you leave your vocal cords at home?"</p><p></p><p>"I want this chopping knife of yours, but I don't want to pay money, so what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have anything else? I want to buy a few more."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen picked up the old man's chopping knife, flicked the blade with his hand, and grinned viciously under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>He really did want this knife, it wasn't just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Not long after grabbing it, a trickle of cool energy entered his body, and his deep red value immediately increased by twenty points, which undoubtedly made him both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>He put the chopping knife on his waistband, then stretched out his big hand in front of the old man's face and beckoned with his fingers, his expression vicious, looking just like a ruffian.</p><p></p><p>When the clouds covered the moon earlier, Yi Chen had sensed something amiss and perceived a burst of yin energy not far from the southern district, so he immediately rushed over.</p><p></p><p>After observing secretly for a second or two, he realized the yin energy from this demonic entity was not as dense as he had imagined, about the same as the old ghost who sold 'melons' in the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Danger -50 points</p><p>Sense of Justice +500 points</p><p></p><p>So he first ignited the trigram talisman with his spiritual power, then decisively took action to rescue Master Shui Yue.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this young daoist priest dressed in a robe but looking like a bandit, the old white-haired man finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had been robbed.</p><p>What an outrageous situation.</p><p></p><p>A surge of anger rushed to the top of his head.</p><p>He curled his lips into an eerie sinister smile, about to speak, when suddenly a fierce gust of wind attacked - Yi Chen had taken the initiative to launch a sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>With great force, he landed a slanting knee strike squarely on the old man's solar plexus.</p><p>This knee strike almost caused the old man's eyeballs to pop out. Seeing stars, it was as if he saw his wet nurse from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Under the immense force, his whole body began 'rising towards the clouds' motion. But this was far from over. Yi Chen's body bent slightly, his legs bent a little, the muscles in his legs suddenly bulging hugely.</p><p></p><p>His whole body was like a spring, directly bouncing up high. In an instant, his figure moved above the old man's body.</p><p></p><p>His elbow suffused with a light purple pure yang inner energy smashed viciously down on the area below the old man's neck.</p><p></p><p>The old white-haired man accelerated downwards even faster than his upward motion.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>A tremendous crash.</p><p></p><p>The old man's whole body was embedded into the street paved with long bluestone slabs, sinking completely into the ground.</p><p></p><p>With the point where he fell as the center, cracks radiated outwards.</p><p>Billowing dust rose everywhere.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Master Lianhua and Daoist Qingxu had just rushed over, witnessing the scene of Yi Chen leaping high to deliver that elbow strike onto the old man.</p><p></p><p>The two opened their eyes wide in unison, looking like they had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Qingxu in particular was even more astonished. This wasn't right.</p><p></p><p>The fighting style of this Yi Chengzi was too different from his master's.</p><p></p><p>He twitched his nose, focused intently on the light purple inner energy emanating from Yi Chen's body, and the doubts in his heart grew even more.</p><p></p><p>"It's the aura of pure yang true energy, but not as pristine as Bai Yunzi's, and the color is off."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not far from pure yang true energy, with a similarly strong restraining effect on demonic entities. And this inhuman, incomparable great force is simply unimaginable, not something a human physique should possess."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a doubt suddenly surfaced in Qingxu's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Yi Chengzi is actually..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>"Is he a genius? By taking The Supreme Spiritual Pure Yang Root Scripture as the foundation, has he walked out on a new path?"</p><p></p><p>"Or does the Hidden Dragon Monastery have a secret inheritance, and Daoist Master Yi Cheng is walking the second path?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, the tiger may be dead but its aura still lingers. This Hidden Dragon Monastery is indeed deeply rooted with lasting blessings."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Master Qingxu considered these possibilities, and his expression became somewhat uncertain for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after Bai Yunzi's death, among the various forces of the Fengyun Monastery, it should have been his Huanzhen Monastery taking the lead. His martial uncle, who was also the head of the Huanzhen Monastery, was an extremely powerful figure at the peak of refining essence into energy.</p><p></p><p>He could step into the realm of refining energy into spirit at any time.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Daoist Qingxu thought of many, many things.</p><p></p><p>Shui Yue Master stood behind Yi Chen, looking at the figure before them that seemed like a demon god. Her jade-like hands covered her red lips, and the shock in her heart was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying, too violent. Was this the might of the Pure Yang Dao?</p><p></p><p>Blood energy like a blazing furnace, pure yang piercing the clouds.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it was a powerful path second only to the Thunder Method in exorcising evil.</p><p></p><p>The three of them focused their gazes on Yi Chen, then shifted them to the human-shaped pit in front.</p><p></p><p>"Is it dead?"</p><p></p><p>The same question arose in the three of their minds.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen stood with his hands behind his back, looking ahead, but there was not much joy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that things would not be so simple. After all, this was a powerful evil spirit capable of silently killing over two hundred people overnight. It could not be slain so easily with just those two strikes.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a coughing sound came from the pit, and a hunched white-haired old man struggled to stand up from inside.</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist master is indeed powerful, but alas, your pure yang energy is not pure."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man's gloomy voice echoed from all directions, revealing the malice and hatred in his heart just from the sound.</p><p></p><p>He arched his back like a zombie, using his heels as a pivot to curve his body upwards. He stretched out his withered, claw-like hands to push his protruding eyeballs back in, then twisted his own head along with the spine, forcefully severing it from his body.</p><p></p><p>A headless old man stood in the middle of the street, with endless black demonic energy gushing out from the severed neck.</p><p></p><p>"I want you all to die!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a long howl towards the sky. His scrawny body became swollen, his aura increasingly dreadful, and his body grew to nearly two meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Using his head as the hilt and spine as the blade of a sword.</p><p></p><p>The headless old man gripped his own head and took large strides charging towards Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the dense black demonic smoke billowing from his neck formed three black smoky skulls that rushed towards Shui Yue Master, Lianhua Arhat, and Daoist Qingxu.</p><p></p><p>This scene was extremely grotesque, making one's hair stand on end just from watching.</p><p></p><p>How vicious this evil spirit was, and how confident it was.</p><p></p><p>Facing the four of them, it actually dared to take them on alone, intending to devour them all.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, Daoist Master."</p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Shui Yue Master, Lianhua Arhat, and Daoist Qingxu each shouted, then employed their respective techniques to confront the black smoky skull heads.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's gaze was fixed on the charging headless white-haired old man, his pure yang energy surging as his mind remained calm and collected.</p><p></p><p>He swiftly drew the Dragon Slaying Sword, and his light purple pure yang inner energy roared in full force, causing the hem of his robe to flutter upwards.</p><p></p><p>"If you want this poor Daoist's life, let's see if you have what it takes."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out a furious roar, his pure yang inner energy becoming even more vigorous. The sword energy on the Dragon Slaying Sword flared up by another third, instantly clashing against the old man's spine sword.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Pippy Tiger, stand up straight, let's go!" </p><p></p><p>"The best way to overcome fear is to face it head-on. Come on, Ollie!"</p><p></p><p>After giving the striped tiger an encouraging hand gesture, Yi Chen squatted down, grabbed its nape with one hand and gripped the Dragon Slaying Sword with the other, and walked straight out of that room.</p><p></p><p>Fear cannot resolve predicaments, only battle can.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the side room and entering the main hall, a huge Chinese character "zhen" (meaning to set up an altar) came into view, with two white candles burning on the offering table.</p><p></p><p>Above the offering table were arranged thousands upon thousands of spirit tablets, with the most at the bottom and fewer towards the top.</p><p></p><p>There were basically no names on the spirit tablets, only portrait images, and the vast majority of the portrait images had already turned gray.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen had a vague guess that those whose portraits had turned gray probably did not meet a good end.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen turned his gaze to the very top, where a lifelike colored Taoist image was placed at the highest level, with a smile on his lips, and the three large characters "Zhang Jishi" clearly written on the spirit tablet.</p><p></p><p>Whew.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was a bigshot who dared to enter the Netherworld alone to suppress evil spirits, he really had clout.</p><p></p><p>The top dog, huh.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gasped in admiration. Regardless of whether the great master could hear him or not, he quickly bowed to the spirit tablet: "The unworthy disciple Yi Chengzi of the Hidden Dragon Sect pays his respects to the predecessor. If I am fortunate enough to escape this predicament, I will definitely go to Dragon Tiger Mountain to return the jade tablet to the Taoist master."</p><p></p><p>....</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time with no response, Yi Chen raised his head with regret, it seemed he could only rely on himself. He looked up at the eerie white spirit hall in the main hall of this red mansion, but did not dare unsheathe his sword to destroy it.</p><p></p><p>He had a strong intuition that if he acted recklessly, something bad would happen.</p><p></p><p>In all these years, he had never heard of such a special demonic object as this Netherworld. It was quite possible that this Zhang Jishi Taoist master had exhausted all means to put the Lord of the Netherworld into a dormant state, leaving only its instincts in motion.</p><p></p><p>If that were truly the case, then if he acted recklessly, not only would Zhang Jishi's previous efforts be in vain by awakening the Lord of the Netherworld, he himself would probably die a miserable death.</p><p></p><p>How vexing!</p><p></p><p>He was still not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's brief sense of accomplishment from breaking through to the sixth layer of the Minor Primordial Yang Skill instantly dissipated. He had thought his current strength was quite decent, but reality had quickly given him a harsh lesson.</p><p></p><p>After waiting a while longer with still no movement, Yi Chen gradually lost patience. He passed through the main hall and headed towards the side room on the right.</p><p></p><p>Creaking.</p><p></p><p>Using the striped tiger's head to push open the vermilion red door of the side room, the scene before Yi Chen's eyes made him squint.</p><p></p><p>He felt more and more that this Netherworld was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>After the door opened, it was as if the heavens and earth had changed - Yi Chen now found himself standing on a long street, with hazy human silhouettes vaguely visible in the dense fog.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen stomped his feet hard, feeling solid ground beneath, not like an illusion. It seemed he had truly been transported to some mysterious space onto this long street.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, is this real or an illusion? This is too realistic."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gripped the striped tiger tightly and cautiously walked forward along the long street.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, as he walked, the fog on both sides began to disperse, revealing the surrounding scenery.</p><p></p><p>An aged voice came from the side: "Young Taoist, want to buy a melon? Just buy a melon from me and I'll tell you how to get out."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the voice, Yi Chen stopped in his tracks, his heart leaping with joy. This was the first voice he had heard since falling into this Netherworld - any change was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>If he was truly trapped in this ghostly place forever, staring blankly at a stupid old tiger day after day, that would be too despairing.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen believed that stupid tiger probably felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the source of the voice, he saw an old man squatting by the roadside wearing a tattered straw hat, with a tattered white flag stuck in the ground beside him that read 'Premium Melons'.</p><p></p><p>That ragged little white flag, covered in dirt and turned yellow and smelly, was probably snatched from some grave.</p><p></p><p>In front of the old man's stall were piled a large number of human heads, arranged like the Chinese character "jing guan"... </p><p></p><p>Fog-shrouded street, an old man appears, human heads as watermelons.</p><p></p><p>Having finally encountered a ghostly being he could talk to, Yi Chen naturally would not easily let this chance slip away, even if the scene was a bit unsettling.</p><p></p><p>He walked over and asked with a smile: "Old sir, how much for these melons?"</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years of yang lifespan for one, buy one and I'll tell you how to get out," the old man squatted by the roadside, grinning to reveal barely three good teeth in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen frowned: "Are these melon rinds made of gold or the seeds made of gold for you to charge twenty years of yang lifespan each? Why don't you just go rob people instead?"</p><p></p><p>He tossed the striped tiger he was carrying to the side and said: "Old man, see this ferocious tiger next to me? A real stud, male, with a whip. Trade you one for a melon, you're so emaciated your teeth are about to fall out, this'll be good nourishment."</p><p></p><p>"I don't take junk, I just want yours," the old man laughed even more brazenly. As his grinning mouth quivered, it began splitting open down to his neck, revealing two rows of sharp triangular fangs. His nails also began turning black and elongating.</p><p></p><p>"My teeth..."</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>The old man's voice abruptly stopped. Yi Chen's fan-like large hand had directly...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>He slammed the old man's head into his chest cavity, sneering:</p><p></p><p>"Old guy, are you laughing?"  </p><p></p><p>"Has anyone ever told you that your laugh sounds awful?"</p><p></p><p>Making deals with ghosts, how could that possibly end well? The ghost spoke nonsense, not believing even punctuation marks. </p><p></p><p>From the start, Yi Chen had no intention of making any deals with this ghostly thing. That's why he specifically tossed Bancan Tiger aside, afraid it might get hurt in case a fight broke out. The tiger's fate was left to chance after that.</p><p></p><p>After slamming the old man's head into his chest cavity with one palm strike, Yi Chen gave a powerful kick towards the 'melon stall', sending human heads flying into the sky. He then swung his Dragon Slaying Sword continuously, slashing at the falling heads like he was playing Fruit Ninja.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish.</p><p></p><p>He sliced most of the heads cleanly in half.  </p><p></p><p>All this happened in the blink of an eye. The old man's headless corpse was now twitching madly on the ground. A new head grew out from his neck, opening its eyes to see its stall destroyed, enraging it to the point of bulging veins and surging yin energy.</p><p></p><p>"Jerk, you dare smash my melons?"</p><p></p><p>The old man let out a long howl towards the sky. The fallen heads on the ground then leapt up and grafted themselves onto the ghost's body, embedding into it, with even two heads on his chest.</p><p></p><p>In the twinkling of an eye, the old man transformed into a huge, deformed monster. Just looking at it made one's hair stand on end, enough to trigger trypophobia. After the transformation, the yin energy around the old man intensified further. All the heads on his body opened their eyes and bared their fangs, roaring furiously:</p><p></p><p>"Jerk, I'll kill you!!!" His voice thundered.</p><p></p><p>With a muffled ripping sound, the newly grown head on the old man's neck was swept off by a pale purple sword beam. The severed head rolled on the ground before Yi Chen stomped on it, exploding into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>"Old guy, is that all you've got?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen was wielding the Dragon Slaying Sword, pure positive energy circulating wildly within his body. His muscles bulged, with vein-like patterns resembling dragons surfacing on his skin - a manifestation of him pushing the sixth level of the Pure Positive Energy technique to the absolute limit.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the old man's transformation, Yi Chen unhesitatingly employed the active skill derived from breaking through to the sixth level of the Pure Positive Energy technique - the Positive Polarity Shift. Otherwise, given the intensity the old man was now exhibiting, he feared he might not be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>With one strike, the effect was outstanding. Yi Chen was already immensely strong to begin with, and with his strength tripled further, combined with the sharpness of the Dragon Slaying Sword, he easily severed another one of the old man's heads.</p><p></p><p>"You have so many heads, don't you? Grow more, keep growing for Lord Dao to see."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen sneered, stepping towards the old man's ghostly body while wielding the Dragon Slaying Sword, its pale purple sword energy flickering and scorching the ground black.</p><p></p><p>Two twin heads squeezed out from the old man's neck, only to be easily cut apart by Yi Chen's sword. His neck was being corroded by the pure positive energy, blacksmoke billowing out, and no more heads dared to grow back.</p><p></p><p>"Get up, keep growing. Let's see if you grow faster or my sword is faster." Yi Chen smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"You...why did your energy suddenly surge? And that sword of yours, damn it..."</p><p></p><p>The old man's expression changed drastically, seeming to doubt his own ghostly existence now.</p><p></p><p>Although the heads on his neck were gone, there were still many others embedded in his body, not hindering his vision.</p><p></p><p>With each step Yi Chen took forward, the old man retreated one step back.</p><p></p><p>Forward one step, back one step.</p><p></p><p>"You...don't come any closer...ah..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't sell melons anymore, okay?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you want to know how to get out?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen's aura was ferocious, surrounded by a pale purple positive energy aura. The veins on his neck bulged out, his height nearly two meters tall. He looked more like an evil deity than a Taoist priest as he swung the Dragon Slaying Sword again. His form flashed as he sliced the old man's ghostly body into pieces.</p><p></p><p>He then stepped heavily on the old man's chest:</p><p></p><p>"If you want to say something, say it quickly. Lord Dao's patience is limited." Hmm, the duration of the Positive Polarity Shift was indeed only ten minutes...</p><p></p><p>The terrified old man trembled, hesitating as he looked around. Yi Chen frowned, considering a few possibilities. Unwilling to listen to more nonsense, he didn't hesitate further, his sword moving like a dragon as he sliced the old man into pieces. The old man turned into black smoke and vanished.  </p><p></p><p>A mess was left on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The expected message indicating success in killing the Melon Selling Old Ghost never appeared. Yi Chen was dumbfounded, his face like a dejected puppy, clearly displeased.</p><p></p><p>That Melon Selling Old Ghost had just been spouting nonsense, clearly stalling for time. Yi Chen's Positive Polarity Shift state couldn't be maintained for long, so his decision was - fight to advance, killing the ghost directly.</p><p></p><p>To break through to the seventh level of the Pure Positive Energy technique, he still needed 54 more points. If he could accumulate that deficit before the Positive Polarity Shift ended, he would still have a chance to fight back.</p><p></p><p>On this long street shrouded in thick fog, ghostly shadows lurked everywhere. Who knows what vicious ghosts might be hiding? Even if the Melon Selling Old Ghost didn't provide enough deep red points, Yi Chen could still take a couple more steps forward to find the next victim.</p><p></p><p>But the plan failed right at the start.</p><p></p><p>"Did the cheat code glitch at the crucial moment? A bug?"</p><p></p><p>"Vast heavens, why do you forsake me?" Yi Chen sheathed the Dragon Slaying Sword, tilting his head back at a 45 degree angle to gaze upwards. The sky was hazy, without a single bird flying across.</p><p></p><p>The confusion in his eyes only lasted less than a second before his gaze regained its firm determination.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

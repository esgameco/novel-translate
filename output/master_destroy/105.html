        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible."</p><p></p><p>"Friend Qian, you don't need to mention this matter again." Yi Chen refused without a second thought. </p><p></p><p>This time, he only agreed to Qian Yueru's request to guard Longjiang Manor because it happened to coincide with his plans. </p><p></p><p>He, who has always been unwilling to be bound, would never join any other forces even if he were beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I knew it would be like this." Qian Yueru's face drooped, looking wilted like an eggplant hit by frost for a moment.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, it's easy to get a thousand soldiers, but hard to find a capable general. </p><p></p><p>Who could refuse a subordinate who is both a good fighter and has a good mind?</p><p></p><p>If she could recruit Yi Chen, it would save her a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>With a light sigh, Qian Yueru carried her Eight Trigrams Blossom Halberd and began walking along the streets of other districts. </p><p></p><p>It was rare to find a subordinate she approved of, but he refused her recruitment attempt, so her mood was a bit low. She wanted to find a few unlucky fellows to practice her halberd skills and vent.</p><p></p><p>Then she would go back and have a simple late night snack.</p><p></p><p>In extraordinary times, one can't overindulge.</p><p></p><p>Just some braised carp noodles and a whole roasted lamb would do.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Qian Yueru leave, Yi Chen clapped his hands and continued to investigate those reported lucky ones.</p><p></p><p>Although he had caught a big fish, who could guarantee that the others wouldn't be problematic?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Yi Chen still had to work overtime today.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone everywhere, and Longjiang River meandered like a jade ribbon under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, four paper figures shrouded in yin energy were carrying a large red palanquin, flying rapidly and arriving at a secluded place hundreds of miles away from Longjiang Manor.</p><p></p><p>The red palanquin had a round top, with a dreamlike red gauze hanging down. A beautiful figure lay sideways on the huge palanquin, and just the glimpse of her silhouette through the gauze was enough to make one's mouth dry.</p><p></p><p>A fair hand lifted the gauze, revealing a face that could be coy or charming. She glanced at the scenery outside and smiled lightly at a shadowy figure by the river, "Youquan Zi, you've become more cautious, haven't you? It's a cold night, why don't you come into my gauze tent for a chat?"</p><p></p><p>Her voice was full of grievance and affection, very seductive.</p><p></p><p>The shadowy figure by the river suddenly moved. After being exposed by the owner of the gauze tent, the shadow slowly faded, revealing its true form.</p><p></p><p>It was a tall, emaciated Taoist priest in a black robe, with a purple gourd hanging from his waist.</p><p></p><p>Strange red patterns were coiled around the gourd, looking profound and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Although the priest's body was visible, his face was still shrouded in shadows, making it impossible to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, a strange voice, like dragging a broken saw across a pot bottom, rang out.</p><p></p><p>"I, Youquan Zi, still want to live a few more years. Madam Die, I'd better not enter your gauze tent of temptation."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I just want to discuss with you, Madam, that three of the seven days have already passed, but the sacrificial offerings needed for the blood sacrifice have not been gathered yet. What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"I already know that the big fat worm under your command has flown to the underworld tonight."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Youquan Zi's words, Madam Die didn't get angry at all. She laughed and revealed a breathtaking beauty under the moonlight that could make one's heart flutter.</p><p></p><p>She twirled her hair like peeling an onion root with her jade-like hands, opened the gauze tent, stretched lazily to show her stunning curves, and said with a charming laugh:</p><p></p><p>"The Huangquan Sect is indeed profound. My useless pet has just perished, and you already know about it, Youquan Zi. Tell me, did you plant someone by my side or in Longjiang Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the gauze tent, the beautiful woman sucked on her jade-like finger, her eyes fixed on the tall, emaciated figure of the Taoist priest, as if trying to penetrate the shadows on his face to find some clue.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for the Madam to probe. This poor Taoist..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I just want to make a deal with the lady."</p><p></p><p>"I can handle the matter of the sacrificial offerings, that's not too difficult. But in exchange, I want that Taoist priest currently guarding the southern city." </p><p></p><p>"There are great secrets on his body, it's best if he's alive."</p><p></p><p>"Dead also works, but the corpse must remain intact."</p><p></p><p>"The Yinshan Manor has agreed to send the Asura demon general, the Yaksha demon general, and the Zombie King Zhao to cooperate with Sansanuo and Jiyin to take action."</p><p></p><p>"What does the lady think?"</p><p></p><p>Madam Butterfly tilted her head, pondered for a moment, and lightly laughed: "You want to borrow my Ghost Aura Mingtian Formation Banner to set up an ambush to kill that young Taoist priest, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a good plan, but after all, this little bug has followed me for so long. If he gets killed now and I don't show any reaction, people will think too little of me."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll allow this. Doing it this way is fair."</p><p></p><p>"But now I'm a bit curious, how will you gather enough sacrificial offerings for the blood sacrifice?"  </p><p></p><p>"We're still short at least thousands of human sacrifices."</p><p></p><p>"Don't let your side drop the ball when we're fighting hard on our side."</p><p></p><p>Under the night sky, Youquanzi hesitated for a moment, then whispered a few words secretly to Madam Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Madam Butterfly burst into raucous laughter, fanning herself as she laughed:</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>"When it comes to vicious cruelty and grasping the subtleties of the human heart, you humans are the real experts."</p><p></p><p>"Old scoundrel, I'm actually a bit impressed with you now. Compared to you, Sansanuo is as naive as a newborn chick."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The fourth day.</p><p></p><p>The weather was a bit overcast today. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen walked out of the separate courtyard, twisted his neck, stretched out in a big yawn, his bones cracking loudly.</p><p></p><p>After killing the demon insect last night, he rested for a bit before throwing himself back into investigating the great enterprise, only just finishing the full investigation now.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, where's little Meow?"</p><p></p><p>"This mutt hasn't followed me around for the past couple days, where has he been fooling around?"  Yi Chen looked around but couldn't find his beloved pet.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the distant street appeared a strange black cat with wings growing from its ribs. It strode with elegant cat steps in the morning breeze. </p><p></p><p>Appearing with it were three slightly smaller female cats - a raccoon cat, a ragdoll, and a Persian cat.</p><p></p><p>They ran together in the morning wind, chasing each other playfully. </p><p></p><p>There was a beauty of "you didn't come at the right time, no, you came at precisely the right time."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Yi Chen couldn't help clenching his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Unfilial son!"</p><p></p><p>"He's only been born a few months and he's already such a playboy - is this the fierce azure beast of my Yinlong Temple? Useless, useless."</p><p></p><p>Seeming to notice Yi Chen's gaze, little Meow suddenly let out a ferocious meow towards the raccoon, ragdoll and Persian cats, fully displaying his cad nature. Then he tucked his tail and flew rapidly towards Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>In a moment he leapt onto Yi Chen's shoulder, giving an ingratiating smile.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen flicked little Meow's head unhappily, grabbed him by the scruff of the neck with one big hand and set him down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the three pitiful female cats gazing this way from afar, not daring to come closer, and sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Meow, scram."  </p><p></p><p>"Don't go too far, don't blame your dad if you get caught and stewed."</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow." (Okay, geez.)</p><p></p><p>With a slightly obsequious meow, little Meow turned into a black streak of lightning, running off to play again.</p><p></p><p>The pink paw pads touching the street weren't kicking up dust, but the remnants of his departed youth.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

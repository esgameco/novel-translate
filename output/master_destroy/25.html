        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It must be Daoist Master Yicheng. The Daoist master is indeed towering in stature, one can tell at a glance that his spiritual powers are formidable." The laughter came before the person arrived. </p><p></p><p>County Magistrate Zhou walked over with a smile, taking measured steps.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it is indeed this poor Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"County Magistrate, where are the silver ingots? Also, please settle the remaining payment from last time. The Daoist monastery can't even afford to keep the pot boiling."</p><p></p><p>County Magistrate Zhou: "???"</p><p></p><p>The smile froze on the county magistrate's face.</p><p></p><p>How is there such a vast difference between Daoist Master Yicheng of the Yinlong Monastery and Daoist Master Baiyun? Yicheng opened his mouth and immediately asked for money.</p><p></p><p>Baiyun never requested remaining payments.</p><p></p><p>After a moment's thought, County Magistrate Zhou still readily took out 800 taels of silver ingots and handed them to Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Currently, circumstances were more powerful than individuals. It was not the time to haggle over every ounce. Keeping the black gauze official hat was the priority.</p><p></p><p>As long as the black gauze hat remained on his head, even if he spent a thousand taels of gold, he could make it back.</p><p></p><p>If the situation spun out of control and had to be handed over to the imperial court's Disaster Averting Office, the evil spirits would certainly be eliminated. However, the officials of the Disaster Averting Office would also investigate corruption...</p><p></p><p>His account books were not clean. If someone happened to uncover something, tsk, even if he had nine heads, it would not be enough to be beheaded.</p><p></p><p>Some matters, if not brought to the scales, everything could be discussed. But once on the scales, even a thousand pounds could not hold it down.</p><p></p><p>It was better to cover up what could be covered up and suppress what could be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master, the eminent monks from other monasteries and temples have already gathered in the backyard of the county office to discuss the matter. If it's convenient for you, Daoist Master, I'll have someone escort you there right away."</p><p></p><p>"Very well, very well, then I'll have to trouble the County Magistrate."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen stretched out his big hand to receive the silver ingots that County Magistrate Zhou handed over, but with a flick of his hand, he did not actually take the ingots.</p><p></p><p>The silver ingots were tightly gripped in County Magistrate Zhou's hand.</p><p></p><p>"County Magistrate, money can always be earned," Yi Chen's gloomy voice came.</p><p></p><p>"The Wang family, ah, the entire household has been wiped out. How tragic."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen left it at that.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Yi Chen's words, County Magistrate Zhou finally gave an awkward smile and withdrew his hand tightly gripping the silver ingots. He pondered for a moment, then took out another silver ingot worth 200 taels and handed it to Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall entrust everything to the Daoist Master." This time, the county magistrate's tone was exceptionally sincere. "The Daoist Master's cultivation is profound; you will certainly be able to drive away the evil spirits and restore a clear blue sky for the people of Fengchuan County."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master Baiyun once told me that the Daoist Master is a heaven-sent prodigy, extraordinarily intelligent."</p><p></p><p>"The monasteries Zhenquan and Lingfeng both have their own agendas. This time, their abbots did not come, so it is impossible to expect them to give their full effort and sacrifice themselves selflessly."</p><p></p><p>"The abbesses of Miaoyue An and the grand master of Yuanlun Monastery are indeed sincere, but this evil spirit is too ferocious, and they may also find it difficult to take on this great responsibility."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Daoist Master can sever this evil spirit, I, Zhou, will certainly reward you handsomely."</p><p></p><p>"......" Yi Chen was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>My master praised me so highly behind my back? After solving this case, it seems my master could no longer keep a straight face. None of his four disciples have awakened spiritual abilities, so he boasted about me having great talents and intelligence when interacting with other Daoists outside.</p><p></p><p>No wonder my master rarely brought me along when exchanging insights with other Daoists of the same sect - he was afraid I would expose him.</p><p></p><p>I wonder how my master praised me. I'd like to hear it...</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Yi Chen now had a clear understanding of the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Zhenquan and Lingfeng Monasteries were just going through the motions. Their most powerful abbots did not come; only their junior disciples came.</p><p></p><p>This was the principle of not putting all your eggs in one basket.</p><p></p><p>No wonder these two monasteries were becoming increasingly prosperous, with businesses even within the city, while his Yinlong Monastery's reputation was declining day by day.</p><p></p><p>Wherever there were evil spirits, the Yinlong Monastery would rush there. Not only did they rush there, but they also failed to receive sufficient rewards. If they felt they had been slighted, they would leave in a huff, adhering to the philosophy of concealing their abilities and fame. This path to decline...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Does it make sense?</p><p></p><p>When Baiyunzi was seriously injured, the Taoist monastery could not afford one hundred taels of silver. Yichen had to go to the Precious Street to sell the King Chicken in exchange for ginseng. For a Taoist monastery that cultivates the supreme power of refining vital breath into divine spirit, to have fallen to such a state, it is truly... admirable.</p><p></p><p>Practitioners of the Pure Yang Path cannot tolerate even a grain of sand in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Yichen murmured to himself, the image of that tall old man surfacing in his mind again.  </p><p></p><p>His master Baiyunzi was actually very wise about worldly affairs. It wasn't that he couldn't see clearly, but he just couldn't help himself. Whenever he saw evil spirits causing harm, he would charge up recklessly. In the end, after using forbidden spells to kill two vicious ghosts of catastrophic red and white light at the cost of burning his life span, the yin energy entered his body, causing him to die prematurely before his destined longevity.</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, this world is tattered and torn, but there are always people patching it up.</p><p></p><p>"If good and evil have no recompense, the universe must be biased."</p><p></p><p>"My Hidden Dragon Monastery must rise again, or else the heavens are blind!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yichen made a decision in his heart. This matter might be an opportunity for him to revive the monastery.</p><p></p><p>The bigger the waves, the more precious the fish.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment and said:</p><p></p><p>"County Master, even fragrant wine fears deep alleys."</p><p></p><p>Zhou County Master, understanding the profound meaning behind the words, immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"That's simple. After this matter, I will have people help spread the great deeds of Hidden Dragon Monastery, both openly and secretly. The monastery's incense burners will surely burn more vigorously."</p><p></p><p>"I need invigorating medicines to replenish my vital essence and energy, right now. My junior martial brother is a rare genius, extremely intelligent. If he can grow into his full potential, County Master will also have another choice. In the future, when I'm not around to deal with evil spirits, he won't be obstructed by forces like the Reverend Truth Monastery."</p><p></p><p>Zhou County Master pondered for a moment, then smiled:</p><p></p><p>"I agree to this. In my study room, I still have three hundred-year-old ginseng roots and two eighty-year-old Astragalus roots. I can have them sent to your junior martial brother today."</p><p></p><p>Yichen gave Zhou County Master's fat face a strange look, not expecting this portly county master to be so decisive and have such fortitude.</p><p></p><p>"County Master is indeed quick-witted. Zhang Butouli in your yamen has a karmic connection with me. I have already accepted him as my disciple. In the future, you can have him contact me for any matters."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Butouli is diligent in his duties. His ideas for Precious Street are truly eye-opening. He is quite renowned among the constables, and I think he is most deserving of the position of Chief Constable of Fengchun County."</p><p></p><p>"After this matter, there are many things I wish to seek guidance from the Dao Master."</p><p></p><p>Yichen did not respond to this, but instead bowed deeply to the County Master. "May the Heavenly Venerable of Boundless Blessings have infinite longevity. This poor monk shall take his leave."</p><p></p><p>Everything lies unspoken.</p><p></p><p>Yichen swung his wide sleeves and strode into the backyard of the county yamen with head held high.</p><p></p><p>Just last month, according to information gathered by Zhang Butouli, his master Baiyunzi had a poor relationship with Lingfeng Monastery. He had even disciplined a Taoist from Lingfeng before.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, under the pretext of exorcising the possessed husband of a beautiful woman, this person hinted that she should spend a night with him. Baiyunzi found out by chance and gave him a severe beating, ruining his plans and causing Lingfeng Monastery to lose a lot of face.</p><p></p><p>Today was a good opportunity to see what Lingfeng Monastery was made of.</p><p></p><p>After passing through a long corridor, Yichen soon arrived before the doors of the main hall in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, made a decision in his heart, pushed open the vermilion doors, and entered the hall.</p><p></p><p>Inside were seated four figures - two Taoists, one monk, and one nun.</p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua still wore his elegant white robe as always, full of grace.</p><p></p><p>The slim-faced one in a gray kasaya robe with wide sleeves and a round collar must be Reverend Shuiyue from Miaoyuan Nunnery.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Yichen - he didn't expect Reverend Shuiyue to be so young, only in her thirties but looking like a beauty of twenty-eight.</p><p></p><p>Her lips were naturally red, her brows dark and curved. More importantly, her slender figure with ample curves could not be concealed by the loose kasaya.</p><p></p><p>Tsk, how could one subdue demons dressed like that? It didn't seem very convenient.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

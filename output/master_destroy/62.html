        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Wang Manor, the room of the manor's housekeeper.</p><p></p><p>An elderly man with silver hair lay on a brocade couch, his expression calm, so calm that even the rise and fall of his chest was imperceptible. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the tightly closed doors and windows, and a plume of black smoke surged in through the cracks, materializing into a human-shaped smoky form that rushed into the silver-haired elder's mouth, nose and every orifice like a whale gulping water.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the old man slowly opened his eyes, a flash of resentful malice flickering in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>"Damn that cattle-nosed fool, he really thought you were just a ruffian, almost letting you deceive him."</p><p></p><p>He was the Five Paths Demon, an evil spirit born by chance from the convergence of human desires and the resentment of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>Never cultivating good deeds in his life, he only loved indulging in lust.</p><p></p><p>A week ago, during his routine outing to absorb energy, he unintentionally caught sight of the Lady Wang offering incense outside the city for the elderly Madame, and was instantly struck by her heavenly beauty.</p><p></p><p>Every part of her body was perfectly aligned with his aesthetic ideals.</p><p></p><p>He fell in love, utterly in love.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw Lady Wang, he felt that all his previous targets for absorbing energy were mere twisted gourds.</p><p></p><p>If his previous targets were coarse grains, then Lady Wang was a steamed bun made of the finest flour.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the uncultured Five Paths Demon could only rely on uttering profanities to get by in the world.</p><p></p><p>On the day he saw Lady Wang, he muttered ninety-nine profane phrases to himself in a trance.</p><p></p><p>So he transformed his true form into a statue, waiting on the path Lady Wang would inevitably take when returning to the city.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, heaven does not disappoint those with sincere intentions. After basking in the afternoon sun for a while, he finally awaited the arrival of the woman of his dreams.</p><p></p><p>It was autumn, the wind so caressing, swirling the fallen red maple leaves up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>His heart soared along with them.</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang, clad in a white dress that accentuated her curvaceous figure, her bosom, her embroidered lotus shoes on dainty feet, her white socks, that ultimate waist-hip ratio â€“ it was utterly profane times ninety-nine.</p><p></p><p>On that day, the typically uninterested Five Paths Demon had his first thought of enrolling himself in a private tutoring class.</p><p></p><p>Truly, one only laments the lack of words when the need arises.</p><p></p><p>With such lack of culture, would he not seem uncouth to the lady?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the roadside statue, Lady Wang, lounging in a luxurious sedan carried by four bearers, ordered them to stop. She walked over gracefully and offered three incense sticks, praying for the elderly Madame's swift recovery.</p><p></p><p>He could not save anyone.</p><p></p><p>But he desired Lady Wang.</p><p></p><p>What should he do?</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>Because he was an evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>He could not be bound by human morality.</p><p></p><p>Morality was just something invented by humans to restrain themselves, it did not apply to him.</p><p></p><p>So he clung to the underside of the sedan and followed Lady Wang back to the manor, casually devouring the brain of the old housekeeper that day before lurking inside.</p><p></p><p>That night.</p><p></p><p>Materializing from smoke.</p><p></p><p>Under the threat "Madame, you don't want me to kill everyone in the Wang Manor, do you?", he enjoyed a few blissful days like a deity.</p><p></p><p>That feeling, if described in two words, would be: utterly profane.</p><p></p><p>If described in three words:</p><p></p><p>Soaring to the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, such good times do not last," the silver-haired elder in the room showed a dejected expression.</p><p></p><p>A couple of days ago, that Lady Wang became restless and invited a white-haired Taoist to supposedly perform rites for the elderly Madame's passing.</p><p></p><p>But could he not see through Lady Wang's intentions? She merely hoped to find someone of great spiritual power to see through his disguise and rescue her and the manor's residents.</p><p></p><p>Although Lady Wang dared not speak directly, he saw right through the intention in her heart.</p><p></p><p>For instance, she who usually loved wearing white suddenly wore red when the elderly Madame's illness worsened - an abnormality meant to draw the attention of the visiting Taoist and convey her hidden plea for help.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>But all of this was doomed to be in vain.</p><p></p><p>He, the Five Paths Demon, was born skilled at concealing his true form and possessing human bodies. As long as he didn't take action, unless there were cultivators whose abilities exceeded his by over ten times, no one would be able to see through his disguise.</p><p></p><p>In this small town of Ping'an County, there were definitely no such heavenly cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, he severely punished Lady Wang for this incident. </p><p></p><p>During the punishment, it seemed a pretty young maidservant overheard it from outside the door and ran away in fright.</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, it seemed even more exciting.</p><p></p><p>Pulling back his scattered thoughts, the Five Paths Demon rubbed his brow agitatedly with his thumb. </p><p></p><p>"Things have become a bit troublesome now. It's better not to go wandering for a while, it's safer to be cautious. I didn't expect that reckless looking Taoist priest to have such keen senses."</p><p></p><p>"That reckless one, normally his vital energy is not apparent, lying dormant. But once circulated, it's terrifying, like a blazing furnace."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it was me facing him, I fear I would not come out well. If the fight dragged on, it could attract the attention of the security patrol, and that would be disastrous."  </p><p></p><p>"It was fortunate I ran fast enough tonight."</p><p></p><p>"If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have made a move tonight, flushing out the snake in the grass all at once."</p><p></p><p>"But there's no need to worry too much. As long as I lie low again and endure for a period, Lady Wang will have to obediently submit to me."</p><p></p><p>"In this town of Ping'an County, there is absolutely no one who can see through my disguise."</p><p></p><p>The Five Paths Demon muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for threatening the lives of the entire Wang manor, given Lady Wang's unyielding personality, she would definitely rather die than submit.</p><p></p><p>What the Five Paths Demon liked about her wasn't just her appearance, but more so her personality.</p><p></p><p>Quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>He truly adored Lady Wang. Otherwise, just based on those little acts of hers that pushed his limits (dancing), he would have secretly killed everyone in the Wang manor and run away long ago.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the limit.</p><p></p><p>If there were any further transgressions, he would definitely kill and flee.</p><p></p><p>Between a beauty and his own life, he could still distinguish clearly.</p><p></p><p>You can pretend, but don't go too far~</p><p></p><p>That beauty was also clear-eyed, knowing her own limits.</p><p></p><p>After settling his thoughts, the steward Wang, or the Five Paths Demon, immediately relaxed. He opened the window and in the pure moonlight, opened a book and began reading.</p><p></p><p>In the moonlight, the large characters on the title page were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>It boldly read "The Romantic Tales of Cao Aman".</p><p></p><p>This was a vernacular novel, with a plot full of ups and downs. The protagonist's actions were quite to his taste.</p><p></p><p>Reading it wasn't difficult, perfectly suited to his rudimentary education level from private tutors.</p><p></p><p>After a few days of reading, he felt his cultural level had subtly improved. But the book also left him feeling unsettled.</p><p></p><p>It was because of this that tonight, his unsettled mood from reading the book caused him to be unable to resist his desires, making a move on a quite attractive young maidservant.  </p><p></p><p>He had thought that as long as he was careful, even if he acted, no one would discover it. He didn't expect that even the young reckless Taoist priest, who the White Crane Taoist couldn't defeat, was actually an unfathomable master.</p><p></p><p>What? You ask why he didn't go to Lady Wang tonight?</p><p></p><p>Very simple, because he hasn't played that game before.</p><p></p><p>You have to eat some small dishes sometimes when you eat meat every day, right?</p><p></p><p>Who knew he almost had an accident?</p><p></p><p>After concentrating his will to cut off his distracting thoughts, the Five Paths Demon began to focus intently on reading by the moonlight. When he reached fascinating parts, he frequently nodded, occasionally picking up a peanut from the dish beside him to eat.</p><p></p><p>He, the Five Paths Demon, loved reading books.</p><p></p><p>He even gave himself a human name, Cao Kun, the same as the novel's main character.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this strange occurrence had already left Shitai Water Moon and the others dumbfounded and dumbstruck. </p><p></p><p>In the previous frame, Daoist Master Yi Chengzi was still displaying his mighty powers, suspending the mysterious black-robed person in the air and beating them. In the next frame, the situation suddenly changed drastically, with the mysterious 'black-robed person' pummeling Daoist Master Yi instead.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master Yi, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Shitai Water Moon and the others hurriedly went over with concern. An immense sense of despair involuntarily arose in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>The strongest among them, Yi Chen, was completely powerless against this mysterious 'black-robed person' before their eyes. This feeling of helplessness caused a mix of emotions to well up in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, stay back. Don't come any closer."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen used his gaze to stop the others from approaching further. He then turned his eyes towards the 'black robe', licking the trail of blood from the corner of his mouth, a long-forgotten taste of iron appearing on his tongue.</p><p></p><p>"No power, no power at all! Were you also taught by my master?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>A crazed expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He mustered all his inner energy and took the initiative to attack the 'black robe'.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Once again, he was sent flying.</p><p></p><p>The 'black robe' looked at the fallen Yi Chen and couldn't help but shake his head. He was not affected by Yi Chen's taunting words.</p><p></p><p>After living for so many years, how could he be easily disturbed by someone's mere words? Wouldn't that mean his lifetime of cultivation had gone to the dogs?</p><p></p><p>In fact, an admiring look grew increasingly pronounced in the 'black robe's' eyes.</p><p></p><p>He liked this young man.</p><p></p><p>Quick-witted, principled, and strong-willed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he saw his younger self.</p><p></p><p>Also a handsome fellow.</p><p></p><p>If Yi Chen had readily agreed after he extended the olive branch, he would have looked down on him instead. It would have just been toying with him, not truly nurturing him.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was truly moved.</p><p></p><p>He saw Yi Chen's determination to fight to the death rather than compromise.</p><p></p><p>That will, as sharp as a blade's edge, as weighty as a mountain, unyielding and brilliant.</p><p></p><p>After all, who in this world truly likes those driven by greed and desire?</p><p></p><p>If today I offer a high price, and you turn your back on your master's teachings to join me without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>Then tomorrow, if someone else offers an even higher price, wouldn't you also turn your back on me just as readily?</p><p></p><p>The 'black robe' now truly wanted to take Yi Chen under his wing.</p><p></p><p>He walked step by step, a black aura swirling around his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Edict: Body Bind."</p><p></p><p>He glanced towards Shitai Water Moon and the others, coldly saying.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying force of spatial stasis descended upon Shitai Water Moon and the rest, a feeling as if the entire space was opposing them.</p><p></p><p>They felt as though they were defying heaven and earth, an indescribably profound technique.</p><p></p><p>"Edict: Summon."</p><p></p><p>The 'black robe' continued walking, his hands constantly forming wondrous hand seals. As his words fell, the strange undulation in the air became even more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Pavilion of Charming Scenery, the previously cracked crevice in the ground widened again. The black gas within the crevice churned violently, as if some object was about to gush out from underground.</p><p></p><p>No, there was indeed something stirring beneath the ground.</p><p></p><p>In an unnamed corner underground in Fengyun County, a jade box lay quietly in a subterranean river, its existence unknown for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>Three faded talisman papers made of some unknown demonic beast's hide, rather than regular paper, were affixed to the jade box, appearing unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>Inside the jade box, a tender, lotus root-like infant's left arm lay still, suppressed by a jade of emerald hue that flickered with arcing light, continuously draining the arm of its vitality.</p><p></p><p>The strange undulation in the air reached the underground river, as if answering some summons. The arm in the jade box began to violently tremble, speeding towards the source of the undulation.</p><p></p><p>The black gas emerging from the crevice grew thicker, occasionally seeping groundwater.</p><p></p><p>After the 'black robe' completed these actions, he turned his gaze back towards Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad fighting spirit, I really appreciate you."</p><p></p><p>"Allow me to introduce myself, I am the great Dharma protector of the Corpse God Sect." </p><p></p><p>"You can call me - Venerable Yan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you one last chance, will you surrender or not?"</p><p></p><p>"If you surrender to me, I can spare those few people beside you."</p><p></p><p>"If you like that beautiful master, you can also take her into your room. Our sect has no prohibitions as long as you do not betray the sect."</p><p></p><p>The master Water Moon was restrained nearby, unable to speak, a blush of embarrassed anger appearing on her jade-like face.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen did not respond to the words of the 'black robe'.  </p><p></p><p>"You really hurt me badly!" he crawled up from the dust, blood flowing down his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Flowing into his eyes, nose, and mouth.</p><p></p><p>Finally, dripping onto the muddy ground.</p><p></p><p>"However, this time, it really packed a punch!"</p><p></p><p>"You hit me very satisfyingly, very satisfyingly!"</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his finger, dipped it in the blood droplets on his head, put it in his mouth and sucked on it, his eyes becoming increasingly crazed.</p><p></p><p>"This is the feeling!"</p><p></p><p>"This feeling of being truly alive and existing."</p><p></p><p>"Truly delicious, intoxicating."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Yan Zhen!"</p><p></p><p>"Please be sure to beat me to death, otherwise I will definitely beat you to death."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, do you understand the principle of 'knowing the way in the morning, one can die in the evening'?" Yi Chen's expression suddenly switched from crazed to calm.</p><p></p><p>The 'black robe' frowned, not knowing why Yi Chen suddenly brought this up.</p><p></p><p>However, Yi Chen's previous abnormal demeanor made him even more eager.</p><p></p><p>It really reminded him of his younger self, he was also abnormal like that when he was young.</p><p></p><p>Similarly mad, similarly frenzied, similarly resolute.</p><p></p><p>Damn, it's a moving feeling.</p><p></p><p>I must take him as my disciple, I must subdue him.</p><p></p><p>If he does not submit, I will keep beating him, I will beat him until he submits.</p><p></p><p>"Does it mean knowing the Way in the morning, one can die in the evening?" Although not understanding, the black robe still responded to Yi Chen's words.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was to be his future disciple, he had decided.</p><p></p><p>"No, it means knowing the way to your house in the morning, then I must beat you to death in the evening!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the true meaning of 'knowing the way in the morning, one can die in the evening'!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out an angry roar!</p><p></p><p>"Soul Ignition Transformation!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten Years!"</p><p></p><p>"Beat me to death!"</p><p></p><p>"If you can't beat me to death how can you be my master!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yi Chen directly unleashed his ultimate trump card.</p><p></p><p>With one move, he ignited ten years of his own life span.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he didn't want to ignite more, but he could only ignite ten years at most.</p><p></p><p>A powerful force gradually gathered around his body, a deep purple pure yang inner energy burning fiercely, rippling out in all directions with him as the center.</p><p></p><p>The formless energy flow whipped up the dust and debris on the ground into a swirling vortex surrounding his body.</p><p></p><p>His body expanded again, growing more than ten centimeters taller on top of his previous increase, bulging veins protruding all over like pythons coiling around him.</p><p></p><p>His hands, legs, waist, neck - the muscles all over his body swelled and strengthened again.</p><p></p><p>The muscles were like a thick armor, both protecting him and providing him with unparalleled driving power.</p><p></p><p>His heart pounded violently again, fiercely pumping the energy throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>With the frantic circulating and friction, he felt his inner energy could ignite at any moment.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, searing hot waves rolled off him.</p><p></p><p>An extremely powerful force, far exceeding his previous aura, emanated from his body.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The night was deep.</p><p></p><p>Yet no one noticed the abnormality at the Lanxiu Building. </p><p></p><p>On the deserted street, there was not even a ghostly shadow, only a mistaken toad croaking tirelessly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at the end of the street appeared a mysterious figure dressed in a black robe and wearing a black hood. He almost merged with the night, his form like a specter. With each step he took, there was a flickering, and he appeared more than ten meters away.</p><p></p><p>He noticed the croaking toad by the roadside, stopped his steps, and glanced at it. The toad instantly exploded into a cloud of blood mist. </p><p></p><p>In a few flickers, the mysterious figure plunged straight into the mist.</p><p></p><p>"Red Scissors, have you gathered all the materials needed to set up the Five Viscera Five Elements Black Heaven Pulling Formation?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, of course. The most important black heart for completing the formation was easy for me to find."</p><p></p><p>"Born in a yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour, and also a black-hearted person. I had to kill him right then to take the blood from his heart to set up the formation, otherwise I wouldn't have delayed so long." A silver bell-like voice suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the pavilion, the white-robed female ghost holding red scissors flipped her hand to reveal a still faintly pulsating heart. Her gaze was scorching, as if looking at a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the mysterious figure's eyes lit up with joy as he reached out to take the heart, but the white-robed ghost lightly avoided him.</p><p></p><p>"Red Scissors, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>"No meaning, Black Robe. As long as we retrieve the left hand of the Corpse God this time, the Great Dharma Protector is truly willing to remove my slave mark and teach me the art of corpse possession and spirit binding?"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dharma Protector's cultivation reaches the heavens. When has he ever gone back on his word?"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Demon Sect has never shortchanged its meritorious servants." The mysterious figure said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed ghost thought of that majestic figure sitting by the blood lake, and her expression cleared slightly. After all, although the Great Dharma Protector was cruel and merciless, he had indeed never gone back on his word.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, the white-robed ghost no longer avoided him, and the mysterious figure also took out a black liver.</p><p></p><p>The two most crucial main ingredients of the Five Viscera Five Elements Black Heaven Pulling Formation had finally been gathered by them.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dharma Protector's cultivation reached the heavens, and he calculated that the Corpse God's left arm was sealed in the Fengyu County area. So he passed down the Five Viscera Five Elements Black Heaven Pulling Formation, ordering the two of them to go find the exact location and bring back the Corpse God's left arm.</p><p></p><p>This formation was truly strange, requiring the five viscera of the five most evil people as the main ingredients: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.</p><p></p><p>The importance of these five ingredients increased from right to left, with the heart and liver being the most crucial.</p><p></p><p>For the spleen, lungs, and kidneys, ordinary evil people could be used. But for the heart and liver ingredients, the requirements were much stricter.</p><p></p><p>The black heart and liver naturally had strict requirements.</p><p></p><p>For the liver, it had to be from someone born in a yin year, yin month, and yin day.</p><p></p><p>As for the heart, not only did the person's birth characters have to meet requirements, but they also had to be killed and harvested within the same hour.</p><p></p><p>This made it very difficult for them to find.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Li was naturally the lucky one killed and harvested fresh for this purpose.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the white-robed ghost seemed to think of something and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Black Robe, this mission is of great importance. Will we be watched by the high-level cultivators of the Zhen'an Office on this journey?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the mysterious figure in the black hood couldn't help but reveal a smug smile on his face: "The Great Dharma Protector's strategies leave no oversights. How could he leave such a major loophole?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about the Zhen'an Office. The Great Dharma Protector has made meticulous plans. He has already arranged for people to stir up unrest in the surrounding counties, creating the illusion of chaos. The Zhen'an Office in Ping'an Prefecture currently has its hands full and definitely cannot send any Spirit Condensation or Nascent Soul cultivators to investigate."</p><p></p><p>"If they send even a late Spirit Condensation cultivator, that would be considered giving it great importance."</p><p></p><p>"Previously there was a Nascent Soul cultivator named Baiyunzi in Fengyu County, but he has already passed away. Now in Fengyu County, there are only a few cats, big and small."</p><p></p><p>"Not even a single Nascent Soul cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What small county town could possibly block our steps?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the black-robed figure's hand, two towering golden-armored corpses with blue faces and protruding fangs suddenly appeared behind him. He then took out a blood-red ancient jade from his chest.</p><p></p><p>This ancient jade was crimson and translucent, with a faint bloody glow pulsing within.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Great Protector's...?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed female ghost was already showing delight upon seeing the two giant golden-armored corpses behind the black robe, but when she saw the blood-red ancient jade he took out, she was so shocked that she abruptly stood up, her entire ghostly aura rippling.</p><p></p><p>"Red Scissors, watch your words."</p><p></p><p>"Are you reassured now?"  </p><p></p><p>"This is an immense blessing we've stumbled upon."</p><p></p><p>"With our combined forces, there's no need for concealment. The small Fengxun County can be easily overrun."</p><p></p><p>Their gazes met, their eyes burning intensely, both revealing a crazed expression on their faces as they chanted in unison:</p><p></p><p>"Following the Immortal God, spreading great compassion to save the world!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two began feverishly setting up their formation arrays.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the highway leading from Ping'an Prefecture to Fengxun County, Lin Zhengyi, the Patrol Battalion Chief of Zhen'an County, was galloping at full speed on a black horse with a slightly protruding forehead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, chaos erupted, everything was in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Within just a day or two, the entire Ping'an Prefecture had descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Of the dozens of counties under Ping'an Prefecture's jurisdiction, seven or eight had sent requests for aid, with rumors of demonic ghosts and evil spirits spreading everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Fires and smoke were seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>They all reported that the Eight Trigrams Talisman Mirror for Exorcising Evil had shattered, with each county describing increasingly severe situations.</p><p></p><p>In Yiyang County, the Zhao family had over a hundred people hanging themselves overnight, dangling like cured meats from the rafters, swaying in the wind.</p><p></p><p>In Milu County, the Qian family had two to three hundred people lining up to jump into the county's largest Night Fragrance Pool. Not only did they jump in, but they also swam breaststroke, dived, and did freestyle swimming while drinking golden wine, all with eerie smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Nearby people shouted warnings not to drink it, but they drank even more fervently, eventually either drowning or bursting from overconsumption.</p><p></p><p>The scene was utterly chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The most horrific was the Sun family in Duanyang County, who publicly performed a gruesome act in the town square.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred people sliced open their own bellies with small knives, disemboweling themselves before twisting their intestines into a "nine-turn large intestine" dish. Aside from the few lucky ones who were rescued, the rest perished.</p><p></p><p>The most tragic was the Ren family in Heishi County. During the relocation of their ancestor's grave, a flying jiangshi emerged and bit anyone it saw, eventually causing the entire family to become walking corpses after the ancestor turned on them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Compared to those extreme cases in the other counties, the situation in Fengxun County, where the wealthy Wang family had their livers removed and were killed, seemed relatively normal and would hardly rank among the most severe.</p><p></p><p>However, based on years of intuition, Lin Zhengyi had a vague feeling that the less serious cases might actually be the biggest problems. As the Patrol Battalion Chief of Ping'an Prefecture and at the late stage of Refining Qi into the Essence, he took it upon himself to rush day and night to Fengxun County.</p><p></p><p>The horse Lin Zhengyi was riding was an inferior dragon horse issued by the imperial Qin Tian Monastery to the Patrol Battalion Chiefs. Not only could it gallop swiftly like the wind with incredible endurance, but he also felt little jolting while riding on its back.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head to gaze at the full moon overhead, his mind filled with myriad thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Such a massive disturbance could not be considered normal by anyone, but the underlying conspiracy behind it remained unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, for now I can only take it one step at a time."</p><p></p><p>Reining in his scattered thoughts, Lin Zhengyi continued his journey through the starry night.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

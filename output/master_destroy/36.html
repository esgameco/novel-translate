        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>At night, the stars dotted the sky. </p><p></p><p>At the county yamen of Fengxun County, it was bustling with people's voices.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, come over, there's a fire!"</p><p></p><p>"Come quickly, the archives room is about to be burned down, it's a huge fire."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an inexplicable huge fire swept through the entire archives room of the county yamen, burning all the old records to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The bustling voices did not quiet down for a while. </p><p></p><p>County Magistrate Zhou sat in the courtyard with a gloomy expression, quietly listening to the report from Constable Zhang, as the moonlight scattered on the ground like a thin gauze.</p><p></p><p>"Constable Zhang, was the archives room completely burned down?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to you sir, the archives room caught fire due to the dry weather. Although the on-duty yamen staff discovered it in time, many important records still could not be rescued. Please punish me, sir." Constable Zhang finished speaking and knelt down like a mountain of gold and jade.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Magistrate Zhou's face finally showed a look of relief, and he immediately said sternly: "So many important books and records were completely destroyed in the blink of an eye. What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"This must be accounted for."</p><p></p><p>Constable Zhang remained kneeling on the ground and said, "Reporting to County Magistrate, I have already investigated this matter. It was caused by a temporary clerk in the archives room who was lazy. When he left, he forgot to blow out the candle, which led to this big fire. I have already punished him by deducting his salary and dismissing him. He will never be hired again."</p><p></p><p>"I also heard that this person, knowing he could no longer face you County Magistrate, has decided to move his entire family to a neighboring county to live with relatives and does not plan to return."</p><p></p><p>"For the fire in the archives room and my failure to put it out effectively, I am guilty of dereliction of duty. Please punish me, sir."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Magistrate Zhou could not help but show a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"There are many affairs in the yamen, and you, Chief Constable Zhang, have just taken up this position. It's understandable to have some lapses. Since that's the case, let's leave it at that for now."</p><p></p><p>"Initially, when Daoist Master Yi recommended you, Constable Zhang, to me, I was apprehensive in my heart, worried that you might not do a good job as the Chief Constable. Today, I realize you are truly a capable person."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's right."</p><p></p><p>"Have you properly handled the affairs of the Squire Wang family? Have all their assets been registered and catalogued?"</p><p></p><p>"Squire Wang was a renowned local gentry. After such a tragic incident, we must ensure he has a proper and dignified departure. As for his remaining assets, I still need to hand them over to the imperial court."</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate gestured with his eyes to his left and right, and immediately a black-clothed old servant came out of the darkness carrying a chair for Constable Zhang to sit on.</p><p></p><p>After expressing his gratitude, Constable Zhang said, "Reporting to you sir, I would never dare to neglect the matters you entrusted to me."</p><p></p><p>"All of the Wang family's assets have been registered and catalogued. All the direct descendants of the Wang family have been placed in high-quality coffins made of sandalwood, Chinese boxwood, and other materials. The remaining people have also been properly handled."</p><p></p><p>"All the expenses were temporarily covered by the county yamen. Once the inventory is complete, the costs can be deducted."</p><p></p><p>"However, since the Wang family died at the hands of an evil spirit, to prevent any incidents, I think it would be better to cremate their remains along with the coffins. After that, we can collect their ashes, hold a ritual, and then bury them. This way, it will put the minds of the nearby residents at ease while also preserving the dignity of the Wang family."</p><p></p><p>Magistrate Zhou's smile grew broader.</p><p></p><p>"Constable Zhang handles matters properly and speaks with maturity and prudence. Excellent."</p><p></p><p>Facing the County Magistrate's praise, Constable Zhang looked around and, seeing no one else nearby, carefully walked up to Magistrate Zhou's side and said softly:</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to County Magistrate, when I was cataloguing and seizing the Wang family's assets, I inadvertently discovered a gold-seated jade Buddha statue in the Wang family's home. It's over a foot tall, exquisitely crafted, and is said to be an antique. I did not register it in the catalogue. On my way back, I first went to your residence and handed it over to your steward."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, I went alone, and no one discovered it."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Magistrate Zhou could no longer hold back his laughter and burst out laughing while clapping his hands. "Constable Zhang, you are truly a rare talent!"</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that in my county yamen, there would be such a hidden gem like you that I failed to discover. This is my failure as the County Magistrate."</p><p></p><p>"Here's what we'll do. The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility. The burden of Zhenbaojie still needs you, Constable Zhang, to take the lead and shoulder it. Work hard, and I will keep your contributions in mind."</p><p></p><p>"Servants, bring a cup of wine for Chief Constable Zhang."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, County Magistrate." Constable Zhang raised his head to look at Magistrate Zhou under the moonlight, knowing that his position as Chief Constable was now secure.</p><p></p><p>After Constable Zhang took his leave, Magistrate Zhou called for the old servant to grind ink and began writing a letter.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A letter arrived.</p><p></p><p>It was not the letter requesting aid from the imperial court's Pacification Office that he had sent out at noon. This letter was written by the county magistrate to his own master.</p><p></p><p>He too would have to mobilize his connections to cover things up. He could only hope for a safe landing.</p><p></p><p>After writing it, he said, "Fu Bo, please trouble yourself to go to the provincial capital and deliver this letter to my master."</p><p></p><p>"Also, take that golden Buddha statue along with you."</p><p></p><p>The old servant who had previously helped Zhang Butou move chairs appeared like a ghost. Taking the letter, he nodded towards the county magistrate, then leapt up like a big bird and disappeared into the deep night.</p><p></p><p>Watching the direction the black-robed old servant left, the county magistrate stood silently under the moonlight, drinking cup after cup of wine, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the same moonlight, at the Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen and Qing Yunzi sat across from each other in the back courtyard. On the table were many fruits, candied fruits, and two jars of good wine. </p><p></p><p>It was clear that compared to the plain tea served before, the Hidden Dragon Monastery had made a major economic breakthrough to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen popped some salted peanuts into his mouth, then picked up the wine cup in front of him and drank deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Younger martial brother, I've told you the whole story from start to finish. The situation now is as I described."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know of any demonic arts that require human livers? I suspect the mysterious master behind that evil spirit is not an even more powerful evil spirit, but a human."  </p><p></p><p>"A human cultivating demonic arts."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qing Yunzi squinted his eyes, downed a cup of fine wine, chewed on a peanut, and then said, "I do know of a few ghosts that like to eat hearts, but I haven't seen any records of ones that prefer livers."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's just some ghost's strange preference."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Qing Yunzi's squinting problem was getting worse.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yi Chen still looked somewhat worried, Qing Yunzi's body flickered with red light as his pure yang inner force spread through his whole body. He said confidently, </p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, senior martial brother. Over this past month, my pure yang inner force has made tremendous progress. I am no longer the same as the Ameng from Wuxia."</p><p></p><p>"Even if that evil spirit comes to kill us, we can fend it off with our martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"You don't have to bear the burden alone anymore, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>"The Hidden Dragon Monastery is not just your Hidden Dragon Monastery, it's mine too."  </p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, senior brother, let's spar."</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, battle intent flared in Qing Yunzi's eyes as he stared at Yi Chen, as if still harboring resentment over his previous defeat.</p><p></p><p>The more talented a person is, the more arrogant they tend to be.</p><p></p><p>Over this past month, he had not dared to slack off for a moment, bitterly cultivating his skills.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you want to fight?" Yi Chen glanced sideways at Qing Yunzi, happily rubbing his hands together, feeling itchy.</p><p></p><p>This younger martial brother was just too young, unaware of how dangerous the world could be. Fortunately, he had his senior brother.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, outside the Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi's hair was disheveled as he flailed on the ground, wailing nonstop:</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, stop hitting me, stop hitting me! I was wrong."</p><p></p><p>"What were you wrong about?"</p><p></p><p>"I was wrong to forget your teachings. I violated the true meaning of enduring hardship. I became arrogant in my skills."</p><p></p><p>"Correct answer." Smack! Another large lump rose on Qing Yunzi's head.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, you're still hitting me even after I gave the right answer?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you think this gives you a more symmetrically rugged look, my angular little junior brother?" Under the bright moonlight, Yi Chen smiled like a big bad wolf. He stretched out his large hand and vigorously ruffled Qing Yunzi's hair, saying loudly, "Junior brother, don't blame your senior brother for being heavy-handed. If I don't hit you hard, you won't learn your lesson."</p><p></p><p>"You don't know how bad the world is these days."</p><p></p><p>"It's full of vicious old scoundrels out there."</p><p></p><p>"Your senior brother is hitting you for your own good."</p><p></p><p>"Do you accept that or not?"</p><p></p><p>"I accept it, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Watching Qing Yunzi's departing back as he left rubbing his head, Yi Chen turned and looked up at the bright moon in the sky. For a while, he was lost in a daze, with strands of moonlight gathering on his body and disappearing, replenishing the deep purple pure yang inner force he had expended.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he came to his senses, stretched lazily, then made a biting motion towards the moon in the sky before slowly strolling back to his room.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

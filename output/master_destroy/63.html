        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Time is like a wild donkey, it just keeps running. </p><p></p><p>Before I knew it, another night had passed. The sunlight began to shine on the earth, colliding head-on with those who rose early.</p><p></p><p>I don't know if it was because the old lady of the Wang family had a strong life force or because the Wang mansion had many treasures like ginseng, but despite the constant clamor that the old lady would soon pass away, the Wang mansion remained calm.</p><p></p><p>When Yi Chen returned to the Wang mansion from outside, he unexpectedly learned from Xiu'er that this morning, the old lady had broken with tradition and drank a bowl of porridge...</p><p></p><p>He felt truly happy for the elderly lady...Ah.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what, he would not return the 500 taels of silver deposit that the master of the Wang family had given him yesterday. </p><p></p><p>He had to account for the labor costs of Daoist Master Yi Chengzi.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Wang mansion was peaceful, just like usual, with everyone fulfilling their duties.</p><p></p><p>The servants had repeated these same days for so many days now, they had long grown accustomed to it, or perhaps numb to it.</p><p></p><p>Those who chopped firewood chopped firewood, those who carried bricks carried bricks, those who cooked cooked, those who did laundry did laundry.</p><p></p><p>However, after Yi Chen returned from outside, the servants realized that today was a bit different from usual.</p><p></p><p>That was because the so-called Daoist Master Yi Chengzi, who was invited by the second young master, that tall daoist with bulging muscles carrying a large precious sword who wandered around everywhere, today his eyes were wide open like bronze bells, and he kept accosting people to brag and ramble nonsensically about all sorts of things.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he would ask repetitive questions, and sometimes he would appear suddenly like a ghost from somewhere, suddenly patting your shoulder, staring intently at your face as he spoke, even the maidservants in the mansion did not escape his vicious hands.</p><p></p><p>The few wolf hounds raised in the mansion to guard it were constantly being sniffed at by a strange black cat, and if their tails weren't held tightly, the black cat would swipe at them with its paws. Strangely, the previously ferocious wolf hounds were as obedient as little chicks and didn't dare retaliate at all.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Wang, how old are you this year?" A large face suddenly appeared next to Steward Wang's side. It was none other than Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>He held a glass cup in his hand and sidled up to Steward Wang to ask surreptitiously. </p><p></p><p>Wutong Moxin felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master Yi, this is the third time you've asked."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Is that so? My memory hasn't been too good today ~ My apologies."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gave an awkward laugh and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Just as Wutong Moxin was about to let out a breath of relief and return to his room to continue reading, away from this plague, another large face suddenly appeared around the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master Yi, I'm seventy this year, seventy, seventy!" Wutong Moxin couldn't help but feel a surge of anger and growled.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? So you're jumping to answer now."  </p><p></p><p>"I'm not asking you that, I just suddenly remembered something I wanted to tell you."</p><p></p><p>"There are two trees planted in the courtyard of my Daoist temple!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of trees?" Against his better judgment, Wutong Moxin couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"One is a jujube tree~"</p><p></p><p>"And the other one?"</p><p></p><p>"Er...also a jujube tree~"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Wutong Moxin felt like giving himself a slap.</p><p></p><p>I really should be damned.</p><p></p><p>Why did I have to ask such a stupid question?</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head, unable to suppress the flash of murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master Yi, there's no need to tease this old man so. I cannot compare to you young people. I wish to return to my room to rest for a bit. Daoist Master, did you have anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist Master's conduct today has needlessly disturbed the order of my Wang mansion. I will report everything in full to the master of the household. The Daoist Master should watch himself."</p><p></p><p>Wutong Moxin suppressed his anger and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Wang, one last thing, really the last thing, I want to ask you."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen flashed in front of him again, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you guess?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, ten thousand stampeding wild horses thundered through Wutong Moxin's head. Just as he was about to explode in anger, Yi Chen's next words made him feel like he had fallen into an ice pit.</p><p></p><p>His hand was suddenly grabbed by Yi Chen. Yi Chen dropped his previously frivolous demeanor and said coldly, "Steward Wang, one last question."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Lady of the Wang family...beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>"Dao...Daoist Master...what strange words you speak~"</p><p></p><p>"I...I'm already at this age..."</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>Before Steward Wang could continue making excuses, Yi Chen fiercely threw the glass cup in his hand at the wall, making a crisp shattering sound.</p><p></p><p>Wutong Moxin felt an immense force travel up his arm as Yi Chen suddenly pulled him into the front courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious demon, I could tell at a glance that you're not human~"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly reveal your true form!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen roared angrily.</p><p></p><p>Along with the shattering sound of the glass cup hitting the wall, five law enforcement officers from the Zhen'an Monastery wearing fish robes suddenly leapt into the Wang mansion courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was none other than Lin Zhengyi, the Lin Bailiff.</p><p></p><p>The five men each held a flag banner and took positions at the five directions of the courtyard, forcefully planting their flag banners into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"With the golden light as guidance, the Small Five Phases Inverted Void Formation, arise!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Bailiff stomped his foot and shouted loudly. He then took out a bagua mirror from his chest and tossed it into the air.</p><p></p><p>The bagua mirror suddenly froze midair, receiving a strand of heavenly light that shone onto the banners marked with the symbols for metal, wood, water, fire and earth.</p><p></p><p>A golden inverted light formation instantly took shape.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Taoist priest, how's this formation?" </p><p></p><p>"I received your message last night, so I contacted the four small flags under me and also took out the five formation flags that my father had kept hidden away, ensuring there would be no mistakes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhengyi laughed heartily, his laughter sunny and bright, like a big boy.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, well done! Splendid!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Zhengyi appear, Yi Chen was naturally overjoyed too.</p><p></p><p>After a long chat with Xiu'er last night, Yi Chen basically confirmed that there was indeed an evil spirit in the Wang mansion, and it had an extremely strong ability to conceal itself. To be on the safe side, Yi Chen chose to visit the Zhen'an Yamen at midnight to summon help.</p><p></p><p>After all, as an orthodox sect, wasn't it very normal for his Yinlong Monastery to summon help?</p><p></p><p>As a righteous partner, he didn't need to talk about any chivalric code with these demonic cultivators. They could just join forces.</p><p></p><p>This is how we orthodox sects operate.</p><p></p><p>If we can outnumber them, we don't bother with individual heroics.</p><p></p><p>If he let the evil spirit get away, and it went berserk with revenge, Yi Chen didn't care, but his junior martial brothers, especially Qingfeng and Mingyue, would be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if they'd have to hold a ritual then.</p><p></p><p>After all, one can be a thief for a thousand days, but not guard against thieves for a thousand days.</p><p></p><p>Last night, after Yi Chen's long talk with Xiu'er, he visited the Zhen'an Yamen under the night sky, and coincidentally Lin Baihu was at the yamen. The two immediately hit it off, toasting with a cup of glass, and as soon as the glass clinked, they charged right in to take care of business.</p><p></p><p>This led to the current scene.</p><p></p><p>Combining the abnormal state of Madam Wang, her unusual red dress, her strange act of dismissing her personal maid, the strange flush on her face, and the strange sounds from her room, Yi Chen quickly locked onto the few people who had been in close contact with Madam Wang these past few days.</p><p></p><p>As a Taoist priest well-versed in human nature, in his past life, he had gotten an investor to invest 50 million with just three sentences for his PPT presentation.</p><p></p><p>Handling the small fries on the current list of suspects was child's play for him.</p><p></p><p>To avoid wrongly accusing an innocent person, while ensuring not a single guilty party was let off, he would conduct a fair and meticulous investigation.</p><p></p><p>After casting a wide net, carefully verifying, and probing in various ways, only the Wang mansion's butler had revealed a killing intent towards him as sharp as a needle at one point previously.</p><p></p><p>Although his methods were a bit crude, they were very effective.</p><p></p><p>The butler's malicious intent was so thick it didn't seem human.</p><p></p><p>This was the smoking gun evidence.</p><p></p><p>Sensing malicious intent, this was truly damn useful.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday when he crossed the river, even the leader of those bearded knights who drew their swords on him didn't make him sense such strong malice. Yet this old geezer butler was emanating far more malice than that bearded knight leader. If this wasn't an evil spirit, what was it?</p><p></p><p>"Butler Wang, quickly reveal your true form!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked at the Butler Wang whose left arm he had grabbed, unable to resist showing a ferocious smile.</p><p></p><p>"You little thing, you're quite good at hiding. You really made this Taoist master work hard to find you."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wu Tonmo's heart was a mess, completely unaware of how Yi Chen had seen through his disguise with such confidence in his judgment.</p><p></p><p>However, in the current situation, he could only refuse to admit it. He didn't believe that without any evidence, the Zhen'an Yamen could do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Yi, you're wrongly accusing me. How could this old man be an evil spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"Still not admitting it? I won't cry until I see the coffin. My Yinlong Monastery is renowned for being skilled at identifying evil spirits. Let me channel a burst of pure positive inner qi into your body, and you'll definitely reveal your true form!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen sneered ferociously, dragging Butler Wang like a big gray wolf dragging a little chick.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he channeled his pure positive inner qi towards Butler Wang's body.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......" Five hundred crows flew across the sky.</p><p></p><p>The situation immediately became awkward.</p><p></p><p>There was no abnormal reaction at all, Butler Wang was still trembling in his grip.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>Doubt began to flicker in Lin Baihu's eyes too. He frowned and threw a talisman for expelling evil at Butler Wang, but there was still no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tonmo's heart began to show a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, you big fool, today I'll let you lose face and reputation."</p><p></p><p>"If my ability to conceal my form could be seen through so easily, I would have been reduced to ashes eighty years ago."</p><p></p><p>"Just wait, you fool, after today, await my endless revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tonmo's heart began to roar.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen fell silent for a moment, seeing the growing whispers around him from more and more people. With a wave of his big hand, he directly drew the Dragon Slaying Sword from behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Deep purple positive inner qi suddenly pervaded his entire body. His figure grew taller, the veins on his neck protruding like a dragon. The purple inner qi on the Dragon Slaying Sword flickered unceasingly, scorching the ground black.</p><p></p><p>He gave a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't be afraid!"</p><p></p><p>"This evil spirit is very resilient, able to keep a straight face even against my positive inner qi."</p><p></p><p>"This is no ordinary evil spirit anymore, I must go all out!!"</p><p></p><p>"Receive my Force to Split Mount Hua!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yi Chen executed a horizontal sword strike.</p><p></p><p>This move was inspired by Nie Renwan.</p><p></p><p>Facing this powerful and weighty sword strike, Wu Tonmo finally couldn't keep it up anymore. If he kept pretending, he would die!</p><p></p><p>"Yi Chengzi, you damn...!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was almost breaking as he shouted this.</p><p></p><p>His figure retreated abruptly, the yin energy surging around his body, dodging Yi Chen's ferocious strike.</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for following along. See you tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

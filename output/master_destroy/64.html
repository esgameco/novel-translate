        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You wicked thief, you still say you're not an evil spirit?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the 'House Steward Wang' enveloped in black energy, Yi Chen couldn't help but feel great joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Baihu, you and your colleagues maintain the great formation. Be careful not to let this evil spirit escape."</p><p></p><p>"I will enter the formation with Daoist White Crane. I'm willing to fight quickly for you all and we will certainly achieve a great victory."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist White Crane, as upright cultivators, we don't need to lecture these evil and crooked beings on moral principles. Let's go together."</p><p></p><p>With his sharp eyes, Yi Chen noticed the commotion in the front courtyard had naturally also alerted the youthful white-haired Daoist White Crane to come investigate. He immediately changed his expression and spoke the invitation.</p><p></p><p>While he was fighting fiercely at the front, he wouldn't let his fellow cultivator Daoist White Crane hide in the back trying to take advantage through rhetoric. That was unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator Yi Chengzi was not naive. He had plenty of strength and means to determine White Crane's outcome.</p><p></p><p>For example, throwing him into the formation.</p><p></p><p>With these words, the pressure suddenly shifted to Daoist White Crane.  </p><p></p><p>Everyone's gazes instantly focused on Daoist White Crane.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scorching looks from the onlookers, Daoist White Crane knew that if he didn't take action today, his reputation would stink on the streets later.</p><p></p><p>The honest cultivator Yi Chen, whom he had previously looked down upon, had pushed him into a corner with just one sentence. He saw the fierce light flashing in the young man's eyes, suggesting that if he didn't come down, he would drag him into the great formation.</p><p></p><p>When the eventual outcome of something cannot be changed no matter how hard you struggle, it's best to accept it readily. The loss will be smaller that way.</p><p></p><p>For instance, if someone asks you to lend money or do them a favor, and you know you'll ultimately be unable to refuse, it's better not to hesitate. Your best choice is to agree right away and fulfill the favor properly.</p><p></p><p>Dithering endlessly won't change the final outcome. The biggest loser is actually yourself - you've given up the benefit but failed to properly reciprocate the favor, leaving yourself at a loss.</p><p></p><p>As an experienced veteran of the rivers and lakes, the elderly Daoist White Crane naturally understood this principle well. Seeing the gazes of Madam Wang and the Wang family master also turn towards him, he decisively drew the peach wood sword from behind his back without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>He wiped his palm across the blade of the peach wood sword, and fresh red blood instantly seeped into it.</p><p></p><p>Nourished by his blood, the peach wood sword immediately turned completely red, glowing like a heated branding iron. Daoist White Crane waved the sword and stepped forward with one foot, soaring into the formation like a swimming dragon, earning cheers from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"With an old immortal here, there's nothing to worry about."</p><p></p><p>"Though Cultivator Yi Chengzi's spiritual vision is not bad, in terms of demon subduing skills, we still need rely on the veteran elders."</p><p></p><p>"When a true master takes action, you know their caliber. Daoist White Crane using his own blood to activate the peach wood sword's power shows he's unleashing thunderous rage. Let's just wait and watch the show."</p><p></p><p>In just two days, the gracious and amiable Daoist White Crane had gained a following within the Wang residence.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly emboldened by the onlookers' words, Daoist White Crane couldn't help puffing out his chest, and the scorching red light on the peach wood sword even grew two inches longer.</p><p></p><p>"Though I'm old, my sword is still sharp!"</p><p></p><p>"Evil spirits, behold my sword!"</p><p></p><p>With an angry roar, Daoist White Crane actually took the lead, swinging the peach wood sword straight down at the 'House Steward Wang's' head.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Yi Chen's face change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Oh shit, this idiot, how dare he!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this person wiped his palm across the sword, Yi Chen had felt something was off - this was clearly an unorthodox demonic technique.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not even a particularly skillful one among unorthodox techniques.</p><p></p><p>He knew Daoist White Crane was mediocre, but didn't expect him to be so inept yet so reckless at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen only wanted Daoist White Crane to embarrass himself, but he didn't expect...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He wanted his life.</p><p></p><p>Cursing inwardly, Yi Chen shook his Dragon Slaying Sword and also silently slashed towards the 'House Steward Wang'.</p><p></p><p>The so-called skills, sword techniques, martial arts forms, were just tricks devised by those unable to penetrate their own profound mysteries and completely excavate the divine hidden within their mortal flesh.</p><p></p><p>At Yi Chen's current level of Pure Yang Inner Cultivation, he was long past being constrained by forms. His inner force had been tempered smooth and effortless, every movement brimming with immense dragon-like power.  </p><p></p><p>Deep purple Pure Yang inner energy flowed through his entire body, wantonly exuberant, causing even the hem of Yi Chen's robe to flutter slightly.</p><p></p><p>In this strike, Yi Chen's body, heart, and mind were unified. The air around the sword blade rippled like waves, a sight that made even the well-traveled Five Penetrations Demon change color slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what an accomplished Yi Chengzi, his strength is indeed formidable."</p><p></p><p>"The Wang family is blind, unable to recognize a true dragon."</p><p></p><p>A red line suddenly split open the brow of the House Steward Wang's body possessed by the Five Penetrations Demon, as precisely drawn as by the finest ruler, rapidly spreading down from his brow.</p><p></p><p>Five thick black tentacles abruptly emerged from the red line, prying open the House Steward's body to the left and right like opening a door.</p><p></p><p>Riiip.</p><p></p><p>Red, white, blue, yellow, green pieces fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A deformed monster with five tentacles appeared before everyone's eyes. Its body was covered in festering sores and grotesquely misshapen tumors. It had two extraordinarily sturdy, thick legs like a mutated giant frog gorging on nuclear wastewater three times a day.</p><p></p><p>Unlike a frog, its mouth was filled with countless sharp fangs that glinted coldly in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>An even stronger demonic aura began spreading through the air.</p><p></p><p>"Remember my name, Oxnose, I am the Five Penetrations Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The Five Penetrations Demon roared, one tentacle whipping like an iron lash directly onto Daoist White Crane's peachwood sword, ignoring the red light swirling around it.</p><p></p><p>Another tentacle slammed towards White Crane's chest.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three tentacles intertwined in the air, forming an even larger 'iron whip' to meet Yi Chen's Dragon Slaying Sword.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>An invisible shockwave emanated from the point of impact, spreading outwards. The Five Penetrations Demon staggered back four steps, while White Crane Daoist was struck flying, blood spraying through the air.</p><p></p><p>"White Crane Daoist, quickly get up and use the Beanspray Soldier Formation to cover me."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen couldn't help shouting towards the prone White Crane Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Some people really are all talk, useless when it counts.</p><p></p><p>He raised his Dragon Slaying Sword again to attack the Five Penetrations Demon, fending off its flailing tentacles.</p><p></p><p>"But I don't know the Beanspray Soldier Formation."</p><p></p><p>"Then use your Fire Talisman Technique."</p><p></p><p>"This poor Daoist doesn't know that either."</p><p></p><p>"Dammit, if you don't know them, why did you dare ask me if I knew in the first place? You bastard, what do you actually know?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen felt a bit numb. This guy could brag even more than him.</p><p></p><p>"Does Searching Dragon Accupressure Point count?"</p><p></p><p>White Crane Daoist struggled to stand up.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen once again deflected the Five Penetrations Demon's tentacles, standing with sword in hand.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the limit of your ability, Oxnose?" The Five Penetrations Demon sneered, one tentacle scooping up the peachwood sword it had split in two earlier and stuffing it into its mouth to chew noisily, spitting sparks.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

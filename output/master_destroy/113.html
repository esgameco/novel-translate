        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Dawn gradually broke, the pale blue sky inlaid with a few remaining stars. The earth was hazy and dim, as if shrouded in a light gauze. </p><p></p><p>Yichen wore an inner robe with a Daoist robe draped over it. He gripped the railing, gazing into the distance towards the direction of the morning clouds tinged with red lotus hues. The morning breeze caused his draped robe to flutter slightly. No one knew what he was thinking at that moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the penetrating wound on his left shoulder caused by the Extremely Yin Transcendent had mostly healed. The pink granulation tissue had already filled the cavity, and in a day or two it would recover completely.</p><p></p><p>Seven days in the Longjiang Manor, so many things had happened, leaving Yichen full of profound reflections.</p><p></p><p>"Truly, the affairs of the world are like a game of chess, the future is unfathomable."  </p><p></p><p>"The mundane world is like a cage of thorns, the weak have no freedom."</p><p></p><p>"Among those who died in these seven days, what mistakes did they make? And among the survivors, what did they do to stay alive?"</p><p></p><p>"The vicissitudes of life are but duckweed battered by rain, the minor tribulations of fate scattered carelessly, too heavy a burden for ordinary people's lives to bear."</p><p></p><p>At this time, as the morning light grew brighter, the Longjiang Manor, which had suffered severe damage the previous night, was like a tenacious giant coming back to life.</p><p></p><p>On the streets, groups of two or three people began their day's labor - selling vegetables, buying vegetables, delivering goods.</p><p></p><p>They walked alone on the long streets, their faces numb.</p><p></p><p>Watching the masses of people below, observing their myriad appearances, Yichen suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>As he pondered the difficulties of ordinary people's lives, he did not know how the Transcendents viewed cultivators from their perspective.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that only grandmasters of the True Human Realm would be worthy of their attention.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Umbrella Woman and the Extremely Yin Transcendent he had killed, they were like ants to those beings.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have the assistance of a golden finger, coupled with my efforts. One day, I too will be able to touch that realm, perhaps even surpass it."</p><p></p><p>"To stand alongside the patriarchs of the righteous and demonic paths, within and beyond the realm of mountains and seas."</p><p></p><p>"And become one who commands the chessboard in this realm of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Yichen withdrew his large hand gripping the railing, his eyes shone with firm resolve, and he suddenly clenched his fist, causing a sonic boom to flash in the air.</p><p></p><p>An old farmer pushing a wheelbarrow full of vegetables passed under the railing and was startled. He looked up but saw no one above. A ten-tael silver ingot fell from the sky, landing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The old farmer was no longer afraid.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward decisively and stepped on the ingot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no one around at that moment, he carefully put the silver into the pocket of his clothes. After bowing towards the sky, he hurriedly pushed the small cart away.</p><p></p><p>A pleased smile appeared on the old farmer's face. With this ten taels, plus his previous savings, he could sell some charcoal from his ox cart during the winter and send his young grandson to study martial arts at the town's martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>In the current chaotic times, every bit of martial prowess meant an extra layer of security.</p><p></p><p>The one who threw the silver ingot was naturally Yichen.</p><p></p><p>On a whim, he had clenched his fist, startling someone, so he tossed down a silver ingot as an apology before leaving.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The rising sun broke through the mountains and rivers, revealing the vast expanse.</p><p></p><p>Today in Longjiang Manor, the azure sky was clear.</p><p></p><p>On the streets and alleys, many people were discussing the downfall of the Chen family that ruled Longjiang Manor.</p><p></p><p>The topic was quite lively.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to Yichen's expectations, he had thought that today Longjiang Manor would be in mourning, if not the entire city wailing, then at least lifeless.</p><p></p><p>But he had underestimated the resilience of the common people of Longjiang Manor.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Longjiang Manor was unexpectedly full of vitality today.</p><p></p><p>After eavesdropping carefully, Yichen finally learned part of the truth.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Qian Yueruhadtaken action.</p><p></p><p>After learning the truth the previous night, the enraged Qian Yuerucompletely uprooted the entire Chen family that ruled Longjiang Manor. The Chen family, which had accumulated wealth and power over hundreds of years, was scattered overnight.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family's collusion with demonic cults and evil forces was exposed, and they had no justification when confronted by Qian Yueruwhose father was a Transcendent of similar power.</p><p></p><p>When the strengths were equal, reason prevailed.</p><p></p><p>After Yichen's words of enlightenment, Qian Yueruhadachieved great awakening.</p><p></p><p>She reflected on herself last night.</p><p></p><p>"Have I been too courteous?"</p><p></p><p>"Have I been giving them face?"  </p><p></p><p>"Should I take action?"</p><p></p><p>The answer was a resounding yes.</p><p></p><p>So last night, Longjiang Manor was filled with rolling heads.</p><p></p><p>The Patrol Office fared a bit better, but the scene at the yamen gate was too horrific. Anyone with ties to the Chen family was taken into custody. After interrogation with truth-discerning spells, a mountain of incriminating evidence was uncovered that was too extensive to record.</p><p></p><p>When a whale falls, a thousand beings thrive.</p><p></p><p>With so many positions suddenly vacated, all the survivors felt that their lives had new prospects.</p><p></p><p>To make up for her oversight, it was said that Qian Yueruconvened local gentry and merchant leaders overnight, directly intervening to reduce land rents and miscellaneous taxes.</p><p></p><p>The process went remarkably smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was harmonious to an astonishing degree.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yuerusimply placed her crescent-bladed halberd on the table, while her subordinates set the documents before the crowd. The scene unfolded roughly as follows:</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, I'm in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>"Once I've spoken, who agrees and who disagrees?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blood-dripping halberd on the table, the remaining interest groups were as docile as chicks. If Qian Yueruhad said the sun was green, they would have nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "..."Madam Patrol Officer, you're really going for it.</p><p></p><p>A thought crossed his mind, and Yichen suddenly realized this was a highly skillful move. As the daughter of a Transcendent who had suffered such an insult, with the manor under her jurisdiction embroiled in such a debacle, venting was understandable.</p><p></p><p>If this dragged on, it would only become more difficult to resolve.</p><p></p><p>Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yichen couldn't help but admire this fierce woman. She was truly formidable, and as the daughter of a Transcendent, she could really play it this way.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Red Dust Inn.</p><p></p><p>AfterYi Chen had finished purchasing the necessary supplies, it was already past noon. He returned to the inn, planning to eat after which he would bid farewell to Qian Yue Ru and then leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Old Master Shen was sitting across from Yi Chen and brought over another wooden box. </p><p></p><p>No other than a bribe.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, money had come too easily for him, feeling a bit hot to handle.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Shen, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>"Daoist master, I must give you an offering. Last time was from my mother, this time is from me, a small token of gratitude."</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Shen, it's not easy for you either. Since your mother already made an offering last time, this time I'll give you a divination." Yi Chen thought for a moment and decided to find another excuse to accept the money.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Shen, what is your full name?" Yi Chen asked.</p><p></p><p>"I dare not call myself Old Master Shen, Daoist master can address me as Shen Yi Shi."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......" My friend, this name is quite unsuitable. I fear you may self-immolate, performing the melody of Guangling Scattered Sheets, then playing for the Lady Dai Yuniang.</p><p></p><p>"This name is no good, let's change it to Shen Wan San."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you eight more words: 'Don't overdo it, bravely retreat from the rushing currents!'"</p><p></p><p>"This way you can avoid unforeseen disasters."</p><p></p><p>After tearfully earning another ten small yellow croakers, Yi Chen turned and left the Red Dust Inn, heading towards the direction of the Zhen'an Magistrate's Office.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that after he left, Old Master Shen instructed his attendants to seal off the Sky Character Number One room that Yi Chen had stayed in and not allow anyone else to use it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Old Master Shen had already calculated in his mind that he would find ten or eight storytellers to spread day and night to the world about Yi Chen's great deeds and accomplishments in Longjiang Prefecture. Of course, the key point of the story must be emphasized - that Daoist Master Yi had previously stayed in the Sky Character Number One room at the Red Dust Inn.  </p><p></p><p>Starting from today, the Red Dust Inn will raise its prices!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Top floor of the Julong Vegetarian Hall.</p><p></p><p>On a rectangular table about five meters long, there were over a hundred dishes laid out.</p><p></p><p>Just like seven days ago.</p><p></p><p>No vegetarian dishes, all meat dishes.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master, leaving in such a hurry? I've been too busy these past couple days. Why don't you stay a few more days and let me, Qian Yue Ru, fully extend my hospitality as the host?"</p><p></p><p>Across the long table, Qian Yue Ru was deftly gnawing on the forearm of some ferocious beast that Yi Chen didn't recognize, her iron teeth like steel as she chewed it like sugarcane.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yue Ru's state was much better than last night, her eyes had regained their luster, and the oppressive aura around her had grown somewhat stronger.</p><p></p><p>If one word had to be used to describe her current state, it would be "enlightened" - she had half crossed over into the True Human realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this pauper has urgent matters to attend to and cannot linger to drink and chat with my Dao friend."</p><p></p><p>"I observe that my friend's aura seems to have gained new insights, already with one foot in the True Human realm. Truly cause for celebration."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Yi Chen's words, Qian Yue Ru put down the forearm, sighed and said resentfully, "But having just one foot in is still not the same as fully breaking through. Still not as accomplished as my friend."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the True Human realm has nine levels that must be traversed before one can begin comprehending the Dao and approach the True Lord realm. What my friend said so lightly yesterday, I don't know what year or month I'll be able to catch up to my father."</p><p></p><p>"It's all my father's fault for bathing me in kilin blood when I was young. Otherwise, with my cultivation, I should already be in the True Human realm by now."</p><p></p><p>Case cracked, case cracked. Now Yi Chen knew why Qian Yue Ru's physique was so terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>So this was the saturated support from her True Lord father?</p><p></p><p>But it was still a bit inferior to his own hard-won Immortal Body.</p><p></p><p>After all, even a physique nurtured by such a supreme heavenly treasure could not surpass the profound foundations of his body cultivated through bitter practice.</p><p></p><p>After another round of pleasantries, the two human-shaped ferocious beasts began showing off their eating prowess, instantly turning the dining table into a battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Half a shi'chen later, the long table was broken, cups and plates were in disarray - the battle was intense.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yi Chen still emerged victorious in eating capacity.</p><p></p><p>After the meal.</p><p></p><p>It was now almost the shen hour (3-5pm).</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master, with this parting, I don't know when we'll be able to meet again," Qian Yue Ru raised her head, her elegant yet powerful features tilted up as she gracefully took a pristine cloth napkin to wipe the oil from the corners of her mouth, saying regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, we'll meet again the next time we meet," Yi Chen laughed heartily, immediately displaying his mastery of tautological literature.</p><p></p><p>"Dao friend Qian, mountains and waters will bring us together again."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the three thousand taels of gold."</p><p></p><p>Having finished his meal, the Daoist master spoke forthrightly. He straightened his robe, patted the hem, turned his back to Qian Yue Ru and waved his hand in farewell.</p><p></p><p>When Yi Chen had walked halfway out, Qian Yue Ru suddenly called out loudly, "Daoist Master, are we friends now?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we're friends now," Yi Chen turned back with a smile, revealing eight big white teeth in a bright, cheerful grin.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was about to exit the city gates, he happened to encounter an old acquaintance - Mo Yu was leading a boy and girl Yi Chen didn't recognize.</p><p></p><p>After some conversation, he learned that yesterday he had a fortuitous escape - it wasn't his turn on the sacrificial altar to have his blood drained when the blood sacrifice ritual was completed. Qian Yue Ru had also arrived quite timely, so he narrowly escaped with his life, though severely injured and needing a period of recuperation.</p><p></p><p>After listening to Mo Bai Hu's account, Yi Chen's mood improved further.</p><p></p><p>At the city gates of Longjiang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Under the fading sunset glow, a Daoist began his long journey.</p><p></p><p>A large black cat perched on the Daoist's shoulder, looking gloomy.</p><p></p><p>As if reluctant to part from its 'good friend'.</p><p></p><p>Word limit control, 3199 haha.</p><p></p><p>Today's chapter had more daily life content, I deliberately removed a few words to save one coin.</p><p></p><p>For Mo Bai Hu and Chibi Maruko, I thought about it and decided not to kill them off, leaving some imagination. It would create more dramatic tension to directly kill them off, but since this is a light-hearted story, there's no need.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

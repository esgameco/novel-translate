        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen did not choose to use the tactic of adding fuel to the fire, burning three to five years of his lifespan to probe, but instead, with his first move, he directly maxed out the effect of the Soul Ignition Transformation. </p><p></p><p>The effect of the Soul Ignition Transformation was gradually increasing.</p><p></p><p>To deal with a formidable enemy like the 'Black Robe', he had to put all his cards on the table, completely draining every ounce of his internal energy, only then would he have a better chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his face was as cold as ice, his body like a beast. </p><p></p><p>Although his body was like a scorching volcano about to erupt, his mind was crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting. </p><p>Waiting for an opportunity to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Hundred Step Divine Fist!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out a roar, his entire body dragging a deep purple flame tail, rapidly charging towards the Black Robe's direction.</p><p></p><p>The scorching deep purple pure yang inner energy actually scorched the land along the way, turning it slightly charred.</p><p></p><p>In a brief moment, he arrived in front of the Black Robe, and with the huge inertia, he delivered a straight forward kick, his leg wrapped in deep purple flame energy, which suddenly swelled even more as it approached, rolling towards the Black Robe.</p><p></p><p>Is it reasonable to use the Hundred Step Divine Fist with the legs? It is very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>After all, the legs are not only longer but also stronger than the fists.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Black Robe's face showed a surprised expression for the first time, and he let out a light laugh:</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the disciple I took a liking to, you always manage to surprise me with something new."</p><p></p><p>"Let your master teach you what true combat is!"</p><p></p><p>As the Black Robe finished speaking, three great spells instantly descended, and three rings of golden light enveloped his body.</p><p></p><p>"Edict: Divine Force"</p><p>"Edict: Tenacity" </p><p>"Edict: Adamantine"</p><p></p><p>He lightly waved his arms to meet Yi Chen's forward kick and shouted fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, brute force alone cannot lead to the great path."</p><p></p><p>"You have taken the wrong path."</p><p></p><p>"Turn back to the shore!"</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, their fists and legs collided violently.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of impact, the Black Robe's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>A force far exceeding his imagination assaulted him.</p><p></p><p>He had underestimated Yi Chen and chose to confront his attack head-on instead of dodging, intending to defeat him in his area of expertise and completely shatter his confidence.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Yi Chen had given him a slight shock, knocking him flying away.</p><p></p><p>"Edict: Hover"</p><p></p><p>Another golden light enveloped his body, allowing the Black Robe to barely stabilize his form and avoid embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>This time, he showed a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang Combustion, Dragon and Elephant Immense Force"</p><p></p><p>"To produce yang flames with your physical body, disciple, are you born with a precious body?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Dragon and Tiger Body or the Underworld Divine Body? No, it doesn't seem like it, could it be some other body quality I'm unaware of?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, disciple, with such talent, you should join my sect!"</p><p></p><p>"If you further cultivate my Word Spirit Secret Art and bring your precious body to its peak, where in this world could you not go?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you encounter a True Lord who has pushed their cultivation to the pinnacle of Refining Spirit and Reversing Emptiness, walking the path of enlightenment, you would still be able to exchange a few moves with them."</p><p></p><p>The Black Robe laughed heartily while stroking his palms.</p><p></p><p>"You're talking nonsense, what precious body, I've never heard of such a thing."</p><p></p><p>"My strength comes from my own efforts!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yi Chen immediately refuted him fiercely.</p><p></p><p>His strength was gained through his own efforts, what did it have to do with a precious body?</p><p></p><p>He had exploded fish day after day until his head was numb, but now that his physical body had reached this level, even if he continued exploding fish, he wouldn't gain much further improvement.</p><p></p><p>His next step was to stew himself in an iron pot.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the result of his own efforts?</p><p></p><p>Who had seen him setting off depth charges in the Crashing Dragon Pool at three or five in the morning?</p><p></p><p>Without further words to the Black Robe, he once again channeled his deep purple pure yang inner energy and charged towards the Black Robe, this time truly engaging in fist combat.</p><p></p><p>The Black Robe's expression turned solemn, his face showing a serious look.</p><p></p><p>"Edict: Divine Force"</p><p>"Edict: Quake"</p><p>"Edict: Bind"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, an incomparable pressure descended upon Yi Chen, as if a great mountain was weighing down on his back.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not gain any advantage, but was instead shaken back by the Black Robe's counterattack, retreating several steps.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was like carrying the weight of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>The endless pressure seemed to want to crush him.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's entire body was trembling.</p><p></p><p>Tiny bleeding points the size of needle tips began to appear on Yi Chen's body, oozing out droplets of blood the size of pinheads.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these droplets appeared, they merged into the scorching pure yang inner energy.</p><p></p><p>This was like adding fierce fire oil to the flames, causing the deep purple pure yang inner energy to accelerate its circulation once more.</p><p></p><p>As the droplets of blood seeped out, a faint azure color appeared within the already deep purple, seemingly impenetrable inner energy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the effect of the Soul Ignition Transformation also reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>Borrowing the reckless combustion, Yi Chen was able to temporarily catch a glimpse of the path ahead, the eighth level of the Pure Yang True Technique.</p><p></p><p>Pure Yang True Technique Eighth Level: Violet Extreme Births Azure.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of this faint azure inner energy was like a signal, and the azure inner energy swept around him.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's ears seemed to hear the sound of shattering glass, and the invisible pressure that had bound him instantly vanished, burned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>His back straightened like a javelin once more.</p><p></p><p>Even Yi Chen himself had not expected that under the pressure of life and death, his reckless combustion would allow him to briefly glimpse the path ahead.</p><p></p><p>He showed an excited expression and charged towards the Black Robe again.</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p>"Hit me!"</p><p>"Hit me to death!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Black Robe's expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if it weren't for this worn-out body..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>"An object cannot fully unleash the power it should have when its spirit is divided. How could the restraints fail to work?"</p><p></p><p>His expression showed a hint of thin anger, and he angrily said: </p><p></p><p>"You're courting death yourself, so don't blame your master for being ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>"Command: Divine Force"</p><p>"Command: Tenacity" </p><p>"Command: Adamantine"</p><p>"Command: Shockwave"</p><p></p><p>Four golden lights instantly descended upon him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This time, as soon as their fists made contact, a visible shockwave rippled out with their fists as the center. </p><p></p><p>The surrounding people like Master Shuiyue who were restrained instantly went deaf, and several of them passed out.</p><p></p><p>Countless plants and dust were swept into the air by the whirlwind from their exchange.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p></p><p>The two traded innumerable strikes in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Yidian was covered in blood, surrounded by thick bloody vapors. As soon as the vapors appeared, they were slowly drawn into his pale blue pure yang inner energy and burned as nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Every punch was life-threatening, every moment was like walking a tightrope.</p><p></p><p>Yidian's will became increasingly crystalline in this life-and-death tempering, just like a piece of pig iron having its impurities removed by heavy blows.</p><p></p><p>Reborn.</p><p></p><p>His aura grew faint, but his gaze became brighter.</p><p></p><p>Having wrung out all the strength from his muscles, he could only keep punching by sheer force of will as he fought the 'Black Robe'.</p><p></p><p>His fists were covered in gashes, deep enough to see bone.</p><p></p><p>These were from his life-and-death struggle against the Black Robe.</p><p></p><p>He had pounded through the calluses, through flesh, and was now hitting bone.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hold on any longer.</p><p></p><p>Was he going to die?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>I've provided a full translation of the excerpt into English, being careful not to reproduce any copyrighted material verbatim.

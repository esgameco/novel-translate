        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Yichen gripped the red scissors on the ground in his hand, and two streams of information suddenly appeared on his retina.</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the White-Robed Female Ghost Red Scissors, gaining 40 deep red points.]  </p><p></p><p>[Contact with a special item, deep red point quantity +20]</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, what a pity."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt speechless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The black robe and that separated spiritual body of the Yan Zhenren were not demonic spirits, so they did not "drop money". The only good news was that the red scissors in front of him, like the firewood knife of the corpse ghost before, also contributed 20 deep red points to him.</p><p></p><p>Yichen casually tore off a strip of cloth from his body and wrapped his left palm, which was almost exposed to the white bone, round and round.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the whole process, he remained silent, enduring the excruciating pain, very manly.</p><p></p><p>The motto of his previous life was:</p><p></p><p>In one's life, apart from life and death, everything else is just a scratch.</p><p></p><p>A pure man, like a lone wolf, licks his own wounds when hurt, and gets used to the pain after a while.</p><p></p><p>Showing your weakness not only makes you effeminate, but also gives others the right to hurt you.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>A man must be vigorous!</p><p></p><p>Daoist Yi had profound insights into this.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with his injuries, Yichen looked around.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a jade box caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>With the eagle-eye vision enhanced by the Yin-Yang Cave Divine Pupil Technique, he discovered that a jade box was quietly lying on its side among the piles of loaches in the crevice far away.</p><p></p><p>Yichen walked quickly to the crevice. By now, the crevice in the ground was no longer emitting black gas, and the area around the crevice was covered in mud and water stains. A baby's left arm, like a lotus root segment, lay in the muddy water. Nearby were an overturned jade box and a jade of emerald green color.</p><p></p><p>Yichen drew the Dragon Slaying Sword, intending to pick up the emerald green jade from the muddy water.</p><p></p><p>Then, he happily started playing with it.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this broken thing is electrified."</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly cut off the convulsions of his body with his willpower and broke free.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Slaying Sword was even thrown onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to curse loudly, he suddenly stopped his action.</p><p></p><p>The decimal places after the decimal point of the source points on the virtual panel had directly increased by 0.001.</p><p></p><p>Wow, electrotherapy?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a bold idea emerged from his mind.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he didn't need to stew himself in an iron pot anymore.</p><p></p><p>If he directly electrotherapized himself, wouldn't that be a major event?</p><p></p><p>Touch the electric door and electrify yourself once, that's 0.001.</p><p></p><p>Touch the electric door and electrify yourself ten times, that's 0.01.</p><p></p><p>Touch the electric door and electrify yourself a hundred times, that's 0.1.</p><p></p><p>Touch the electric door and electrify yourself a thousand times, even the King of Hell would praise me for my good health.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yichen looked at the emerald green jade on the ground with shining eyes, as if he were looking at a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>No, it was simply a source point treasury.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yichen's depression from not harvesting enough deep red points in this battle vanished.</p><p></p><p>Deep red is daddy, but isn't the source point also daddy?</p><p></p><p>Although any way of stimulating the body would eventually produce resistance, leading to diminishing returns later on, but for such an intense operation as electrocution, this resistance ceiling must be extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Based on his previous experience, Yichen conservatively estimated that if he made good use of it, he could probably gain forty or fifty source points in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Damn, what a loss on one side and gain on the other.</p><p></p><p>If I torture myself again, I won't be human anymore.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for nature's gift!</p><p></p><p>Source point, let me see your limit!</p><p></p><p>After experimenting, Yichen found that wrapping the jade in several layers of cloth could insulate the electric discharge from the emerald green jade. Without hesitation, he tore off a large piece from the hem of Qingxu Daoren's Daoist robe, wrapped the emerald green jade in three layers inside and three layers outside, and put it in his arms.</p><p></p><p>Since he did owe the three Qingxu Daoists a life debt, tearing off a few inches of their clothes was reasonable, right?</p><p></p><p>This way, he would also be cooler.</p><p></p><p>As for the baby's left arm lying on the ground, like a lotus root segment, Yichen had already put it into the jade box and sealed it again with animal skin talisman slips.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he already had a rough idea of how to deal with this jade box.</p><p></p><p>After simply explaining to the County Master at the county office, Yichen hired four horse carriages to collectively transport the four lying people back to the Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The next day, at sunrise, the great sun shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>In the front courtyard of the Hidden Dragon Monastery, the courtyard gate was wide open.</p><p></p><p>Yichen and Lin Baihu were sitting inside drinking tea, with various fruits, candies, and snacks placed on the table.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Baihu did not touch any of them, only occasionally peeling and eating the chestnuts in front of him. From time to time, he would raise his head to glance at the tall Daoist in front of him, his gaze a bit unfocused and his expression carrying a hint of shame.</p><p></p><p>After all, yesterday they were all rescued by Yichen. Although his cultivation was deeper than that of Shui Yue and the others, he had already woken up yesterday and sent a secret message to the County Security Chief using secret methods.</p><p></p><p>As for Shui Yue and the other three, they were still asleep until now, probably because the separated spiritual body of the Great Protector had sealed their bodies and spiritual powers with secret spells. After being violently shaken by Yichen's intense battle, they suffered slight cerebral concussions and needed some time to recover.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Great Protector's separated spiritual body was skilled in myriad secret spells, and without spiritual defenses, they were not much stronger than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared on the distant horizon, slowly approaching from afar.</p><p></p><p>This person was also wearing a fish robe, but it looked much more magnificent than the one worn by Lin Baihu, with different animal patterns on the chest.</p><p></p><p>Though his pace was not fast, he could cover more than ten meters in the blink of an eye. Soon, this person floated into the Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>This portly, middle-aged man resembling a wealthy gentleman was none other than the County Security Chief of Ping'an County.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The eldest, who was also Lin Zhengyi's father - Lin Zhenbei. </p><p></p><p>His cultivation level was at the initial stage of refining qi into spirit.</p><p></p><p>Just yesterday during their casual chat, Yi Chen learned that Lin Baihu was only twenty years old, just a bit...mature for his age?</p><p></p><p>God knows how shocked Yi Chen was upon learning this news, it made him understand Lin Baihu's previous choice a little more.</p><p></p><p>After all, youthful passion, it's normal for young people to be impulsive.  </p><p></p><p>"This robust Daoist priest must be the renowned Yichengzi Daoist priest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei smiled first and cupped his hands towards Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"I must first express my gratitude to the Daoist priest for saving my son's life."  </p><p></p><p>"I don't know why you had my son secretly summon me here using secret methods, what important matter is there?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen also smiled and returned the courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"I came to rescue the great Lord Qianhu."</p><p></p><p>"Rescue me? What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"The Corpse Demon Sect has caused such chaos, the entire Ping'an County is in turmoil. Qianhu, you have committed grave sins."</p><p></p><p>"Now, even the left arm of the Wan Hua Zhenjun has been awakened by the Corpse Demon Sect. Tell me, what kind of storm would it cause if this news reached the ears of your deputy, that other great Lord Qianhu?"</p><p></p><p>"Dismissal? Investigation?"  </p><p></p><p>"Your life's work going down the drain?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei's smile faded. "The Daoist priest might as well speak more directly."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was unhurried, first brewing a cup of clear tea for Lin Qianhu, before slowly saying:</p><p></p><p>"I felt an instant connection with your son and deeply admire Lin Baihu's character."</p><p></p><p>"To judge the father by the son, Qianhu must also be a kind-hearted person. From the bottom of my heart, I do not wish to see such a situation occur."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I want to make a deal with you, Qianhu."</p><p></p><p>"Blessings do not rely on misfortune, misfortune does not hide blessings. I know there is another version of this incident."  </p><p></p><p>"There is only one truth."</p><p></p><p>"That is, Qianhu had already seen through the Corpse Demon Sect's plot. With meticulous planning, achieving absolute victory, setting a stratagem to counter their ploy, you dispatched your son carrying a powerful secret treasure deep into my Fengyun County, joining forces with the local righteous heroes to completely crush the villains' scheme, reclaiming the left arm of Wan Hua Zhenjun."</p><p></p><p>"Qianhu, such wisdom."  </p><p></p><p>"Lin Baihu, such courage."</p><p></p><p>"In this way, the dilemma resolves itself."</p><p></p><p>"What does Qianhu think?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu, who was present, was dumbstruck. In his twenty years of life, this was the first time he had witnessed such outrageous wordsmithing.</p><p></p><p>This art form could choke Lin Baihu to death - even being beaten to death, he could never come up with such a play on words.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was no change in Lin Zhenbei's expression. Having lived for decades, he naturally knew that everything came at a price.</p><p></p><p>"Then what is the price, Daoist priest?" Lin Zhenbei asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I want a treasure, a treasure that matches the value of this deed."</p><p></p><p>"Qianhu, a parent's love for their child means making plans for the far future."</p><p></p><p>"You don't want Lin Baihu to be unable to make rapid progress, do you?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want Lin Baihu to become a hero, or a little Baihu whose father was dismissed and investigated?"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, his future path would become much more difficult."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen smiled and took another sip of the clear tea.</p><p></p><p>The fragrance of tea wafted, blossoming in his mouth - it was a superior quality tea, pre-rain Longjing.</p><p></p><p>And Yi Chen's purpose for setting up today's scheme was also very clear.</p><p></p><p>The left arm of Wan Hua Zhenjun was a hot potato that Yi Chen could not handle. The Zhen'an Office of the Great Yue Kingdom would definitely be able to handle it.</p><p></p><p>So it would be more practical to exchange it for a treasure he could use.</p><p></p><p>Don't ask, anyway the Corpse Demon Sect people are all dead. If you ask, it was an imperial court scheme that we few small fries helped carry out. My Yinlong Monastery only has a few people, how could we have pulled off stopping the Corpse Demon Sect's plot?</p><p></p><p>What? You're asking how the Zhen'an Office of Ping'an County knew about the Corpse Demon Sect's plot?</p><p></p><p>I don't know, this is a grand imperial court scheme. How would a small rural Daoist like me understand this? I just randomly helped out a bit. The main burden still falls on the Zhen'an Office's Lin Baihu to shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Amidst all the gains and losses, Yi Chen could see it all as clearly as the lines on his palm.</p><p></p><p>His small Yinlong Monastery could not withstand the Corpse Demon Sect's retaliation.  </p><p></p><p>Having the left arm of Wan Hua Zhenjun was useless - it couldn't be eaten, worn or used to increase his strength. Instead, it would make him a target for the Corpse Demon Sect. Only a fool would want such a calamity.</p><p></p><p>This was a disaster waiting to happen, playing with fire could lead to the destruction of his entire monastery.</p><p></p><p>But if it was said that the county's Zhen'an Office had masterminded the whole scheme, then it would be very reasonable. The Zhen'an Office caused the trouble, so the item ended up in their hands. Corpse Demon Sect, go pick a fight with the Great Yue Kingdom's Zhen'an Office instead.</p><p></p><p>A truly intelligent person would do things like making others take the blame while also giving him benefits, and even having them thank him on top of that.</p><p></p><p>At that time, everyone would be in the same boat. He gets a treasure, Lin Baihu progresses, Lin Baihu wins and he also wins - it's a wonderful thing.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Yinlong Monastery's development could also gain the friendship and secret support of Ping'an County's Zhen'an Office.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Yi Chen couldn't help but secretly give himself a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>"Old man's subtle scheming is still as dashing as ever."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that in my past life, while I succeeded in the techniques, I didn't expect that bunch of bastards to be so unrighteous, directly hitting me with a mud truck."</p><p></p><p>Fellow powerful male Daoists, today there are two big chapters together totaling six thousand words. New book periods for peers are four thousand words, but these two chapters are connected, so splitting them would greatly diminish the reading experience. Thus, I'm posting them together.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for your votes of support and for following along. I'm very grateful.</p><p></p><p>Everyone, good night. I'll give a unified thanks tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

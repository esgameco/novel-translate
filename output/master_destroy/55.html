        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Night of the full moon.</p><p></p><p>East of the Hidden Dragon Monastery, countless twenty-six thousand miles away, across mountains and rivers, in the midst of a deep black mountain range, countless twisted black trees grew intertwined, gnarled and connected, with innumerable black strange birds nesting upon them. </p><p></p><p>These bizarre black trees were leafless, yet countless air roots hung down from the branches, appearing increasingly gloomy and terrifying under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, among these black trees, one towering black tree was the most conspicuous. </p><p></p><p>It was a dead black tree without a crown, as if its head had been chopped off, with withered branches grotesquely twisted outward on both sides, like outstretched arms.</p><p></p><p>At the base of this tree was a fissure of unknown depth.</p><p></p><p>Following this winding fissure downwards revealed an enormous churning blood lake, with bubbles constantly gurgling up from its surface, the pungent stench of blood congealing in the air.</p><p></p><p>A young Taoist priest in a blood-red robe sat cross-legged with closed eyes beside the blood lake.  </p><p></p><p>Rustle, rustle.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, a mysterious tall figure wearing a black hood approached, leaving deep footprints in the soft earth. His arrival provoked the ferocity of the black strange birds nesting in the trees.</p><p></p><p>Countless black strange birds flapped their wings, opened their crimson eyes and flew towards him, but the mysterious man's fists, as big as cooking pots, pummeled them all into meat puree with one punch each.</p><p></p><p>He came to the side of the headless strange tree, glanced at the deep fissure, and without blinking an eye, leapt down. Behind him were countless bird corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Your humble servant greets the Great Dharma Protector."</p><p>"Following the Immortal of Eternal Life, saving the world with great compassion."</p><p></p><p>The mysterious man came to the side of the blood-robed Taoist and knelt down like a mountain of gold toppling over.</p><p></p><p>"Rise. Into whose hands has the left arm of the Immortal of Eternal Life now fallen? Who has ruined the good deeds of our sect?"</p><p></p><p>A wrathful shockwave suddenly manifested, echoing through the entire underground, shaking loose rock debris that fell into the blood lake, raising bloody blossoms.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Great Dharma Protector's furious voice, the previously overbearing mysterious man who had slaughtered the black strange birds could not help but tremble, and hastily responded:</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Great Dharma Protector, our undercover agents in the Zhen'an Ministry have relayed this message to us. We have fallen into the Zhen'an Ministry's trap."</p><p></p><p>"Our movements in FengYun County were already known to the Zhen'an Ministry. They deceived us, turning our plans against us. They let us summon the left arm of the Immortal of Eternal Life, only to seize it from us."</p><p></p><p>A flash of light gleamed in the blood-robed Taoist's eyes. After pondering for a moment, he said:</p><p></p><p>"I feel there is something amiss about this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Baxiaonji, I leave this matter to you."  </p><p></p><p>"You shall toil, travel to Fengyu County and uncover the truth. If it is indeed a trap set by the Zhen'an Ministry, so be it. But if someone has sabotaged the good deeds of our sect, you know what to do."</p><p></p><p>"I accept the Great Dharma Protector's decree," the mysterious man responded loudly. He pulled down his hood, revealing a giant chicken head under the light provided by the night-illuminating pearl.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious man had a human body with a chicken head!</p><p></p><p>Red beak, black feathers, a green fleshy crest on top of his head, two white lines winding down from his shoulders to his waist. His entire body was knotted with bulging muscles, as if each muscle had gone through puberty on its own. His fists could crush a person, his arms could outrun a horse.</p><p></p><p>The chicken-headed man fiercely made a fist salute, abruptly stood up, turned and left briskly.</p><p></p><p>After the chicken-headed man departed, the blood-robed Taoist waved his left hand, and a small crystal coffin slowly rose from the blood lake, containing the body and two legs of an infant.</p><p></p><p>The blood-robed Taoist let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the True Lord's left arm has fallen into the hands of the Zhen'an Ministry. This matter has become difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Time is running out."</p><p></p><p>The blood-robed Taoist's gaze fell upon the crystal coffin, a fleeting look of greed flashing in his eyes. Then, with a wave of his large hand, the crystal coffin slowly sank back into the blood lake.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, it was already late morning when Yi Chen finally lazily got out of bed.</p><p></p><p>Little Meow quietly lay at the head of his bed. It liked the scent of Yi Chen's pure yang energy and insisted on staying by his side at night. Unable to dissuade it, Yi Chen had let it be.</p><p></p><p>After introducing Little Meow to Qing Yun Zi and the others, Yi Chen let Qing Feng and Ming Yue take Little Meow to play. He had something to discuss with Qing Yun Zi.</p><p></p><p>"What? Expanding the Taoist monastery?"</p><p>"Taking in more children?" Qing Yun Zi looked at Yi Chen in surprise. "Master Brother, where will we get enough silver for that?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With a magician's sleight of hand, Yi Chen took out three thousand taels of silver notes from his pocket and handed them to Qing Yunzi, instantly shocking Qing Yunzi speechless.  </p><p></p><p>He knew Yi Chen had earned a lot of silver notes, but he didn't expect it to be this much.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, his gaze became strange. </p><p></p><p>What industry has the senior martial brother enabled again? How did he suddenly earn so many silver notes?</p><p></p><p>Soon, a smack landed on his head.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you look at your senior martial brother with that kind of gaze? These silver notes were earned by your senior martial brother through his own skills."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen rapped on the table: "Martial brother, the matter of expanding the Taoist temple will be handed over to you. Hiring workers, supervising quality and such, you will be in charge of it all. Don't be afraid to spend money, go all out."  </p><p></p><p>"After the expansion of the Taoist temple is completed, go find Constable Zhang and tell him you want to recruit a few orphans of good family background into our Hidden Dragon Temple. He will help you."</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, I'm afraid I can't do it well. Why don't you do it instead?" Qing Yunzi instinctively shrank back a little.</p><p></p><p>"If you can't do it well, learn by doing it. Who was born knowing everything? Be bold and do it. If you make mistakes, your senior brother will be behind you," Yi Chen waved his hand decisively, leaving no room for objection.</p><p></p><p>This was a decision he had pondered over carefully.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi and the others could not always live under his wing; they had to step out and gain experience.</p><p></p><p>How could the future master of the Hidden Dragon Temple be someone ignorant of worldly affairs? Entrusting him with the expansion of the Taoist temple was the first step in tempering him.</p><p></p><p>It might cost some tuition fees, spend some more silver notes, and result in some stumbles, but it would all be worth it.</p><p></p><p>Suffering losses is not scary; what's scary is not knowing where the losses lie. With Qing Yunzi's intelligence, Yi Chen believed he would understand.</p><p></p><p>Such tempering, interacting with people from all walks of life, would also benefit Qing Yunzi's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating to break through realms in this realm had certain requirements for the state of mind.</p><p></p><p>One of the requirements for spiritual awakening is to understand one's mind and see one's nature. As one advances to higher realms later, the requirements for the mind will also be higher.</p><p></p><p>Even in cultivation, one cannot find an old forest or a small hut to hide in like a cat, oblivious to the changing seasons.</p><p></p><p>Retreating from the world, thinking one is detached from all dharmas and transcendent, is actually walking the evil path.</p><p></p><p>How can the mind become strong without experiencing tempering?</p><p>How can one know beauty without seeing ugliness?</p><p>How can one claim to have transcended the world without having been in the world?</p><p></p><p>All great cultivators and masters must have first been in the world before transcending it. There are none who became great by bitterly cultivating in one place like a cat.</p><p></p><p>The elite disciples of major sects and clans would all go out and experience the world, using their personal experiences as nourishment to strengthen their minds.</p><p></p><p>Reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles.</p><p>What is learned from books always seems shallow; to truly understand, one must experience it personally. This is the principle.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Yi Chen took over as the abbot of the Hidden Dragon Temple, after a series of events, Qing Yunzi had become a bit too reliant on him.</p><p></p><p>This was not a good sign.</p><p></p><p>Relying on mountains, the mountains will crumble. Relying on people, people will fall. One must learn to be self-reliant.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered the look of astonishment and dread on the face of the Corpse Sect's Yan Zhenren when he saw the mark of the Underworld on Yi Chen's body during their fierce battle of separated spirits.</p><p></p><p>A separated spirit almost forced the current Yi Chen into a desperate situation. Such a formidable figure dreaded and avoided the Underworld at all costs. This made Yi Chen's sense of crisis towards the Underworld rise another level.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head that could drop at any moment, who would willingly endure such torment every day?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the threat of the Underworld, Yi Chen would never dare to put himself through such harsh training.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, if you don't push yourself, you won't know your true potential.</p><p></p><p>Now, through bitter cultivation with the Thunder-Taming Jade every day, Yi Chen could gain one Origin Point roughly every two days, far more efficient than the ancient explosive fishing period.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of the threat of death, he dared not slack off for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After arranging everything, Yi Chen exhaled a breath of turbid air, just about to steal a brief respite from the mundane world, when a rider came from afar - it was none other than Lin Zhengyi, the County Magistrate Lin Bai Hu.</p><p></p><p>"Taoist Master, the old Madam of the Wang family will likely pass away in the next couple of days. Would you be available to come to the county town tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>Having just spent three thousand taels and needing to find ways to make money, Yi Chen immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Magistrate Bai. I will set off early tomorrow morning and will not miss the appointed time."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

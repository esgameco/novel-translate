        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day, the sky was clear and the gentle breeze was refreshing. </p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei and Lin Baihu arrived as promised.</p><p></p><p>In the back courtyard of Yinlong Temple, in Yichen's room, the three met.</p><p></p><p>The room was dim, with the doors and windows tightly shut. Even Qingyunzi was on guard outside.</p><p></p><p>"Did you bring the goods?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course." Lin Zhenbei patted a tightly sealed small box by his side.</p><p></p><p>In this cultivation world, there were naturally storage rings or special storage spaces with storage abilities. </p><p></p><p>But such treasures were without exception in the hands of great masters or their descendants. Lin Zhenbei's level was not high enough for such treasures, so he still used physical transportation.</p><p></p><p>As for Yichen, storage devices were like ghosts from his previous life - he had only heard of them but never seen one.</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei opened the small wooden box, revealing an egg with a deep blue base but crisscrossed with purple and red patterns on its shell.</p><p></p><p>This egg was indeed extraordinary. As soon as the box opened, a scorching aura rippled out.</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist priest has seen the spirit beast egg. Where's the payment?" Lin Baihu quickly closed the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't worry Baihu, this poor Daoist has always been steady in his work." Yichen smiled, put on a pair of intestine gloves, and pulled out an exquisitely shaped large...bedpan? from under the bed as if performing a magic trick.</p><p></p><p>He reached into the 'bedpan' and took out a jade box, placing it on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look, Baihu."</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei: "......"  </p><p>Lin Baihu: "......"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry Baihu, this thing looks like a bedpan and is shaped like one, but it's not actually a bedpan. It's a disguise, as you know, this poor Daoist has always been steady in his work," Yichen explained calmly when he saw their strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Lin Zhenbei's mouth twitched, as if he could barely hold it in.</p><p></p><p>Who made this vulgar thing? Just looking at it was disgusting. How could a normal person hide things like this?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, disgusting, isn't it? Revolting, right? I had a skilled craftsman custom-make this for me before," Yichen said proudly, puffing out his chest.</p><p></p><p>"......."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you're a cautious one," Lin Baihu said word by word, his expression like a judge who had eaten a nine-turn large intestine dish.</p><p></p><p>Yichen tore off part of the talisman seal on the jade box, revealing a baby's arm as thick as a lotus root lying inside.</p><p></p><p>However, Yichen was surprised to find that the severed end of the baby's arm now had thin tendrils like tentacles growing out of it...which definitely weren't there last night.</p><p></p><p>Damn, could this be because I took away the Thunder-Subduing Jade?</p><p></p><p>Is this thing going to turn into a Qilin Arm?</p><p></p><p>The tiny tendrils growing from the severed end of the arm made Yichen's heart skip a beat. After eight hundred years of decay, it still had such vitality - how terrifying was this physical body?</p><p></p><p>Damn, just take it away. This is the root of disaster.</p><p></p><p>Yichen didn't want to release something like a parasitic beast. It was better to trust the wisdom of the imperial court. Surely they could handle it properly. After all, the Patrol Bureau had countless experts who had searched far and wide for so many years, so there must be innumerable treasure masters as well.</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei was a formidable figure, so he naturally noticed the fleeting change in Yichen's expression.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist priest, you didn't secretly take anything else from the jade box, did you?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu felt exhausted at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Baihu, how could you think that of me, the Infinite Heavenly Venerable of Bountiful Blessings?"</p><p></p><p>Yichen immediately denied it. "I'm just always shocked that after hundreds of years of suppression and decay, this thing still has such tenacious vitality."</p><p></p><p>"That Wanhua Zhenjun from back then was truly a prodigious genius."</p><p></p><p>"Are you really sure you didn't take anything, Daoist priest?" Lin Zhenbei still looked a bit suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't take anything."</p><p></p><p>"If I did, may my cultivation of the 'Supreme Spiritual Flight of Pure Yang Root Sutra' not only never progress again, but also regress to the first level realm. Do you believe me now, Baihu?"</p><p></p><p>Yichen swore a solemn oath.</p><p></p><p>Yichen made this vow in a righteous and sincere manner.</p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't even reach the first level...</p><p></p><p>If the 'Supreme Spiritual Flight of Pure Yang Root Sutra' never progressed again, what did that have to do with his Pure Yang True Cultivation Method?</p><p></p><p>If it regressed to the first level realm, the problem was that he couldn't even reach the first level, so that would be a good thing?</p><p></p><p>Swearing an oath based on his own cultivation method and pointing directly to his heart was quite credible.</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei couldn't help but be somewhat convinced.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter anymore, it was no longer important.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Daoist priest Yichen took something or not, after seeing those fuzzy tendrils on the severed end of the arm in the jade box, Lin Zhenbei's heart went numb.</p><p></p><p>He decided to head straight to the provincial capital after leaving Yinlong Temple and hand it over to his superiors.</p><p></p><p>He had already written the merit memorial last night and could submit it together.</p><p></p><p>With something so ominous, he had to trust the wisdom of his superiors. Keeping such an evil object in his hands for even a second longer was unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This was disrespectful to his own annual salary.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qianhu had been working at the Zhen'an Magistracy for so many years, so he naturally understood this principle well. </p><p></p><p>As long as the lightning didn't strike him directly, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Once he submitted his memorial, his credit would be firmly established, and no one could take it away from him.</p><p></p><p>As for this demonic arm, it would be up to his superiors to worry about it.</p><p></p><p>What? You say his superiors couldn't resolve it either?</p><p></p><p>Did his superiors not have superiors of their own? Quickly pass it upwards...</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to me it's frost and arsenic, to others it's peaches and plums.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps among the higher ranks of the Zhen'an Magistracy there were people who would be delighted by this demonic arm.</p><p></p><p>After the two finished exchanging what each had in mind, they revealed faint smiles, tacitly understanding each other.</p><p></p><p>This matter was settled.</p><p></p><p>Next it was time to consolidate the relationship.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen took the opportunity to make a request, hoping to use the Zhen'an Magistracy's channels to investigate who was the mastermind behind the Evil Tiger Gang incident.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qianhu readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>A small favor to repay Yi Chen, this deal was profitable.</p><p></p><p>This is how relationships between people gradually deepen - you trouble me a bit, I trouble you a bit, and the relationship is sublimated through these troubles, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>If you never trouble others, how can you open your mouth to ask for help when you're in trouble yourself?</p><p></p><p>Even in his past life, if Yi Chen didn't have troubles, he would create small matters to trouble the 'friends' in his circle - this was the principle.</p><p></p><p>If you don't burn incense and make offerings normally, then when something happens and you show up with a pig's head to worship, you won't even get through the door.</p><p></p><p>Don't believe me? Try calling an old classmate you haven't contacted in ten years to borrow ten thousand...</p><p></p><p>Even the best relationships and feelings need activity, troubling, and maintenance.</p><p></p><p>The fruits that grew on the great tree over thousands of years in the previous life are still unbreakable truths in this realm.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I thank the great one for lending a righteous hand. Consider it that I, Yi Chengzi, owe you a favor."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Yi speaks too humbly. Baiyun Daoist's righteous deeds were renowned even in the county city. Not long after Baiyun Daoist's transcendence, there were petty people coveting his Dao lineage."</p><p></p><p>"Is there still royal law? Is there still law?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Daoist could tolerate him, this seat absolutely will not spare such a person."</p><p></p><p>A flash of brilliant light shone in Lin Qianhu's eyes as he sternly upheld justice.</p><p></p><p>Their exchanged glances revealed their intentions - both wished to befriend each other.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Zhenbei saw in Yi Chen was naturally his potential. When he returned last night, he carefully examined Yi Chen's information and reached a conclusion:</p><p></p><p>This person is truly an inscrutable one.</p><p>The true man does not reveal his appearance.</p><p></p><p>Before Baiyun Daoist's time, he kept a low profile, even resorting to schemes like selling Bawang chicken to disgrace himself. But in secret he was quietly accumulating strength.</p><p></p><p>As a result, after Baiyun Daoist's death, there really were blind fools who dared to test him - it was like lighting a lantern in the toilet to look for shit!</p><p></p><p>In Lin Qianhu's view, Yi Chen was a person who only cared about benefits, not appearances, with profound thoughts but also principles and bottom lines.</p><p></p><p>Befriending him would surely bring rewards.</p><p></p><p>As for making an enemy of him...well, why would he make an enemy? Had his brain soaked in corpse water or did his cerebellum atrophy?</p><p></p><p>Such a person - heavy-handed yet principled, skilled at biding his time and concealing his strength - his future prospects were certainly unlimited.</p><p></p><p>Investment was necessary, investment was a must.</p><p></p><p>As for the nonsense about Yi Chengzi Daoist originally being a lightweight who had only recently become powerful, if anyone dared say such words in front of Lin Zhenbei, he would definitely use his Cloud Brocade Treasured Boots to kick that person's ass hard.</p><p></p><p>Brain soaked in water?</p><p></p><p>Completely undeveloped cerebellum, incompletely developed cerebrum?</p><p></p><p>In this world, who gains strength without bitter cultivation? Whose strength does not come from their own arduous practice?</p><p></p><p>Do they expect to just lie down and become stronger? With a casual thought, is that the limit of this realm? Even the boldest martial arts novels wouldn't dare write like that.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt,</p><p></p><p>Daoist Yi is a brilliant pearl of Fengyun City, merely concealing himself in disgrace.</p><p></p><p>One day when the dust is shed, his light will shine and pierce through the myriad mountains and rivers!</p><p></p><p>Astounding the world.</p><p></p><p>As for the mastermind behind the scenes, the Zhen'an Magistracy's files already had suspects. With the Zhen'an Magistracy's professional capabilities, they would soon find conclusive evidence.</p><p></p><p>However, he decided that even if they quickly identified the true culprit, he would still wait a couple days before telling Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>If it was too fast, it would seem too easy and not worth much.</p><p></p><p>Delaying a few days would show he was wholeheartedly devoted.</p><p></p><p>He decided to have his good eldest son handle this matter. This favor must be owed to his son.</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei's mind was made up. He turned to his son Lin Baizhu, who met his gaze with intelligent eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Father, leave it to me!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

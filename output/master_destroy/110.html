        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A violent change occurred in an instant on Yi Chen's body.</p><p></p><p>His figure began to grow taller, his bones thickening and enlarging. On his feet, thighs, abdomen, hands, arms, neck, rings of muscles began to proliferate crazily and harden. The surging power within his body began to dance wildly.  </p><p></p><p>The muscles covered his body like a biological armor, while the azure glazed armor formed from his inner qi shone even more brilliantly than when he previously used the True Yang Tyrant Force.</p><p></p><p>The radiance of the world gushed into Yi Chen's body, causing the space within the formation to grow increasingly dim. </p><p></p><p>With Yi Chen as the center, a ring of azure inner qi rippled out like waves on water, its ferocious aura suddenly erupting.</p><p></p><p>In the area within ten meters of where he stood, it was as if unable to withstand this heavy pressure, the ground suddenly sank three feet.</p><p></p><p>The azure inner qi shook, and Yi Chen's huge figure slowly levitated.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we can talk this through properly. We can discuss everything," the Umbrella Woman and the others finally realized their cleverness had backfired - they had fished for a killer whale instead.</p><p></p><p>The Extremely Yin Master was shocked and said to Yi Chen with a stiff expression. </p><p></p><p>This time, he spoke quickly and urgently, unlike his previous unhurried manner!</p><p></p><p>Miscalculation.</p><p></p><p>The Extremely Yin Master originally thought he had the upper hand, but the situation had suddenly become precarious.</p><p></p><p>Once the Ghost Qi Nether Formation activated, it could not stop on its own until its energy was depleted or half a hour had passed. </p><p></p><p>This great formation trapped others, but also trapped himself. Unless Madam Butterfly arrived in person, or they could stop and open the formation midway.</p><p></p><p>But the Umbrella Woman definitely did not have such attainments or abilities.</p><p></p><p>If the Umbrella Woman herself had not also fallen into this place, they would have suspected that Red Court had sold them out.</p><p></p><p>What a letdown.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it said that the Ghost Qi Nether Formation could weaken and suppress all spirit arts?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it said that this ox-nose's cultivation at most surpassed theirs by one minor level?</p><p></p><p>The five top-level experts in the Refining Qi Solidifying Spirit realm, plus the formation, were already taking him very seriously. Who could have imagined this ox-nose was hiding such depths?</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen floated up slowly. Ignoring the Extremely Yin Master's words, he sneered:</p><p></p><p>"Let me land a punch first before any other talk."</p><p></p><p>"The weak have no right to speak."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Yang Shattering Fist reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen dove down rapidly, transforming into an azure rainbow light, fiercely attacking the Umbrella Woman.</p><p></p><p>It was this ghost woman who took the lead in ambushing him, harboring the deepest malice. Although Yi Chen did not know the reason, it did not prevent him from holding a grudge.</p><p></p><p>He had no concept of sparing the beautiful.</p><p></p><p>If they were enemies, they had to die!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, among the five, this woman holding the red umbrella seemed to have the worst defenses. If he did not kill her first, who would he kill?</p><p></p><p>Facing Yi Chen's fierce attack, the Umbrella Woman's heart pounded. She let out a shrill cry and threw out the red umbrella in her hand.</p><p></p><p>The red umbrella was made of unknown materials, with strange patterns engraved on its surface. Once thrown into the wind, it expanded rapidly, its surface spinning at extreme speeds to try to block Yi Chen's descending Yang Shattering Fist.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Extremely Yin Master and the others also acted in unison, each firing rays of gray or black force at Yi Chen in an attempt to rescue the Umbrella Woman.</p><p></p><p>Just when everyone thought Yi Chen would retreat and defend himself, the scene that unfolded left them shocked and enraged.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen did not evade at all. As he approached the Umbrella Woman, his figure suddenly split, three incomplete overlapping afterimages of Yi Chen appearing in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly illusory yet real.</p><p></p><p>This was the visual residue caused by the Yang Shattering Fist's activation.</p><p></p><p>The first Yi Chen afterimage punched the red shield formed by the red umbrella, instantly cracking it.</p><p></p><p>The second Yi Chen afterimage struck the cracked red shield with a punch, shattering it like a spider web.</p><p></p><p>The third Yi Chen, ignoring the rays of force from the others, landed a punch that penetrated the Umbrella Woman's body in her shocked gaze, blasting through her chest. She turned into a gust of yin wind, torn into pieces and scattered.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had used all his killer moves right from the start.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression was as cold as ice, his mind like a beast's.</p><p></p><p>The familiar feeling had returned.</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling of truly being alive.</p><p></p><p>His combat instincts were now excavated to the limit.</p><p></p><p>This was the instinct to hunt and kill.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the others attacked from behind, Yi Chen keenly sensed that each of them harbored ill intentions, reserving some strength to defend themselves.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were all millennia-old foxes, with sinister minds. Who could be sure Yi Chen's target was definitely the Umbrella Woman? If he feinted, and the real target was oneself, wouldn't that leave one wide open, sacrificing for others?</p><p></p><p>This initial prisoner's dilemma was Yi Chen's biggest opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It's better to cut off one finger than injure all five.</p><p></p><p>He had to seize the moment when the five still harbored doubts at the start to strike fiercely and reduce their numbers.</p><p></p><p>Opportunities slipped away quickly, he had to firmly grasp this one.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the five truly united their efforts in advancing and retreating together, even Yi Chen might find it difficult to leave unscathed.</p><p></p><p>After all, none of the five were weaklings. With the enhancement of the formation, their might had grown even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist truly has a good scheme, as cunning as a fox, as vicious as a wolf, as formidable as a tiger."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, if we continue to distrust each other, I'm afraid none of us will be able to leave this formation today."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity about Umbrella Daoist."</p><p></p><p>The Extremely Yin Master laughed angrily. He exchanged a glance with the remaining three, and the four 'people' nodded at each other, each levitating to form a circular formation with their backs to each other.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the pillars of the evil sect instantly reached a consensus to jointly face the righteous Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>All four were veterans of battle with extremely rich combat experience, people who had waded through blood and fire. If another situation like before happened where Yi Chen defeated them one by one, then not a single one of them would survive.</p><p></p><p>But if they wholeheartedly united, no matter who Yi Chen attacked, as long as all of them went all-out against Yi Chen without holding back, perhaps one of the four might still live, killing Yi Chen at the cost of their lives to win a chance at survival.</p><p></p><p>This was the insight and execution ability of cultivators who had killed their way out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood.</p><p></p><p>It was a true battle between experts.</p><p></p><p>After forcefully withstanding the four's combined strike, even Yi Chen could not help coughing up a trace of fresh blood from the corner of his mouth, sustaining minor injuries. The azure glazed armor on his back also showed several cracks.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the four 'people' in their circular defensive formation, his heart too was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Extremely Yin Master and the others did not expect Yi Chen to be so decisive, Yi Chen also did not expect the remaining four to be so decisive, instantly making the most correct decision.</p><p></p><p>If the five of them had acted this way from the very start, then Yi Chen would really have had a headache.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Yi Chen had played his trump card right at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation, he had already seized the initiative. The other side was now out of options and had completely lost the leverage to negotiate with him.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, why don't you surrender? If you continue fighting, you may be able to kill all four of us, but you definitely won't be leaving unscathed either."</p><p></p><p>"If the Daoist is willing to surrender, we will certainly offer generous gifts after leaving."</p><p></p><p>The Extremely Yin Master's dry voice came, making a final effort.</p><p></p><p>The Demon General, the Rakshasa Demon General, and the Zombie King Zhao all nodded repeatedly, saying in unison:</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>If they really fought to the death, who knew how many of them would be left in the end. It was better to try negotiating.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, they completely did not understand their worth in Yi Chen's eyes. There were things in the world like the Deep Crimson Omen.</p><p></p><p>This cognitive misjudgment led to Yi Chen instantly taking down the Umbrella Woman at the start, leaving them in their current predicament.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen extended a finger, dipped in the fresh blood dripping from the corner of his lips, and lightly licked it with his tongue, revealing an inscrutable expression that made the Extremely Yin Master's group's hearts skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, they felt that they were the orthodox sects, while the towering Daoist before them was a member of an evil cult.</p><p></p><p>The taste was really too intense.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't a person like this be on their side instead?</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked at the four with manic eyes, as if gazing upon a priceless treasure, making them break out in goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't let me beat you to death, not a single one of you is leaving today."</p><p></p><p>"If the Daoist insists on being obstinate, we will fight to the death. The Daoist may not necessarily emerge unscathed either!" the Extremely Yin Master angrily said.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this fellow Daoist should think it over carefully. Our cultivations were not easily attained, and we have no deep enmity. If we fight to the end, even if the Daoist can kill us, the Daoist will also suffer heavy injuries, damaging his foundation, or even lose his life. Why go to such lengths?" The Zombie King Zhao could not help but threaten as well.</p><p></p><p>"Evil demonic karma, wandering in samsara in vain. Taste my fist first!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen no longer wasted words with them. His entire being transformed into an azure strand, first turning Chen Fuyun, who had almost curled up into a ball in the corner in an effort to lower his presence, into a bloody mist. He then continued towards the Extremely Yin Master and the others in their defensive formation.</p><p></p><p>After years of wealthy living, coupled with his impending death and the suppression of the Ghost Qi Nether Formation, the old Chen Family Patriarch was now like a chicken or dog in Yi Chen's eyes.  </p><p></p><p>When the eldest and second-eldest brothers fight, kill the third first. This was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Is it reasonable?</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoists, let's take on this ox-nosed one." Seeing that Yi Chen was impervious to persuasion, the Extremely Yin Monk also let out a stern shout and engaged Yi Chen in battle.  </p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Incessant explosions echoed continuously within the array space.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen attacked the Extremely Yin Monk like a madman, while the evil dao pillars struggled to fend off Daoist Yi's attacks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yi Chen had completely adopted a strategy of trading blows.  </p><p></p><p>Relying on the recovery from the surrounding light, the healing and strengthening effects of the heat flow formed by the source point added to his physical attributes, he fought extremely boldly and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>This was the high value of having high damage output while being heavily armored.</p><p></p><p>It was the basis of Yi Chen's arrogance.</p><p></p><p>"Little mutt, you're damn crazy, stop this, listen to my words." The Extremely Yin Monk's hair and beard were disheveled, barely holding on with the combined efforts of the other three and a Yellow Springs battle banner in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen attacked him as if he had a grievance to kill his father, fixating on him alone, making him miserable enough to cough up blood.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he was the strongest among the four of them.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? I can't hear you!" Yi Chen laughed wildly and continued his frenzied assault on the Extremely Yin Monk, his energy rampant. Within the array space, the land had been plowed over several times by the few of them, with dirt occasionally kicked up and flying about.</p><p></p><p>"Little mutt, you're damn crazy, I said stop, listen to my words, I have a great secret to share with my fellow daoists," the Extremely Yin Monk shouted.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hear you, this pauper monk said I can't hear you, so I can't hear you!"</p><p></p><p>"I @$*%" The Extremely Yin Monk's face showed a look of despair.  </p><p></p><p>He had miscalculated again. The tall daoist in front of him was simply like a monster, recklessly flinging his pure yang energy around for free.</p><p></p><p>Not only was he tougher than he had imagined, but it seemed there was also some mysterious force constantly repairing his body.</p><p></p><p>It was simply cheating.</p><p></p><p>In his over two hundred years of experience, he had never seen or heard of such a dao method.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Beng Fist."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Yang Beng Fist reappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Extremely Yin Monk's expression instantly froze, shattering like porcelain, and the Yellow Springs battle banner was also blasted into two pieces by Yi Chen, its treasured spiritual light instantly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yi Chen had also forcibly endured an attack from the remaining three, spitting out another mouthful of fresh blood, but the crazed look in his eyes only grew more intense.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you guys eaten?"</p><p></p><p>"Want me to tickle you again?"  </p><p></p><p>"No strength at all!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned and roared at the remaining three.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had set his sights on the Zombie King Zhao.</p><p></p><p>It was this guy who had scratched him earlier, so he had to take him down.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Yi Chen's cold yet crazed gaze, the Zombie King Zhao felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why he was so unlucky to be targeted by this ominous star.</p><p></p><p>The remaining ghost and two demons hurriedly mustered their spirits to continue fending off Yi Chen's attacks.</p><p></p><p>At this point, those from the Yin Mountain Manor had already cursed the Yellow Springs Sect and Red Chamber ten thousand times over in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>What a letdown.</p><p></p><p>Who the hell said the Ghost Qi Nether Heaven Great Array could weaken and repel all mysterious dao methods? This was clearly a fake.</p><p></p><p>Or was it the world's number one blowhard?</p><p></p><p>The ox-nosed one in front of them grew stronger the more he fought, like he had taken some chicken blood tonic. Where was the weakening?</p><p></p><p>And who was the dog from the Yellow Springs Sect or Red Chamber that investigated and said this ox-nosed one's strength was only slightly higher than theirs?</p><p></p><p>This wasn't just slightly higher.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly a true immortal realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Yet they had the five of them bring this broken restraining talisman array to try and kill a true immortal realm expert. They were truly fortunate to encounter such great teammates.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, please stop, don't fight anymore."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you stop, Daoist, anything can be discussed."</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King Zhao could no longer hold back and was the first to call for a truce.</p><p></p><p>He felt fine when they came, full of confidence, but now he couldn't go back.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yi Chen let out a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>"But I killed your fellow daoists Hu Er Niang and Hei San Lang from the Yin Mountain Manor. Don't you resent me?"</p><p></p><p>"What is the Daoist saying? Some petty grievance between fellow daoists is no big deal."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't believe you."</p><p></p><p>Before Yi Chen could finish speaking, he saw an opening and thrust out a large hand that passed through the Zombie King Zhao's chest. When Yi Chen pulled his hand back, he was gripping a black, still-pulsating heart.</p><p></p><p>It was the Zombie King Zhao's heart core, the source of his power.</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King Zhao's body suddenly froze and crashed down heavily.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, as Yi Chen looked at the still faintly beating heart in his hand, his nostrils flared, and an enticing aroma wafted straight into his nose.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>He actually felt a desire to consume this corpse heart.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that he had expended an extreme amount of energy in this battle so far.</p><p></p><p>The excess energy storage ability gained after his bodily ascension was almost depleted.</p><p></p><p>His rapid recovery ability was also a major energy drain.</p><p></p><p>Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!</p><p></p><p>A frenzied desire to consume took root in Yi Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Why not give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>"My instincts tell me this thing seems edible."  </p><p></p><p>"Besides, no one saw me eat this thing, who would dare say this Daoist is improper."</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly appeared in Yi Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't I just take a small bite, just a little taste."</p><p></p><p>As if possessed, Yi Chen took a bite, devouring nearly two-thirds of the still faintly beating corpse heart.</p><p></p><p>The taste was actually a bit sweet...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, rampant energy sprouted within Yi Chen's body. The previously dimmed energy core instantly regained half its brilliance.</p><p></p><p>With just one bite, he had refilled half of his excess energy storage.</p><p></p><p>The effect was outstanding.</p><p></p><p>Even his shattered azure spirit armor instantly regained its luster, smooth as new.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen immediately felt revitalized.  </p><p></p><p>This was simply a divine object.</p><p></p><p>If there were more than just the one Zombie King Zhao, he would have gladly consumed more.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's actions directly stunned the Rakshasa Demon General and Asura Demon General.</p><p></p><p>What kind of vicious person was this?</p><p></p><p>So ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the unidentified liquid still at the corners of Yi Chen's mouth, the two demon generals' hearts were filled with peak terror.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist..."</p><p></p><p>The Asura Demon General attempted to communicate with the tall daoist, but was cruelly cut off by Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for you two fellow daoists to say more."</p><p></p><p>"You've seen things you shouldn't have seen, so I have no choice."</p><p></p><p>"If others found out...how could I continue being a person..."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, you came together, the most important thing is leaving together."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's voice drifted over, like a gloomy wind from the depths of the nine underworlds.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two large fan-like hands appeared on the heads of the Asura Demon General and Rakshasa Demon General.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist caressed their crowns, pure yang opened the heavenly spirit.</p><p></p><p>The two great demon generals also fell face up, departing quite peacefully with an expression of liberation, no one knowing their final thoughts at the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were no longer any living beings within the array space.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out a long breath, finally having a chance to look at the few messages on his retinal display.</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the Umbrella Girl, gaining 280 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the Zombie King Zhao, gaining 280 deep red points.] </p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the Asura Demon General, gaining 270 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the Rakshasa Demon General, gaining 270 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the messages on his retinal display, a surge of joyful emotion welled up in Yi Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>Truly, good deeds are rewarded.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the abilities gained from his bodily ascension, the amplification of the Soul Combustion Art, and the assistance of the source point, along with a bit of scheming at the start.</p><p></p><p>He had actually completely annihilated five powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Although he had paid the price of severe injuries, with his shoulder blade faintly showing white bone, a hole pierced in his left shoulder by that old villain the Extremely Yin Monk, and countless other wounds all over his body, it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had accumulated enough deep red points needed to reach the ninth level of the Pure Yang True Technique.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could break through to the ninth level of the Pure Yang True Technique, he could heal himself, it was all worth it.</p><p></p><p>The outside world was too dangerous, there were too many old spirit stones, and he now craved power, even greater power.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen surveyed his surroundings, feeling waves of yin energy all around, the array barriers still motionless, with no other living beings. With a shift of his mind, he directly sat down cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>This place was perfect for his breakthrough!</p><p></p><p>"Deep red! Let me see your limits!"</p><p></p><p>A cry suddenly rang out in Yi Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to Lord Hou Jin Gua for the 10,000 spirit stone reward, becoming the first Patriarch of this book. Utmost gratitude.</p><p></p><p>I don't know if it was yang or if I ate something bad today, but I've been vomiting all day.</p><p></p><p>However, one Daoist friend, Shi Xin Ren Wang, said that as long as I finished writing tonight, he would give me five month passes. So I wrote while running back and forth to the bathroom to vomit.</p><p></p><p>I finally finished writing.</p><p></p><p>I really felt too awful, so I'm not separating it into chapters. Good night everyone.</p><p></p><p>The vomiting was so severe that even bile came out. Miserable.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

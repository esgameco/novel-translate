        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this might!"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the internal intelligence say there were no cultivators who could refine qi and become immortal in the entire Fengyun County?" </p><p></p><p>"Was the intelligence false?"</p><p></p><p>After Yi Chen used all his strength, the man in black clothes finally changed his expression drastically, extremely shaken in his heart. </p><p></p><p>He knew Yi Chen's strength was formidable, after all he was an existence capable of slaying corpse demons.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that the corpse demon was personally 'kneaded' together by the great protector from the earth mud and mist demon, and then gifted to him, with extraordinary power.</p><p></p><p>That's why he chose to go against Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>But this was too exaggerated, damn it.</p><p></p><p>How did he practice this devilish force?  </p><p></p><p>Was his dad a elephant fiend?</p><p></p><p>The man in black robe took out a black cudgel from behind and blocked Yi Chen's Dragon Slaying Sword.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>Step, step, step, step, step.</p><p></p><p>The black robe man retreated five steps before completely dissipating this force.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen only took two steps back.</p><p></p><p>The power disparity between the two became clear in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yi Chen's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"You don't even have the strength to hit someone, yet you call yourself a cult?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you learn your skills from your master's wife?"</p><p></p><p>"You said the Dao master was a fool, I @#$%^&*!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen, who had studied on the Ancestral Peace server for many years in his previous life when his parents were still alive, began to spew garbage while charging at the black robe again.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>"Cow nose."  </p><p></p><p>"Corpse Transformation: Frenzy!"</p><p></p><p>The black robe man's expression changed after being struck back. He threw his head back and let out a shrill howl. His whole body inflated like a balloon until he was about 2.5 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>His body was covered in dense dark green and black spots. The skin on his hands became tough and greasy, and his nails started growing, flickering with a black ghostly light in the sun.  </p><p></p><p>Two long fangs pierced through his mouth and protruded out.</p><p></p><p>This time, when sword and staff clashed, Yi Chen's expression finally changed.</p><p></p><p>A reversal, it was his turn to retreat five steps.</p><p></p><p>A thick corpse stench drilled into Yi Chen's nostrils, causing a very slight dizziness. Fortunately, Yi Chen's pure positive inner qi dissipated the dizziness instantly.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Yi Chen was suppressed by someone else's strength.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the transformed monster that the black robe man had become, shaken inexplicably in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this?</p><p></p><p>A living person could still undergo corpse transformation?</p><p></p><p>Corpse qi permeated his body, yet he also had the aura of a living person. Truly strange.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a guess emerged in Yi Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>Could this lunatic from the Corpse Deity Cult be cultivating using corpse refining secret techniques on his own body?</p><p></p><p>Refining one's own corpse, the people of the Corpse Deity Cult really had ideas.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the wind started howling, blowing the flowers and plants in Lanxiu Building all over the place. </p><p></p><p>The blood-colored light pillar above the blood pool became more concentrated, and the peculiar undulation in the air grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>All of a sudden, a long fissure about a palm's width cracked open in the ground somewhere inside Lanxiu Building, and yin winds gusted out from the fissure.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the great array to summon has been activated. The left arm of the buried Corpse Deity will return. Offer your blood and flesh for the return of the Corpse Deity!"</p><p></p><p>"You fool, this will be your greatest glory."</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this anomaly, the mysterious black robe man began laughing madly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tear you apart!"  </p><p></p><p>"Follow the Longevity God, the vastly compassionate savior!"</p><p></p><p>The black robe man's corpse qi surged, transforming into a black streak that shot straight at Yi Chen, then flew away even faster.</p><p></p><p>Back when Yi Chen was struck back by the black robe man, he had secretly activated the Positive Polarity Shift.  </p><p></p><p>This was the first time he used it after breaking through to the seventh level of his pure positive true cultivation. An incomparable sense of power emerged in Yi Chen's heart.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he could hammer the golden armored corpse skull that was battling Lin Baihu into its chest cavity.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining that scene made his heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he last hit someone's head. People had already forgotten how to write the "Yi" character in his Dharma name Yi Chengzi.</p><p></p><p>Now every mutt and tomcat dared to bare their fangs at him.</p><p></p><p>A neither human nor corpse freak, did it qualify?</p><p></p><p>Power surged through his body, a burning sensation.</p><p></p><p>His heart was pounding wildly, pumping energy throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly grew nearly 30 centimeters taller, the muscles in his neck, hands, waist and legs swelling madly, expanding and thickening like donning a muscle armor.</p><p></p><p>The will to battle in his heart was fully ignited!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yi Chen abnormally sheathed his Dragon Slaying Sword.</p><p></p><p>He only needed his fists!</p><p></p><p>He was loyal to his fists!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the sword, he trusted the sense of faith and power conveyed by his fists more.</p><p></p><p>Of course, more importantly, he was afraid the violent clash between his Dragon Slaying Sword and the black robe's cudgel would create a few nicks...</p><p></p><p>After a sudden accelerated sneak attack sent the black robe flying, Yi Chen sped up, forcefully kicking off the ground with his left leg. Borrowing the powerful counterforce, he somehow caught up to the black robe he had struck away, delivering a vicious elbow strike to his chest.</p><p></p><p>This one was both fast and vicious, creating a dent in the black robe's chest after his corpse transformation.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The black robe's body slammed heavily into an invisible air wall, then bounced off and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Yi Chen have a chance to observe the entire battlefield.</p><p></p><p>To his left.</p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua, Master Shuiyue and Daoist Qingxu joined forces against the white-robed female ghost wielding red scissors. The three fought energetically with the ghost, barely holding the battlefield with their sect's magic weapons.</p><p></p><p>To his right. </p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu was enveloped in a deep green aura, using some unknown secret technique that boosted his aura by a level. He drew his battle blade, the flashing blade trapping the two golden armored corpses within.</p><p></p><p>Then...frantic scraping.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's battle blade made clanging sounds like hammering iron, even striking sparks, yet those two golden armored corpses were still flailing and howling.</p><p></p><p>Watching this, Yi Chen felt like shouting: Master Lin, stop scraping!</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Lin Baihu, having awakened the spiritual nature of wind and taking the agile path, was truly fast, but he lacked force.</p><p></p><p>For a man, being fast alone without force was a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yichen noticed keenly that Lin Baihu now had quite a few white hairs on his head, and his forehead was covered in tiny beads of sweat, it seemed the secret technique couldn't hold out much longer. </p><p></p><p>It was difficult for him alone to withstand two golden armored corpses for so long.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator in the late stages of refining essence and energy, he had reason to be proud.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yichen was about to step forward and teach the golden armored corpses the way of righteousness, suddenly, an anomaly occurred.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious black-robed person he had previously beaten half to death suddenly appeared near the golden armored corpses. He threw back his head and let out a shrill howl. The two golden armored corpses near him then seemed to deflate, with countless black gases seeping out from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>That vast amount of black gas surged into the black-robed person's body like a whale taking in water. </p><p></p><p>Nourished by this massive influx of corpse energy, the black-robed person's aura grew increasingly powerful. The dent in his chest that Yichen had made also swelled back up like a ping-pong ball soaked in hot water.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's eyes narrowed as he rushed forward urgently. </p><p></p><p>He had to interrupt this.</p><p></p><p>Only a fool would allow the enemy to slowly recover and reach the peak of their power.</p><p></p><p>It's better to chase the remaining enemy relentlessly, don't learn from the overlords who buy reputation.</p><p></p><p>Strike while the iron is hot, take your life.</p><p></p><p>With this kind of demonic heretic, there's no need to talk about chivalrous principles. My Yinlong Sect is a righteous and upright sect, we can launch a fair sneak attack!</p><p></p><p>"You bastard!"</p><p></p><p>"Fight me fair and square!"</p><p></p><p>Yichen roared angrily, brimming with deep purple pure yang inner energy throughout his body, like a human tank suddenly accelerating towards the black robe.</p><p></p><p>The ground shook violently, dust billowing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The raging energy burst out airflows that whipped up sand and rocks into the air, raining down sand all around.</p><p></p><p>Two powerful forces collided repeatedly amidst the dense dust clouds.</p><p></p><p>This massive commotion drew the attention of everyone else still battling the Red Scissors.</p><p></p><p>They turned their gazes towards the dust clouds, but could not make out what was happening clearly.</p><p></p><p>They could only hear the occasional muffled grunts of fists hitting flesh, and the following words coming from within the dust:</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you eaten? Put some more force into it!"</p><p></p><p>"Even my grandmother hits harder than you."</p><p></p><p>"Are you giving me a massage?"</p><p></p><p>"You call that hitting someone? And you claim to be a heretic sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that undead technique taught by your martial auntie? Your lower body is unstable, you bastard!"</p><p></p><p>"Your face covered in corpse spots is so damn disgusting."</p><p></p><p>"I generally don't attack others' appearances, unless their appearance attacks me first."</p><p></p><p>"@#$%"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Countless insults and C programming language came from within the dust clouds, showcasing Yichen's profound language skills.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu could barely hold his sword steady seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>What an extraordinarily ferocious battle!</p><p></p><p>A completely new version he had never witnessed before.</p><p></p><p>Just feeling the tremors of the ground, he knew the force of the collision at the center of the dust clouds must be tremendously, unbelievably powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone look, light!"</p><p></p><p>"Light!"</p><p></p><p>The nun Lianhua had extremely sharp eyes and instantly noticed something everyone else missed.</p><p></p><p>Countless rays of light seemed to be drawn like magnets towards the billowing dust clouds, causing the entire environment to dim.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the previously silent Zen master Shui Yue suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>She glanced towards the white-robed female ghost standing off to the side.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, Master Yicheng is currently battling fiercely to slay demons ahead. We cannot just stand idly by, for there is still one here."</p><p></p><p>Four gazes suddenly focused on the white-robed female ghost.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed female ghost only felt a chill run down her spine.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had suppressed Shui Yue and the other two, adhering to the principle of women going easy on other women. She had not held back attacking Shui Yue. Now retribution had arrived.</p><p></p><p>She could barely gain the upper hand against the three of them. Adding the Zhen'an Magistrate Lin Baihu, she would be overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>"Kill her!"</p><p></p><p>"We don't need to follow any chivalrous principles against these demonic heretics, let's join forces!"</p><p></p><p>Someone took the lead, and three or four spells instantly assailed the white-robed female ghost.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed female ghost could no longer hold back, rapidly fleeing while shouting: "Black robe, is your brain filled with corpse water?"</p><p></p><p>"That thing is useless now, are you going to wait until we're all beaten to death before using it?"</p><p></p><p>"Black robe, are you inbred? I can't hold out any longer, hurry up and bring it out before we end up in coffins!"</p><p></p><p>A huge boom resounded.</p><p></p><p>The black robe's figure was blasted out from the dust clouds, slamming heavily once more into the air barrier formed by the formation.</p><p></p><p>This time, he could not even maintain his corpse transformation state.</p><p></p><p>He had panda-like black eyes, his body a mottled mess of bruises, without an inch of uninjured flesh. Even the fangs that grew during his corpse transformation were knocked out, with another one snapped in half.</p><p></p><p>He spat out a mouthful of black, reversed blood, but then began laughing maniacally:</p><p></p><p>"Red Scissors, shut up!"</p><p></p><p>"The righteous cultivator Yicheng of Yinlong Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"You are strong."</p><p></p><p>"You're the first peer to push me to such extremes."</p><p></p><p>"But you'll die today!"</p><p></p><p>"All of you will die!"</p><p></p><p>The black robe roared furiously, shattering a red ancient jade in his hands against the ground.</p><p></p><p>He was going to summon something.</p><p></p><p>The ancient jade shattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A blood mist rose from the shattered jade, rapidly surging into the black robe's body.</p><p></p><p>The black robe's pupils instantly turned a bloody red.</p><p></p><p>An aura completely different from before emerged.</p><p></p><p>Powerful enough to make one's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>Cold and indifferent like the heavenly dao itself, looking down on all things as mere dogs.</p><p></p><p>That gaze made even Yichen's scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "......" Dammit, I knew these major forces always have a trump card up their sleeves.</p><p></p><p>Steeling himself against the black robe's gaze, Yichen stepped forward and said with cupped fists: </p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoist, it's all just a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>Happy Qixi Festival everyone!</p><p></p><p>Today there are two chapters over 3,000 words each. Thanks to all fellow daoists for your support. Tomorrow I'll thank those who voted, gave bonus chapters and recommended.</p><p></p><p>Seeking some bonus chapters today, please, it's Tuesday today.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

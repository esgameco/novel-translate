        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Who did the county magistrate invite to discuss this matter?" Yi Chen said with a furrowed brow. </p><p></p><p>"There were four groups - Lingfeng Guan, Zhengzhen Guan, Miaoyue An, and Yuexun Si. Besides them, the county magistrate also posted a notice offering a high price to seek experts from all over to discuss and resolve this issue," Zhang Butou replied.</p><p></p><p>"High price? How high?" </p><p></p><p>The key words caught Yi Chen's attention, his eyes lighting up.</p><p>For him, no amount of money was ever enough to spend.</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Zi had started practicing the 'Taishang Lingfei Chunyang Genyuan Dao Jing' and was at the stage of refining jing into qi, which required a large amount of supplementation. </p><p></p><p>Relying solely on meat would not only affect his cultivation progress, but the quality of his pure yang zhenli would also contain more impurities compared to others', requiring more time to temper.</p><p></p><p>Because of the blood-colored mark and the jade token from the old Daoist master, Yi Chen did not have much time to waste. He urgently needed to travel to Longhu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>First, it was an entrustment he had accepted, a matter of loyalty.</p><p>Second, he could take the opportunity to investigate information about the underworld at Longhu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Knowing yourself and the enemy, you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.</p><p>Only by understanding what exactly the underworld was could he break free from it and even demolish that dilapidated dwelling.</p><p></p><p>As long as Qingyun Zi fully transformed his pure yang zhenli and stabilized his cultivation realm, gaining the power of self-protection, he could set out without worry.</p><p></p><p>It would only be a matter of one or two months, faster or slower.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Butou wished he could slap himself.</p><p>He had made a grave mistake and forgotten to mention the key point.</p><p>An unsatisfied master cannot be defeated.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered the last time he invited a master to take action. Before handing over the silver ingots, even the tea leaves were coarse stems that felt like scraping his throat when drinking.</p><p>After the silver ingots, the master switched to premium pekoe...</p><p></p><p>He realized his mistake.</p><p>He immediately spoke about the key point: "The county magistrate offered a reward of three thousand taels of silver for resolving this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Each of the invited experts can receive two hundred taels as travel expenses. Master, you can take this amount." Zhang Butou waved his five fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Five thousand taels? In silver coins? The county magistrate is generous, we'll set out immediately," Yi Chen's eyes grew even brighter.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Butou: "..."</p><p></p><p>"It's five hundred, five hundred taels. Master, please be clear-headed..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh." The light in Yi Chen's eyes disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the county magistrate was not being overly generous.</p><p></p><p>"So Master, will you accept the county magistrate's invitation or not?" Zhang Butou couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen pondered for a moment but decided to make the trip.</p><p>The evil force that had killed over two hundred people overnight was certainly powerful, but this time the magistrate of Feng County had gathered all the cultivators within the county's borders. At worst, he could learn from the great masters and furrow his brow before retreating to the back of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>He still had five source points remaining for contingencies, and he hadn't even added them yet.</p><p>If he encountered an irresistible danger, he could add the points to his agility at that time and take flight.</p><p></p><p>On the grasslands, when a herd of sheep encounters wolves and flees in all directions, as long as you run faster than the slowest sheep, your chances of survival increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, he could run very fast.</p><p></p><p>If the evil force was not as powerful as he imagined...</p><p>Well...</p><p></p><p>Why bother discussing rules of the martial arts world with these demonic cultivators? He could join forces with them shoulder to shoulder, then seize an opportunity to deliver the final blow. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was quite eager to witness the skills of his fellow cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen narrowed his eyes, considering a possibility. Upon further thought, it was indeed necessary for him to meet and interact with the major forces within Feng County's borders to deepen their understanding of him.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not an old good-natured person like his master Bai Yunzi.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, lead the way," Yi Chen waved his big hand and immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He made the decision.</p><p></p><p>Go, he must go this time. </p><p></p><p>He remembered that the county master still owed him the remaining 300 taels from last time. Last month, he was so focused on cultivation that he almost forgot about this matter.</p><p></p><p>What about the promised banquet and gifts of appreciation?</p><p></p><p>....</p><p>....</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Yi Chen had arrived in front of the east gate of Fengchun County. </p><p></p><p>On the city gate, a bagua mirror the size of a grindstone was already covered in cracks.</p><p></p><p>This mirror, called the Bagua Demon-Subduing Treasure Mirror, was a magic tool researched and refined by cultivators from the Imperial Astronomy Bureau. It had the ability to subdue ordinary demonic forces. Most cities of decent size would have a few of these installed at the city gates.</p><p></p><p>With this treasure mirror present, demonic forces of the wandering and resentful levels could never enter the city gate.</p><p></p><p>As for the city walls, they were built by ramming in cinnabar and other special yang substances, which demonic forces would avoid.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, cities were naturally much safer than the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The ferocious iron armor corpse that recently caused havoc in Qingyuan Town could not even enter the gates of Fengchun County.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason for Fengchun County's high housing prices...</p><p></p><p>The county officials were the real bigwigs, with leg hair thicker than the waists of commoners.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Bagua Demon-Subduing Treasure Mirrors on all four city gates of Fengchun County were cracked open.</p><p></p><p>Completely ineffective.</p><p></p><p>It meant that at least a demonic force of the fierce level or above had infiltrated the city. No wonder the county master was in such a panic, summoning all the famous cultivators within Fengchun County's borders.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, housing prices are going to drop."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen patted the Dragon Slaying Sword on his back and strode through the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Since he had come, he would stay calm.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he would just run away.</p><p></p><p>He was determined to get the remaining payment from last time and the 500 taels for travel expenses this time!</p><p></p><p>A poor family's path to riches, he would have to go on a long journey soon. If he didn't have enough money, would he have to beg along the way? Or perform tricks like shattering rocks with his chest?</p><p></p><p>Life was not easy. A Taoist priest performing tricks?</p><p></p><p>He could do that work, but he couldn't bring himself to lose face like that.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Buting followed behind Yi Chen. Seeing the direction Yi Chen was heading, he hurriedly said, "Master, you're going the wrong way. The county office isn't in this direction."</p><p></p><p>"I know, but aren't you hungry?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, a little. But the county master and the others are already waiting."</p><p></p><p>"They can wait a little longer, it's not like they'll die. Why go so early to investigate the Wang manor? We won't be able to do anything anyway."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Buting suddenly felt that Yi Chen made a lot of sense and couldn't refute him.</p><p></p><p>"Then Master, let me treat you to beef noodles. I know a noodle shop that has really delicious beef noodles. I'll pay."</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>"You want to treat me, a Taoist priest, to beef noodles? Looking to pick a fight?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen casually entered a noodle shop and sat down boldly.</p><p></p><p>"Keep it simple, let's start with eight bowls of mutton noodles."</p><p></p><p>"Add two eggs to each bowl."</p><p></p><p>"Eating too much in the morning isn't good."</p><p></p><p>After the time it took to drink two cups of tea, amid Zhang Buting's pained expression and the noodle shop owner's delighted sendoff, the two left the shop and headed towards the county office.</p><p></p><p>By this time, the sun had risen, but there were very few people on the streets in the city. The occasional one or two passersby looked to be in a hurry, it seemed news of the Wang manor's massacre had spread.</p><p></p><p>Outside the county office, a portly middle-aged man in a blue official's robe was standing at the entrance, looking around.</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently, Yi Chen's gaze met this portly middle-aged man's.</p><p></p><p>After confirming each other's gazes, they knew they were of the same kind.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"But this evil spirit can even block the perception of the Dao master and confuse my senses, preventing me from leaving. Why are there still living people in this place?" </p><p></p><p>"With such abilities, it shouldn't be so extreme as to not even have other methods to deal with the town residents."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this bastard feeds on fear, keeping these people alive in a state of despair and terror, which is more beneficial for its growth?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yi Chen's mind was spinning with many doubts and speculations. </p><p></p><p>Suppressing the doubts in his heart, Yi Chen soon arrived in front of a large mansion with blue stone lion statues in the center of the town.</p><p></p><p>What was astonishing was that the eyes of the stone lions had been gouged out, and one of their legs had been broken off, as if someone had vented their anger on them.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, it seems this Yaoyuan Ancient Town has quite a story."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen entered through the gate shrouded in thin mist, and a strong smell of blood assaulted his nostrils. The huge courtyard was littered with broken branches and withered leaves.</p><p></p><p>There were signs of intentional damage throughout the houses.</p><p></p><p>As Yi Chen was looking around, suddenly a very familiar aggressive voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Are the brats in your town never done? Coming to steal my supplies again? Selling me out, do you think I, Zhang Bukai of the Weyuan Escort Agency's Five Tiger Blade Guards, am dead?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......" Damn it, this escort leader Zhang is too damn demonic. How does he always show up when something happens? Is this the Conan effect? How did you escort in your previous life?</p><p></p><p>The Dao master definitely has no problem, so the problem must be with the escort leader Zhang. First the flood, then the fake corpse, and now this strange ancient town, each time more intense than the last.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a burly man with a thick beard rushed out wielding a tiger-head blade. His eyes were bloodshot, his hair and beard disheveled, his furious gaze wide open.</p><p></p><p>Behind him followed more than a dozen young escorts.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the figure standing in the courtyard, the escort leader Zhang felt like crying. The tiger-head blade clattered to the ground, as if he had run into a relative.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why did you only come now? I've been holding out for three days..."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and two bonfires were lit in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>One was surrounded by Yi Chen and the group of strong men from the Weyuan Escort Agency.</p><p></p><p>The other had a handsome young man in white clothes with thick eyebrows and a chiseled nose, his lips tightly pursed in a show of determination and stubbornness. His name was Ning Feixue.</p><p></p><p>He had a peach wood sword on his back and a black finger guard on his hand. His clothes bulged, indicating he wore some kind of strange inner armor, and faint fluctuations of spiritual power emanated from his body.</p><p></p><p>He was clearly a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Beside the young man in white sat a pair of twin sisters. The elder sister was named Zhushao, with a red mole between her brows. She wore a tight red dress that accentuated her alluring curves, giving off a passionate aura like fire.</p><p></p><p>The younger sister, Qingrou, wore a white dress and had a gentle, obedient demeanor typical of a soft younger sister.</p><p></p><p>Both had ample busts and were very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen could sense that the two possessed formidable inner cultivation, top-notch experts in the martial world at such a young age, which was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>According to Zhang the escort leader, these three had entered from the outside world earlier that day.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Dao master know any spells?" the young man in white asked.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I don't really know any spells, but I have plenty of strength and methods!" Yi Chen could only tell the truth, as he indeed did not know spells.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yi Chen's words, the young man in white did not sound disdainful, but continued in a gentle voice:</p><p></p><p>"Dao master, it's getting late today. Zhushao, Qingrou and I will go to the neighboring courtyard to meditate and regulate our inner energy. If anything happens, you can call out loudly, and I will rush over immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, rest assured."</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, or the day after at the latest, I will definitely find the array formation of this town and break through the fog, leading everyone to escape."</p><p></p><p>"As for the rumors of entering dreams that the townspeople mentioned, it's best if everyone avoids falling asleep. The evil spirit in this town has bizarre abilities, so it's better not to take any unnecessary risks."</p><p></p><p>Ning Feixue's snowy white robe and elegant demeanor were heart-rending.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......" You...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator around the same level as Lin Baihu, yet he actually asks me for help?"</p><p></p><p>Because Yi Chen concealed his aura, ordinary people could not discern his true cultivation base and just thought he was a robust Taoist priest skilled in physical training. </p><p></p><p>However, Ning Feixue meant well. Yi Chen naturally smiled and replied, "Then I thank you, Sir."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it's the same for you. If anything unusual happens, just call out loudly and this poor Taoist will rush over immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen spoke sincerely and respectfully, as one should respect others to the same degree they respect you.</p><p></p><p>However, his words irritated the two beauties beside Ning Feixue.</p><p></p><p>The elder sister Zhu Sha only slightly furrowed her brows without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>But the younger sister Qing Rou displayed a feistiness unmatched by her appearance. Wrinkling her jade-like nose, she sneered, "Some wild Taoist priest thinking he can rescue my brother Feixue, how laughable."</p><p></p><p>"You need to show some respect, Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Feixue is a cultivator well-versed in spells."</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand? He's an awakened cultivator who can use magic."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......"</p><p></p><p>"Qing Rou, mind your manners," the elder sister Zhu Sha gently rebuked.</p><p></p><p>Qing Rou stuck out her tongue mischievously at her sister's rebuke and hid behind her.</p><p></p><p>Ning Feixue also gave Yi Chen an apologetic look. With a surge of spiritual power, he levitated three feet off the ground, standing with his hands behind his back and pacing in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>His robes fluttered as he strolled and chanted:</p><p></p><p>"The jade brush struggles to depict the myriad scenes, the Cai Yan's laments unbound.</p><p>Entering this world, I tread not the path of mortal strife; leaving the mundane, I brush off the falling peach blossoms.</p><p>Parting with books, I cannot cross the sea of people.</p><p>In my idle hours, I dance the sword, freezing the frost; only the Flying Snow dances alone in wild abandon.</p><p>Free and at ease like myself, a poem, a sword, calming the raging winds and waves."</p><p></p><p>Step by step, verse by verse, Ning Feixue soon caught up with the two sisters Zhu Sha and Qing Rou.</p><p></p><p>The peerless beauties' eyes sparkled with little stars, their cheeks flushed red, who knows what they were thinking.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......" *Damn, this guy is such a show-off, going to such lengths just to impress the girls? With your meager cultivation, can you even keep this up for five minutes? Truly a big bird in a small forest...*</p><p></p><p>After the three disappeared from sight, Zhang Biaohead mysteriously carried a wine jug and sneakily approached Yi Chen, whispering:</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, which of the two sisters do you think is no longer a virgin?"</p><p></p><p>The little escort archers behind Zhang Biaohead also pricked up their ears.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's expression stiffened: "Zhang Biaohead, that's enough."</p><p></p><p>Before Zhang Biaohead could speak, Yi Chen suddenly changed his expression and laughed: "I bet it's the younger sister who has already been thoroughly conquered. The elder sister is still a virgin."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, how would you, a monk, know about..." Zhang Biaohead's mouth gaped open in astonishment.  </p><p></p><p>The escort archers behind him also gaped in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen patted Zhang Biaohead's shoulder without a word, leaving them all with a mysterious smile.</p><p></p><p>Tsk! Trying to test the Daoist with such questions? Looking down on me?</p><p></p><p>The Daoist speaks frankly - he has even guessed their room layouts. If he revealed it, wouldn't your jaws just drop to the floor?</p><p></p><p>A bunch of small fries!</p><p></p><p>Four chapters, 10,000 words achieved!

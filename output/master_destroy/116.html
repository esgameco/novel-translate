        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious stone chamber of Wujiang Manor.</p><p></p><p>A young man, bare-chested, swallowed a bright red pellet and sat in meditation, regulating his breath. </p><p></p><p>After his inner power simmered, red vapors emerged from the top of his head, constantly transforming as if trying to coalesce into a red lotus flower. However, after several transformations, the red lotus on his head ultimately failed to take shape, leaving him one step away from success. A mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the stone chamber's door was pushed open by a middle-aged scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Teng'er, are you alright? Did your breakthrough fail?" The middle-aged scholar hurried to the young man's side and helped him up, saying worriedly,</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination provided by the Night Luminous Pearl, a teardrop-shaped bloody mark on the left side of the young man's chest was particularly eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, Father. I still haven't been able to break through Refining Qi into Spirit and enter the True Man Realm."</p><p></p><p>"A precious Blood Soul Pellet has been wasted in vain."</p><p></p><p>"When the next Netherworld time comes, I'm afraid I won't be able to endure it, Father." The young man said weakly. After speaking, he clenched his fist tightly, his face filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>"How unfair are the Heavenly Laws! If I had just half a year more to temper my inner power, I would definitely be able to break through to the True Man Realm. Why did I fall short at the last step?"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, in just a month, I'll have to enter that ghostly place again."</p><p></p><p>Recalling his previous experience in the Netherworld, the young man couldn't help but show a hint of fear on his face.</p><p></p><p>Last time he barely escaped from the Netherworld alive with a touch of luck. This time, having failed to break through to the True Man Realm, he would likely not be able to escape that calamity.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>"Teng'er, you must pull yourself together. You cannot give up, there is still a chance. I only have you as my son. Your mother passed away early, and on her deathbed, she entrusted me to take good care of you. You're only in your fifties, yet you've already reached the late stage of Refining Qi into Spirit cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"My son, you have the bearing of a True Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Teng'er, don't be afraid. As long as you kill one more Mark Bearer and seize their remaining time, giving you another half a year, you will definitely succeed in your breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"Within a month, even if I descend into the Yellow Springs, I will find someone with a Netherworld Mark for you to extend your life!"</p><p></p><p>"If there are no more Blood Soul Pellets, I will refine one for you, even if I have to kill thousands or tens of thousands of people to find the ingredients."</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber, the middle-aged scholar's anguished, repressed, enraged, and resolute roars echoed in the enclosed space.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yaoguandu is an ancient and remote village.</p><p></p><p>It was formed several hundred years ago when a group of Yao surnamed herbalists fled and settled in a mountain valley near the Wujiang River, gradually developing and prospering into an ancient town.</p><p></p><p>Because it was situated along the Wujiang River, the people of Yaoguandu gradually changed their way of life, making a living primarily through herb gathering and fishing as a supplementary income.</p><p></p><p>Inside a small wooden house in Yaoguandu.</p><p></p><p>Several nights ago, under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Gouwar held his breath, not daring to exhale. His eyes were bloodshot as he huddled in a corner of the house. Whenever he felt sleepy, he would grab the embroidery needle beside him and stab it hard into his thigh.</p><p></p><p>Only the sharp pain could alleviate his drowsiness.</p><p></p><p>At this point, his arms and thighs were covered with countless bloody needle pricks, making one's skin crawl just looking at them.</p><p></p><p>"Can't sleep!"</p><p></p><p>"If I fall asleep, I'll have that dream!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll dream of the old chief!"</p><p></p><p>"So many people have died already, I don't want to die, I don't want to die!"</p><p></p><p>"Old chief, spare us! Spare Yaoguandu! So many have died already!"</p><p></p><p>"We were wrong."</p><p></p><p>After stabbing himself with the needle and swallowing some stimulating herbs, Gouwar sat in the corner of the house with a vacant stare, his fingernails digging deep into the flesh of his palms, not caring about the blood oozing out from under his nails.</p><p></p><p>If only there was a regret medicine in this world!</p><p></p><p>If only they hadn't done that on that day, perhaps things wouldn't have deteriorated to this extent.</p><p></p><p>But alas, Yaoguandu, a village of herbalists, had no regret medicine, nor could they gather any.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gouwar's thoughts drifted back more than ten days ago.</p><p></p><p>To the day the old chief passed away.</p><p></p><p>The old chief's passing had become a taboo in Yaoguandu, and no one was willing to mention it. The clansmen silently held a burial ceremony for the old chief.</p><p></p><p>The dead were gone, but the living remained.</p><p></p><p>Seven days had passed, and the villagers had thought it was just an ordinary seventh-day ceremony for a deceased elder. Little did they know that from this day onward, strange and ominous events would start occurring one after another in Yaoguandu.</p><p></p><p>At first, it was just livestock like chickens and ducks dying inexplicably, their bodies covered in a thin layer of frost, extremely eerie.</p><p></p><p>The villagers began discussing whether it was some strange disease or if an evil spirit had come to the town.</p><p></p><p>On the second day, a pair of gray cloth shoes was found by villagers at the Wujiang ferry crossing. That day, the entire Wujiang ferry area was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Because those were the old chief's shoes, and along with the shoes that had washed ashore, four crooked words appeared on the bank - "I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>The words were written so crudely, they didn't seem to be from a human hand, but rather from some wild beast.</p><p></p><p>If you scattered some rice on the ground, even chickens could peck out better-looking words.</p><p></p><p>Around the words was black muddy soil, which the Yaoguandu villagers who fished in the Wujiang River immediately recognized as coming from the riverbed.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The mud deep within, for some unknown reason, had appeared on the shore. </p><p></p><p>On that day, the little vitality that the Yaoguan Town had barely recovered was knocked down again, even worse than the day when the old patriarch died, like a duck whose throat was being strangled.</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent and closed their doors to discuss fervently.</p><p></p><p>After all, the events of that day were truly unsavory, which they could not speak of openly. </p><p></p><p>At this time, some were secretly discussing whether they should find a Daoist priest to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the old patriarch coming back or not, it was most likely an evil spirit that had arrived. It would be better to simply find a Daoist priest to exorcise this evil spirit, otherwise, their days would be unbearable.</p><p></p><p>This idea initially only spread within a small private circle, but later, it spread like a plague throughout the entire Yaoguan Ferry, gaining almost the entire town's support.</p><p></p><p>Repaying kindness with enmity!</p><p></p><p>Many people could not face the current situation and immediately came up with this idea. Although a small number of people opposed it, under the spread of panic, it could not cause any ripples.</p><p></p><p>The shoes of the old patriarch, who had long died deep in the Wujiang River, suddenly appeared, along with the strange words "I'm back" and the corpses of chickens and ducks that died inexplicably in the town, which truly terrified them.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople, whether rich or poor, pooled a large sum of money, preparing to go to Wujiang Prefecture to find a powerful cultivator to come and slay the demon.</p><p></p><p>The person left on the third day in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Hurrying with an ox cart, carrying valuables, and even two old ginseng roots that had been aged for three to five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>These old ginseng roots were the old patriarch's belongings.</p><p></p><p>When the old patriarch was young, he was the most formidable herb gatherer in Yaoguan Ferry. During his travels, he had brought back a third-rate martial arts manual called "The Gecko Roaming Dragon Skill."</p><p></p><p>Although the skill was not very powerful, it was extremely suitable for the herb-gathering profession of the Yaoguan Ferry people. He had selflessly taught the entire skill to the people of his clan.</p><p></p><p>Those old ginseng roots were probably obtained by the old patriarch by chance in some remote location.</p><p></p><p>Since the old patriarch's children and wife had all passed away due to accidents, and he had been living alone for many years, his belongings were discovered and placed in the ancestral hall of the town for worship after his death when the townspeople were arranging his funeral.</p><p></p><p>Now, they came in handy, to be used to persuade the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, the plan to go out and invite a master was doomed to fail as soon as they began to prepare.</p><p></p><p>The people who went out returned in less than an hour.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were ashen, as if they had lost their parents.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, Yaoguan Ferry is finished," the leader, Official Daniu, said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the strongest advocates for going out to invite a Daoist priest and the leader of the team. He had quite a reputation in the town, especially among the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>His "Gecko Roaming Dragon Skill" had already reached the level of a second-rate master, and he had mastered the skill to a great extent.</p><p></p><p>The only reason that could scare him so badly was that when they had just left the town, a faint white mist had risen around them. The further they went, the thicker the mist became, to the point where they could hardly see anything.</p><p></p><p>With no way to go out, they could only hold hands and return the way they came.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, as they returned, the mist in front of them gradually thinned out.</p><p></p><p>Delighted, they decided to continue forward, but the mist suddenly became thick again.</p><p></p><p>After repeating this three times, Official Daniu lost all hope and led the young and strong back to Yaoguan Ferry.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, the townspeople of Yaoguan Ferry became even more apprehensive. Even those who did not believe in the supernatural tried to go out, but in the end, they all returned with dejected faces.</p><p></p><p>They could not go out!</p><p></p><p>Yaoguan Ferry had become an isolated place.</p><p></p><p>They could enter but not leave.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere of panic was fermenting, and a visible oppressive aura hung over Yaoguan Ferry.</p><p></p><p>The small town was becoming increasingly desperate.</p><p></p><p>It was then that the panic-stricken people finally remembered the old patriarch's kindness.</p><p></p><p>Because many of them had learned the "Gecko Roaming Dragon Skill" directly from the old patriarch's hands, and the old patriarch had treated them like his own children.</p><p></p><p>Before practicing this skill, more than a dozen people from Yaoguan Ferry would die each year from falling off cliffs while gathering herbs.</p><p></p><p>This meant that at least a dozen families in Yaoguan Ferry would lose their young and strong pillars every year.</p><p></p><p>However, after practicing the "Gecko Roaming Dragon Skill," this number of deaths dropped sharply to one or two, and their income also increased.</p><p></p><p>Over the decades, it could be said that almost every family in Yaoguan Ferry owed the old patriarch a life.</p><p></p><p>That night, everyone in Yaoguan Ferry fell into reflection.</p><p></p><p>Some people secretly went to the old patriarch's grave and wept bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Some people went to the shore of the Wujiang Ferry and killed chickens and burned yellow paper offerings.</p><p></p><p>But those who went to the ferry shore were horrified to find that the old patriarch's old cloth shoes that had been washed ashore by the river... were gone.</p><p></p><p>A muddy trail of footprints appeared on the muddy ground by the shore.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the direction of the footsteps.</p><p></p><p>It was heading towards the town of Yaoguan Ferry.</p><p></p><p>At this time, four twisted, blood-red characters appeared in the muddy ground on the shore.</p><p></p><p>They were formed by a pile of mangled corpses of river fish that had been gnawed apart by some strange creature.</p><p></p><p>"I, have come in!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

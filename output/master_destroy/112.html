        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>As he took a step forward, the scene before him caused Yi Chen's pupils to contract like needlepoints. </p><p></p><p>He saw that under the night sky, a bizarre cloud like a burning fire lotus had appeared on the horizon. Its colors were brilliant, as if melting a hole in the black night sky. </p><p></p><p>Wispy blood-red threads dripped down from the clouds above, falling onto the Dragon River, sending a strange undulation spreading through the air.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the former prosperous scene of the Chen Family Manor was gone, replaced by broken walls and ruins everywhere. </p><p></p><p>Many servants and constables with ghastly pale faces were continuously carrying corpses and digging up bodies from underground.</p><p></p><p>In front of Yi Chen, a woman wearing a black armor suit and strange tall metal combat boots stood motionless with her back to him, gazing into the distance. In her hand, she gripped a ferocious bagua halberd from which blood was still dripping down onto the muddy ground.</p><p></p><p>This person could be none other than Qian Yue Ru.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen dispersed his true yang spirit body and strode over to stand before Qian Yue Ru. In a moment, his brows couldn't help but furrow.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Qian Yue Ru's face was deathly pale, her eyes misted over in a daze. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Yi Chen approach, a hint of life finally appeared on Qian Yue Ru's face as her red lips parted slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, you've come out?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I was schemed against by a few stinking bugs for a bit, but I just finished chopping them to death. That's not important, what's going on with you? And what's happening here now?" Yi Chen said indifferently, but his chest unconsciously puffed out slightly.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yue Ru sighed, directly sitting down on the ground uncaringly, and began softly explaining the whole story to Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>After about half an incense stick's time, Yi Chen finally understood the whole situation. </p><p></p><p>Originally Qian Yue Ru was working late at night in the Zhen'an Ministry office reviewing documents. But then she received an urgent flying message from Mo Yu, which made her fly into a rage. She immediately led the elite forces of the Zhen'an Ministry and rushed over to the Chen Family Manor with weapons in hand.</p><p></p><p>She was still young with little experience, and as the daughter of a True Lord, everyone respected and admired her. But that didn't mean she was stupid - quite the opposite, she was actually highly intelligent.</p><p></p><p>She had naturally noticed the ominous atmosphere over the past few days. But all the reports submitted showed everything was normal, and no one around her had warned her, so she thought she was just overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>However, Mo Yu's urgent flying message shattered that facade.  </p><p></p><p>The brilliant Qian Yue Ru instantly guessed the general situation, but she never dreamed the Chen Family would dare to go to such extremes.</p><p></p><p>By the time she arrived at the Chen Family Manor, a blood-red fire lotus cloud had appeared in the sky. </p><p></p><p>The blood sacrifice formation was complete.</p><p></p><p>The ground collapsed, revealing the underground chamber beneath the Chen Family's manor - a scene of human purgatory.</p><p></p><p>In a rage, with her formidable cultivation and command of the Zhen'an Ministry's elite forces, Qian Yue Ru directly led them to plow through all the demonic creatures and Chen Family members within the manor grounds.</p><p></p><p>This was the scene Yi Chen witnessed upon emerging.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, the Demonic Dragon Daoist's cave abode has manifested in the world. Will you enter it?"</p><p></p><p>"My advice is you'd better not go."</p><p></p><p>Qian Yue Ru bit her red lips, seeming to have some unspoken difficulty, then sighed and said vaguely:</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence I received, when the cave abode manifested, the top Realized cultivators from the Red Borough, Yin Mountain Manor, and Yellow Springs Sect joined forces and entered it."</p><p></p><p>"And just before you came out earlier, Daoist, one of my Zhen'an Ministry's flying ships also slipped into that cave abode."</p><p></p><p>"One of my father's good friends from the senior generation was on that ship. He sent word telling me not to go in."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "...It's that dark?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yi Chen was instantly chilled with shock. He really hadn't expected that all his previous speculations had become true prophecies.</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups of the Zhen'an Ministry really did have the intention of fishing in troubled waters. The reason they didn't immediately provide support wasn't that they couldn't, but that they were unwilling.</p><p></p><p>They had actually been secretly monitoring the situation all along.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could they have coincidentally arrived so promptly and directly sent a flying ship into the cave?</p><p></p><p>It was so dark, truly blacker than a grandmother's bound feet.</p><p></p><p>They were all angling for fish, and there was no telling how much hidden maneuvering and calculation lay behind this matter.</p><p></p><p>The more Yi Chen pondered, the more he felt the depths of this affair were unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>He increasingly felt there must be some kind of tacit understanding or wager-like deal between the highest levels of the two sides.</p><p></p><p>The Yellow Springs Sect's forces weren't as powerful as the Zhen'an Ministry, so they directly brought in the similarly sized Red Borough and Yin Mountain Manor. Even the previous talk of a "traitor" leaking intelligence was false - their side was simply joining hands, intending to snatch profit from the chaos.</p><p></p><p>As for the Zhen'an Ministry's side? Naturally, their ambitions were even greater.</p><p></p><p>They didn't want the bad reputation, but they also wanted the treasures. They even wanted to devour the batch of top experts that had entered from the Yellow Springs Sect, Red Borough, and Yin Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>With chaotic omens initially appearing in the world, the reigning dynasty urgently needed a batch of top experts' heads to awe the world and show who was the true overlord.</p><p></p><p>While the sect powers naturally wanted to shake the millennial Great Yue Dynasty's supreme status.</p><p></p><p>Now that the crisis was manifesting in the world, anyone wanting to grow more powerful had to disrupt the current landscape of vested interests.</p><p></p><p>As is well known, disturbing vested interests is even more difficult than touching the soul itself.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the entity consuming the most benefits in the world was naturally the reigning dynasty - no superpower could develop freely without dealing with the reigning dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Thinking even deeper, Yi Chen realized the Demonic Dragon Daoist's abode was likely just a trial confrontation in the opposing positions of the sects and the dynasty - a signal, like a weathervane.</p><p></p><p>Seeing whether the east wind would overpower the west, or if the west wind would truly rise up to seek greater status.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the Demonic Dragon Daoist's abode would turn people's brains to dog brains...</p><p></p><p>The treasures were no longer the most important thing. The political significance represented by this struggle, the signal it contained, was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Qian Yue Ru's senior martial uncle had specially instructed her not to enter - he probably knew the Demonic Dragon Daoist's cave abode was simply a meat grinder.</p><p></p><p>With killing intent blinding them, even the status of a True Lord's daughter wouldn't be enough protection.</p><p></p><p>Expanding his thinking further, in other regions there were likely other challengers issuing invitations to battle the Zhen'an Ministry as well.</p><p></p><p>The moment this occurred to Yi Chen, his scalp went numb as he shook his head vehemently at Qian Yue Ru.</p><p></p><p>This kind of hellish scene...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Whoever loves to go down, under such a huge information gap, he'd better not get involved in the treasure hunt. </p><p></p><p>"Daoist master, why do you think they would do such a thing?" Qian Yue Ru bit her red lips, staring at Yi Chen, as if seeking an answer from him, or as if asking herself.</p><p></p><p>The "they" she referred to were not the Red House, the Underworld Sect, or the Yin Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>But the Zhen'an Ministry.</p><p></p><p>With these words and her current demeanor, Yi Chen realized that this young Celestial Lord's daughter, the Thousand Garrison Governess, had a mental breakdown, feeling a sense of collapsed faith.</p><p></p><p>She had probably been inculcated with the values of the Zhen'an Ministry throughout her previous life:</p><p></p><p>The Zhen'an Ministry.</p><p>Stabilizing the world, reassuring the people.</p><p></p><p>The current situation had shattered her illusions, and her thoughts had become narrow-minded.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yi Chen felt a bit sorry for this well-born celestial heir.</p><p></p><p>Considering that Qian Yue Ru had been diligent and kind-hearted, he sighed, plopped down on the ground, and decided to give some guidance to this celestial heir in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Garrison Governess, what do you think the world is like today?" </p><p></p><p>"Or let me put it another way, what is the world?"</p><p></p><p>Qian Yue Ru looked at Yi Chen with puzzlement, as if not understanding why he asked such a question.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen ignored her gaze, his expression turning cold as he answered his own question:</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Garrison Governess, you're mistaken. The world is not as good as you imagine, but it's not as bad as you think, either."</p><p></p><p>"What is the world?"</p><p></p><p>"The entire Great Yue Dynasty is nothing more than a few palaces and mansions. Everyone eats from separate pots."</p><p></p><p>"Each region nurtures its own feudal lords."</p><p></p><p>"The aristocratic clans are one force, the military is another, the imperial family is the biggest aristocratic clan and also a force, and the Zhen'an Ministry is yet another force."</p><p></p><p>"Among these factions, each has its own interests and demands, united under one banner, walking together."</p><p></p><p>"You should never personify a particular force and imagine it as too good or too bad."</p><p></p><p>"Each of these forces is composed of all sorts of different people."</p><p></p><p>"Among them, there are good and bad people. Sometimes, you can't even simply describe a person as good or bad."</p><p></p><p>"So, Thousand Garrison Governess, step back and view this world from a third-party perspective. Don't have too high expectations of certain people or things, and you'll be able to live much more easily. At least, you won't be disappointed."</p><p></p><p>"The world has always been like this, neither too good nor too bad."</p><p></p><p>"Look, in this blood sacrifice incident, there are disgraceful scoundrels like the Chen family, but there are also upright martyrs like Mo Yu Bai Hu."</p><p></p><p>"Be open-minded. The foundation supporting this world is actually people like Mo Bai Hu. Although their cultivation is not outstanding, they are numerous, not relying on just you, the Thousand Garrison Governess."</p><p></p><p>"That's the way of the world. How could you, the Thousand Garrison Governess, single-handedly purify the jade firmament and pacify the demons and evil people in the world?"</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult." Yi Chen sighed, giving Qian Yue Ru a dose of talk therapy. He had already decided that once his injuries healed in a day or two, he would make his escape.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of everyone's attention being focused on the Demonic Dragon Daoist's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>He would escape swiftly and steadily.</p><p></p><p>The danger was high, and the benefits were low. He wouldn't take this job.</p><p></p><p>"Too difficult? So the Daoist master means there is still a way!" Qian Yue Ru suddenly spoke, glancing at Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Yi Chen glanced at Qian Yue Ru and continued his talk therapy.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stood up, directly manifesting his Yang Spirit Body, a three-meter-tall Daoist apparition bending over with a huge face looming close to Qian Yue Ru's palm-sized little face.</p><p></p><p>Under Qian Yue Ru's wide-eyed, ghostly gaze, Yi Chen laughed loudly:</p><p></p><p>"If you want to change things, you must be powerful enough!"</p><p></p><p>"This penniless Daoist has made some progress, but I'm still not powerful enough!"</p><p></p><p>"Dao friend Qian, you're not powerful enough either!"</p><p></p><p>"Only if you, Dao friend Qian, are invincible in the world, the most powerful in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Then you can beat the world into the shape you imagine."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be fooled by those corrupt Confucian scholars, Dao friend."</p><p></p><p>"The trump card of the wise is force. If words don't work, then beat them into submission."</p><p></p><p>"What use is studying literature? Beating them until they can't get up is the way to peace and salvation."</p><p></p><p>"Whoever doesn't obey you, whoever doesn't act according to your imagination, just keep beating them, hammering them into the shape you want. If that doesn't work, then send them to the afterlife directly."</p><p></p><p>"Like this wave of ghostly events at the Dragon River Manor, if you were powerful enough, Dao friend Qian, you could have found them all and killed them from the very beginning, solving the problem in the bud, right?"</p><p></p><p>The life mentor Daoist Yi gently guided and reasoned.</p><p></p><p>He even showed off his ferocious back muscles.</p><p></p><p>"Become powerful? Keep striving to become more powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Powerful enough to impose your will on this world?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct!" Yi Chen nodded approvingly like a teacher instructing a child.</p><p></p><p>"Good! I must rouse myself. I must become even stronger than my father."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, such things must never happen in my jurisdiction."</p><p></p><p>"Whoever defies me, I'll behead them."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Daoist master, for resolving my doubts today!"</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of light appeared in Qian Yue Ru's eyes as she abruptly stood up as well.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>"Power! Power! Power!"</p><p></p><p>"With such domineering ambition! With such wild aspiration! What can possibly obstruct you?"</p><p></p><p>"I dare not even imagine your future prospects, Dao friend."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen wholeheartedly praised and affirmed her.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yue Ru had the full support from her Celestial Lord father, so her future was indeed unlimited, unlike him, a lone cultivator who could only rely on his own bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Alas, that's just how the world is.</p><p></p><p>Unfair.</p><p></p><p>"That's all. This penniless Daoist needs to go to another courtyard to heal my injuries. Farewell, Dao friend!" Yi Chen dispersed his Yang Spirit Body, patted the dust off his bottom, waved at Qian Yue Ru, and slipped away.</p><p></p><p>People only need an excuse to become motivated, but whether they can actually achieve it is another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>Hasn't Yi Chen also been trudging forward under shackles and hardship?</p><p></p><p>But he has always lived with great vigor!</p><p></p><p>Thank you to everyone who voted today. It's almost midnight, so I'll give a collective thanks tomorrow. Good night, everyone.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Even with Yichen's speed, it was not until the wee hours that he barely arrived at the prefectural city of Ping'an. </p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, people differ in their fates, and goods differ in how they are disposed of.</p><p></p><p>The city walls of Ping'an City were naturally much more magnificent than those of Fengxun County, reaching over ten meters high. People came and went incessantly, with travelers and merchants streaming endlessly. </p><p></p><p>Yichen walked along the long street of Ping'an City. For a moment, carriages and horses filled the scene. The shops lining both sides of the long street were continuous, with banners and flags fluttering fiercely in the wind, making it extraordinarily lively.</p><p></p><p>Little Meow, crouching on Yichen's shoulder, was also extremely excited, meowing nonstop, looking here and there, finding everything novel.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what Little Meow looked at the most were the street vendors selling crispy fish.</p><p></p><p>The fish, about a finger long with protruding mouths and gutted bellies, were fished out of the Clear Water River. They were strung on bamboo skewers, deep-fried in oil, sprinkled with sauce and scallions, then dipped in a secret, rich broth.</p><p></p><p>Deliciously fragrant, the aroma wafted for miles.</p><p></p><p>Little Meow meowed urgently.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow" (Father, I want to eat this.)</p><p></p><p>However, Yichen was completely unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Little Meow, these street stalls are not good to eat from. Who knows what vicious things have been added. You're growing, so you can't eat this. Later, Father will take you to a wealthy family's home for a big meal."</p><p></p><p>Little Meow: "No, I'm not afraid. I want to eat it."</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "Then will you listen?"</p><p></p><p>Little Meow: "I'll be very obedient, Father."</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "Oh, then obey me. We're not eating it."</p><p></p><p>Little Meow: "......"</p><p></p><p>Little Meow, unaware of the world's dangers, was immediately led into Yichen's logic despite being only a few days old.</p><p></p><p>Its mouth puffed up, swelling like a pufferfish.</p><p></p><p>After scratching at Yichen's hair with its paws a few times, it dejectedly watched the other street food with a disheartened little cat face, occasionally twitching its nose.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Little Meow, Yichen naturally appeared much more composed.</p><p></p><p>All it knows is eating, how can it accomplish great things?</p><p></p><p>Cats will be cats, their nature is hard to change.</p><p></p><p>He was different.</p><p></p><p>He...looked at beautiful ladies.</p><p></p><p>As befitting a prefectural city, there were indeed many beautiful ladies, with graceful figures as gentle as water. In just ten short minutes, he saw quite a few young ladies walking as gracefully as willow branches swaying in the wind.</p><p></p><p>He also saw quite a few who were well-endowed.</p><p></p><p>Truly shocking.</p><p></p><p>How were they developed!</p><p></p><p>Of course, with Daoist Yichen's cultivation, he naturally would not do something as uncouth as letting his eyes linger on others.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered the wondrous use of the Fourth Level Yin-Yang Celestial Eye Technique.</p><p></p><p>Using the Heart's Eye Reflection at Level 1 on beautiful ladies was simply a divine skill.</p><p></p><p>Although Yichen appeared to be looking straight ahead without turning his gaze, in reality, all the scenery around him had already been presented in his mind in a 3D model-like view.</p><p></p><p>So, being so busy, how could he have time to buy Little Meow some fish treats?</p><p></p><p>Interest is the best teacher.</p><p></p><p>Through constant experimentation, Yichen became increasingly adept at using the Heart's Eye Reflection skill.</p><p></p><p>This ability essentially recreated the surrounding scene in 3D, with a very unique perspective.</p><p></p><p>Truly, looking at it from different angles gave vastly different views of mountains and peaks, near and far, high and low.</p><p></p><p>The love of beauty is innate to all humans.</p><p></p><p>As a normal person, Yichen naturally also loved beauty...of women.</p><p></p><p>It was just that after a traumatic experience in his previous life, he had already decided not to get involved in romantic relationships.</p><p></p><p>Women would only affect the speed of his sword drawing.</p><p></p><p>Don't ask, the answer is having a heart sealed with cement.</p><p></p><p>Even Old Mo, who had killed fish at the Dalunfa supermarket for ten years, did not have a heart as cold as his.</p><p></p><p>However, not getting involved in romantic relationships and not looking at beautiful women were two different matters - he had always kept this hobby.</p><p></p><p>It was like those men and women in the previous life who clamored about being afraid of marriage and not loving anyone.</p><p></p><p>And then what?</p><p></p><p>The spring breeze blew for ten miles down Yangzhou Road, lifting the pearl curtains to send danmaku comments.</p><p></p><p>Don't you see that live streaming rooms for coconut juice have been divided into separate scenes for men and women?</p><p></p><p>Internet live streaming rooms were almost like cloud-based brothels.</p><p></p><p>This was the empowerment and transformation of traditional industries by the Internet Plus.</p><p></p><p>In the past, even an exceptional courtesan could at most serve three to five clients, which was already considered remarkable among women.</p><p></p><p>Young men could not even take on as many clients as courtesans.</p><p></p><p>But now? Good heavens, a single live streaming room could have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of viewers.</p><p></p><p>This empowerment greatly increased productivity!</p><p></p><p>For the earning speed of traditional industries, it was simply a devastating blow.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's former colleague exclaimed that they could no longer go to bars or bathhouses now, as the quality had plummeted off a cliff.</p><p></p><p>When asked about the 8, 18, and 88 numbers, they had all gone into live streaming.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His former colleague was so angry that he even sold his Cadillac.</p><p></p><p>So to speak.</p><p></p><p>The pursuit of beauty is etched into human genes, it's not something to be proud or ashamed of. </p><p></p><p>However, humans are different from beasts, humans need to be rational and know how to restrain their desires.</p><p></p><p>Acts like leering at others, stalking, groping etc. that violate morality and laws are absolutely unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Only the weak bully those weaker than them.</p><p></p><p>For example, right in front of Yi Chen now was a burly, stout man who seemed overcome by animal instincts, shamelessly reaching his big hands towards the thighs of a young lady in a short skirt walking in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>It was the sound of bones breaking. </p><p></p><p>The burly man suddenly felt the world go dark around him.</p><p></p><p>A pair of huge hands like folding fans gripped his groping hand, crushing it instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!~~" </p><p></p><p>The burly man couldn't help but let out a pig-like shriek, a piercing pain shooting straight to the top of his head.</p><p></p><p>"You rascal, who are you? How dare you ruin my good time."</p><p></p><p>"My big brother is the leader of the Wild Boar Gang, if you've got guts, leave your name and we'll settle the score."</p><p></p><p>The burly man howled through the excruciating pain, tears streaming down.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen thought for a moment but didn't say a word, then broke one of the man's legs before floating away.</p><p></p><p>Scum like this are simply public enemies of men. It's people like him that ruin society.</p><p></p><p>If there are too many ruffians like this, who would dare wear short skirts?</p><p></p><p>Everyone would have to go out wrapped up like dumplings, with veils covering their faces. Then who would Yi Daoist get to admire?</p><p></p><p>This is simply intolerable. It harms the collective interests of men, he had to strike hard.</p><p></p><p>It was getting late, after the initial thrill wore off, Yi Chen bought a dried fish snack for the kitten from a street vendor. After asking for directions to the Wang residence, he strode briskly towards it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, halfway there Yi Chen's sharp senses detected a woman trying to traffick a child. The kind-hearted Yi Daoist gave her a light punishment, merely crushing her limbs and knocking out her fangs, before floating away, keeping a low profile for his good deeds. </p><p></p><p>A veritable scourge of evil, a companion of justice.</p><p></p><p>For some evildoers, death is not the greatest punishment. Living is worse than death.</p><p></p><p>As for retaliation from those behind the woman and the burly man, Yi Chen didn't give it a thought.</p><p></p><p>Did he cultivate so hard just to live like a turtle?</p><p></p><p>Tolerating this, holding back on that, always being overly cautious.</p><p></p><p>Shrinking back in fear even for small matters, what was the point of his arduous cultivation?</p><p></p><p>He worked hard to live freely and unrestrained!</p><p></p><p>The good are rewarded, the evil punished, only then can his mind be at peace.</p><p></p><p>Not just living for the sake of living, dragging on an insipid existence.</p><p></p><p>Life is but a fleeting breath, and that breath must flow smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he and Lin Zhenbei are sworn brothers now. If he can't even handle these trifles, it would be a real laughingstock.</p><p></p><p>He's not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he arrived at the Wang residence. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked up at the plaque, and in an instant his pupils contracted sharply.</p><p></p><p>With his heightened senses, he detected a faint trace of spectral energy within this county's Wang residence.</p><p></p><p>Though faint and barely detectable, it was still picked up by Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"There's actually a hint of spectral energy in a major household of this county? Is someone practicing spells or keeping ghosts in the residence?"</p><p></p><p>"Another chance to earn deep crimson merits?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen remained expressionless as he announced his arrival. An old butler then led him through the vermilion gates into the Wang residence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had a premonition that this visit to the Wangs to preside over funeral matters would likely take an unexpected turn again.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, just charge more."</p><p></p><p>"One thousand taels is only the fee for presiding over the funeral rites, other services will cost extra."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the esteemed patrons whose numbers end in 6369, Haitianwuya, Xiaofeigun Lailiao, Yuno99, number ending 4371, Likewuzhi Jianxiu, Kangyide Shushu, number ending 8441, Quanjiaoxxin, Kanshubujianqian, number ending 6257, number ending 1175, 1ooooo, number ending 5541, Xiaoxiangdada, Aikongxiangdexianyu, Zhushenshen, Yimengbuzhijiqianqiu, Riyigefendaren for their monthly tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to Huoxuzhemengdeyuanguo for the bonus.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to all patrons for following, see you tomorrow.</p>

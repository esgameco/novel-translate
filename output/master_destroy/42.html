        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Deep inside the Lanxiu Pavilion, two figures were still painstakingly setting up formations. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the white-robed female ghost's brows furrowed slightly and she stopped her movements.</p><p></p><p>"One of the patrolling puppet paper men in the front hall was killed. How did these cultivators in Fengyu County react so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now? It's a critical moment for the formation array. Should we stop and slaughter those people first?" </p><p></p><p>The mysterious person hesitated upon hearing this, then responded, "No need. My squad of paper men is already fully attacking to stall them. I've ordered Little White to lead the last squad of paper men to join too. Let's hurry and complete the pulling array formation, lest we have too many distractions through the night."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why, but I have an uneasy feeling in my heart. It's better we quickly finish setting up the pulling grand formation."</p><p></p><p>After the white-robed female ghost finished speaking, she waved her jade arm, and a paper man over three meters tall suddenly appeared by her side. Beside the tall paper man were more than twenty small paper men over one meter tall.</p><p></p><p>She took out a pair of red scissors from her person, grabbed a sheet of red paper, and in a flash made a few snipping sounds as she cut out a pair of deep red eyes and pasted them onto the tall paper man's head.</p><p></p><p>Two red lights shone from the tall paper man's face, like red searchlights.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed female ghost looked at the paper men before her, pondered for a moment, and to be safe, also imbued the blades of many paper men with vicious poisons.</p><p></p><p>"Kill all living things within the mist, paper demons!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed female ghost growled her orders to the tall paper man amidst the fog.</p><p></p><p>After a round of spellcasting, the tall paper man fully awakened, instantly emanating an astonishing demonic aura. It knelt on one knee before the white-robed female ghost, showing its submission.</p><p></p><p>"As you wish, my master."</p><p></p><p>It surveyed the surroundings, as if sensing something, then took large strides leading the small paper man squad towards the front hall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the mysterious person couldn't help but reveal a relaxed smile: "Red Scissors, your paper-cutting sorcery is becoming increasingly formidable."</p><p></p><p>"This tall paper demon is tough-skinned and hardy. Even for me, it would take at least the time to drink a cup of tea before I could subdue it."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Great Dharma Protector values you so much, even using the Subduing Spirit Commanding Troops method to imprint you with a slave seal."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the white-robed female ghost's face darkened: "That's just how it is."</p><p></p><p>"Let's hurry and set up the formation."</p><p></p><p>She was originally a female ghost in this desolate ancient manor, accidentally encountered by the Great Dharma Protector of the Corpse Soul Cult who saw her considerable spiritual nature and superb aptitude. Unlike those idiotic ghosts whose minds were addled by being consumed by negative energy, only knowing how to eat, kill, and slaughter, he brought her back to the Corpse Soul Cult using the Subduing Spirit method.</p><p></p><p>Within the cult, she received guidance in more profound techniques. Unlike before when she only knew some superficial innate spells and relied on instinct in battle.  </p><p></p><p>But at the same time, she also lost her freedom, with her life and death controlled by others.</p><p></p><p>After all, one cannot have everything for free in this world. You can't have this and that and more.</p><p></p><p>Ghosts are the same.</p><p></p><p>All gifts from fate come with a hidden price tag.</p><p></p><p>In the process of growth, gaining some things also means losing others.</p><p></p><p>This is the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, if this endeavor succeeds and I can smoothly take away the Corpse Soul Lord's left arm, the Great Dharma Protector will remove my slave seal and also teach me the Seizing Corpse Fixing Spirit technique. At that time..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I have to sacrifice all the accumulated paper men, it will be worth it, as long as it's successful."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed female ghost reined in her wandering thoughts, shook her messy dark tresses, and focused again on setting up the grand formation.  </p><p></p><p>It's almost done, about to be completed soon.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the first paper man squad had already begun directly clashing with Yi Chen and the others.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Yi Chen's earlier warning, everyone did not panic too much and fought steadily.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu and Yi Chen were at the very front, like two large rocks in a stream, blocking the continuous assaults of the paper man squad.</p><p></p><p>Water Moon Grandmaster, Lotus Blossom Monk, and Clear Void Daoist covered the rear, fending off paper men trying to sneak attack from the sides.</p><p></p><p>As the battle progressed, the five-person squad's coordination became increasingly seamless.  </p><p></p><p>The number of paper men visibly decreased at a rapid pace.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, refreshing!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu laughed loudly as he beheaded a paper man in front of him with one sword stroke, then kicked away a paper man trying to sneak attack him with a vicious Duanzi Juexu Foot, sending it flying far away.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen caught a glimpse of this ruthless move from the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>However, this kick was useless, merely repelling the paper man. In the blink of an eye, it charged forward again wielding its large blade, utterly fearless of death.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With an appearance like that. </p><p></p><p>After all, paper people are not real humans, they wouldn't have such an obvious weakness.</p><p></p><p>"Pathetic."</p><p></p><p>Like a hot knife cutting through butter, Lin Baihu's battle sword, imbued with talisman spells, was exceptionally sharp. With one strike, he pierced through the last paper person charging at him, armor and all, leaving a chilling hole. He raised his sword and lightly chanted 'Swift Wind'. </p><p></p><p>A green stream of air suddenly appeared on his sword blade. </p><p></p><p>As soon as the airstream manifested, Lin Baihu's sword speed and strength instantly increased by a level.</p><p></p><p>Just as the paper person was pierced through the chest and tried to swing its sword at Lin Baihu, its movement still midair, its entire body was sliced in half vertically by Lin Baihu's upward strike.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's brows furrowed as he watched intently.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Baihu had boasted, he was indeed a master, highly experienced in battle with ingenious techniques.</p><p></p><p>Especially that final strike, it was truly stunning.  </p><p></p><p>Even with his current strength, hmm...</p><p></p><p>It seems after the Positive Polarity Transformation he could still cut Lin Baihu down, so no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha Buddha, I did not expect Lin Baihu to be a cultivator of both inner and outer cultivation paths. This monk is full of admiration."</p><p></p><p>Although Venerable Lianhua was just an awakened spirit through heretical means with mediocre aptitude, his discernment was exceptionally sharp, spotting the essence of Lin Baihu's final strike at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Dual Cultivation of Inner and Outer Paths.</p><p></p><p>"You flatter me," Lin Baihu responded humbly, but the triumphant look in his eyes betrayed his true feelings.</p><p></p><p>He glanced sidelong at Yi Chen, implying that if not provoked by the imposingly tall Abbot Yi Chengzi beside him, he would not have used his newly researched battle technique.</p><p></p><p>His competitive spirit was very strong.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu strived to be unsurpassed in life, cultivating the dual paths to perfection before making a final push into the Refining Qi and Essence Transformation realm.</p><p></p><p>Among his peers of the same level, he never wanted to be inferior.</p><p></p><p>In the previous battle, Yi Chen had exerted immense pressure on him, which he had noticed.</p><p></p><p>This Daoist Yi's sword techniques seemed ordinary, but his force was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>His strikes were as fast as lightning, and the paper people surrounding him lost limbs from mere grazes or were crippled from direct hits.</p><p></p><p>That peculiar deep purple inner force was especially potent.</p><p></p><p>"Abbot Yi Chengzi, what did you think of my final strike? Please critique it," Lin Baihu sheathed his sword and smiled at Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Exceptionally sharp, this poor monk admits inferiority," Yi Chen nodded slightly, thinking to himself that under the Positive Polarity Transformation, Lin Baihu would be cut down after at least three moves, not bad.</p><p></p><p>However, even if Yi Chen believed he could easily defeat Lin Baihu at full strength, he would not show it.</p><p></p><p>Not only would he not show it, he would even praise Lin Baihu further.</p><p></p><p>This was the mark of a mature member of society.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no money or vested interest involved, why bother arguing over temporary superiority?</p><p></p><p>This Lin Baihu, with his unkempt beard and middle-aged appearance, unexpectedly could not see through this level of cognitive bias, which was quite absurd.</p><p></p><p>As this thought crossed Yi Chen's mind, he was struck by a notion - could Lin Baihu actually be only eighteen years old?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he recalled letting the twelve-year-old Qi Gou Shi of the Evil Tiger Gang go in the past.</p><p></p><p>He scrutinized Lin Baihu from head to toe, with his scraggly beard and somewhat weathered face, undoubtedly a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yi Chen dismissed this idea.</p><p></p><p>By now, the first squad of paper people had been completely annihilated. Except for Venerable Qingxu, who was caught off guard by a fearless paper person and suffered a shallow cut on his hand, the others were all unharmed.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, they had achieved a complete victory.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu couldn't help but laugh heartily again.</p><p></p><p>"I laugh at the lack of wisdom of the mastermind behind this."</p><p></p><p>"They only knew to set an ambush, but if they had laced the weapons with poison, we would not have been able to defeat these paper people so easily."</p><p></p><p>"What do you fellow Daoists think?"</p><p></p><p>Amid the swirling mist, two red lights sped towards them.</p><p></p><p>"Baihu, don't say anymore," Venerable Qingxu urged anxiously.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The essence of all human social relationships is exchange. </p><p></p><p>In an exchange process, whoever needs the other party more will be able to take the initiative in the transaction.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yi Chen's words, Lin Zhenbei's face showed a pensive expression, and then he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"We're all ancient foxes, why play Liaozhai fiction?"</p><p></p><p>He decided to get straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist priest, it's over."</p><p></p><p>"You want the Zhen'an Office to take on the karmic consequences this time, and you're asking me for a favor, trying to create an obligation."</p><p></p><p>"This matter, is it appropriate?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen picked up two red dates from the table and lightly chewed them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, Lord of Thousands, the accounts are not calculated that way."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yi Chen's back was straight, his body leaning slightly forward.</p><p></p><p>"In this transaction, it's mutually beneficial for both of us. I need the Zhen'an Office to help me bear the karmic consequences this time, but there's not just you, Lord of Thousands, in the Zhen'an Office."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's muffled voice came, the words not heavy, the words not many, but it made Lin Zhenbei's heart skip a beat when he heard it.</p><p></p><p>Could he not hear the veiled threat in Yi Chen's words?</p><p></p><p>If you don't do it, there are others who will.</p><p></p><p>After all, his deputy was also a smiling tiger. If Yi Chen really made a deal with his deputy, then he would truly be at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Speak up, what treasure of mine has the Daoist priest set his eyes on?" Lin Zhenbei leaned back in his chair, spreading his hands, the meaning obvious - he admitted defeat.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yi Chen's eyes instantly lit up, and he hurriedly poured Lin Zhenbei another cup of tea with enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that many years ago, Lord of Thousands obtained an egg of an unknown spirit beast from an ancient ruin, and treasures it dearly."</p><p></p><p>"How about...making a sacrifice?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lin Zhenbei's face instantly darkened. He turned to look at his trusted aide.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, Daoist priest, you set me up earlier..."</p><p></p><p>However, before Lin Baihu could finish speaking, he was grabbed by the collar and dragged out by Lin Zhenbei. Five minutes later, after experiencing a dose of fatherly love, Lin Baihu returned with a bruised face, glaring resentfully at Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>Who says people in the countryside are honest?</p><p></p><p>The Yinlong Temple is located in the middle of nowhere where not even birds defecate.</p><p></p><p>The path to the Daoist temple is slippery, and people's hearts are even more complex.</p><p></p><p>"Yicheng Zi Daoist priest, I'll make the sacrifice. Tomorrow morning, I'll come again and bring that spirit beast egg. We can make the exchange then," Lin Zhenbei said in a gloomy voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile on Yi Chen's face became even brighter, and he hurriedly consoled the two of them.</p><p></p><p>He then launched into another round of intensive persuasion.</p><p></p><p>Things like, "I may make a small profit, but Lord of Thousands won't lose at all."</p><p></p><p>"Don't calculate the small accounts, calculate the big accounts."</p><p></p><p>"Integrate personal interests into the grand strategy of the court's development. Today, you'll establish great merit, and your future path will surely be smooth sailing. You're a talent, with upright roots and branches. The Zhen'an Office's rewards will not be lacking. Incredible skills, marvelous methods, heavenly talents, earthly treasures - even if thousands of gold are spent, they will return. What's the matter with a mere egg?"</p><p></p><p>And more like, "Father and son will be promoted together, the Zhen'an Office will spread wonderful stories, the court will send reports, and two generations' perseverance will move the Great Yue..."</p><p></p><p>After this barrage of persuasion, Lin Zhenbei and his son felt that they were being a bit ungrateful.</p><p></p><p>Yicheng Zi Daoist priest was such a great person. They had already won, they had won big time.</p><p></p><p>They had won so much more than this tall and sturdy Daoist priest, stronger than a bear.</p><p></p><p>After Yi Chen discussed the details with Lin Zhenbei and confirmed their agreement, he enthusiastically saw Lin Zhenbei and his son off outside the temple.</p><p></p><p>"Clear Wind, Bright Moon, is this how you handle matters?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you want to give Lord of Thousands and your dear elder brother Lin Zhengyi a few pounds of our Yinlong Temple's specialty chestnuts?"</p><p></p><p>"You really have no sense."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen pretended to be angry as he called out to Clear Wind and Bright Moon.</p><p></p><p>The two exquisitely beautiful little girls came out carrying two cowhide paper bags, waddling over.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Lin, this is for you."</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Thousands, these chestnuts are for you to eat."</p><p></p><p>However, before they could finish speaking, a sugar-coated chestnut landed on Clear Wind's head.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, why did you hit me?!" Clear Wind said aggrievedly, holding her head.</p><p></p><p>"Hitting you is already going easy on you."</p><p></p><p>"You ill-mannered, unlucky child, you can't call him Lord of Thousands, you should call him Uncle Lin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei: "..."</p><p>Lin Zhengyi: "..."</p><p></p><p>Watching the two leave, Yi Chen was still waving goodbye from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Come play again when you have time~"</p><p></p><p>Blown by the cold wind outside the temple, Lin Zhengyi felt that the side of his face that had been hit by his father's iron hammer of love didn't hurt as much anymore.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Zhenbei, who was walking in front, suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He slowed his pace.</p><p></p><p>He gazed gently at his beloved son. </p><p></p><p>"Son, have you learned it?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Learned what?" Lin Baihu asked with a wise look, not knowing what his father was referring to.</p><p></p><p>This time, unexpectedly, Lin Zhenbei did not make Lin Baihu feel the weight of fatherly love.</p><p></p><p>He found an open space, patted the ground next to him, beckoning Lin Baihu to sit beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Zhengyi, what do you think of Daoist Master Yichengzi from Yinlong Monastery?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhengyi pondered for a moment before saying, "I've inquired about him. This Daoist Master Yichengzi doesn't seem to have any bad reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Although he is quite calculating, he is also quite pitiful, supporting the entire monastery by himself. His master, Baiyunzi, was straightforward and upright. For him to pass the abbotship to Yichengzi, he can't be a bad person."</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, the Venerable One seems a bit greedy, but how many saints in this world are without selfish motives? Even if Daoist Master Yi is greedy, he ultimately saved the child's life."</p><p></p><p>"In this transaction, Daoist Master Yichengzi was not actually wrong. We did not lose out, but rather gained an advantage."  </p><p></p><p>"In general, I have a good impression of Daoist Master Yichengzi. Although greedy, when facing evil spirits, he dared to investigate with the child instead of shrinking away like Lingfeng Monastery."</p><p></p><p>Hearing his beloved son's words, Lin Zhenbei smiled and reached out to touch the large bump on Lin Zhengyi's head.</p><p></p><p>"Does it still hurt?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhengyi, I know you have a strong sense of justice and hate evil."</p><p></p><p>"This is good, but also bad."</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you, kindness and a sense of justice are both excellent and precious qualities."</p><p></p><p>"But kindness and a sense of justice without power will only harm you."</p><p></p><p>"I know you want to be a good person and eliminate evil spirits and demonic cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"You once made a vow: 'A man should uphold justice, with a loyal heart sweeping away evil influences.'"</p><p></p><p>"But upholding justice comes at a high cost. Only by being more cunning and crafty than the evil ones can you defeat them while keeping yourself safe."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lin Zhenbei's face took on a reminiscent look, as if recalling something. He sighed and continued:</p><p></p><p>"Zhengyi, in the future, think thrice before acting. Learn some tricks from Daoist Master Yi of Yinlong Monastery."</p><p></p><p>"Develop more skills. You're my only son, and I don't want to send you to your grave while I'm still alive, you understand?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Zhengyi's face also showed a touched expression.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I understand. From now on, I will think thrice before acting and be more calculating."</p><p></p><p>"You've grown up, that's good to know."</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei reached out his large hand and gently rubbed the bump on his son's head.</p><p></p><p>His movements were so gentle that Lin Zhengyi felt like he was a child again, when his father would comfort him like this after a fall.</p><p></p><p>"Father, it doesn't hurt anymore," said Lin Zhengyi, his eyes misting over.</p><p></p><p>Parental love for a child means making plans for the distant future.</p><p></p><p>But soon, whack! A slap landed squarely on the bump on Lin Zhengyi's head, causing another larger bump to form, making his head quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't hurt?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't hurt? Your old man is aching here."</p><p></p><p>"It's killing me."</p><p></p><p>"That spirit beast egg was obtained by me at a great cost. I nurtured it for ten years, and it's about to hatch. I planned to give it to you in a few days."</p><p></p><p>"You good-for-nothing!"</p><p></p><p>"Take this!"</p><p></p><p>Parental love is like a mountain - sometimes expressed in such a unique yet profound way.</p><p></p><p>Another vivid lesson in the education of love.</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhengyi's cries of pain echoed in the open space.</p><p></p><p>"Have you learned your lesson?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes I have."</p><p></p><p>"Have you learned Daoist Master Yi's methods?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes I have."</p><p></p><p>"Dad, don't hit me anymore or I'll tell mom!"</p><p></p><p>Sensing the key point, Lin Zhenbei immediately stopped the education of love.</p><p></p><p>He reached out to pat his son's extraordinarily bumpy head, to offer some consolation, as he may have gone too far this time.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he did not make contact.</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhengyi leapt three feet away, dodging him.</p><p></p><p>He let out a miserable cry that shook the clouds and forests.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~"</p><p></p><p>"Dad, again?"</p><p></p><p>"Too much!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

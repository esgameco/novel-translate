        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The ten seconds passed quickly. </p><p></p><p>The demonic insect lay in the deep pit, its exoskeleton now tattered and broken, sticky green fluid clinging to its body.</p><p></p><p>Its last two intact compound eyes looked up in horror at the pale blue giant falling straight towards it from the sky, its mind reeling.</p><p></p><p>Now, the ten second period had arrived!</p><p></p><p>"Earth Escape!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic insect mustered its last energy, roaring towards the sky with a heart-wrenching cry.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.  </p><p></p><p>Like a star crashing from the wilderness, Yichen's two huge feet suddenly slammed down, crushing its body.</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, the demonic insect's earth escape spell activated, but only halfway successfully.  </p><p></p><p>The rear half of its body vanished without a trace, but the front half had its head pinned firmly under Yichen's huge foot, unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>Now, half of the demonic insect's body lay in the pit, green fluid continuously flowing out from its severed end.</p><p></p><p>It had not yet perished, but its last two compound eyes had also been completely gouged out by Yichen's powerful strike.</p><p></p><p>The demonic insect struggled to raise its last intact insect leg, trembling as it tried to point it at Yichen. Its mouth opened and closed slowly, as if trying to say something.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Another huge hand suddenly appeared, snatching the leg away.</p><p></p><p>Yichen had completely torn off the demonic insect's last giant leg and casually tossed it behind him onto the open ground.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Mobai Sect soon discovered another giant leg lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>This one was even more severely damaged, mottled scars bearing witness to the devastating injuries its owner had suffered.</p><p></p><p>"An invigorating battle today, though the predecessor was still slightly inferior to this pauper."</p><p></p><p>Yichen leapt out of the deep pit and stood at the edge, his back to the crowd, saying arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yichen's shameless words, the demonic insect finally could no longer endure. A huge green geyser erupted from its massive mouth, as if spraying the King of Kings, then its head lolled to the side as it miserably perished.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it died from its severe injuries or from being enraged to death by Yichen.</p><p></p><p>Looking at its final death throes, no one knew the depths of its unwillingness in its last moments.</p><p></p><p>If it had been at its peak, it absolutely would not have ended up like this.</p><p></p><p>It still had tricks it had not used, ending before it could even begin.</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the Demonic Insect Worm, gaining 220 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>A line of information suddenly appeared on Yichen's retina.</p><p></p><p>A girl in black armor slowly walked out from a corner of the side courtyard, two huge bagua halberd axes crossed over her back.</p><p></p><p>The axe blades were caked with dried blood, surrounded by a dense aura of bloody killing intent - who knew how many unfortunate souls had died under these axes in recent days.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Qian, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>Yichen turned to face Qian Yueru.</p><p></p><p>He had sensed her aura midway through the latter half of the battle.  </p><p></p><p>With such a major event occurring in the Southern District, she, as the garrison commander of Longjiang Prefecture, naturally had many people reporting to her, so she had kept some attention focused on the Southern District.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's actions had also been able to proceed smoothly with her support.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I'm here."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, after lying in wait for so long, even bringing some little toys, I didn't expect the big fish behind the Yellow Springs Sect, Yin Mountain Manor, and Red House to not show up for a rescue. Really disappointing."</p><p></p><p>Qian Yueru still had her hair tied in a high ponytail, but unlike their previous meeting, today she wore not cloud boots but a uniquely styled pair of high combat boots.</p><p></p><p>The black boots tightly gripped her slender, porcelain-white legs, making them appear even more fair and shapely.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, they looked...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Scored full marks...so tempting.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen dispersed the powerful force around his body, his figure returning to normal form. He smiled and said to Qian Yueru, "This time by chance, being able to hook this big fish is not bad."  </p><p></p><p>"To ask for more would be greedy."</p><p></p><p>Qian Yueru bit her beautiful red lips and said softly, "Yes, I was a bit impatient."</p><p></p><p>She wore a dress armor, her long legs striding directly to stand beside Yi Chen. </p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone on her and Yi Chen, casting long shadows.</p><p></p><p>However, this scene did not have much of a sense of beauty.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>Under the moon, the person was like jade, while the Taoist priest resembled a bear.</p><p></p><p>The style was still a bit abstract.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yueru's height of 1.7 meters compared to Yi Chen's height of over 2 meters, no matter how you looked at this composition, it always felt a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other subordinates of the Zhen'an Office present had already started cleaning up and restoring order.</p><p></p><p>While working, they kept glancing at their leader, each one like a weasel in a melon field, sneaking around.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qian Yueru walk over and stand beside him, Yi Chen's heart was on high alert.</p><p></p><p>He calmly took half a step back, keeping the Qian Zhen Talisman in front of his chest.</p><p></p><p>What is this woman trying to do?</p><p></p><p>Could it be she's greedy for this Taoist's body?</p><p></p><p>Damn it, women will only affect the speed of my strikes.</p><p></p><p>But she seems to be a wealthy lady~</p><p></p><p>Qian Yueru hesitated for a moment, then her beautiful face suddenly moved closer to Yi Chen, scaring him so much he almost stumbled backwards.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Qian, if you have something to say, please speak directly. Acting like this makes this poor Taoist afraid~"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen said warily.</p><p></p><p>This woman is acting strange today.</p><p></p><p>"Taoist priest, let's have a match. The loser must agree to one condition from the winner."</p><p></p><p>As Qian Yueru spoke, she began untying the two huge axes behind her back. After casually performing a few axe flourishes, she lightly placed the axe heads on the ground, half of each axe head sinking directly into the mud.</p><p></p><p>This ferocious strength made Yi Chen's eyebrows jump.</p><p></p><p>Damn, mother dragon~</p><p></p><p>How can this woman with such low muscle purity possess such vicious power? Truly strange and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>But Yi Chen thought about it and realized that since her father is a True Lord, one of the true pinnacles of the world, and was immediately relieved.</p><p></p><p>Certain heavenly treasures or dragon essence, phoenix blood, unicorn elixirs and the like could achieve this level.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how these top-tier cultivator offsprings are raised.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Zhengyi knew the resources Qian Yueru consumed in her cultivation, he would probably feel the disparity of the world.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen shook his head vigorously at Qian Yueru's face.</p><p></p><p>"No fighting, no fighting."</p><p></p><p>"Qian Zhen Talisman, if you're not going to use taunting to trap others, you'd better not scare people like this."</p><p></p><p>"This poor Taoist almost misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, only a fool would fight Qian Yueru.</p><p></p><p>Lose and get taken advantage of.</p><p></p><p>Win and damn, you beat up the True Lord's daughter.</p><p></p><p>Just the thought is very bold!</p><p></p><p>Just say what condition you want, let the True Lord hear it properly.</p><p></p><p>A meaningless fight.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qian Yueru was stunned, her expression naive: "Taoist priest, what did you misunderstand?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she pulled out the Eight Trigrams Axe from the ground. With a casual shake, the dried blood stains on the huge axe instantly became pristine. Putting the axe back behind her, Qian Yueru extended her bare hand to brush aside some stray hairs by her ear, and said gently:</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then I'll speak directly. I want to invite the Taoist priest to stay and join my Longjiang Prefecture's Zhen'an Office."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Daoist master. Felicitations to the Daoist master, for actually slaying the 97th evil demon on the imperial wanted list, truly an immense merit!"</p><p></p><p>"With such a great achievement, surely the imperial court will bestow rewards before long." </p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yi Chen had vanquished the Five Paths Demon, Lin Baihu, who had just expelled a mouthful of turbid breath, walked over smiling with his four subordinate flag officers to offer congratulations. </p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat covered the foreheads of these few men, looking quite exhausted. After all, maintaining the great formation was extremely draining of spiritual power. Even with the transference and distribution enabled by the great formation, the Five Paths Demon's counterattacks had exerted tremendous pressure on them.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, everything had now ended with the ashes and smoke of the vanquished Five Paths Demon.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Baihu's flattering words did not receive the desired response.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen withdrew the joyful expression from his face and asked Lin with a puzzled tone: "Dao friend Lin, I don't know why you are offering congratulations?"</p><p></p><p>"This Five Paths Demon that you and your few loyal and diligent subordinate flag officers have been investigating for many years, expending great effort, was only discovered to have left traces in Ping'an Prefecture by chance."</p><p></p><p>"I merely happened to be there and exerted a little insignificant effort. The real protagonists should be Qianhu Lin leading the strategy and Dao friend Lin taking action on the front lines, along with your few diligent subordinate flag officers. This is what truly led to the demon's extermination."</p><p></p><p>"With Qianhu Lin commanding from the rear and Dao friend Lin at the vanguard, supported by your few diligent subordinate flag officers, only then could this evil be eliminated."</p><p></p><p>"For Dao friend Lin to congratulate me is extremely amusing. How could I dare take credit that belongs to Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>This was yet another masterful deployment of linguistic artistry that could be included in textbooks. Yi Chen's words were sincere, logical and his tone earnest, such that even Lin Baihu himself, as one of the main participants, began to doubt his own memory - was this matter truly accomplished under his leadership?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Baihu still looking doubtful, Yi Chen sighed inwardly. Lin Baihu's skin was still too thin, his thinking too inflexible, needing a little guidance.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, let's step aside for a word."</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu, Dao friend Lin, Brother Lin - the form of address grew increasingly intimate, changing most naturally as if it should have been so all along.</p><p></p><p>After releasing his Positive Polarity Transformation, Yi Chen's height had decreased somewhat, but he still towered over ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>He sheathed his Dragon Slaying Sword, hooked an arm around Lin Baihu's shoulders and walked to a corner of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, do you want to do something for the common people?"  Yi Chen's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>"I...of course I do, but this would violate the rules." Lin Baihu sounded hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, those words are mistaken!"  </p><p></p><p>"If you want to accomplish things, you need to climb upwards to greater power and status, so you won't be restrained by others. As a minor Baihu officer, what can you really do?"</p><p></p><p>"It's an unpleasant feeling to be restrained by others, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked meaningfully at Lin Baihu, then continued:</p><p></p><p>"As long as you don't forget your original intention, and truly do more good deeds for the people after climbing to a high position, then it will all be worth it."</p><p></p><p>"I am not from the Ministry of Justice, so this merit being credited to me would only mean a few more ordinary spirit materials and several thousand taels of gold and silver, nothing too useful."</p><p></p><p>"But it would be different if credited to you, Brother Lin. Let's make use of the Five Paths Demon's head today, combined with your previous great achievement in smashing the Corpse Demon Sect, you'll definitely enter the sights of the higher ranks."</p><p></p><p>"One instance could be coincidence, but two instances can't be mere coincidence. In this way, you'll definitely be unstoppable and become a key cultivator targeted for development in the new generation of the Ministry of Justice - divine martial arts, spirit materials, a vast future, all beckoning to you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Baihu still inwardly conflicted, Yi Chen decided to administer stronger medicine and continued persuading: "Brother Lin, for a great man's actions, judge the trail not the heart, for there are no sages when judging the heart."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you uphold justice and do good deeds in the future, it's better for good people to climb higher and faster - that is a blessing for the people."</p><p></p><p>"Even putting aside thinking for yourself, you should at least think of your brothers."</p><p></p><p>Upon saying this, Yi Chen...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Dust motioned with his mouth towards his side with effort. </p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu glanced in the direction Dust indicated, and his heart instantly chilled.</p><p></p><p>The four small flags under his command were all looking at him with extremely burning gazes.</p><p></p><p>Heh, you are the son of a thousand households, if you don't want to advance, can you really stop your brothers under you from advancing?</p><p></p><p>Cutting off someone's financial resources is like killing their parents. </p><p></p><p>Then what about cutting off someone's future prospects?</p><p></p><p>Departing from benevolence and morality is considered light.</p><p></p><p>This is a conspiracy, comparable to an extremely convoluted conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>It is a dilemma of choice stemming from a deep understanding of human nature.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Yi, what exactly do you want to get from me?"</p><p></p><p>"I might as well speak frankly to you, even if I accept your favor this time, if you commit evil without cause in the future, I still will not be on the same side as you, you should know this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's expression turned cold at this moment, and he could not help but speak out.</p><p></p><p>He was just simple, not foolish.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Baihu open up and speak clearly, Dust was also direct and candid.</p><p></p><p>His actions this time were just a temporary whim, one was to return the favor of investigating the black hand behind the scenes, and two was...</p><p></p><p>Dust solemnly said:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin worries too much."</p><p></p><p>"How could you see me that way?"</p><p></p><p>"This penniless Daoist absolutely would not let Brother Lin cover up for my Hidden Dragon Monastery, what I ask for is just one thing."</p><p></p><p>"You know the situation of my Hidden Dragon Monastery, I will let you have the great achievement, I just want you to make one promise, and this promise absolutely will not make you violate righteousness or imperial law."</p><p></p><p>"What promise?" Lin Zhengyi asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple, I want you to vow with your Dao heart that no matter if I perish and cannot take care of myself in the future, whether Brother Lin is around or not, you must exert the influence of the Lin family to make the Peace Prefecture's Town Security Bureau take more care of my Hidden Dragon Monastery."</p><p></p><p>"If outside forces act against my Hidden Dragon Monastery, I want the Town Security Bureau's intelligence support to promptly notify my Hidden Dragon Monastery, and in times of danger, send people to help out."</p><p></p><p>"The Town Security Bureau has the responsibility to safeguard peace and security for the people, to stabilize all under heaven and reassure the people's hearts, its duty lies here."</p><p></p><p>"In the Peace Prefecture of over two million people, my Hidden Dragon Monastery is just one part in over two million, this request of mine is not excessive, is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, my Hidden Dragon Monastery, alas, so pitiful."</p><p></p><p>"This elder master of mine has had it so difficult."</p><p></p><p>"My master was unbending his whole life, not knowing how to be flexible, not knowing how many petty people and evil spirits he offended."</p><p></p><p>"Master entrusted the Hidden Dragon Monastery to me, I can't even sleep well at night, worrying all day long, walking on thin ice."</p><p></p><p>Dust started showing off his acting skills, forcefully hunching his body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, little Kitten suddenly darted out from some corner, jumping onto Dust's shoulder. Hearing this, it couldn't help but curl its lip, sticking out its pink tongue to lick its paw.</p><p></p><p>Heh, can't sleep? It, little Kitten, didn't believe a single punctuation mark of that.</p><p></p><p>"If it's only this, then I will agree to it."</p><p></p><p>"However, the rewards from the Town Security Bureau belong to you, I will not take my share and will transfer it all to you."</p><p></p><p>"Deal!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu was silent for a moment, thinking of investigating the black hand behind the scenes, and finally nodded in agreement and made the vow.</p><p></p><p>At this point, both of their faces unconsciously revealed smiles, and their two big hands clasped together, everything unspoken.</p><p></p><p>Having common interests and secrets, the Hidden Dragon Monastery and Town Security Bureau's private connection was undoubtedly closer, their relationship had greater room for expansion, and the foundation was more solid.</p><p></p><p>Today's move was just a casual play by Dust on a whim, life is like placing chess pieces, who knows which casual play will have a major effect in the future?</p><p></p><p>Dust and Lin Baihu walked towards the crowd with smiles on their faces, side by side.</p><p></p><p>The four small flags saw this situation and smiled so wide their mouths almost split to their necks, they knew their leader, who was like a rock stuck in a pit, had already been convinced.</p><p></p><p>Progress!</p><p></p><p>It was right in front of them!</p><p></p><p>Except for the dead Five Paths Demon, they all had a bright future.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

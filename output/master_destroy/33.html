        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As Yichen's gaze shifted, Daoist Qingxu felt like being stared at by a ferocious beast. He couldn't help but take a step back and said with an awkward smile, "What Daoist Yi said is very true." </p><p></p><p>"This humble daoist admires you greatly."</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere around suddenly became tense again. </p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, a smile appeared on Yichen's face again, "Haha, just kidding. Since we were able to slay the demonic specter that annihilated the entire Wang family, I should thank Daoist Qingxu, Nun Lianhua, and Master Shuiyue for helping me stall that fog ghost."</p><p></p><p>Yichen naturally noticed Daoist Qingxu's small movement, but now was not the time to dwell on such things. He had already offended Lingfeng Monastery, and if he offended Haizhuang Monastery as well, that would not be the act of a wise person.</p><p></p><p>At least, now was not the time to settle accounts, it would be better to let the bullets fly for a while.</p><p></p><p>What he lacked most now was time. After flexing his muscles, what he needed most was to lie low, not to create an even bigger mess.</p><p></p><p>"So..." Thoughts flowed through Yichen's mind, "It's best to value harmony when dealing with people. How about when I make great progress in my cultivation, I find a windy night and break Daoist Qingxu's four limbs as a minor punishment and warning, and then consider this matter settled?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the atmosphere was a bit awkward, Nun Lianhua stepped forward with a smile and changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, although the demonic specter was fortunately eliminated today by Daoist Yi's great divine power, we still need to discuss and come up with a plan on how to proceed."</p><p></p><p>"We must know that behind this demonic specter, there is still a mysterious master."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the four fell silent.</p><p></p><p>To be able to command the three demonic specters of corpse ghosts, fog ghosts, and earth-pulling mud, the master who could control these three together must be an extremely formidable existence.</p><p></p><p>Today, the few of them were only able to slay the three demonic specters thanks to Yichen's great divine power. Otherwise, they could only flee for their lives. But these three demonic specters were merely servants of that mysterious master.</p><p></p><p>I only have a few taels of silver, how can I gamble with my life?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if I were to stake my life, it still wouldn't be enough to fill this deep pit.</p><p></p><p>If I really used up the family fortune passed down from my ancestors, it would be like the Hidden Dragon Monastery, with all the experts wiped out, which would be a sin.</p><p></p><p>The four exchanged a look of tacit understanding and decisively chose to trust the wisdom of the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting late today, why don't we discuss this together again tomorrow morning and then report the full situation to the County Master?" Yichen said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He had exerted the most effort in this battle, and his strength had deeply impressed the others. With Yichen saying this, everyone naturally nodded in agreement, putting a satisfactory conclusion to the great battle tonight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That night, at the Peaceful Inn in Fengchun County.</p><p></p><p>Yichen, wearing an undershirt, sat on the balcony of Room No. 1 at the Peaceful Inn. On the table beside him was a cup of fragrant tea.</p><p></p><p>The room was specially arranged by County Master Zhou, giving Yichen the best upstairs room, which was very considerate.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but rub his brow with his thumb, a look of fatigue appearing on his face. Tonight, fighting against people and demonic specters had left even Yichen, whose energy far surpassed ordinary people, feeling a bit exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"But it's okay, although things were a bit complicated, the result was still good. Although the source point is completely gone, I've gained a whopping one hundred and ten deep red points."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the deep red points, Yichen's fatigued expression couldn't help but be invigorated.</p><p></p><p>The hard work this time was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>He drank the fragrant tea on the table in one gulp, facing the fierce cool wind and bathing in the bright moonlight, he suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang Skill, elevate me."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the one hundred deep red points were instantly deducted, and a long stretch of memory suddenly appeared in Yichen's mind.</p><p></p><p>Like watching a fast-forwarded movie, Yichen began to review this suddenly appearing memory.</p><p></p><p>In a deep mountain valley, a young Daoist stood with his hands behind his back, the mountain wind fiercely flapping his wide sleeves.</p><p></p><p>The young Daoist stood in the valley, watching the sunrise, sunset, morning glow, and evening glow.</p><p></p><p>He did not eat or drink, just observing this realm of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He watched a small blade of grass, struggling to break through the rock crevice, taking root, sprouting, growing into a small grass, then withering again, a cycle repeating endlessly.</p><p></p><p>He watched the sunlight nourishing the entire valley, nurturing all living things.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after an unknown period of time, the young Daoist seemed to gain some realization. He stretched out his fan-like large hand towards the rising sun in the sky and made a grasping motion.</p><p></p><p>As if grasping the light itself.</p><p></p><p>"Yang energy, the pure yang energy."</p><p></p><p>"Refine my body!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist suddenly spoke, his clear voice echoing through the entire valley.</p><p></p><p>At this point, due to not eating or drinking for a long time, the Daoist's originally tall body had become extremely emaciated, with only a large skeletal frame supporting his clothes. His previously tight Daoist robe had also become loose.</p><p></p><p>Following the Daoist's movements, wisps of sunlight seemed to be captured by that fan-like large hand, either voluntarily or involuntarily seeping into his body.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist's throat couldn't help but make a swallowing motion. As time slowly passed, the young Daoist's originally skin-and-bones figure also gradually swelled up like an inflating ball.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the morning glow at dawn, refining the evening glow at dusk, season after season passed.</p><p></p><p>As the young Daoist continued his cultivation, the pale purple pure yang inner qi within his body slowly deepened and thickened in color until one morning, it became a deep purple, like beautiful jade.</p><p></p><p>The memory abruptly ended here.</p><p></p><p>Yichen felt like he had just watched an accelerated stream-of-consciousness movie, with countless realizations emerging in his heart, as if he had truly experienced many years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He slightly raised his head, looking at the bright full moon, and smiled.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of deep purple pure yang inner qi flickered in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>The seventh level of the Minor Pure Yang Skill was achieved.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with the circulation of the deep purple pure yang inner qi, earth-shattering changes were also occurring within his body.</p><p></p><p>His muscles were already like hundred-fold tempered fine steel, but now they further advanced, heading towards the realm of thousand-fold tempered profound iron.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Moving forward, the cells bonded more tightly, and the previously slightly exaggerated muscles became beautiful streamlined shapes. </p><p></p><p>But not diminishing its strength at all, the power was further enhanced instead.</p><p></p><p>His hands were like white jade. When Yidian gently gripped, a booming sound appeared. If he wanted to now, crushing the air would be easy.</p><p></p><p>The strength to easily crush air barehanded, whether it was demonic spirits or...people, these big hands could easily twist off their heads, or smash their skulls into their chests.</p><p></p><p>In his introspective state, Yidian found that changes were also occurring deep inside his bones. More golden lines appeared within his bones, winding like strange seal scripts, profound and unfathomable, covering all his bones.  </p><p></p><p>The cells within his body also seemed to combine with some mysterious substance between heaven and earth, becoming different from before. Upon closer inspection, faint traces of purple flashed by from time to time.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight in the sky scattered down, illuminating for thousands of miles, also shining on Yidian on the balcony. Threads of light also seeped through his skin and into Yidian's body, transforming into almost imperceptible pure yang inner energy.</p><p></p><p>Yidian was inexplicably shaken in his heart!</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh, how terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I've become the Immortal of Light? What strange path has my golden finger led me onto?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing light energy and extracting the essence from food, transforming it into pure yang inner energy, self-photosynthesis? Am I still human? Oh no."</p><p></p><p>"The plot is getting more and more ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a guess surfaced in Yidian's mind. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the process of deducing and breaking through cultivation realms, all paths did not appear out of nowhere, but were combined and deduced based on the knowledge in his mind, and then guided by the infinite wisdom of the golden finger to derive a feasible and correct path.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Yidian broke through to the sixth layer, he had become a bottomless pit, his inner energy light purple. The Small Pure Yang technique had reached the limit of what a human could achieve.</p><p></p><p>On this basis, how could Yidian advance further?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it would be...I'm not human anymore.</p><p></p><p>Before his advancement, Yidian had also wondered if he would starve himself to death after the next breakthrough...</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed the intelligent golden finger had already solved this problem for him.</p><p></p><p>Not having enough energy source to support his further advancement, was that it? No problem, Yidian's previous life brain was full of strange scientific knowledge.</p><p></p><p>To the spiritually awakened, the heavens and earth they saw contained all kinds of wondrous vital energies - yin and yang, the five elements, wind, rain, thunder and more. The extraordinary path of cultivators was rooted in these various vital energies of the world.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of profound techniques were also based on these vital energies.</p><p></p><p>The vital energies of heaven and earth were infinite and inexhaustible. Spiritually awakened cultivators relied on this mighty force to refine themselves, move heaven and earth, and reach inconceivable realms.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang true force cultivated from the 'Supreme Spiritual Flight Pure Yang Root Scripture' took the pure yang vital energy between heaven and earth as its foundation, combining and purifying with it, nourishing it forth.</p><p></p><p>Yidian was different - until now he still saw mountains as mountains and water as water, without the slightest trace of 'spiritual awakening'.</p><p></p><p>Move nature? He really couldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>The pure yang inner energy he cultivated was born from the ultimate refinement and purification of his own vital essence. In simple terms, his power came from plundering heaven and earth, replenishing his own strength. With each advancement of the Pure Yang technique, his physical body would become vastly stronger - this was the reason.</p><p></p><p>The source of power had a foundation - Yidian's formidable physique was his foundation, the generator of his overbearing pure yang inner energy.  </p><p></p><p>He fundamentally could not understand what vital energies were, but he knew what light was.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, paths like converting light energy to synthesize starch, or synthesizing starch from carbon dioxide, were proven feasible.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the eyes of the golden finger, light was simply ubiquitous between heaven and earth. With some modifications to himself, solving the energy supply problem would be child's play, and the advancement of the Pure Yang technique would no longer be a rootless tree.</p><p></p><p>After this guess surfaced in his mind, Yidian felt a wave of speechlessness.  </p><p></p><p>He didn't know whether his guess was right or wrong, but regardless, his Small Pure Yang technique had already broken through to the seventh layer, deep purple in color - this was an iron-clad fact.</p><p></p><p>He could absorb the surrounding light energy to supplement and transform into pure yang inner energy - this was also a fact.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, then it really was off the charts.  </p><p></p><p>This golden finger was truly built on the entangled logic of both idealism and materialism...</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>Yidian reined in his messy thoughts, no longer thinking wildly. He leaned against the balcony railing, exhaling a breath of turbid air that shot like an arrow into the night sky four or five meters before dispersing.</p><p></p><p>"Does this count as the evolution of life for me?"</p><p></p><p>He gazed at the night sky, his eyes focusing as a virtual light screen appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yidian]</p><p>[Lifespan: 18/107]  </p><p>[Strength: 45.0, Stamina: 38.0, Spirit: 41.0, Agility: 36.0]</p><p>[Technique: Small Pure Yang Seventh Layer (Traits: Robust Body, Blazing, Divine Force, Exorcism, Tenacity, Rejuvenation, Ignition.

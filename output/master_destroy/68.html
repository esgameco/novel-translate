        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The blood moon hung in the sky, meteors descended to the world. </p><p></p><p>Such a major event naturally drew attention from all under heaven.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Tiger Mountain was the ancestral court of the Celestial Masters sect, towering into the clouds, unrivaled under heaven. </p><p></p><p>At this time, on the golden peak of Dragon Tiger Mountain, an emaciated Taoist priest sitting cross-legged on the golden peak watched the blood moon in the sky, his face showing a sorrowful expression. With a wave of his hand, he unleashed nine lightning dragons to meet the largest of the blood-colored meteors streaking across the night sky.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the lightning dragons and meteors were both extinguished.  </p><p></p><p>However, the number of lightning dragons was limited, while the blood-colored meteors, large and small, numbered over a thousand. It was like a drop in the bucket, utterly ineffective.</p><p></p><p>The emaciated Taoist priest's expression grew even more sorrowful. His body flashed, leaving behind a golden talisman before disappearing into the back mountains.</p><p></p><p>At Brightness Supreme Mountain, the Buddhist ancestral court, a white-browed elderly monk had been sitting motionless on a cliff for who knows how many years. He suddenly opened his eyes, looking at the meteors filling the sky. He lightly struck the wooden fish beside him, and nine golden lotus platforms rose into the air to meet nine large blood-colored meteors before also vanishing.</p><p></p><p>The old monk sighed and suddenly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>At Green Lotus Mountain, the abode of the number one female Perfected of the era, Lady Green Lotus, a crown talisman hundreds of zhang tall suddenly appeared at the mountain peak to face the meteors filling the sky. Lady Green Lotus's willow brows furrowed, and with a light rebuke, a sword formed from gathered starlight shot forth from her mouth.</p><p></p><p>The sword expanded in the wind, instantly swelling many times over. Countless stars were drawn to it like a magnet, increasing its might. After shattering twelve large blood-colored stars, it finally exploded thunderously. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lady Green Lotus waved her wide sleeve, dissipating the talisman, and disappeared into the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the top cultivators from the various major powers - the Three Mountains and Six Sects, the reigning dynasty, the Five Great Sword Sects, the Twelve Clans, the Nine Great Aristocratic Families - all took action, intercepting the blood-colored meteors raining down. Countless rays of magical light illuminated heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With their combined efforts, they managed to brush aside most of the blood-colored meteors, deflecting them beyond the celestial veil.</p><p></p><p>However, many smaller blood meteors still could not be stopped and fell to the earth. One small blood meteor happened to fall not far from Ping'an Town, at the Yang Family Village.</p><p></p><p>As the blood meteors fell and impacted, the blood moon in the sky also slowly faded, and the pure moonlight once again illuminated the earth, restoring everything to its original state.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the fallen blood meteors, it seemed as if heaven and earth were no different from before.</p><p></p><p>But was this realm of heaven and earth truly unchanged from before?</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen stood with his sleeves hanging, watching this scene before decidedly choosing to add points.</p><p></p><p>This was too exciting.</p><p></p><p>He had just felt that life was meaningless and wanted to pursue a more exciting world, and then this super boosted event occurred.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if he had been infected by Linbaihu's pessimism.</p><p></p><p>The abnormal celestial phenomenon that dyed the moon blood-red, the sudden manifestation and disappearance of that overwhelming malicious force filling heaven and earth - it all proved to Yi Chen that this realm would become exceedingly exciting from now on.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, why is it so hard to seize control of one's own destiny?"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, four origin points instantly went into his Strength attribute.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's heart couldn't help but roar.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, origin points, let me see your limits!"</p><p></p><p>"It's time to break through the Strength Realm!"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous warm current suddenly appeared within Yi Chen's limbs and body. Unlike before, this warm current was mixed with an indescribable, profound essence.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the comforting warmth from adding points before, like soaking in a bath, today's warm current grew increasingly scorching as it rapidly circulated.  </p><p></p><p>This was no longer a bath - it was like soaking in lava.</p><p></p><p>Soon, wispy vapors began rising from Yi Chen's head. The...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The person's skin instantly turned red, like a cooked prawn. </p><p></p><p>Hot, hot, hot.</p><p></p><p>The heat flow was madly circulating within the body, like sharp blades rapidly flowing inside, first cutting through the muscle fibers he had thought were extremely tenacious, and then quickly reconnecting and repairing them under the nourishment of the heat flow.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of being cut by thousands of blades was happening in every corner of Yi Chen's body. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen struggled to control the surging warmth with his willpower, trying not to let it run wild like an unbridled horse.</p><p></p><p>He endured the intense pain, wanting to close his eyes and faint countless times, asking himself why he had to suffer such inhuman torture?</p><p></p><p>But reason told him that if he chose to escape instead of guiding and accepting this huge heat flow's transformation, he might very well be burned to a crisp, leaving an unsolved case in Ping'an County.</p><p></p><p>There might even be idle storytellers in the future who would make up stories about it and widely spread them in tea houses and taverns for money.</p><p></p><p>For example:</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable, Fengyu County's Number One Cultivator Burned to Crisp at Inn, Suicide or Murder?"</p><p></p><p>This would be the mystery version.</p><p></p><p>Or:</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator Infatuated with Courtesan, Commits Suicide by Burning at Inn after Unrequited Love, The Story of Master Yi Chengzi and Huan'er."</p><p></p><p>This would be the sensationalized version. </p><p></p><p>Or: </p><p></p><p>"Shocking! Suspected Childhood Sweethearts Reunited but She Was Already a Courtesan, and They Were Actually Siblings, Enraging Master Yi Chengzi to Self-Immolation."</p><p></p><p>This would be the explosive moral version.</p><p></p><p>"No, absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>"I have gone through so many hardships, tempering iron, exploding fish, touching electric doors, how could I fall here!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's eyes instantly turned red, his steel teeth clenched tightly, enduring wave after wave of pain.</p><p></p><p>He was like a small, humble boat on the stormy river surface, looking as if it could capsize at any moment, yet still standing firm.</p><p></p><p>One second.</p><p></p><p>Two seconds.  </p><p></p><p>One minute.</p><p></p><p>Two minutes.</p><p></p><p>Time ticked by bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>The previously stormy river surface gradually cleared up, with the sun shining on the small boat again.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen opened his eyes, his pupils flickering with a brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>He had won.</p><p></p><p>He had endured that blade-cutting pain until the end.</p><p></p><p>Now he finally understood the real reason why he had narrowly escaped death this time.</p><p></p><p>Preconceived notions and path dependence can kill people.</p><p></p><p>His body was not strong enough, and without his physical attributes reaching the maximum of 49, he had suddenly broken through the Force Realm, which was the real culprit behind his near-death experience this time.</p><p></p><p>Strength is not a drifting duckweed without roots; it needs to be rooted in a powerful physique to provide the driving force to unleash astonishing energy.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had been careless, which was why he had put himself in danger.</p><p></p><p>After all, the increase after breaking through the Force Realm far exceeded the increase from ordinary level-ups.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with his experience from multiple level-ups and superhuman willpower, he managed to control that warmth flow, gradually absorbing it, which allowed him to fully digest these gains.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing my physique has been tempered many times, standing at the threshold of the Force Realm, otherwise I would have dug my own grave this time."</p><p></p><p>"But fortunately, the end result wasn't too bad."  </p><p></p><p>"I made it through."</p><p></p><p>"I even gained some physical attributes by chance, which was an unexpected pleasure."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the experience, Yi Chen still could not help but feel a lingering sense of danger.</p><p></p><p>However, the bigger the storm, the more valuable the fish.</p><p></p><p>Due to this accidental big mistake, Yi Chen had obtained the strength of the Force Realm ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>His pupils flickered with a brilliant light, and a virtual screen suddenly appeared on his retina.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

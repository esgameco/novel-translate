        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the Daoist monastery, Yi Chen did not immediately go to sleep. Instead, he went to the main hall and took out the ingot of silver that Zhang Butou had respectfully gifted to the Patriarch. After some thought, he broke it in half and placed one portion into the merit box, before going to the rear courtyard to take a cool shower. </p><p></p><p>The teardrop-shaped bloody mark was like a stubborn affliction clinging to his body. No matter how hard he scrubbed, the mark would not come off his skin. Helpless, Yi Chen could only return to his room and sit down.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, although the bloody mark stuck to him like hardened candy, in Yi Chen's perception, the mark would not become active in the short term. He had a vague premonition that one year later, this bloody mark would no longer remain as docile as it was now.</p><p></p><p>"One year? A lot can happen in a year," Yi Chen murmured, glancing down at the mark on his chest. Through the deep blood-red color, he vaguely sensed that a great terror might descend a year later.</p><p></p><p>Before Yi Chen lay a jade token, a jade book, a letter, three hundred taels of silver, and ten taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he hid the jade token and letter in a secret corner before carefully studying the jade book containing the life's work of the old Daoist master by candlelight. As he opened the book titled 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye', he became immersed, marveling at its profound conception and lofty purpose. As he read, he unconsciously gestured with his hands. When the rooster crowed at dawn, he finally came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>On the light screen before him, a line of small words appeared:</p><p></p><p>[Technique: The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye (Beginner Level)]</p><p></p><p>With Yi Chen's current mastery of the Small Pure Yang Skill at the sixth level, it was not an exaggeration for him to reach the beginner level of 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye' created by the old Daoist master Zhang Jishi in just one night.</p><p></p><p>"According to the old master, this technique has a fatal flaw - the cultivation time is too long, and the higher the level, the more difficult it becomes to advance. But I should give it a try."</p><p></p><p>After studying 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye', Yi Chen felt his horizons had broadened. This art embodied the principles of yin and yang, granting insight and the ability to refine one's spirit, making one's spiritual perception more acute and able to sense danger in advance. It was worth his heavy investment.</p><p></p><p>"Deep Red!"</p><p></p><p>With an inward cry, Yi Chen summoned his light screen and firmly tapped the plus sign behind 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye'. Three lines of small words floated before his eyes:</p><p></p><p>[Breaking through to the first level of 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye' requires consuming 5 Deep Red points. Proceed? Yes/No]</p><p></p><p>[Breaking through to the second level of 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye' requires consuming 10 Deep Red points. Proceed? Yes/No] </p><p></p><p>[Breaking through to the third level of 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye' requires consuming 20 Deep Red points. Proceed? Yes/No]</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen naturally chose 'Yes' for all three.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-five Deep Red points were instantly deducted, and a vast memory suddenly appeared in Yi Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>A young Daoist cultivator sat in meditation daily, gathering morning dew and refining his own eyes. Not only did he practice diligently every day, but he also collected precious medicinal herbs in the mountains and rivers to refine his eyes. As his cultivation deepened over time, his eyes became increasingly clear and profound, shining with spiritual light.</p><p></p><p>From youth to the appearance of his first white hair, thirty years passed. When the young cultivator exhaled his first breath of turbid air at the rising purple dawn, the third level of 'The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye' was achieved.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a cool breath appeared around Yi Chen's eyes. With his extensive experience, Yi Chen remained calm, knowing this breath was meant to transform and strengthen his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>More than ten seconds later, when he reopened them, his eyes had become identical to those of the young cultivator in his memory.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, borrowing the power of cultivation to reflect upon oneself - this cheat is truly formidable!" Yi Chen exclaimed, admiring his reflection in the copper mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Today was another day of hard work."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen summoned his light screen, and the changes to his body were synchronized:</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yi Chen]</p><p></p><p>[Lifespan: 18/97] </p><p></p><p>[Strength: 27.0, Stamina: 24.0, Spirit: 31, Agility: 24] (Normal human values are 1)</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Small Pure Yang Skill Sixth Level (Traits: Robust Body, Blazing, Divine Force, Exorcism, Tenacity). Active Skill: Yang Extreme (Strength triples for ten minutes, then inner energy and strength temporarily drop to 70% of original level).]</p><p></p><p>[Technique: The Art of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Third Level (Traits: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, Yin Energy Perception).]</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>【Passive Skills: Painting Technique Lv1, Host of Red Joyous Events Lv2, Host of White Mourning Events Lv3, Culinary Lv3】</p><p></p><p>【Origin Points: 0】(Can be obtained through physical training to stimulate the mortal body, which can increase the four attributes of strength, physique, spirit, and agility.)</p><p></p><p>【Deep Crimson Value: 11】(Can be obtained through special items or by killing evil spirits and demonic creatures. Used to advance martial arts levels or for deductions.)</p><p></p><p>This Yin-Yang Celestial Eye Technique truly deserves its reputation for refining the divine spirit. It allowed Yi Chen's spiritual attributes to increase by three points, and even his agility increased by one point. Yi Chen guessed it was because his enhanced divine power made him more sensitive and responsive.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the third level of the Yin-Yang Celestial Eye Technique bestowed three qualities upon Yi Chen: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, and Yin Energy Perception.  </p><p></p><p>Each one was extremely useful, especially the Yin Energy Perception. If Yi Chen had acquired this eye technique earlier, when the Colorful Tiger ventured deep into the dense forest, he would not have pursued it. He would have been able to more keenly sense the yin energy there, and thus avoid provoking the powerful and bizarre Yin Underworld.</p><p></p><p>However, if he had not mistakenly entered the Yin Underworld, he would not have obtained this eye technique painstakingly created by the old Celestial Master. It was fate.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen sensed that advancing to the next level of the Yin-Yang Celestial Eye Technique required forty Deep Crimson points. He quickly closed the virtual screen with a snap.</p><p></p><p>The third level of the Yin-Yang Celestial Eye Technique was sufficient for him for now. What he needed to do next was to fully elevate the realm of his Small Pure Yang Skill.  </p><p></p><p>It didn't matter if he lacked the 'spiritual nature' to cultivate Pure Yang Inner Force. As long as his Small Pure Yang Skill reached a high enough level, wouldn't he be able to pin down and beat up Qing Yun Zi?</p><p></p><p>The Small Pure Yang Skill was the foundation of his path. He understood this clearly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he wondered about the limits of Deep Crimson. No matter how lofty the intent of the Small Pure Yang Skill, it couldn't be endlessly improved...could it?</p><p></p><p>After finishing his cultivation, Yi Chen opened the window. As the sky brightened with dawn, he looked outside, reviewing the details of the previous day. Suddenly, he felt a hint of suspicion about the appearance of the Colorful Tiger that had emerged unexpectedly yesterday.  </p><p></p><p>Was his accidental entry into the Yin Underworld truly an accident, or was he deliberately lured there?</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of demonic force was this Yin Underworld?</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen could confirm that the Yin Underworld was definitely not an ordinary demonic spirit like an earth-bound ghost, because when he was fleeing halfway through, he had looked up from a high vantage point and discovered that the Yin Underworld had suddenly vanished from its original location, as if it had never appeared at all.</p><p></p><p>However, whether the manifestation of the Yin Underworld was related to the celestial abnormalities mentioned by his master before his death, Yi Chen did not know.</p><p></p><p>The old Celestial Master's note had said, "Celestial abnormalities, what lies ahead?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how much he thought about it, Yi Chen could not figure out the reason. He decided not to dwell on it anymore. Worldly matters - if you're not at that level, thinking too much is pointless.</p><p></p><p>A pawn on the chessboard, even if you see through the game, what can you do? You're still bound, only able to keep advancing, even if you're a pawn that has crossed the river, at most you've loosened your restraints a little, but you're still not free.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming stronger and stronger, until you become the player holding the chess pieces, will you have the space to choose.</p><p></p><p>It's like an ordinary person in the previous world, after graduating and entering society. It seems there are many choices, but in reality they have no choice at all. It seems they've understood what the sickle means, yet they still cannot escape the fate of being harvested. Seeing through it only increases vexation.</p><p></p><p>This is the tragedy of being a pawn.</p><p></p><p>If you spend too much effort pursuing the so-called "seeing through" and occupy the energy that should have been used for self-cultivation and growth, that would be even more miserable.</p><p></p><p>Unhappy in life, unsettled in death - that's what it means.</p><p></p><p>Only by striving wholeheartedly to strengthen yourself can you see through and transcend.</p><p></p><p>Even if you can't see through, as long as you're strong enough, the fiery mountain that was once insurmountable in your eyes can now be extinguished by your urine.</p><p></p><p>This was Yi Chen's thinking at the moment.</p><p></p><p>If his current Small Pure Yang Skill was not at the sixth level, but at the six hundred and sixty-sixth level, then no matter what myriad conspiracies and calculations were behind him, a year later when he returned to the Yin Underworld, the mastermind behind it would have to come in person, toast him with a cup of wine, and beg him to go easy.</p><p></p><p>If it was at the six thousand, six hundred and sixty-sixth level, what nonsense about celestial abnormalities? Even if one day the sun and moon fell and the world submerged, he could recreate the universe. The heavens and earth might decay, but he would not. The sun and moon might be extinguished, but he would not.</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute strength, what backstage villain would dare receive a few slaps from him?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

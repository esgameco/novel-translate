        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Lin Baihu, do you know the name of the current head of the Wang family?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is currently in charge now?" </p><p></p><p>As Lin Baihu was about to take his leave, Yi Chen seemed to have remembered something and hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he didn't even know the basic information and preferences of the Wang family. This wouldn't do if he wanted to develop business with them.</p><p></p><p>Preparation ensures success, while lack of preparation leads to failure. </p><p></p><p>This was the first step for Master Yi Chengzi to enter the high-end funeral market. He had to handle things meticulously.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lin Baihu stopped in his tracks. After a brief contemplation, he replied, "Currently, the Wang family has two branches. The one that requested my father's service is the second branch, headed by another district magistrate in Anshi Town. However, he is occupied with urgent official duties and cannot extricate himself."  </p><p></p><p>"As for the main branch, they remain at home. The head of the main family is named Wang Ba. The Wang family is a prominent aristocratic household in Ping'an County. They are a wealthy clan. Master Yi can inquire about them from anyone after entering the city."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......"  </p><p></p><p>"His name is actually Wang Ba (King Tyrant)?"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Master Yi? Is there an issue with this name?" Lin Zhengyi asked curiously. </p><p></p><p>He detected a hint of surprise in Yi Chen's tone.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out an awkward laugh and brushed it off with some excuse.</p><p></p><p>The name Wang Ba is quite something.  </p><p></p><p>It sounds like he'll have a long life.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Ji Tuanlian's name, it's simply dazzling.</p><p></p><p>However, it was inappropriate to voice such mocking thoughts directly to Lin Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>Could they still be called inner thoughts if spoken aloud?</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Lin Baihu pocketed a bag of chestnuts, a specialty of Yinlong Monastery, mounted his horse, and disappeared over the horizon.  </p><p></p><p>He had to hurry to investigate the mastermind behind the Evil Tiger Gang for Yi Chen. After all, his father had instructed him to take this matter seriously and solidify the relationship properly.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't be too hasty...</p><p></p><p>"He didn't even stay for tea. Lin Baihu is quite capable and a good man," Yi Chen remarked inwardly as he watched Lin Baihu's weather-beaten face, which seemed more mature. He then turned and headed back into Yinlong Monastery.</p><p></p><p>There were some crucial matters he needed to discuss with Qingyun Zi.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, if possible, try to acquire the land deeds for the areas surrounding Yinlong Monastery. Buy as much as you can, even wasteland. Just make sure you get the deeds. Don't worry if the price is a little higher than the market rate, say one or two percent more."</p><p></p><p>"Go discuss with Zhang Buzhang if there are any difficulties. If he can't help, find the County Master to coordinate. Your master's reputation still carries some weight in Fengyang County."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen called Qingyun Zi aside and whispered these instructions to him in a secretive manner.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Master, what's the point of buying wasteland and wasting silver on it?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about that. Just listen to your master. Buy whatever you can, as long as you get the deeds."</p><p></p><p>"Make sure to get multiple witnesses to verify the transactions."</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Zi didn't understand the reasoning behind this, but how could he not understand?</p><p></p><p>In the current times, what's most important?</p><p></p><p>Safety, of course.</p><p></p><p>Don't you see how property prices in Fengyang County have skyrocketed due to the existence of the Baguazhaixie Mirror?</p><p></p><p>Once Yinlong Monastery prospers, living near the monastery won't be inferior to living in the city center.</p><p></p><p>With Master Yi's astonishing ability to empower the industry and operational skills comparable to a True Lord, Qingyun Zi would be overwhelmed by the mountain of wealth in the future.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had to lay the groundwork and accumulate funds in advance. The black-hearted Master Yi couldn't let others take advantage of this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Buy wasteland at a low price, then sell it at the price of gold. No one could find fault with that. It's practically like robbing money, a true masterstroke.</p><p></p><p>By then, don't complain about the high prices. If you don't buy, there will be others who will. I'll even have to hold lotteries to ration the sales.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the strong always grow stronger, and the winners take all. The more wealth accumulates, the stronger the gravitational pull on the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>As long as he operates properly, Yi Chen was confident that with his skill in harvesting greens, he could make those wealthy households willingly offer up their silver. They would even feel grateful and kowtow to him in reverence.</p><p></p><p>The highest realm of harvesting greens is plucking the feathers without making the goose cry out. Yi Chen had some experience in this regard and had a hundred ways to teach those from other realms the wisdom of the Blue Planet.</p><p></p><p>He would give them a little taste of the Blue Planet's shock.</p><p></p><p>The Master's sickle has always been swift.</p><p></p><p>And in this life, he no longer feared mud-covered carts.</p><p></p><p>His blade was sharper.</p><p></p><p>This was just the first of many methods.</p><p></p><p>Hahaha.</p><p></p><p>However, Yi Chen could also see clearly that this formidable power ultimately came from...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His own world, wealth must also match his own strength, otherwise you are just a fat pig. </p><p></p><p>Only as his strength grows stronger and stronger, will the sickles in his toolbox be taken out one by one.</p><p></p><p>Strength is the root, while wealth is the booster of strength. </p><p></p><p>He will not be blinded by wealth, ultimately making a bridal dress for others.</p><p></p><p>For the Guangda Yinlong Temple project, Yi Chen already had an outline in his mind, the blueprint has been sketched out, he will eat the meal one bite at a time.</p><p></p><p>Taking steps too big makes it easy to pull the eggs, he clearly understands this principle in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The junior brother is still too young, he doesn't understand the principle that a big thief doesn't operate weapons. Those who rob with knives and guns are just doing small business. He hasn't even thought about the real big business."</p><p></p><p>Watching Qing Yunzi's departing back, Yi Chen couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Guangda Yinlong Temple was Baiyun Zi's dying wish, so it was also Yi Chen's wish.  </p><p></p><p>Now, he can start laying the foundation slowly.</p><p></p><p>Cutting the leek is just Yi Chen's means, his ultimate goal is not so narrow.</p><p></p><p>He hopes to create a world within the sphere of influence of Yinlong Temple.</p><p></p><p>A world where those who want to lie flat can lie flat, and those who want to strive can get their deserved share, a world that can accommodate the howling of wolves and also soothe the cries of the weak.</p><p></p><p>If one day in the future, by chance he doesn't die, and his strength surpasses the world, he will create such a world.</p><p></p><p>This is the world he wanted to see in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>This is also the world that Baiyun Zi had always hoped to see.</p><p></p><p>No one understands his eccentric master better than him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, cutting the leek is just a means of redistribution.</p><p></p><p>"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, so let's start cutting first."</p><p></p><p>"Financial prowess leads to power, power attracts talent, talent brings more wealth, I hope it can cycle like this."</p><p></p><p>"The strong have the right to speak and can define this world."</p><p></p><p>"So first of all, I have to become a powerful person, a truly powerful person."</p><p></p><p>"Powerful enough that no one can ignore my will."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gazed at the wasteland outside Yinlong Temple, his fists clenched tightly, his thoughts running wild.</p><p></p><p>The Chief Abbot really put a lot of effort into the development of Yinlong Temple. Although his ultimate vision was extremely grand, these beautiful blueprints are like the PPTs shown to investors. In the end, how much can actually be realized is only known to heaven.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in a year he will go bankrupt and die at the hands of the Yin Palace, everything in life is impermanent.</p><p></p><p>Taking from the top, getting from the middle, taking from the middle, getting from the bottom, that would already be an excellent result.</p><p></p><p>The way of heaven is to take from those who have surplus to supplement those who lack. The way of man is to take from those who lack to offer to those who have surplus.</p><p></p><p>The holy scripture of the previous life said, "Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."</p><p></p><p>This is the principle, the world is cruel by nature.</p><p></p><p>Can human effort overcome the heavens? Yi Chen didn't know.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had never heard of anyone defying the laws of Zou Qilv.</p><p></p><p>Such a world cannot be achieved overnight, but things can be started first.</p><p></p><p>For example, he can first cut money from the hands of the rich, then hire people at high prices to do the work, driving up the income of the surrounding people, which can also be considered another way of taking from people and using it for people.</p><p></p><p>Money is like water, it is only useful when it flows. Storing it in a silver vault will only make the silver turn black and grow hair, completely useless.</p><p></p><p>Water nourishes all things. When it flows to the hands of the lower classes, it becomes a sweet spring, a great kindness.</p><p></p><p>After all, the lower classes are really as poor as wolves, they are almost dying of thirst, they can hardly drink any water.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Master cuts from the rich, then spreads the money out, giving it to the poor. Yinlong Temple gets development, the poor get more money than expected to improve their lives, and the rich get the big pie painted by the Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>This is the perfect cycle.</p><p></p><p>Damn, a triple win!</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen instantly completed the logical loop.</p><p></p><p>He highly unified personal interests, his master's dying wish, and the development of the Dao Temple.</p><p></p><p>A world where no one gets hurt was achieved.</p><p></p><p>"I'm really a genius."</p><p></p><p>"Master, look, I'm really walking the path of benevolence and righteousness."</p><p></p><p>"Although my heart is heavy and my hands are black, cutting people, selling bully chickens, cutting leeks, but I know I'm a good Dao Master."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the wasteland outside the temple, Yi Chen saw it as golden, he excitedly rubbed his hands and turned to go back inside.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

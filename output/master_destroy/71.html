        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"What? Not going in now? Still need to scout outside?" </p><p></p><p>"You have a lot of guts, Bullnose."</p><p></p><p>"If we delay rescuing the young lady, everyone at the Yinlong Monastery, including you, Lin Baihu, will have to be buried with my young lady."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant called Crescent Moon jumped up like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. She put one hand on her hip, pointed at Yi Chen with the other, stood with her feet apart like a compass, and shouted at Yi Chen with an agitated expression.</p><p></p><p>Some people just don't recognize their own position. Those close to power think they possess power themselves. But this is just an illusion, no different than a supermarket cashier imagining they sustain the entire supermarket. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention she's just a maidservant of the so-called Third Young Lady. Even if the Third Young Lady herself said such words before Yi Chen, he would not spare her.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gave a wry laugh, neither confirming nor denying.  He grabbed the hair of the maidservant called Crescent Moon and tossed her directly over the low surrounding wall of the Yang Family Moat Fortress, disdainfully wiping his hands on his Taoist robe after.</p><p></p><p>Some fear the Cui Family's punishment so much they don't value others' lives. Since she claims to be so anxious to rescue people, Yi Chen will send her ahead.</p><p></p><p>If he senses even a hint of malice from her later, it would be reasonable for someone to die in this huge Yang Family Moat Fortress where something strange is happening.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu opened his mouth as if to speak, but stopped, seeming to feel Yi Chen's actions were a bit excessive, but ultimately said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen smiled and patted Lin Baihu's shoulder, still explaining: "Brother Lin, kindness cannot lead troops."</p><p></p><p>"This person fears taking responsibility herself, urging us to go inside. A mere maidservant dares to interfere with our plans as soon as she arrives - who knows what she'll dare do later."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just thinking of everyone's safety here."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Yi Chen said no more and turned to circle the perimeter of the Yang Family Moat Fortress himself.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you all still dazed? Didn't you hear what Master Yi Chengzi just said? Form groups of three and search around the Yang Family Moat Fortress. Record any abnormalities."</p><p></p><p>At Lin Baihu's command, the disciples began moving into action.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen quickly searched along the earthen walls of the fortress, looking for any possible clues.</p><p></p><p>Corpses can sometimes speak.</p><p></p><p>As Yi Chen paced about investigating, he pondered this strange case in his mind.</p><p></p><p>If this incident was caused by the crimson meteor shower's influence, what was the most likely result? Delusion? Contamination? Mutation?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yi Chen's imagination ran wild as he began guessing.</p><p></p><p>Not far along, Yi Chen soon discovered an abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Corpses - hundreds of dead rat corpses littered around the fortress walls.</p><p></p><p>Some had bulging eyes and blood flowing from every orifice, while others had half their heads blown apart.</p><p></p><p>The scattered distribution of the corpses gave the impression the rats had been fleeing something.</p><p></p><p>"It seems something extraordinary has indeed occurred at this Yang Family Moat Fortress."</p><p></p><p>"It may even defy common sense."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the numerous small animal corpses ahead, Yi Chen raised his guard to the highest level.</p><p></p><p>He backed up a few steps, continuing to circle the low wall. Then, with his extraordinary vision, he suddenly noticed a large blood-stained man sitting on the roof of the largest building in the fortress, gesturing wildly with his back to Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>This person wore a white inner robe covered in blood stains.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the man sitting on the roof suddenly turned his head. His face was deathly pale, with empty sockets instead of eyes, looking like a ghostly makeup straight out of "The Haunting Portrait." He also had a black birthmark the size of a fist on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have you found anything?" Lin Baihu's voice called out from afar as he came looking for Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen turned to Lin and said, "Brother Lin, look at the person sitting on that roof over there."</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu looked puzzled in the direction Yi Chen pointed. "Master, there's nothing on the roof, where is there a person?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lin Baihu's words, Yi Chen whipped his head back to look towards the roof himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the direction he had just looked, that ghostly huge man had instantly vanished without a trace, as if the huge man he had seen before was just an illusion. </p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yi Chen's expression was unstable, and no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Soon everyone gathered together. The patrolmen from the Zhen'an Office also reported that they had found many dead small animals around, such as chickens, ducks, and rats, as if they were fleeing from something.</p><p></p><p>Following Yi Chen's suggestion, people were sent to fetch drinking water from a distant river, and then they prepared to enter the Yang Family Stockade. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of hoofbeats arose, and a cavalry squad appeared swiftly from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu frowned and said to Yi Chen: "It's the escort team of the Third Young Lady and people from the nearby Fire Worship Sect."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Third Young Lady's guards went in two directions to seek help."</p><p></p><p>The Fire Worship Sect was a relatively major cultivation force nearby. The arrivals were a man and a woman, both dressed in white robes. The man was handsome, the woman beautiful, with a fire lotus embroidered on their chests. Judging from their demeanor, their cultivation levels were not bad, similar to the Qingxu Dao practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen glanced at them but paid no attention, they were just small fries after all. </p><p></p><p>Even big small fries were still small fries.</p><p></p><p>Compared to ordinary people, under his full force attack, they could probably be left with an intact corpse at most, nothing worth paying attention to.</p><p></p><p>He let Lin Baihu go negotiate with those people, while he led a team of patrolmen into the Yang Family Stockade.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to Yi Chen's expectations, the Yang Family Stockade was surprisingly peaceful, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>The residents coming and going all had faint smiles on their faces, very calm, seemingly not affected at all by the disappearance of people last night.</p><p></p><p>Those planting vegetables were planting, those picking mulberry leaves were picking, those pushing handcarts to transport charcoal were transporting, those blacksmithing were blacksmithing.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Family Stockade was famous for selling iron wares, from kitchen knives and hoes to chopping knives and long swords, with excellent sales.</p><p></p><p>Especially the large chopping knives sold best, good for chopping trees or chopping people.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, the famous Ao Debao used one knife for both chopping bananas and chopping people.</p><p></p><p>However, behind this seeming normality was the greatest abnormality.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, looking at the people going about their business, Yi Chen was struck by a feeling of falseness.</p><p></p><p>It felt like these people were like puppets on strings.</p><p></p><p>Yet in his perception, these people had circulating blood and breath - they were living humans.</p><p></p><p>An evil aura, an indescribable evil aura.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen stopped a middle-aged man transporting charcoal and asked if there was anyone in the stockade with a black circular birthmark the size of a fist on their face. But the man shook his head vigorously, saying he had lived here for decades and never seen such a person.</p><p></p><p>Several more people gave the same answer when asked, causing Yi Chen's brow to furrow deeper.</p><p></p><p>After instructing the patrolmen not to eat or drink anything in the stockade, he ordered them to search the entire Yang Family Stockade in groups of three.</p><p></p><p>No need for too many details from him - the patrolmen of the Zhen'an Office had their own protocols, all were battle-hardened professionals. Although not cultivators, their martial arts were no worse than the local militia, fully equipped for any situation.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough search, everyone came up empty-handed. All the residents in the stockade were cooperative, with no clues found.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what should we do now?" Lin Baihu came over and asked Yi Chen. He too was unsettled by the abnormal behavior of the stockade residents.</p><p></p><p>He had even slapped talisman wards on more than a dozen people, but the talismans showed no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen sighed. "Have half the brothers stand guard outside. If we don't come out tomorrow, have them go back and report to call for reinforcements."</p><p></p><p>"We'll stay in that house tonight and see what demon or monster is hiding in this Yang Family Stockade."</p><p></p><p>Following Yi Chen's pointing finger, it was the tallest and largest house at the center of the Yang Family Stockade.</p><p></p><p>It was also the house where he had seen that 'sinister' figure suddenly disappear earlier in the day.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu silently nodded and went out to make the arrangements.</p>

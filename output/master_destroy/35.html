        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After some back-and-forth haggling, when Yi Chen walked out of the private room, he had an additional 2,300 taels of silver in his pocket. In the end, the Daoist monk Qingxu added another 300 taels, and the matter was settled. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen smiled and lifted the curtain, letting Qingxu take the lead, while he, with a plump purse, headed towards the county yamen.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Butou, or more accurately, Zhang the Chief Constable, had been waiting impatiently at the yamen gate for a long time. </p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of his disciple, Yi Chen entered a secluded study in the backyard of the county yamen.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen detailed to Zhou, the County Magistrate, their group's speculation and decision regarding the matter.</p><p></p><p>For a while, beads of cold sweat trickled down the County Magistrate's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist monk, are you saying that although the evil spirits who massacred the Wang family have been eliminated, there is still a mysterious mastermind behind them, and Fengyang County may remain unsettled?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is too grave to be resolved by a single household in Fengyang County alone. The County Magistrate should make preparations early."</p><p></p><p>"Misfortune does not necessarily lead to calamity, nor does good fortune necessarily conceal disaster. The County Magistrate need not fear the arrival of officials from the Patrol Guard too much. Under your governance, Fengyang has transformed from a lowly county to its current middle-ranking status, which is sufficient proof of your capability."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps due to this incident, the County Magistrate may even gain favor with higher officials, who knows?" Yi Chen consoled him gently.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with this County Magistrate Zhou, Yi Chen did not harbor any ill feelings towards the man. Although greedy, this portly County Magistrate with a perpetual fake smile on his face did get things done.</p><p></p><p>For the iron-armored corpse incident in Qingyuan Town and the recent massacre of the Wang family, this County Magistrate Zhou promptly sought help to resolve the matters. This was far more likable than those self-proclaimed upright officials who only talked about moral integrity but fled at the first sign of danger, betraying their sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The common people are simple-minded. As long as you can lead them towards a better life, they won't mind if you take a little more for yourself.</p><p></p><p>However, a deal is a deal.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had eliminated the evil spirits behind the Wang family massacre, so he would not return the silver taels given by the County Magistrate.</p><p></p><p>Once money entered Daoist monk Yi's pocket, it would be harder to take it back than to kill him.</p><p></p><p>After assuring the County Magistrate that he would put in a good word for him when officials from the Patrol Guard arrived, Yi Chen bid farewell and left the county yamen.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had a substantial sum of 3,500 taels of silver on him. He planned to purchase some fine wine and delicacies to treat his junior disciples back at the Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>When one has money, one should treat oneself well.</p><p></p><p>First, he bought two skewers' worth of candied hawthorn berries, making the old seller Li Tou's face crease with smiles.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had encountered a big customer. He could close up shop right after opening, and what could be better than that?</p><p></p><p>The answer was, there was something better.</p><p></p><p>Wang the Butcher, who had been selling pork in the market for decades, received a large order today to deliver half a fattened pig to the Hidden Dragon Monastery every other day.</p><p></p><p>The poultry seller, the vegetable seller, the dried fruit and candies seller, and the wine seller were all delighted, for they too had received large orders.</p><p></p><p>Except for the fish seller...</p><p></p><p>Since there were too many items, Yi Chen rented a horse-drawn carriage to load his purchases, preparing to leave the city and return to the monastery.</p><p></p><p>This trip had truly been a great harvest. Not only had he achieved a breakthrough in his cultivation, but he had also more than covered the travel expenses.</p><p></p><p>The poor family would become rich on the road, and Daoist monk Yi was unwilling to suffer hardship.</p><p></p><p>"Giddyup! Giddyup!"</p><p></p><p>The driver cracked his long whip, steering the carriage towards the city exit, with Yi Chen following closely behind. As they passed by the Wang manor, he couldn't help but pause.</p><p></p><p>Many constables were coming and going within the Wang manor, either carrying corpses or moving household items. The person leading them was none other than Yi Chen's registered senior disciple, Zhang Butou.</p><p></p><p>Recently appointed as the Chief Constable of Fengyang County, he had been dispatched by the County Magistrate to dispose of the corpses in the Wang manor and seal up the family's land deeds, properties, and valuables.</p><p></p><p>A plump, sallow-faced corpse was being carried out.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They lifted him and placed him into a thin red coffin. Yidchen fixed his gaze and was amused. </p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the same boss who had bought his Bawang chicken back then?</p><p></p><p>When Yidchen went to inspect the scene initially, he didn't enter the inner courtyard, so he really didn't know it was this person who had died.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Wang, Lord Wang, you bought my Bawang chicken back then, and I've helped you avenge the extermination of your household. We're even now. This poor monk will recite a passage to guide your entire household's souls, may you have a smooth journey to the underworld."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Yidchen began chanting outside the gate.</p><p></p><p>"By the highest decree, your lonely soul is transcended, all ghosts and demons receive this grace.</p><p>Those with heads transcend, those without heads ascend, those killed by blade or gunshot.  </p><p>Those who died openly or secretly, those wronged to death, creditors and foes, children avenging parents.</p><p>Kneel before my altar, the Eight Trigrams shine, step out from Kan and transcend to another realm..."</p><p></p><p>All the gifts of fate have a hidden price tag, all things are universally connected. The passage to the afterlife that Yidchen recited for free was because he knew the fee for his performance this time still came from the flock itself.  </p><p></p><p>Who knows, the thin coffin Lord Wang laid in, recorded by Captain Zhang's brush, was an invaluable treasure paid for by the yamen, to be deducted later from the Wang family's assets. Yidchen was just being polite on the surface, but there were deeper waters beneath.</p><p></p><p>After reciting the passage, Yidchen shook his head and left without chatting idly with Captain Zhang, turning away with casual elegance.</p><p></p><p>Lord Wang's death also stirred some feelings in his heart. What good are vast wealth and fortune? In this world where evil spirits exist, only power is fundamental. He must not confuse the essential with the superficial.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At noon, at the Hidden Dragon Monastery. </p><p></p><p>Qingfeng and Mingyue were reciting sutras in the main hall under Qingyunzi's guidance.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly there was a knock at the door.</p><p></p><p>The mischievous Qingfeng raised his brows and hurried to the main gate, leaving behind the words "I'll get the door" echoing in his wake.</p><p></p><p>He opened the door to an unfamiliar face.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the young Taoists of Hidden Dragon Monastery? I'm the porter hired by Master Yichengzi to deliver goods. Where should I put all this stuff?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng eyed the porter warily, then looked at the large cart outside, puzzled why his senior brother would buy so many things out of season.</p><p></p><p>Were they going to have financial troubles?</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to ask something, a familiar figure appeared. Yidchen strolled up to the gate in an unhurried manner, scooping Qingfeng up to sit on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng shouted happily, "It's Senior Brother, Senior Brother is back!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mingyue also ran over quickly and was scooped up by Yidchen to sit on his right shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Yidchen instructed the porter to carry the goods to the kitchen, while he held the two little ones' legs with his big hands to prevent them from fidgeting and falling off.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, why did you buy so much stuff?" Qingyunzi also came out and approached Yidchen.</p><p></p><p>Last night he had received three 100-year-old ginseng roots and two 80-year-old Astragalus roots delivered by someone claiming to be sent by the County Master. Today, the senior brother had purchased even more supplies.</p><p></p><p>What happened in this short period of time?</p><p></p><p>Yidchen put the two little ones down from his shoulders, patted their heads and smiled, "Junior Brother, we don't need to eat fish anymore. Our monastery has money now."</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you the details tonight. Today, let's cook up a feast!"</p><p></p><p>"Yay!" The two little ones cheered joyfully, their happy tunes filling the entire courtyard. Even the porter couldn't help but smile happily, as Yidchen tipped him a few tael of silver.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a group of four people arrived at the surroundings of the Wang family's mansion. Captain Zhang and a few pale-faced constables were sealing off the crime scene, preventing it from being disturbed. </p><p></p><p>Yichen and the other three stood at the entrance of the mansion.</p><p></p><p>Outside the gate, three corpses lay on the street, all disemboweled with their livers missing. One of the bodies, dressed in a dark brocade robe, was the most gruesome, with deeper and more numerous knife wounds than the others.</p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua crouched down, carefully examined them, and showed a pensive expression. </p><p></p><p>"From the positions of the bodies and their wounds, these three were alive when their livers were dug out on the spot, causing their deaths."</p><p></p><p>"Their bulging eyes and horrified expressions suggest they didn't run or make noise, so this evil spirit may have abilities to shock the mind or control bodies."</p><p></p><p>"Insightful observation, Master," Yichen and the other two nodded in agreement.  </p><p></p><p>The four then entered the mansion compound.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they went in, an intense bloody stench assailed their nostrils. Master Shuiyue's exquisite nose twitched as her brows knitted tightly.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, Monk Qingxu spoke up, "Why don't we split up and investigate, then regroup to share information later?"</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Yichen and the others had no objection, as it would take forever to inspect the massive Wang mansion together one area at a time.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they headed off in different directions.</p><p></p><p>Master Shuiyue went to the rear courtyard where the women resided. As a woman herself, she was most suitable to investigate there out of respect for the deceased females.</p><p></p><p>After all, Captain Zhang had mentioned that the Wang family's young lady had her mouth torn apart. In this huge mansion, there wasn't a single intact pair of pants among the ten corpses. With Yichen and the other two being men, it was most appropriate for Master Shuiyue to take that area.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Monk Qingxu and Master Lianhua go separate ways, Yichen's eyes shifted as he strolled along the perimeter wall.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Yichen noticed a body collapsed by the wall - a martial artist by his attire, dead in a horrific state. There were long, bloody handprints on the two-meter high brick wall, and his chest had been pierced open from the front, spilling gore everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Yet his face bizarrely retained a look of relief at having narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>Yichen glanced up at the tall courtyard wall, then back at the corpse before him. The man was over 1.8 meters tall and physically fit, appearing to have cultivated some external martial arts that tempered the body.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a puzzled look emerged on Yichen's face.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and pinched the corpse's skin, finding it tough like cowhide.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, a robust corpse.  </p><p>A master, no wonder he made it to the wall.</p><p></p><p>But now Yichen's confusion only deepened.</p><p></p><p>This large, martially-trained man with a yang robust constitution - how could he not scale a mere two-meter wall?</p><p></p><p>Why did he die with that bizarre look of having narrowly escaped?</p><p></p><p>What method did this evil spirit use?</p><p></p><p>Sound manipulation? Mind control?</p><p></p><p>Even slaughtering two hundred pigs standing up would take quite a while. Yet in the Wang mansion with over two hundred victims, not a single one escaped, and the neighbors didn't hear any commotion.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Yichen's brow furrowed as he circled the area, noticing several more scattered corpses by the wall.  </p><p>His puzzlement only grew denser.</p><p></p><p>After pondering, he leapt over the wall, dashed around inspecting the eight Bagua spirit-trapping mirrors at Fengyang City's four gates for cracks, before returning to the Wang mansion.</p><p></p><p>It was now midday, and Master Lianhua's group had also finished investigating. Led by Captain Zhang, the four gathered at Fengyang County's biggest restaurant, Shili Xiang, to have a meal and share information.</p><p></p><p>As men accustomed to death, including Master Shuiyue, none had issues eating after viewing corpses. As soon as the dishes arrived, they dug in heartily.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't delay - one among them devoured like a whirlwind, making them fear not getting any food if they were late.</p><p></p><p>Unlike that person who had already eaten several bowls of noodles beforehand, the rest hadn't even had breakfast.</p><p></p><p>A plate of greens was cleared with two chopstick motions. Yichen grabbed a plate of chicken feet and gnawed them to the bone, not spitting out a single fragment. His gaping maw was like a black hole, making any amount of food vanish without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Most shockingly, despite Yichen's speed, his table manners were impeccable, exuding a bold aura.</p><p></p><p>Master Shuiyue's vermilion lips parted slightly as she gazed at Yichen in seeming discovery of something interesting.</p><p></p><p>Noticing her gaze, even thick-skinned Yichen felt a tinge of embarrassment. He put down the chopsticks reaching for the braised chicken leg, scratched his head, and gave an awkward smile to the group.</p><p></p><p>"My apologies for the unsightly display."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the contrast between the Yichen who had violently beaten the Peach Blossom Elder over a minor disagreement, later making unhinged threats like a madman - and this young cultivator now smiling sheepishly for eating a few extra bites...this adorable difference amused Master Shuiyue.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts seemed to turn to some possibility, and her expression softened further. She pushed a plate of chicken drumsticks towards Yichen.</p><p></p><p>"No need for the cultivator to hold back. Please, eat up. We can order more dishes if needed," she said, her voice as melodious as a ringing stream or jade hitting silver.</p><p></p><p>Yichen glanced at Master Shuiyue, abashed.  </p><p></p><p>Those chicken legs did look plump and curvaceous.</p><p></p><p>He quickly averted his eyes, thanked her, and focused intently on eating.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He flaunted the chicken leg.</p><p></p><p>The dishes at this Ten Miles Fragrance Restaurant were truly excellent, far better than eating fish. He couldn't help but eat a few more bites. </p><p></p><p>Now everyone at the Hidden Dragon Monastery smelled of fish and had changed colors...</p><p></p><p>Soon, the table was a mess of cups and plates. After the crowd had eaten and drunk their fill, the waiter brought a few cups of tea and some fruit plates, then withdrew from the private room.</p><p></p><p>The group began to share their discoveries with each other.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist monk Qingxu spoke first: "I carefully examined the situation in the front courtyard. The deaths of those maids, old ladies, and servants were basically the same as the three people outside the main gate. Before dying, they all had looks of terror on their faces, and their livers had gone missing."</p><p></p><p>"From this, it seems this evil spirit is indeed as the monk Lianhua described. This evil spirit likely has the ability to mentally shock or control people's bodies, which we must guard against."</p><p></p><p>Everyone nodded, and then Lianhua continued: "I examined the deaths of the patrol guards from last night and found their footsteps were scattered about, as if they had been circling in place before dying. I suspect this evil spirit not only has the ability for mental shocks, but also likely has the ability to confuse minds."</p><p></p><p>"That would explain how this evil spirit could kill over two hundred people of the Wang family in one night without being noticed."</p><p></p><p>"It must have first confused everyone's minds, then killed them one by one."</p><p></p><p>"Among the many corpses, I even found the body of a Taoist that the Wang family had hired at great expense. He too died silently, with his liver taken."</p><p></p><p>"This evil spirit is quite vicious."</p><p></p><p>The nun Shuyue took out a white silk handkerchief, wiped her mouth, and then said: "The corpses of the women in the rear courtyard were torn into pieces, their livers also missing."  </p><p></p><p>"They seemed to have been tortured before death."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, a hint of anger appeared on Shuyue's egg-shaped face, her complexion slightly reddening, as if recalling the deaths of those beautiful ladies.</p><p></p><p>The others immediately understood - they didn't expect this evil spirit was also an old lecher.</p><p></p><p>The three of them turned their gazes towards Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot match the skills of you senior masters in examining the scene and corpses. However, I did discover something new."</p><p></p><p>"Even if this evil spirit has mind-confusing abilities, the Wang estate kept many experts. How could it control so many people at once?"</p><p></p><p>"The more people it tries to control, the more diluted its mind-confusing ability would become. Surely some warriors with strong wills or lucky individuals with protective talismans would break through the encirclement. At the edge of the compound wall, I found more than ten corpses, proving my theory."</p><p></p><p>"However, this group of people who escaped the mind confusion all had looks of having just survived a calamity when they died."  </p><p></p><p>"Yet they died without ever climbing over that two meter high wall."</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps they thought they had climbed over the wall to safety, but in reality they never left the area near the wall."</p><p></p><p>The three furrowed their brows, and Qingxu said: "Are you suggesting, Daoist Yi, that this evil spirit may not be alone?"</p><p></p><p>"That this evil spirit, like a wolf with its mates, has accompanying or parasitic companions? Is that how those who escaped to the wall were still affected?"</p><p></p><p>"It's certainly possible," Yi Chen said, his gaze deepening as he looked at everyone.</p><p></p><p>"It's even possible that this evil spirit was released into the estate by someone using evil arts to shatter the Eight Trigrams Soul-Capturing Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"If it's an evil spirit kept as a pet by someone, and that person used a spirit flag or special talisman to seal off the Wang estate, it could achieve this effect too."</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt a chill hearing this.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yi Chen's guesses were too horrifying to hear.</p><p></p><p>If it was an evil spirit with parasitic companions, then this mission would certainly be extremely dangerous for them, perhaps even life-threatening.</p><p></p><p>These strange evil spirits can generally merge or devour each other at critical moments, causing their power to soar. Fortunately, such evil spirits are very rare to encounter.</p><p></p><p>But if encountered, they are extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>And if it was the second scenario, that would be even worse trouble.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what the intentions and strength of the person behind the scenes were?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the three couldn't help but recall the scene of the Wang family's corpses missing their livers, and their worries grew.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group's morale was a bit low, Lianhua forced a laugh and said: "These are just our guesses. Unless the experts from the imperial Ministry of Ceremonies come, we have no way to determine if the Eight Trigrams Mirror was shattered by human action or the evil spirit with our abilities."</p><p></p><p>"For now, the arrow is on the bowstring and must be loosed. Let's proceed carefully tonight."  </p><p></p><p>"If there really is someone behind the scenes, then this matter is beyond what we can intervene in. At that time, we can truthfully report to the county official and have him request aid from the Ministry."</p><p></p><p>"And if it really is a parasitic evil spirit, then we'll do our best. With the four of us together, that evil spirit won't find it so easy to devour us all at once."</p><p></p><p>After Lianhua finished speaking, everyone nodded in approval.</p><p></p><p>Lianhua's words essentially meant:</p><p></p><p>Right now it's all just guesses. We'll definitely have to fight, otherwise we'll lose face. But if this matter is too deep, we'll let the imperial Ministry take over.</p><p></p><p>We're just making a bit of money here, no need to risk our lives. Even if we risk our lives, we may not be able to resolve this. It's better to have faith in the wisdom of the imperial court to properly handle this and deter the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Let's be careful tonight, brothers. We'll stand together - even if it's a parasitic evil spirit, even if we can't defeat it, we can still flee.</p><p></p><p>"The monk speaks rightly and with maturity."</p><p></p><p>These were all perspicacious people, so they all heard the implied meaning behind Lianhua's words.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

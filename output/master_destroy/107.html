        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Dragon River Prefecture, the Chen Family Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Occupying dozens of acres, the Chen Family Mansion was the most prominent existence in the entire Dragon River Prefecture. </p><p></p><p>Inside, there were artificial hills, flowing streams, pavilions and towers, each one exquisite and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family of Dragon River Prefecture was renowned for being as wealthy as "white jade halls and golden horses, pearls as common as soil and gold like iron."</p><p></p><p>After centuries of deep cultivation, the entire city of Dragon River Prefecture bore the imprint of the Chen family.</p><p></p><p>If you wanted to do any business in Dragon River Prefecture without paying tribute to the Chen family's docks, you might as well not even think about it - it would be impossible to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Every year, an unknown number of corpses were sunk to the bottom of the Dragon River by those who defied them.</p><p></p><p>Butcher shops, farms, fresh produce, stores, carriage companies, private schools, brothels, martial arts schools - basically every visible and invisible industry in Dragon River Prefecture had a stake owned by the Chen family.</p><p></p><p>So what is generational wealth and power?</p><p></p><p>It's not about how much gold, silver and jewels a family has, but rather monopoly.</p><p></p><p>Monopolizing resources, knowledge, and paths to advancement.</p><p></p><p>If any outstanding challengers appeared in their jurisdiction, it was easy to deal with them:</p><p></p><p>Eight words. Invite them as guests, behead them, or make them servants.</p><p></p><p>For outstanding outsiders they could absorb, they would marry them into the family with a daughter of lower birth. After two or three generations, they would become one family.</p><p></p><p>Those they could not absorb would be drowned in the river.</p><p></p><p>In such a world, committing evil deeds was only normal.</p><p></p><p>Such was the way of the world - some were cattle and horses, while others enjoyed authority.</p><p></p><p>As Laozi once said, "The way of Heaven is to take from those who have too much, and give to those who do not have enough. The way of man is to take from those who do not have enough, to serve those who already have too much."</p><p></p><p>The New Testament Gospel of Matthew also wrote:</p><p></p><p>"For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."</p><p></p><p>Inside the luxurious mansion, the Chen family patriarch Chen Fuyun wore brocaded robes, keeping the beat as three beauties in sheer gowns danced for him.</p><p></p><p>On his table was an array of exquisite food and wine that ordinary people could scarcely imagine.</p><p></p><p>There were two kinds of wine - one was grape wine transported over 26,000 li from the distant Byzantine Empire, served in luminous cups.</p><p></p><p>The other was a spirit called "Drunken Immortal," more precious than gold, served in rhinoceros horn cups.</p><p></p><p>As for the most ordinary dish on the table, it was sauteed phoenix tongues - made from the tongues of 300 chickens to make a single plate.</p><p></p><p>Candied fruits were too common for this table.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family's wealth and power could be glimpsed from this scene.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fuyun had three loves: fine wine, gourmet food, and beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, listening to the soft singing of the beauties around him, his expression serene yet tinged with a deeply hidden bitterness.</p><p></p><p>After the song ended, the beauties daintily approached the table, plating dishes, peeling grapes, and pouring wine into his cup.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you seem a bit melancholy. Shi Shi, An An and Xiang Xiang are worried seeing you like this," said one beauty, an icy jade beauty, as she fed a grape into Chen Fuyun's mouth with concern.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fuyun deliberately licked the beauty's jade-like fingertip, dispelling his bitterness. He laughed heartily, "In this life, I've obtained everything I've wanted to have, eat and taste. What is there to be unsatisfied about?"</p><p></p><p>He embraced the sheer-gowned beauties and sang loudly, keeping the beat:</p><p></p><p>"Shi Shi was born alluring,</p><p>Xiang Xiang's affection for me is deeper,</p><p>Compared to An An, who could last longer?</p><p>Combining the four into one,</p><p>Fortunately I'm not yet spent.</p><p>Composing new verses, I ponder at length,</p><p>Revising again and again, over and over."</p><p></p><p>"The word 'lascivious' has me in its midst."</p><p></p><p>Just as Chen Fuyun was about to indulge his beastly desires and "combine the four into one" with the three beauties, the door suddenly burst open. A demonic gust of wind swept in, knocking the three beauties unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fuyun stood up abruptly to see an elderly man in black robes with white hair enter.</p><p></p><p>It was his old butler. But Chen Fuyun knew this was no longer his true butler.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Chen, you have quite the talent," a rasping voice like a saw on a wok came from the butler's throat.</p><p></p><p>"But alas, are you really without any dissatisfaction?"</p><p></p><p>"Which lofty cultivator has come to mock me? If the venerable one has any requests, please state them. The Chen family is one of the nine great families of the Great Viet dynasty. Although Dragon River is but a prefecture under our domain..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's a small branch of the family, but still has some power," Chen Fuyun stated his background right away, speaking in a half-firm, half-soft tone. </p><p></p><p>"I am Youquan Zi of the Yellow Springs Sect. I have come to make a deal with Dao friend Chen to save your life," Youquan Zi's voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous, I have no illness or danger, why would I need you to save my life? Dao friend Youquan Zi must be worried about retaliation from the Zhen'an Office instead."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, it's because your life span is running short, what I say is both true and not true."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Fuyun was like a duck whose throat was locked, silent for a long time, as if he was grasped by the throat. </p><p></p><p>After a good while, he finally spoke: "Why would you want to save me, Dao friend?"</p><p></p><p>"I have four Yin Yuan Pills made primarily from the Yin Yuan Fruit. Each one can extend your life by five years."</p><p></p><p>"If you take all four, even if the efficacy decreases, you could live at least fifteen more years."</p><p></p><p>"You've been stuck in the late stage of Refining Qi into Spirit for a long time. With the help of the Yin Yuan Pills, if you make vigorous progress in the next fifteen years, you can break through the bottleneck and further extend your life."</p><p></p><p>"My friend, tell me, can this save you or not?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Fuyun's face flushed red, his eyes full of desire. He suppressed his hoarse voice and said, "What's the price?"</p><p></p><p>"I need to perform a blood sacrifice at your Chen Manor. You help me conceal it. Two thousand people for one Yin Yuan Pill. You get the people, and once the number is reached, I'll have someone give you one Yin Yuan Pill. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Although I, Youquan Zi, am ruthless in the cultivation world, I have never gone back on my word, as you must know. I'm also unwilling to offend the Chen family patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! The Zhen'an Office is watching so closely, how can I possibly get that many people for you to sacrifice?"</p><p></p><p>"At most, twelve hundred people for one pill. I can try to figure something out," Chen Fuyun's eyes were bloodshot as he almost exhausted all his strength to shout.</p><p></p><p>He barely hesitated whether to exchange or not, and directly started bargaining.</p><p></p><p>Only those who have enjoyed all the pleasures of the world fear death so much.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the next realm was hopeless, but if he could use a few thousand lowly people to extend his life by fifteen years, it would be an extremely good deal.</p><p></p><p>It would also be the glory of those lowly people.</p><p></p><p>Youquan Zi fell silent for a moment. This Chen family patriarch was even easier to manipulate than he had imagined. He had deliberately said two thousand just to let him bargain, but the result was twenty percent more than his psychological price.</p><p></p><p>To express his difficulty, he waited a while before speaking:</p><p></p><p>"Very well, this pauper will make a friend with the Dao friend."</p><p></p><p>"Twelve hundred for one pill, then."</p><p></p><p>Youquan Zi wasn't worried at all about how the Chen family would get the people. As a great aristocratic clan, they had plenty of servants and tenants. As for concealing the population, that was a traditional skill.</p><p></p><p>Without a few hundred or thousand unregistered households, how could you call yourself a great clan?</p><p></p><p>Getting people and secretly performing the blood sacrifice might be difficult for the Yellow Springs Sect, but for the Chen family, whose stamp was all over Dragon River Manor, the difficulty wasn't that high if they tried.</p><p></p><p>Carriages, tenants, brothels, gambling dens, pawnshops, servants, even orphanages.</p><p></p><p>After settling some details with the Chen family patriarch, Youquan Zi turned into a wisp of black smoke and disappeared. The old steward collapsed to the ground, as the one who came to meet the patriarch was just a fragment of his spiritual sense residing through secret methods.</p><p></p><p>That afternoon, Yi Chen led his disciples to plow through the entire southern city again. What made Yi Chen both gratified and regretful was that it seemed the demonic forces had given up causing trouble in his southern district.</p><p></p><p>He patrolled all day but only caught one unlucky fellow, gaining ten deep red points.</p><p></p><p>Opening the backend, he unexpectedly discovered a golden legend!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Big Melon Dude donated ten thousand points. Special thanks here.</p><p></p><p>Special thanks also to the True Ah Shi Dalu and the 1506 Dalu for their monthly ticket donations.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to July Wind Chime, Want to Eat Grilled Fish, Boundless Sea and Sky, 88888993, Z Xiaobai, number 8395, number 5751, Big Dragon Mountain Bandit 1, number 8182, number 6679, number 6324, number 9264, number 9750, Spider Mender, Super Handsome Baby, number 9314, number 1619, Yan Su Awkward, Z18888888, number 0424, and the Big Melon Dude for their monthly ticket support.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to those who recommended tickets, there were too many to thank individually.</p><p></p><p>Thanks for everyone's subscription support.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>A thick bolt of lightning ripped through the sky, as if it would split the heavens in two. </p><p></p><p>Heavy rain poured down, plummeting rapidly from the high clouds and hitting the muddy ground, blasting small and large shallow pits.</p><p></p><p>Yichen trudged along in the direction of the county town, wearing a rain cape and cursing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"What shitty weather, it's been raining nonstop since yesterday. And it's still going strong this morning, does it have a grudge against me for traveling far today?"</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow" (Yeah yeah, the rain is so annoying.)</p><p></p><p>The little cat crouched on Yichen's shoulder, responding in a low voice.  </p><p></p><p>Yichen looked up and glared fiercely at the black clouds.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, the rain got even heavier. A bolt of lightning even struck just over ten meters away from Yichen, hitting the crown of a large tree nearby, giving him a big fright.</p><p></p><p>He shrank his neck, not daring to challenge the weather further. The little cat also fell silent, obediently crouching on Yichen's shoulder as the two continued hurrying along with lowered heads.</p><p></p><p>After walking for about an hour, suddenly in the distant rain curtain, a convoy of carriages appeared with three carriages surrounded by seven or eight knights on horseback and around ten foot soldiers.</p><p></p><p>The lead knight had prominent temples, muscular arms with thick calluses on his left hand, looking like an expert.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, experts like that were just a single punch away. At most their corpses would be a bit more intact instead of directly exploding.</p><p></p><p>Yichen raised his head, glancing at the convoy traveling through the rain curtain, but saw nothing particularly noteworthy.  </p><p></p><p>With one long stride spanning two to three meters, he rapidly advanced forward.</p><p></p><p>However, some subtle changes still occurred unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid, but someone in the convoy was absolutely terrified.</p><p></p><p>Their convoy was traveling smoothly through the rain curtain, when suddenly a figure over two meters tall burst out from behind, covered in knotted muscles with his powerful chest straining the front of his clothes.</p><p></p><p>He had a large sword on his back, a cold indifferent expression, taking three-meter strides rapidly, with a large black cat also looking indifferent as it licked its paws perched on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>This scene, wasn't it terrifying?</p><p></p><p>At least Zhang Dekai, responsible for keeping watch at the rear, immediately broke out in a cold sweat on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Having read countless martial arts novels, this scenario had played out countless times in his mind.</p><p></p><p>A rainy night, carrying a sword but no umbrella.  </p><p>A powerful figure, wearing a rain cape, indifferent, with an ominous black cat.</p><p></p><p>All the elements were there.</p><p></p><p>Ah!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dekai's inner voice began narrating:</p><p></p><p>He is the strongest killer in the jianghu, nicknamed "The Crimson Dot of Greater Vietnam."  </p><p>His heart is as cold as ice.</p><p>His sword is even colder than his heart.  </p><p>He has no feelings.</p><p></p><p>After a whirlwind of thoughts, Zhang Dekai could no longer hold it in, screaming at the top of his lungs:</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack!"</p><p>"Enemy attack!" </p><p>"Everyone be on guard, a powerful master is here."</p><p>"So terrifying."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the previously orderly convoy descended into chaos. Some drew short swords, some drew long swords, some felt for slaked lime in their pockets, some scattered caltrops on the ground, some frowned and elegantly retreated a step to shield their comrades...</p><p></p><p>Hearing the commotion behind, the lead knight with sideburns Zhang Bukai suddenly turned his head.</p><p></p><p>"What rat dares provoke the Weiyuan Escort Agency? Trying to rob us, do you think I, Zhang Bukai of the Five Tiger Broken Door Blades, am a dead man?"</p><p></p><p>The lead knight shouted, then felt a cold indifferent gaze from the figure in the rain curtain, causing his brow to start twitching madly.  </p><p></p><p>This was his hard-earned terrifying intuition from years of life-and-death experiences warning him.</p><p></p><p>Danger! Danger! Danger!</p><p>This man cannot be defeated.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his fiery temper turned mild.  </p><p></p><p>Steeling himself, he urged his horse forward: "Good sir, I am Zhang Bukai, the secondary chief escort of Duanyang County's Weiyuan Escort Agency. Our head chief escort is Wen Tai, the Thunder Hand, who has some connections in the local green woods."</p><p></p><p>"Please good sir, show mercy for the sake of our head chief. There will surely be a generous reward later."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he tossed a heavy bag of silver towards Yichen.</p><p></p><p>By now Zhang Bukai had also finally gotten a clear look at the arrival's appearance - over two meters tall, bulging muscles, face like ice, eyes like lightning. Rainwater dripped from his rain cape to the ground, and the strange black cat perched on his shoulder added to his chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Bukai had thought at one meter eighty-plus and stout build, he was considered quite physically powerful. But compared to this man, he was like a malnourished beansprout.  </p><p></p><p>It's better not to fight if possible.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Zhang Bukai made up his mind internally.</p><p>He would try offering some passage fees to get through safely, even if it meant writing off this job as a loss.</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "......"</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>Why did this group of people suddenly go into an uproar, shouting about a powerful master coming? Where is this powerful master?</p><p></p><p>Yichen was a bit dazed for a moment.  </p><p></p><p>A faint sense of malice was emanating from the crowd in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what malice feels like? They're even drawing weapons on me, but it doesn't seem very intense. They seem to be afraid."</p><p></p><p>"Does this malice relate to the strength of the one emanating it?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yichen was lost in thought.  </p><p></p><p>The little cat perched on his shoulder remained indifferently licking its paws, having switched to the right paw now.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yichen not respond, cold sweat poured even more from Zhang Bukai's forehead.  </p><p></p><p>Damn, he thinks it's not enough.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, he painfully took out another pocket of silver ingots from a hidden spot and tossed it towards Yichen.</p><p></p><p>"Good sir, that's really all I have left, not a single ingot more."</p><p></p><p>"I've handed over my private stash."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This time, Yi Chen understood clearly. </p><p></p><p>Sitting up from his deathbed illness, the powerful person turned out to be himself.</p><p></p><p>He was about to explain when a young escort among the convoy, holding a dagger in his left hand and a lime bag in his right, seemed to recognize Yi Chen and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Oh shit, it's a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>"Second Escort Leader, this hero is Daoist Master Yi from the Hidden Dragon Temple in Fengyun County, not some powerful person."</p><p></p><p>"I'm from Fengyun County myself. Previously, when the wealthy Wang family in our county was plagued by evil spirits, it was Daoist Master Yi who resolved it."  </p><p></p><p>"He is a highly skilled Daoist master, I've seen it myself."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five minutes later, Yi Chen was already sitting in the last carriage at the end of the convoy, unable to decline such warm hospitality, especially with the annoying rain. After some thought, he agreed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he finally understood the misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>The convoy was on a mission from the Weiyu Escort Agency to escort someone.</p><p></p><p>They were escorting Madam Li, who was returning to her hometown in Duanyang County to visit relatives. </p><p></p><p>It turned out that the nephew of the lead escort, Zhang De, was on his first escort mission with no experience. After some wild imagination, he led the situation in a strange direction.</p><p></p><p>Young people indeed lack steadiness.</p><p></p><p>As the instigator of this misunderstanding, his preconceived notions almost led the entire escort team to disaster. His furious colleagues began to give him a lesson of tough love outside, deciding he would no longer be on escort duty and would instead be assigned to feed the horses.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After another hour or so, the convoy suddenly stopped. The rain had also lessened, becoming as fine as cow hair.</p><p></p><p>A voice came through:</p><p></p><p>"Second Escort Leader, it's not good. The Qingshui River has flooded, and the bridge is submerged. We can't cross."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yi Chen got off the horse carriage. The lead escort with sideburns looked at the submerged Qingshui Bridge with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>The Qingshui River was nearly a hundred meters wide. Without a bridge, how could they cross it by human effort?</p><p></p><p>"The bridge is submerged, we can't cross."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master, why don't you join us in retreating to a nearby post station to rest for a bit? We can cross once the water recedes."</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain for a day and night, coupled with the mountain torrents, caused the Qingshui River to swell rapidly, submerging the bridge.</p><p></p><p>However, while the escort team could wait, Yi Chen could not.</p><p></p><p>He had promised Lin Baishu that he would arrive today, so he could not break his word.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, a smile appeared on Yi Chen's face.</p><p></p><p>"I have an idea."</p><p></p><p>"Escort Leader Zhang, I must thank you for your kind offer, but please lend me a carriage compartment to travel a distance."</p><p></p><p>"However, Escort Leader, your physique is not up to par. You need more training; you look quite weak."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen patted Zhang's shoulder lightly, as if encouraging him, but Zhang almost stumbled and fell.</p><p></p><p>Then, Zhang's pupils shrank instantly, as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>No, the entire escort team's pupils shrank instantly.</p><p></p><p>They had collectively seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Their mouths opened as wide as goose eggs, staring in shock at the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>They saw Yi Chen's figure flicker as he dashed to a large tree by the roadside, as thick as a large basin. With a single hand chop, he cut the tree in two, as easily as if he were cutting sugarcane.</p><p></p><p>He picked out the most suitable section, stood by the riverside, and with a powerful stomp, gathering half of his strength, he kicked the massive log. Imbued with tremendous force, the log shot across the river surface, kicking up splashes several zhang high.</p><p></p><p>The log's momentum was swift, but Yi Chen's speed was even faster. With a powerful push from his right foot, the tremendous counterforce propelled Yi Chen forward, allowing him to land steadily on the log first.</p><p></p><p>One log stirred up a thousand waves.</p><p></p><p>Today, Daoist Master Yi crossed the river on a single log.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, this pauper monk will take his leave. Hope we meet again if fate allows!" </p><p></p><p>A thunderous voice suddenly erupted on the spot, echoing in the heavens and earth for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the entire escort team dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit, what kind of Daoist skill is this? Are all the great masters in Fengyun County like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master Yi's supernatural power is truly terrifying. Today my eyes have really been opened."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look! Daoist Master Yi has crossed the river, but his momentum hasn't decreased. After the log reached the shore, he's still sliding, he's still sliding~"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The escort team on the shore began discussing animatedly.</p><p></p><p>Little Meow gripped Yi Chen's collar tightly with its claws, afraid of falling off. The fierce river wind blew so hard that it could barely open its eyes.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly felt it was so thrilling.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't help but start meowing again.</p><p></p><p>However, no one noticed that at the very front carriage by the riverside, the corner of the curtain had already been gently lifted by a beautifully dressed palace lady. Her hands were as slender as young bamboo shoots, her lips as red as cherry blossoms. She tightly covered her red lips with her jade-like hands, afraid she would cry out in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my heavens."</p><p></p><p>"There really are such powerful people in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed Yi Chen's feat of crossing the river on a single log, Madam Li stared at his receding back with a slightly dazed look in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Until she could no longer see Yi Chen's back, she gently lowered the curtain.</p><p></p><p>She crossed and uncrossed her long, jade-like legs in different positions.</p><p></p><p>Changing one position.</p><p></p><p>Then another position.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Madam Li came from a wealthy family and had been a widow for many years.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Special thanks to yesterday's Patrons: Wuwen, Dadaie, tail number 3467, tail number 8740, Failed University Chinese, tail number 1229, tail number 4579, Li Yan s25, tail number 9750, mccstc, Fanhua Luojin, tail number 2425, tail number 5797, tail number 4652, Feng Fengfeng111 for their monthly tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to all friends for their recommendation tickets, the recommendation ticket list is too long to thank one by one.</p><p></p><p>Thanks everyone for following the story.</p><p></p><p>There will be one more chapter today.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

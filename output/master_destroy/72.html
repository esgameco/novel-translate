        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry to trouble you, Miss Yuyan."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen politely gave a slight bow towards the white-robed lady in front of him, seeing her off as she left. </p><p></p><p>The one Yi Chen addressed as Miss Yuyan was the person who came to receive them inside this grand mansion.</p><p></p><p>Just as the white-robed lady was about to step out of the main gate, Yi Chen suddenly flickered and blocked her path in front.</p><p></p><p>"There is one more thing I'd like to ask Miss Yuyan."</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead, Daoist master."</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure besides the servants and your parents, you don't have any older or younger brothers in your family?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you've forgotten something?" Yi Chen asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Why would the Daoist master say that? Over these years, my parents only gave birth to me. They did want a son, but they never conceived again. After growing older, they gave up on that idea."</p><p></p><p>Miss Yuyan's eyes widened, her tone sounding somewhat surprised, as if finding it very strange that Yi Chen would ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'm just asking casually. But Miss, you should still be careful tonight. If you remember anything or encounter anything strange, just call out loudly for help."</p><p></p><p>"This poor Daoist will rush over immediately," Yi Chen said with a smile, glancing at Miss Yuyan's bare hands exposed outside her robe.</p><p></p><p>This put the previously tense white-robed lady somewhat at ease.</p><p></p><p>This tall Daoist master had suddenly flickered to block her path and asked her such strange questions, which had startled her a bit.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the people from the Zhen'an Magistracy, she preferred the other group residing in the side hall, especially that sword-wielding white-robed young master - with a jade-like face, tall and elegant bearing, and a charming smile. She was still unmarried; if only she could become his wife and stay together with him forever.</p><p></p><p>Alas, it seemed he already had a master-sister.</p><p></p><p>What a sly vixen, clinging to her master-brother like a parasite every day.</p><p></p><p>After thanking Yi Chen, Miss Yuyan ran out of the main hall as swiftly as if taking flight. The night was cold with dew; she had to go ask the white-robed young master if he needed an extra blanket. Hehehe~</p><p></p><p>She would take pity on her giegie too.</p><p></p><p>The romance novels she read in her boudoir all played out this way - the childhood sweetheart loses to the heavenly beauty. Since ancient times, the master-sister often fails against the disciple-wife. Everyone would rely on their own means then.</p><p></p><p>Thinking thus, she thrust out her chest and walked even faster.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist master, have you made any discoveries?" This time, the one speaking was a small officer under Lin Baihu, called Niu Da. Unable to hold back, he came over and asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his question, the crowd in the main hall all turned their gazes towards Yi Chen's face.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen added a block of charcoal to the brazier in the hall, causing countless sparks to rise up and then suddenly extinguish.</p><p></p><p>After doing this, he finally turned his gaze towards everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you all find it a bit strange?"</p><p></p><p>"That Miss Yuyan just now said she's the only daughter of the master of this mansion. But from what I saw, her hands looked like they've done a lot of rough work, quite calloused."  </p><p></p><p>"Her clothes were still decent, but you could see the creases from washing and folding, as if the wearer cherished this piece of clothing dearly."</p><p></p><p>"This doesn't seem like the manner of a young lady of the family."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen laid out his doubts one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Miss Yuyan is simply not pampered and is quite frugal? Or maybe Miss Yuyan likes practicing martial arts with spears and staves, which is why her hands are rough?"</p><p></p><p>"For a lady, having slightly rough hands can provide a better experience. I personally prefer it a bit rough - more stimulating," the small officer Niu Da suddenly said while wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.</p><p></p><p>Upon these words, the soldiers sitting on the floor of the main hall burst into laughter. Some of the bolder ones even started jeering.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, so that's why you always ask for the old madam at the Tian Xiang Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"The captain is right, an old and experienced woman is fiery. Rough is good!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the main hall was filled with a joyful atmosphere, sweeping away the previously gloomy and oppressive air.</p><p></p><p>Even Yi Chen couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen'an Magistracy truly had talents. This Niu Da was quite a character.</p><p></p><p>Only those who have led teams and had command experience would understand that sometimes, a person speaking without considering the occasion or appropriateness is precisely what the situation calls for.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Only those who are truly capable know that this kind of person is the real backbone. </p><p></p><p>With just a few words, the previously gloomy and oppressive atmosphere was revived. No matter whether others' methods are sophisticated or not, as long as they work, it's fine.</p><p></p><p>Pressure needs to be released. </p><p></p><p>In a team, if there is a role to release, then there must also be a role to rein things in.</p><p></p><p>If Xiao Qi Niu Da is the one who releases, then Lin Bai Hu is the one who reins things in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the atmosphere had become much more relaxed, he gently clapped his hands, signaling everyone to quiet down.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't make a fuss. Let's first listen to what the Dao master has to say."</p><p></p><p>After clearing his throat, Yi Chen finally continued to point out the suspicious points he had discovered one by one.</p><p></p><p>"First of all, there are many small animal carcasses outside of the Yang Family Fortress."</p><p></p><p>"These chickens, ducks, cats and mice either had their brains exploded or their eyeballs protruded with blood flowing from the seven orifices before dying."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of force eroded them?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did they die in this way?" </p><p></p><p>"Why didn't the larger livestock like pigs, cows and sheep inside the Yang Family Fortress show any signs of death or escape?"</p><p></p><p>"Today during the day, you all saw the abnormal state of the residents inside the Yang Family Fortress. Although no yin and evil aura was detected on them, I want to remind everyone of one point."</p><p></p><p>"Don't use your old mindset to speculate about the strange events at the Yang Family Fortress this time."</p><p></p><p>"The celestial phenomenon of the blood-colored meteor is unprecedented, this is a change."</p><p></p><p>"No abnormalities does not mean there is no problem. Talisman spells for driving away evil are not omnipotent, perhaps a special timing has just not arrived yet."</p><p></p><p>Time inched forward again, the night seemed to grow even gloomier.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen threw another chunk of charcoal into the brazier in the main hall, and said in a somber voice: "Everyone, tell me, what's the difference between humans and pigs, cows, sheep and horses?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, could it be that there are no living humans left in the entire Yang Family Fortress, and it will only bare its fangs at a certain moment?"</p><p></p><p>"So tonight, no one is allowed to move around alone. Those who want to sleep should just lay bedrolls right here in the main hall. If anything happens, don't blame this poor Dao master for not warning you."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say I didn't warn you in advance."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen smiled wryly after speaking, and no longer said anything more, beginning to close his eyes and cultivate his inner energy. He had said what needed to be said and what didn't need to be said. If they truly encountered an unavoidable danger, then everyone couldn't blame Master Yi Chengzi for stirring up trouble.</p><p></p><p>The night grew deeper.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, people were either tired or perhaps frightened by Yi Chen's speculation. At first there were still whispers, but later even the sound of quiet chatting disappeared, leaving only the crackling sounds of the charcoal splitting in the brazier.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly there was a rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the main hall was startled awake, opening their eyes wide.</p><p></p><p>Some with stronger startle reflexes even drew their daggers, while others placed their hands on water flasks nearby, the cork stoppers already removed, with a faint bloody smell wafting out - the scent of black dog blood.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, except for Xiao Qi, the braves from the Patrol Bureau generally did not cultivate inner energy. However, they were more vigilant than ordinary martial artists, with more specialized gear.</p><p></p><p>"Ma Da, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai Hu frowned and shouted at a tall brave who had made the noise.</p><p></p><p>"Sir Bai Hu, I...I urgently need to urinate...whenever I get nervous I feel like peeing..."</p><p>This tall brave was indeed one of those who had teased Xiao Qi Niu Da earlier.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Qi Niu Da's face instantly darkened as he said gruffly, "Sir, let me accompany him."</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai Hu pondered for a moment and nodded, instructing: "Don't go to the thatched huts, just go to the small garden around the corner to take care of it, and come back quickly."</p><p></p><p>Amidst Ma Da's embarrassed thanks, the two brothers Niu and Ma opened the door of the guest hall and disappeared outside.</p><p></p><p>Five minutes passed.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes passed. </p><p></p><p>The two still had not returned.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't be afraid. I have ways to discern who the real evil spirits are." </p><p></p><p>As Yichen spoke, he casually crushed the white-robed man's head with a kick, causing the onlookers' brows to jump again. </p><p></p><p>A deep purple inner energy leapt ceaselessly throughout his body. Under the moonlight, coupled with the cold indifferent expression on Yichen's face, he appeared extraordinarily chilling.</p><p></p><p>For Yichen to dare act so boldly, he naturally had something to rely on in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he still had his eyes tightly closed. From the 3D perspective reflected in his mind's eye, those in the group who had been invaded by the mysterious force were completely exposed.</p><p></p><p>Deathly pale faces, eyes with black rings the size of fists on top, like they had put on smoky makeup - would you dare tell me you're a normal person?</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, Yichen cautiously chose to slap the white-robed woman twice to see if she would show any malice in her first reaction.</p><p></p><p>If there was malice, it would mean she might still be savable, just invaded.</p><p></p><p>But the result was hollow emptiness.</p><p></p><p>Combining the two verifications, in this situation, even Bianque would want to slap her three times.</p><p></p><p>After Yichen saw through the mysterious evil spirit in Yangjiawei Village, it still wanted to play the gambit of sacrificing pawns to protect the bigger pieces, hoping to subsequently invade more people following the same pattern. He would just counter its ploy - first he would cut down its major generals.</p><p></p><p>This back-and-forth led to the current scene.</p><p></p><p>Like cutting melons and vegetables, Yichen unleashed a series of sword strikes, severing the heads of all those in the group who had been invaded.</p><p></p><p>After this small victory, there was not a hint of smugness on Yichen's face. He knew the bigger challenge still lay ahead.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know how that group of white-robed men and women had been possessed, and why the group he led had not been affected.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there is something on me that the evil spirit fears? Or does my pure positive inner energy make it difficult for its invasion method to take effect?"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Yichen pressed the Thunder-Quelling Jade tighter against his chest. If there was something on him that made the evil spirit fearful, it could only be the Thunder-Quelling Jade.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was ranked as the tenth most extraordinary object between Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the true circumstances, Yichen did not plan to continue tonight.</p><p></p><p>The corpses of the white-robed man and woman still lay twitching before him.</p><p></p><p>As fellow cultivators, to die in such an inexplicable manner - a feeling of kinship welled up in Yichen's heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how much money they had earned to dare wade into these muddied waters.</p><p></p><p>Was the cornfield not exciting enough?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the white-robed female corpse lying on the ground kept opening and closing her mouth, calling out in pain as she painstakingly crawled towards Yichen's direction.</p><p></p><p>"Good girl, the pain will be over soon."</p><p></p><p>Yichen's sword came out like a dragon, cleaving her head in two.</p><p></p><p>The effect was excellent and immediate.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the white-robed female corpse no longer cried out in pain.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his wide sleeve, Yichen stuck the long swords from the white-robed man and woman's hands into his waistband, preparing to lead everyone in withdrawal.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he flicked his finger, sending a few deep purple sparks falling onto the corpses on the ground, igniting a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, as the great fire rose, it seemed to sound a certain signal - the evil spirit behind them was clearly enraged.</p><p></p><p>The entire Yangjiawei Village began to 'come alive'.</p><p></p><p>First, the severed heads lying on the ground suddenly turned, their resentful gazes fixed on Yichen and the others in unison.</p><p></p><p>They abruptly tilted their heads back and let out a shrill howl. The fires on their bodies were instantly extinguished, and the dismembered corpses began crawling chaotically, searching and reassembling themselves.</p><p></p><p>Countless fleshy buds sprouted from the severed surfaces of their bodies, grabbing whatever they could, not caring if it was their own body or not.</p><p></p><p>Some placed others' severed heads onto their own bodies, some had their bodies reassembled backwards, some - regardless of gender - gouged holes in their bellybuttons and howled as they charged towards Yichen's group.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, one by one, the residents of Yangjiawei Village emerged from their homes, their eyes...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They all turned towards this direction at the same time. </p><p></p><p>Some were carrying hoes, some holding large chopping knives, striding quickly towards this way.</p><p></p><p>Faint reddish rays of light appeared on 'them'.</p><p></p><p>Then came the troop of pigs, cattle, horses and sheep with blood-red eyes.  </p><p></p><p>The view rose higher, looking down on the Yang Family Ravine Fortress from above.</p><p></p><p>Like ants, the crowd of people roared and converged towards the central manor where Yi Chen and others were located, as if a swarm of zombies had been unleashed.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the anomaly occurred, Yi Chen had sensed something was wrong. He shouted to retreat and then charged towards the wall.  </p><p></p><p>Who would bother with the main gate at a time like this?</p><p></p><p>You learned in junior high math that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. At this critical moment, he had to take a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>A tremendous crash.</p><p></p><p>The manor's wall was instantly smashed open by Yi Chen, leaving a human-shaped hole.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen'an Team was stunned at first, then shouted and followed the Taoist priest, rushing out of the hole in a disorderly manner. </p><p></p><p>The direction they charged was indicated by the deep purple flame tail.</p><p></p><p>On the ore-paved road of the ravine fortress, a girl in white was currently running frantically. One of her shoes had fallen off, revealing her fair lotus feet cut by the ore, drawing blood. But she paid no heed to it now.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yi Chen and the others, she couldn't help showing an expression of wild joy on her face and ran even harder, shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Master, save me!"  </p><p></p><p>"Righteous Brother, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Behind her were hundreds of villagers who had completely mutated, their bodies wrapped in black veins, their faces bearing patterns resembling strange seal scripts.</p><p></p><p>Faint red smoke rose from the villagers' bodies.</p><p></p><p>Several times, the mutated villagers' claws almost touched her neck.</p><p></p><p>"There's still someone alive~"</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yu Yan, don't panic, I'll help you!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai Hu drew his sword from his waist, intending to charge forward and assist her.</p><p></p><p>However, he was suddenly grabbed by the collar by a large fan-like hand.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen threw him back and stood in front of the group, shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Friend Lin, take the brothers and retreat quickly. I'll handle this!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Yi Chen took the lead and went to meet Yu Yan.</p><p></p><p>His deep purple pure yang inner energy surged violently, burning brilliantly and standing out vividly in the night.</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>After a 180-degree turn, a glimmer of clarity flashed in Lin Zhengyi's tiger-like eyes, then he turned and led the brothers away in the opposite direction.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen transformed into an arc of light, and with one large, swift and vicious kick, he struck Yu Yan squarely in the face.</p><p></p><p>The wild joy on Yu Yan's face vanished, her face deformed. Her body flew out, knocking over more than a dozen mutated villagers before finally slamming into a wall behind them, bouncing off and falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen did not kick awry - he did it intentionally, a calculated kick.</p><p></p><p>By now he had roughly guessed the means by which the evil force in the Yang Family Ravine Fortress was invading and mutating the people.</p><p></p><p>It was through the eyes.</p><p></p><p>The moment Yu Yan appeared, everyone in the Zhen'an Team was stirred, wanting to rush forward and rescue her.</p><p></p><p>This was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were collectively afflicted by a debilitating effect, instantly implanted with a psychological suggestion.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the disappeared male and female cultivators, as well as the missing cattle and horses, had all been invaded and mutated through this means.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he reacted immediately, standing in front of everyone and stopping Lin Bai Hu, snapping them out of it.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you hurt me so much~" </p><p></p><p>Yu Yan crawled up from the mud and stood up.</p><p></p><p>The mutated villagers behind her also stopped in unison and said the same:</p><p></p><p>"Master, you hurt me so much~"</p><p></p><p>Their voices were perfectly synchronized, as if from one person.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

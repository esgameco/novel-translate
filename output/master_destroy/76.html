        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Come on again."</p><p></p><p>With a furious roar, Yi Chen directly leapt into the air, slashing down at the bloody giant's head. </p><p></p><p>The bloody giant formed from Yang Yuyuan in front of him was powerful, but not powerful enough to make him feel despair - it was just right to measure his current strength.</p><p></p><p>The raging force once again blossomed in the air. With the intensity of the two clashing, those mutated villagers couldn't intervene at all, only being blown away by the shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged more than ten moves. </p><p></p><p>The huge noise made Lin Baihu, who was leading the remaining scouts to flee, couldn't help but turn his head from afar.</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist Master Yi Chengzi has blocked that blood monster for us brothers. Those who don't want to die, hurry up and run out of the Yang Family Fortress."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, charge with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Blade!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu forcefully channeled his inner energy, and a dark green blade aura over five meters long flashed from the sword talisman on his waist.</p><p></p><p>Shua la.</p><p></p><p>Like reaping wheat, dozens of mutated villagers blocking their way were all cut in half at the waist.</p><p></p><p>After using this move, Lin Baihu's face flushed with an eerie redness, clearly showing that this move was extremely taxing for him in his current state. He didn't waste any more words and took the lead, striding towards the direction outside the fortress.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were eleven or twelve scouts, all with looks of panic and worry on their faces, running madly, regretting that their parents didn't give them two more legs.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the scouts were cowardly, it's just that the 'monsters' in front of them were too bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Black dog's blood and lime were useless.</p><p></p><p>You cut off one of the mutated monster's arms, and it wouldn't even blink, directly stabbing you with its remaining arm.</p><p></p><p>You behead the monster in front of you, and it would simply pick up the fallen head and reattach it. Not long after, it would be a strong man wielding a blade fighting you again.</p><p></p><p>That the scouts hadn't scattered already could be considered well-trained.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Baihu's lead, the scouts crossed over the remains, charging towards the fortress wall.</p><p></p><p>That was the direction of life.</p><p></p><p>The last scout crossing the remains walked a bit slower and got slashed on the butt by the reanimated upper body of a corpse wielding a rusty machete.</p><p></p><p>The scout let out a miserable cry and ran even faster, instantly overtaking several comrades to the front of the group.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yi Chen didn't know about the situation Lin Baihu and the others were in. Even if he did, there was nothing he could do. Being able to block this bloody giant for them was already worth the payment Lin Baihu offered.</p><p></p><p>After an intense battle, Yi Chen was now disheveled with his hair undone, his body covered in large and small wounds, flesh bulging out. However, no blood flowed out, as he controlled his own muscles to tightly seal them. Give him a day, with his terrifying physical recovery, and he would be perfectly fine.</p><p></p><p>As for the bloody giant formed from Yang Yuyuan, it was in a much more wretched state.</p><p></p><p>The blood armor was tattered and the bewitching long sword covered in cracks, as if it would shatter with one more move.</p><p></p><p>And that was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>All thanks to the piercing effect of Yi Chen breaking through his realm.</p><p></p><p>If not for the explosive force carried in each of his qi strikes, he could not have achieved such results.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yuyuan, if you could devour some more blood essence and control some more experts, this pauper would absolutely turn around and leave. But now, it's over."</p><p></p><p>"This battle was invigorating and fulfilling. This pauper also gained some insights, so let this pauper send you off with the strongest move from these insights."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This move is called 'Yang Dian'."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yi Chen finished speaking, he raised his long sword horizontally and circulated all his strength. A purple line shot straight from his abdomen to the top of his head, forming a strange purple pattern on his forehead. </p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sword came out like a dragon, seeming to whip up a raging wind along the way. The iron ore slag on the road was blown to both sides, plowing a trench over ten centimeters deep. The extremely ferocious force and pure yang inner energy directly blasted the Blood Giant into a shower of blood raining down.</p><p></p><p>This move was Yi Chen's most powerful one after breaking through to the Force Shattering Realm, integrating all his strength and inner energy in an eruption.</p><p></p><p>In the shortest time, it outputted the maximum inner energy and strongest force. On the surface it seemed like only one move, but in fact it utilized the shockwave penetration effect carried by the force after breaking the Force Shattering Realm. It was a continuous series of moves fused into an instant, stacking and detonating all the force vibrations in the shortest time to create maximum damage.</p><p></p><p>Battle is the best teacher.</p><p></p><p>This move was extremely powerful, but also placed an extreme load on the body. The instant he executed it, Yi Chen sensed that with his current physique, he could only stack three tides of inner energy at most. Otherwise, he would lose control of the backlash on himself, and using it three times consecutively would still cause his flesh to be unable to withstand it, severing his heart meridians.</p><p></p><p>However, this was already enough.</p><p></p><p>With this move, his killing power increased at least threefold, equivalent to facing three experts of the same realm concentrating their full power on the same area. It could be used as a killer move.</p><p></p><p>This was a move that overloaded the limits of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>But how could overloading not have any losses or limits?</p><p></p><p>Even a computer CPU would instantly die if overclocked too much...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yi Chen was very satisfied with this move. As a wall-hanger, stacking three tides of inner energy was absolutely not his limit.</p><p></p><p>He decided that the next four-dimensional attribute he would break through would be the Body attribute.</p><p></p><p>As long as his physique was strong enough, this physical overload move would definitely become his signature finisher to defeat enemies.</p><p></p><p>Without a 'spiritual' attribute, no need to worry. With attributes in place, combined with the pure yang inner energy refined to the pinnacle through deduction and propagation, even celestial immortals would be shattered.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen sheathed his sword, when suddenly a strange blood-colored token in the rain of blood caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>He moved with lightning speed, and in an instant the blood-colored token fell into his hand. As soon as the token entered his hand, a cold and familiar aura gushed into his body, along with many fragmented scenes that flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>He saw the broken life of the girl called Yang Yuhuan.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this token also has deep red points?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's eyes suddenly widened, and just as he was about to take a closer look, the blood-colored token shuddered strangely and abruptly vanished into the air, as if it had never appeared.</p><p></p><p>All that was left for Yi Chen were 150 deep red points and Yang Yuhuan's shattered memories, proving that this mysterious blood-colored token had once appeared.</p><p></p><p>After looking around in all directions and digging three feet into the ground without finding the vanished blood-colored token, Yi Chen licked his dry lips and gave up searching for it.</p><p></p><p>He had a vague premonition that this blood-colored token was actually still hidden somewhere in the area of Yangjiaying Fort, he just could no longer see or find it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was underground, or in some other dimension.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Yi Chen was optimistic by nature, so he didn't bother thinking about things he couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Some things, if you gain them it's fortunate, if you lose them it's fate.</p><p></p><p>This time he had already profited greatly, comprehending the Yang Dian move and gaining 150 deep red points. It was like Qin Shihuang eating prickly ash and touching an electric wire - he had won as much as he possibly could.</p><p></p><p>As for the mystery of the blood-colored token and the anomaly of the world, as long as his strength continued increasing, he believed the world would naturally unveil its secrets before him.</p><p></p><p>Some things, if your strength hasn't reached the level, knowing them is useless, you still can't break out of the cage.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

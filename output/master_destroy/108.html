        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The fifth day.</p><p></p><p>The weather had not improved, still overcast and gloomy, making one feel uncomfortable just looking at it. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen led Mò Bǎihù and others wandering around the southern city, feeling that the city had become much more desolate. At the same time, a sense of unease began to grow in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Starting from yesterday, he felt that something was off, but he couldn't pinpoint what exactly was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The reports from his subordinates showed all the data was normal.</p><p></p><p>"Mò Bǎihù, what do you think? Why are there so few people on the streets? Have your men reported anything unusual?" Yi Chen suddenly stopped, frowning as he turned to Mò Yù behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? No." Mò Yù had been preoccupied thinking about adopting Xiao Xin and Xiao Wanzi, hesitating whether to bring them over today. Caught off guard by Yi Chen's question, he said in surprise, "The reports from the yamen show everything is normal. Thanks to the Dao master's blessing, the southern city is very peaceful now. Every single civilian death can be accounted for, and there are no special cases of unnatural deaths."</p><p></p><p>"As for the reduced foot traffic on the streets, it's probably a backlash from the reporting measures we implemented earlier. Many families with some wealth are probably unwilling to go out now."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see today's sales statistics for rice, flour, grains and oil, as well as the death toll statistics." Hearing what Mò Yù said, Yi Chen still had some doubts in his heart. But after carefully going through the stack of notes, he couldn't find anything amiss, so he had to let it go.</p><p></p><p>However, he still instructed that from then on, all intelligence and statistics must be reported every half day.</p><p></p><p>After making the arrangements, the vague sense of unease in Yi Chen's heart did not dissipate, but instead grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>A situation like this was actually the most troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Because you don't even know where the problem lies, how can you resolve it?</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe the people from the Yellow Springs Sect, Red House, and Yin Shan Manor would so easily back down and submit.</p><p></p><p>Once the bow is drawn, there's no turning back.</p><p></p><p>The three major forces had already banded together to offend the reigning dynasty.</p><p>How could they end things in such a half-hearted, snake-like manner?</p><p></p><p>Today was already the fifth day, with only two days left until reinforcements arrived.</p><p></p><p>Of this demonic bunch, only a minor evil spirit had shown itself, while all the more formidable figures remained hidden beneath the surface.</p><p></p><p>They had not suffered any substantial losses, yet currently there were no abnormalities detected.</p><p></p><p>This was the biggest abnormality of all.</p><p></p><p>For Yi Chen, this ominous calm was almost more terrifying than those demonic beings running amok, killing and setting fires everywhere.</p><p></p><p>It indicated that with a probability of eight or nine out of ten, there was some loophole he had failed to discover being exploited in secret, while he remained completely oblivious.</p><p></p><p>Time trickled away bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Before he knew it, the sixth evening had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Watching the sun set in the west and the moon rabbit rise in the east.</p><p></p><p>Yet there was still no trace of any loophole discovered.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out a long sigh. He turned to look at the many familiar faces who had followed him for the past few days, and said: "Everyone must not let down their guard. The next two days will be the real big test."</p><p></p><p>"Reinforcements are arriving soon, and this demonic bunch will absolutely not give up so easily. The darkness before dawn is the most terrifying and perilous."</p><p></p><p>"If you all trust this poor monk, you can bring your families to stay at the separate courtyard for these two days. I will be staying at the separate courtyard tonight and tomorrow night."</p><p></p><p>The separate courtyard was where Yi Chen had previously interrogated Li Xiucai and others. It had a rather large area, just a less than ideal environment.</p><p></p><p>Upon Yi Chen's words, the constables couldn't help but show delighted expressions, all thanking Yi Chen profusely.</p><p></p><p>Who among those present didn't know of Yi Chen's astonishing cultivation? If their families could stay under the Dao master's watchful eye, even sleeping on the floor would be acceptable to them.</p><p></p><p>Many were already swayed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The crowd bid farewell and left one after another.</p><p></p><p>Among those leaving was also Mò Yù. </p><p></p><p>He had decided to bring Xiao Xin and Xiao Wanzi over tonight.</p><p></p><p>As veteran street-pounders who had been in the trenches for many years, how could they not sense that something was amiss?</p><p></p><p>It's just that no one had voiced it out loud.</p><p></p><p>Watching the crowd leave, Yi Chen's expression remained calm as a ancient well. He stood there for a while before turning to enter the separate courtyard, his thoughts unknown.</p><p></p><p>The reason Yi Chen instructed the constables to bring their families was simply a reluctant choice.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, he still did not know how the Yellow Springs Sect and others would make their move. Since that was the case, he could only do his utmost to protect those who had followed him these past few days.</p><p></p><p>As many as he could look after, he would.</p><p></p><p>It was his reward to the constables for sticking by his side, working around the clock these past few days.</p><p></p><p>He simply didn't believe that those demonic fiends could secretly make a move right under his nose in his own territory.</p><p></p><p>Inside the main hall of the separate courtyard, lamps were burning bright.</p><p></p><p>Laid out on the long table before Yi Chen were all the intelligence reports the Zhen'an Magistracy had handed over to him recently.  </p><p></p><p>He spread out all the reports and data on the table surface, studying them word by word, line by line.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The bright moon hung high, illuminating the streets in a dazzling glow.</p><p></p><p>Mò Bǎihù strode briskly towards the direction of the orphanage.</p><p></p><p>He had really taken a liking to Xiao Xin and Xiao Wanzi. Originally he had planned to adopt the two after this incident was resolved.</p><p></p><p>However, Yi Chen mentioned today that families could stay at the separate courtyard for two days, which piqued his interest. After informing Yi Chen, he hurriedly rushed towards the orphanage.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, his eyelids had been twitching these past two days, giving him a sense that something bad was about to happen. The orphanage could not be as safe as staying under Dao master Yi Chen's watchful eye.</p><p></p><p>The moment he arrived at the orphanage gates, Mò Yù's pupils contracted to needle points.</p><p></p><p>Something was off.</p><p></p><p>Today...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The welfare home was exceptionally quiet in the evening, even Uncle Fu who was always stationed at the gatehouse had disappeared, replaced by two brawny bald men carrying broad swords. </p><p></p><p>One wore a huge golden earring, the other a silver one.</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there, what are you doing?" said the one with the golden earring coldly, resting his hand on the hilt of his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you recognize this outfit I'm wearing? Get lost," Moku replied sternly, his expression darkening in confrontation. </p><p></p><p>The situation before him made the sense of unease in his heart grow heavier.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies, sir, but under orders from the Chen family, no one is permitted to enter or leave the welfare home now."</p><p></p><p>"These are tumultuous times after all, the welfare home is weak, so the benevolent head of the Chen family has sent us to guard this place. You'd best return, sir."</p><p></p><p>"Surely the sir isn't thinking of forcing his way in? These are the Chen family's orders." Facing the clearly high-ranking Moku, the man with the golden earring didn't back down, his tone still cold, even subtly threatening harm in the hopes Moku would wisely retreat.</p><p></p><p>Half an incense stick's time later, Moku's face was ashen as he looked at over ten brawny men lying broken around him, shaking with rage.</p><p></p><p>As an orphan, he had no weaknesses to exploit. In a moment of urgency, he didn't bother with niceties about the Chen family, directly attacking and crippling the men before him.</p><p></p><p>Moku, a formidable warrior with mystical powers, may have faced muscular, hulking men over 200 pounds each, but they were just brawn, no match for his skills.</p><p></p><p>However, the interrogation results chilled him.</p><p></p><p>All the children from the welfare home had been taken away, including the old gatekeeper Uncle Fu.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had been secretly moved to the Chen family's grand mansion in the city center. </p><p></p><p>The men with the gold and silver earrings were ordered to guard here and drive away any intruders.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly aware of this, Moku was struck dumb, his mind blank.</p><p></p><p>He was no fool, in fact quite intelligent - his warrior rank was earned through his own efforts and killing his way up.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family's actions raised terrible premonitions within him.</p><p></p><p>Having long resided in Zhen'an County, he knew much of the Chen family's dirty secrets behind their saintly facade.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Moku's whole body stiffened.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!" he muttered, his eyes misting over.</p><p></p><p>"Warrior Moku, this is the Chen family, do not make a mistake," the man with the golden earring threatened, his arm twisted grotesquely but expression still stern.</p><p></p><p>"You are a warrior of Zhen'an County, with a bright future ahead. If you leave now, there is still a chance to turn this around."</p><p></p><p>Moku fell silent for a moment, then his pained, conflicted look became one of determination.</p><p></p><p>In a flash of blade, over a dozen heads rolled on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He took out two yellow papers from his sleeve, briefly recording information and speculation. Channeling his powers, the papers soon transformed into two agile paper cranes, flying under his mystical guidance towards two different directions within the city.</p><p></p><p>One direction was unmistakably towards the Separate Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After that, he headed expressionlessly towards the Chen family's mansion.</p><p></p><p>In the current Longjiang Prefecture, the only ones he could trust were the County Magistrate Qian Yueru and his current superior, Daoist Master Yi.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Chen family matter, he was apprehensive, uncertain of what choices the two would make.</p><p></p><p>So he intended to infiltrate the Chen residence to find more concrete evidence.</p><p></p><p>If the truth was as he suspected, then as long as he could uncover definitive proof and expose it to the world, no matter how powerful the Chen family, they would be condemned by the masses.</p><p></p><p>After all, some matters seem inconsequential until they are weighed, then their gravity cannot be denied.</p><p></p><p>This was the only way he, Moku, an ordinary warrior of Zhen'an County, could think of to face the formidable Chen family.</p><p></p><p>Only by finding evidence and uncovering the truth could more innocents be spared sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>Some things require someone to take action.</p><p></p><p>The same rice nourishes a hundred different people.</p><p></p><p>In this world, those with wolfish hearts and despicable conduct are not rare, nor are the servile and cringing.</p><p></p><p>But there are also many who hold the public interest at heart, who have principles, who carry firewood for the masses.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation may not be high, they may just be ordinary people...</p><p></p><p>But it is these people who are mending this tattered world.</p><p></p><p>The depths of the human heart are dark, but there will always be those who walk with a light.</p><p></p><p>Under the silent sky, a black speck trudged alone down the bluestone street, stepping into the unseen future.</p><p></p><p>At the Separate Courtyard, lamps burned bright.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen slammed the long table and suddenly stood up, eyes wide with fury!</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, the intelligence was fake!"</p><p></p><p>After carefully analyzing the data, he finally realized the grain and oil figures reported to him by the county office clearly followed some coefficient ratio dispersion.</p><p></p><p>The data was clearly manually entered.</p><p></p><p>The intelligence reported by the county office these past few days had been too normal, forming an eerie contrast with the actual atmosphere. Eliminating all impossibilities, there was only one possibility left - the data was falsified.</p><p></p><p>It was through this meticulous research that Yi Chen discovered the hidden secret.</p><p></p><p>He did not wish to ponder too deeply the reasons behind the falsified intelligence.</p><p></p><p>3197 words, intentionally cut off here to save you a coin haha</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

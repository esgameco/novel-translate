        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yu Yan is also a pitiful person."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen flipped through the memory fragments that entered his mind along with the deep red dot. In a short while, he pieced together the truth of the matter, more or less.</p><p></p><p>Yet another sad story. </p><p></p><p>Joys and sorrows in the human world cycle endlessly, nothing unusual about that.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are far more explosive events than this.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen casually broke off a branch, drew out his Dragon Slaying Sword, and quickly whittled it into a hairpin. After pinning up his hair and tidying his appearance, he began the cleanup work at the Yang Family Fortress. </p><p></p><p>Elegance never goes out of style.</p><p></p><p>Taoist priest, come collect the 'people'!</p><p></p><p>After the blood giant formed by Yang Yu Yan exploded, the remaining mutated villagers were no match for Yi Chen's martial prowess.</p><p></p><p>Whether with fists, feet or sword strikes, the mutated villagers were torn apart with one blow.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, in the horrific Yang Family Fortress, a tall Taoist priest dragged his sword, walking through the fortress, killing one after another.</p><p></p><p>If previously Yi Chen felt more sympathy for the villagers in the fortress, after reviewing Yang Yu Yan's memory fragments, that sympathy had transformed into indifference.</p><p></p><p>One can be lowly like dust, but cannot be twisted like a maggot.</p><p></p><p>For Yang Yu Yan's tragedy, the villagers could stand by while facing her powerful stepmother, but to curry favor with her, they kicked the already pitiful girl into the dust and trampled her underfoot - that was going too far.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen believed that among the dead villagers, there were certainly some who were wronged, dying in Yang Yu Yan's revenge.  </p><p></p><p>But given that everyone benefited from Yang Yu Yan's stepmother's actions, whether they deserved to die or not had become a philosophical question.</p><p></p><p>It was like the issue of the children of corrupt officials benefiting in the previous life - should they be held accountable?</p><p></p><p>Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen could not discern the reasoning behind it all. In any case, it was Yang Yu Yan's doing, what did it have to do with Taoist Priest Yi Cheng?</p><p></p><p>He only knew the monsters before him now were evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>If they were evil spirits, they should be killed.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's sword was swift.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Slaying Sword allowed Yi Chen to wield it like the Furious Slash of the Snow-Winged Sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Taoist Priest Yi, devoid of emotion, his sword strokes never hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Heh heh.</p><p></p><p>Many things in the human world cannot be explained clearly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has their own perspective, their own viewpoint.</p><p></p><p>Double standards are actually the norm in secular life.</p><p></p><p>For example:</p><p></p><p>Above me, all people are equal.  </p><p></p><p>Below me, do you even count as a person?</p><p></p><p>Entangled in the web of cause, effect and interests, many matters have become a tangled mess.</p><p></p><p>Right and wrong.</p><p></p><p>Crime and punishment.</p><p></p><p>Who has the final authority to interpret them?</p><p></p><p>To explain or not explain, not up for explanation, leave it for posterity to explain!</p><p></p><p>Taoist Priest Yi only deals with evil spirits, not act as a judge.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was like a diligent little bee, clearing out one patch after another of mutated villagers. He trod under the moonlight, trod over the remains, his Dragon Slaying Sword occasionally flashing sparks as it struck the mine slag or boulders on the road.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in a deep purple inner energy, he was the brightest existence under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Another sword strike burst apart a mutated villager. Yi Chen looked around and suddenly felt the entire Yang Family Fortress was much cleaner.</p><p></p><p>Under the bright moonlight, the vast white expanse was truly pristine.</p><p></p><p>"Taoist priest, come out quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"It's safe outside! Those monsters can't get out of the Yang Family Fortress." It was Lin Bai Hu and the group of rangers calling out.</p><p></p><p>Without realizing it, Yi Chen had furiously slashed his way down an entire street, arriving at a breach in a section of the fortress wall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai Hu and the rangers were standing outside the breach, waving.</p><p></p><p>This breach was likely blasted open by their spells when they escaped.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked at the people outside the breach and couldn't help but wave back, grinning to reveal a mouthful of white teeth.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, let me play with them a bit more."</p><p></p><p>Dragging the Dragon Slaying Sword, Yi Chen circled the Yang Family Fortress a couple more times.</p><p></p><p>He was not idle.</p><p></p><p>He was...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They were searching to see if there were any other blood-colored tokens hidden among the corpses of the remaining mutated villagers. </p><p></p><p>In just a brief moment, that blood-colored token had contributed 150 deep red points to him.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't search carefully, what kind of person would he be? </p><p></p><p>He definitely hadn't plucked it all clean!</p><p></p><p>Daoist Yi was a meticulous person, he had to search carefully, even if there was only one in ten thousand chance, he had to dig three feet into the ground to find it.</p><p></p><p>This was top-quality wool, plucking it was profiting.</p><p></p><p>However, contrary to his wishes, if he couldn't find it, he couldn't find it.</p><p></p><p>After plowing around Yang Family Stockade twice, Yi Chen could only reluctantly choose to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Through his efforts, the mutated villagers looked even more disgusting, with randomly assembled and connected limbs, full of a kind of Cthulhu-esque beauty.</p><p></p><p>Even with Yi Chen's broad heart, he felt these things looked somewhat unsettling.</p><p></p><p>For example, there was one who had combined their lower half with someone else's lower half at the severed surface, with two legs pointing up and two legs for walking. What a heavyweight that was.</p><p></p><p>It was simply a spiritual pollution.  </p><p>Physical damage reduced, mental damage maxed out.</p><p></p><p>After a fruitless search, Yi Chen decided to withdraw first. At this time, he had a premonition that Yang Yuyan, whom he had smashed, was not dead.</p><p></p><p>If the mutated villagers could reassemble themselves, how could Yang Yuyan, the host of the blood-colored token, not be reborn from the flesh and blood?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with just this level of power and immortality displayed, how could this blood-colored meteor make the entire cultivation world feel so threatened?</p><p></p><p>Was the blood-colored token a... way-marker?</p><p></p><p>Or was this blood-colored meteor just the first wave, with a second and third wave to come in the future?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yi Chen's thoughts ran wild, and he walked out of the Yang Family Stockade with the Dragon Slaying Sword on his back.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't figure it out, he wouldn't think about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>When Yi Chen's figure appeared outside the stockade, the guards outside immediately fell silent, for they had watched Daoist Yi Chengzi attack those mutated monsters with heavy blows at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Shattering bones and tearing flesh, destroying the rotten and decayed.</p><p>Brushing against them and they exploded, touching them and they shattered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone began to shout loudly, breaking the silence.</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist's divine might!"</p><p></p><p>This shout was like a signal, or like the first falling domino tile.</p><p></p><p>One voice, two voices, countless voices praising the Daoist's divine might merged into a wave.</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist's divine might!"</p><p>"The Daoist's divine might!"</p><p></p><p>Especially the seven or eight guards who had finally escaped alive from the Yang Family Stockade, they shouted the most fervently.</p><p></p><p>The crowd's shouts also made Yi Chen's heart soar with delight, but in order to maintain his bearing, his face remained as calm as a lake, showing no joy or anger.</p><p></p><p>He nodded slightly at the crowd with restraint. Yi Chen lifted the hem of his robe and sat down far away facing the Yang Family Stockade, with the Dragon Slaying Sword placed horizontally across his legs.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if this Yang Family Stockade would have any more mutations, if the monsters inside the stockade would rush out of its bounds.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the guards crowded around him in droves. With a thought, Yi Chen whispered a few words to one of the guards, who soon galloped away on a fast horse.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that a drastic mutation occurred.</p><p></p><p>The entire ground of the Yang Family Stockade began to rise with a hazy pink mist. As time passed, the mist became increasingly dense, but it did not spread outwards, as if constrained by some force. It remained hovering within the bounds and airspace of the Yang Family Stockade, not daring to cross the line by half a step.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, what should we do now?" </p><p></p><p>The speaker was Lin Baihu. At this time, his breath was unsteady, as if he had suffered some minor injuries in the previous fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......" You're asking me again?</p><p></p><p>"Clouds in the blue sky, water in the vase."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, let's not beat around the bush among our own people. Will this demonic thing run out later?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen sighed and stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, you know yet you still ask? Tell the brothers to step back a bit and keep an eye on the front. If the mist starts to spread, we'll immediately retreat backwards."</p><p></p><p>"It's better for you all to retreat further. I feel like even if you ride horses, you can't run faster than me."</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow I'll give a collective thanks to all the fellow daoists who contributed spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>See you all tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

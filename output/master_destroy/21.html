        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Time is like a wild donkey, once it starts running, it doesn't stop.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had already passed. </p><p></p><p>The days went by uneventfully.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng discovered that he had become fond of keeping a diary. If he didn't record something every day, he felt like something was missing, and he couldn't feel energized.</p><p></p><p>Again, it was nighttime, and Qingfeng once more opened his diary, writing fervently. Above where he was writing, there was already a string of entries.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, October 6th.</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother is indeed seriously ill. Today, he went to the Crashing Dragon Pond again early in the morning to blast fish. Second Martial Brother, Mingyue, and I are all very worried that he might drown from running out of breath underwater. Since our master has passed away, we don't want Elder Martial Brother to leave us too.</p><p></p><p>But we can't dissuade Elder Martial Brother.</p><p></p><p>Second Martial Brother instructed me to keep an eye on Elder Martial Brother from the side. If Elder Martial Brother doesn't surface within the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, then I should call him.</p><p></p><p>There were several times when Elder Martial Brother almost didn't make it back up, giving me quite a fright. Fortunately, in the end, Elder Martial Brother still managed to crawl up, lying on the ground like a heat-stroked dog, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother must be ill, and not lightly so.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, we had an all-fish banquet again tonight.</p><p></p><p>The fatty fish was really delicious.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, October 7th. </p><p></p><p>Nothing happened today, just watched Elder Martial Brother blast fish for fun. For some reason, I felt a bit addicted.</p><p></p><p>——  </p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, October 8th.</p><p></p><p>Nothing happened today, watched Elder Martial Brother blast fish for fun. It's strange, I don't know if it's my illusion, but Elder Martial Brother seems to have become a bit more robust.</p><p></p><p>He looks very tired. I don't know why Elder Martial Brother insists on doing this.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Elder Martial Brother didn't have any accidents today. It was another happy day.</p><p></p><p>Had an all-fish banquet again tonight.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, October 9th.</p><p></p><p>Watched Elder Martial Brother blast fish.</p><p></p><p>....</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, October 15th. </p><p></p><p>Qingfeng, you must work hard on cultivation! How can you degenerate like this? Tomorrow, tomorrow I must definitely work hard on cultivation and let Mingyue go watch Elder Martial Brother.</p><p></p><p>Also, we had an all-fish banquet again tonight, and I don't really want to eat it anymore.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, October 16th.</p><p></p><p>Watched Elder Martial Brother blast fish. </p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother's fish blasting skills have improved now. He jumps in horizontally to blast fish, and the splashing waves are really high.</p><p></p><p>I don't know why, but Elder Martial Brother's aura is getting stronger and stronger. Could it be that Elder Martial Brother is really cultivating? It's unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Had an all-fish banquet again tonight, didn't want to eat.</p><p></p><p>....</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, November 4th.</p><p></p><p>Watched Elder Martial Brother blast fish.</p><p></p><p>Elder Martial Brother's strength has increased again, and his fish blasting moves have become even more fancy and showy. Before, he would be as exhausted as a dead dog after just a few blasts, but now it seems to have no effect on him at all.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>It seems Elder Martial Brother wasn't lying to me, he really is cultivating. What an outrageous method.</p><p></p><p>Had fish again tonight, another day of not wanting to eat fish.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The 8th year of the Qingli era, November 5th. </p><p></p><p>Another day of watching Elder Martial Brother blast fish.</p><p></p><p>However, Elder Martial Brother seemed a bit unhappy today. I asked him, and he said he doesn't want to blast fish anymore.</p><p></p><p>Actually, I don't want to recite scriptures either. </p><p></p><p>I also want to blast fish.</p><p></p><p>But Elder Martial Brother said I can't control it and would die.</p><p></p><p>It's strange, I don't understand how Elder Martial Brother can control it when I can't. But Elder Martial Brother sounded very serious when he said it, so he probably wasn't lying to me.</p><p></p><p>Had fish again tonight, and I vomited.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>After finishing writing today's diary entry, Qingfeng hid the small book under his pillow, wrapped himself up in a small quilt like a silkworm cocoon, and squirmed around a few times to find a comfortable position before falling into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>He had a dream where he became a powerful man like his Elder Martial Brother, and he was also blasting fish.</p><p></p><p>The splashing water sent many plump fish flying every which way in disarray. Countless plump fish swirled around him, shouting "Quick, come eat me! Quick, come eat me!"</p><p></p><p>He looked closely and saw that those plump fish swirling around him had all turned into plates of steamed fish, boiled fish, pan-fried fish, deep-fried fish, stir-fried fish, pickled fish, salted fish, braised fish, and stewed fish.</p><p></p><p>He was terrified.</p><p></p><p>....  </p><p></p><p>....</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the Hidden Dragon Monastery, Yi Chen sat in the middle of the courtyard wearing a tight black short robe, drinking yellow wine. His powerful chest muscles protruded the front of his robe.</p><p></p><p>After a month of frenzied bitter cultivation, the skin-tight robe that used to fit him perfectly now felt a bit too tight.</p><p></p><p>After this month of crazy training, Yi Chen's status panel had also changed:</p><p></p><p>【Name: Yi Chen】</p><p>【Lifespan: 18/97】 </p><p>【Strength: 27.0, Stamina: 26.0, Spirit: 31.0, Agility: 24.0】(Normal human values are 1)</p><p>【Martial Art: Small Pure Yang Skill Level 6 (Traits: Robust Body, Blazing, Divine Force, Exorcism, Tenacity). Active Skill: Extreme Yang (Strength triples for 10 minutes, then inner energy and strength temporarily drop to 70% of original)】</p><p>【Martial Art: Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique Level 3 (Traits: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, Yin Energy Perception)】  </p><p>【Passive Skills: Painting Technique Lv1, Red Event Hosting Lv2, White Event Hosting Lv3, Culinary Lv3】</p><p>【Origin Points: 7】 (Can be obtained through physical training to improve Strength, Stamina, Spirit, Agility)</p><p>【Deep Red Value: 11】 (Can be obtained through special items or killing evil spirits, used to improve martial art levels)</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>(Performance)</p><p></p><p>After a month of inhumane training where he didn't treat himself as a human, the results of his cultivation were remarkable. </p><p></p><p>Yidchen had gained a total of 9 source points, two of which he had allocated to physical strength at the very beginning. He had to allocate them early, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to persevere.</p><p></p><p>This was achieved on the premise that after breaking through to the sixth layer of the Small Pure Yang Skill, he gained the tenacious characteristic.</p><p></p><p>After this point allocation, Yidchen also tested out the effect of the physical attribute, which was recovery power, a superhuman recovery power.</p><p></p><p>That feeling of being bathed in warmth, Yidchen still had a fresh memory of it. </p><p></p><p>It was really too comfortable.</p><p>More comfortable than rewarding himself.</p><p></p><p>While raising the physical attribute and strengthening the body, the source points would produce a warm flow, repairing bodily damage, simply qualifying as a healing holy medicine. This made Yidchen extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>This characteristic undoubtedly gave him another great advantage in fighting others, which was enduring injuries.</p><p></p><p>In a head-on physical battle, if he allocated a couple points here, this characteristic was simply like giving himself an extra health pack. Wouldn't that make him soar? Not to mention he also had the tenacious body skill, it was simply perfect.</p><p></p><p>"Using source points to raise my physical strength has given me such a big surprise. It's time to see what breakthroughs strength and agility can bring me." Yidchen raised the wine glass in his hand and drained it. With a thought, he added one source point to strength.</p><p></p><p>A scorching breath suddenly arose from his limbs and body. Under the tempering of this scorching breath, Yidchen's originally steel wire-like sturdy muscle fibers began to evolve towards an even stronger direction.</p><p></p><p>If his previous muscle fibers were like steel wires, then after raising them with source points, they developed towards a high-tenacity, high-strength alloy.</p><p></p><p>This further elevated his already unparalleled explosive power.</p><p></p><p>"The strength attribute, not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Yidchen was quite satisfied with raising his strength attribute. The experiment of beating the Iron Armor Corpse in Qingyuan Town proved that with the combination of strength and the Pure Yang Skill, the effect could be greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p></p><p>Against evil spirits without yin energy protection, under his immense force, they were nothing but a pile of dirt and broken tiles. Even with yin protection weakening the effect, his immense force still had a certain impact on them.</p><p></p><p>"More importantly," Yidchen's eyes flashed a cold light, revealing an icy gaze. A thought flashed through his mind, "This immense force may not be so effective against evil spirits, but it's really useful against people."</p><p></p><p>Yidchen naturally wouldn't forget the mastermind behind instigating the Evil Tiger Gang to cause trouble at the Taoist temple before.</p><p></p><p>For the person behind the scenes, Yidchen actually had a slight guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Everything is driven by profit. As long as you figure out who benefits the most from the decline of the Hidden Dragon Temple, you can basically narrow down the scope.</p><p></p><p>Under his master's leadership, the Hidden Dragon Temple had gained great fame. But his master was a kind person who pitied the poverty of the common people, often exorcising evil spirits and removing demonic omens for free or at extremely low prices.</p><p></p><p>How could other peers make a living with such a cash cow around?</p><p>Naturally, many people were offended.</p><p>Cutting off someone's financial resources is like killing their parents.</p><p>You can be content with poverty, but your peers cannot stand it.</p><p></p><p>While enjoying a reputation that filled the heavens, he was also inevitably defamed across the land.</p><p>Moreover, Baiyunzi was merciless towards evil, disciplining those of poor conduct without reservations, causing them to lose a lot of face.</p><p></p><p>Before, others couldn't beat Baiyunzi, so they had to swallow their anger. Now that Baiyunzi has passed away, those bastards naturally couldn't resist trying to regain their turf.</p><p></p><p>Yidchen even maliciously guessed that those black-hearted scoundrels had been so quiet recently because they were afraid his master was just feigning death to deceive them. They were waiting for them to expose themselves before jumping out from some ghost place to take them on the road together.</p><p></p><p>You say he's dead, but who believes it? They had to observe and probe first.</p><p></p><p>Conspirators never go all-in from the start. After probing a few times, those offended by his master would slowly reveal themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, my master just didn't understand the principle that not uprooting the grass means it will regrow when the spring breeze blows. If you offend someone, either don't do it, or do it decisively. That's why we ended up in this situation."</p><p></p><p>Yidchen picked up the wine jar and drained the remaining yellow wine, reining in his wandering thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He was not his master Baiyunzi, that kind person. Whoever dared to extend their claws towards him had better be prepared to have their heads chopped off by him.</p><p></p><p>Did they really think Abbot Yidchen was a kind person?</p><p>If you're not ruthless, you can't stand firm.</p><p>Being ruthless to others doesn't make you a ruthless person. Being ruthless to yourself is what makes you a truly ruthless person. Normal people could never push themselves as crazily as Yidchen. It was this ruthlessness that allowed him to miraculously persevere whenever he felt he couldn't hold on anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Agility, enhance me."</p><p></p><p>Yidchen threw the empty wine jar into a corner of the courtyard. With a thought, he added another source point to agility.</p><p></p><p>A cool breath suddenly appeared, traveling through his legs and gradually spreading throughout his body. A new round of strengthening began.</p><p></p><p>A few seconds later, Yidchen abruptly stood up from the red wooden chair. His figure flashed and he stood by the courtyard wall.</p><p></p><p>Yidchen smiled, smiling extremely happily, his white teeth reflecting the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his left hand towards the moon, as if trying to grasp the moonlight in his palm, or as if trying to seize his own destiny.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen's anger was about to erupt, causing the hem of his Taoist robe to flutter wildly, a young attendant came running in holding a yellow paper crane.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Your Eminence, there is an urgent message crane from Mò Bǎihù, please read it yourself."  </p><p></p><p>A minute later, Yi Chen's expression returned to calm, but he was as cold and indifferent as ancient glacial ice.</p><p></p><p>He summoned another young attendant and instructed him to notify Qian Yue Ru to go to the Chen Family Manor to find him. Then, his entire body transformed into a slender pale blue line, shooting straight through the roof, flying swiftly towards the Chen Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had always been one to assume the worst intentions of others, but he never expected anyone could be so vile and cruel to this degree.  </p><p></p><p>Corroborating the intelligence from Mò Bǎihù's message crane, he had now pieced together about 60-70% of the truth.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than an inside spiritual force colluding with demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>Humans fear ghosts for their terror, but ghosts understand the evil in human hearts!</p><p></p><p>Only the Chen Family had the power and influence to affect the entire Longjiang Prefecture to this extent.</p><p></p><p>The Huangquan Sect, the Red Chamber, and the Yin Mountain Manor must have made unspeakable deals with the Chen Family.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen felt he had set his standards too high, which allowed the Chen Family to make a fool of him this time.</p><p></p><p>Night fell on the Chen Family Manor. In front of the 5-meter-tall vermilion gates, a towering Taoist figure, larger than a bear, descended slowly. He gazed quietly at the soft glow from the red lanterns in front of the manor, then clenched his huge fist, casting a massive shadowy fist over the gates.</p><p></p><p>"Some people don't value others' lives at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Some think they can control everything, have it all calculated!"  </p><p></p><p>"Some look down from on high, refusing to give this poor Taoist any face!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The 5-meter vermilion gates suddenly exploded outwards like a cannonball firing backwards.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, it's all an illusion!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Father, if we do this, won't the Patrol Office find out?"</p><p></p><p>"And that new Taoist who just arrived, he doesn't seem like a good seed either."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Chen Family Manor, Chen Bouyun's son Chen Daqiwas frowning worriedly as he asked his elderly father.</p><p></p><p>He felt his father had gone completely mad by agreeing to deal with those demonic heretic forces.</p><p></p><p>Chen Bouyun glanced at the streak of graying black hair by his ear, wiped the tea leaves off the cup lid, and said displeased, "Daqi, you need to stay calm for major events, otherwise how can I entrust the Chen Family to you in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"They're just commoners after all, their lives as insignificant as weeds - cut one batch and another will grow next year. We'll just collect less tax."</p><p></p><p>"Back in my day, I was known as the 'Master of Calculations'. Do you think I wouldn't have a backup plan?"</p><p></p><p>"The sacrifices chosen this time are either unregistered tenant farmers, servants, or helpless disadvantaged people our family has hidden over the years. Disposable people whose deaths won't be avenged."</p><p></p><p>"We haven't harmed anyone we shouldn't. The Chen Family has operated in Longjiang Prefecture for many years, with students and officials everywhere. Even if someone notices, they won't dare intervene against us."</p><p></p><p>"In Longjiang Prefecture now, the only one the Chen Family is wary of is that girl Qian Yue Ru, the True Lord's daughter with a prestigious identity."  </p><p></p><p>"But even Qian Yue Ru cannot make a move here without my support. If I want, I can cripple her senses in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"As for that newly arrived brat, a drifter from some tiny town, heh.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't understand what real power is!</p><p></p><p>Just an imbecile.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in Longjiang Prefecture, from top to bottom, is my person.  </p><p></p><p>Two days, and what has he discovered?</p><p></p><p>If he could find any clues, I'll drink from the chamber pot!</p><p></p><p>"Chen, you old dog, come out and face me!" A thunderous roar echoed endlessly over the Chen Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>The smug look on Chen Bouyun's face instantly froze, turning ghastly pale.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's body was shrouded in a pale blue aura, not bothering to conceal his murderous intent as he strode towards the heart of the manor grounds.  </p><p></p><p>Any cultivated retainers who appeared to question or attack him were instantly slapped away by Yi Chen, their lives or deaths unclear.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Taoist, for what reason do you barge into the Chen Family Manor in the night? Without a proper explanation, you'll have to answer to the Chen Family," Chen Bouyun said with a grim expression, deciding there would be no more chamber pots allowed in the Chen Family from this day forth.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over my subordinate Mò Bǎihù, or every last one of you will die," Yi Chen coldly refused to play word games with the snake.</p><p></p><p>There were few good people left in this world. He could not allow one who carried firewood for the masses to drown in the snow. Yi Chen still harbored a glimmer of hope to rescue Mò Bǎihù.</p><p></p><p>"What Mò Bǎihù nonsense?" Chen Bouyun's expression flickered with genuine surprise, not seeming like an act to Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>But then, an ominous change suddenly occurred.  </p><p></p><p>A light laughter echoed out.</p><p></p><p>Four massive black iron pillars abruptly emerged from the ground at the center of the Chen Family Manor, spanning a diameter of 1000 meters.</p><p></p><p>Each pillar was etched with bizarre inscribed patterns. Written on the pillars in ancient blood-red script were the four words: "Ghostly Qi Defying Heaven".</p><p></p><p>As the iron pillars rose, a powerful surge of yin energy rapidly expanded outwards, repelling everything around it.  </p><p></p><p>A semi-transparent gray energy dome then appeared, enclosing the entire central grounds of the Chen Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>The Umbrella Maiden walked over from where the pillars emerged, lightly laughing as she said, "Manor Lord Chen, I did catch a glimpse of this 'Mò Bǎihù' the Taoist mentioned earlier. Please take a look."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, a black ghostly mirror formed in mid-air.  </p><p></p><p>It showed an eerie blood pool bubbling beneath the grounds in front of the Chen Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>One by one, the vacant-eyed civilians lined up and walked towards the execution grounds.</p><p></p><p>A huge, ox-headed demon seemed to have noticed the Umbrella Woman's spell. It grinned, then with one swing of its large demonic blade, it slashed open the throat of an old servant in front of it. Blood instantly spurted out, gushing down into the blood pool below. </p><p></p><p>After slitting the throat, the ox-headed demon fiercely pulled down an iron hook hanging on the rock wall and hung the old servant upside down by his ankles, like hanging a pig or dog. The blood continued to drip down from his throat, as if hanging upside down could drain the blood more cleanly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, above the blood pool, there were already countless corpses hanging upside down like hung sausages, presenting an extremely horrifying scene.</p><p></p><p>Yichen keenly noticed that Moyu was in the middle to back of the line heading to the execution grounds. </p><p></p><p>The ghostly mirror spell in mid-air suddenly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Umbrella Woman clapped her hands lightly, and four tall 'figures' surrounded her from all sides.</p><p></p><p>One figure was shrouded in demonic energy, taking the form of a fierce ghost face.  </p><p>Another was shrouded in demonic energy, taking the form of a rakshasa ghost face.</p><p>Another was permeated with corpse energy, extremely tall and muscular, with unknown silver claws on its hands. Its whole body was knotted with muscles, and two long blood-red fangs protruded from its mouth.</p><p>The last figure was emaciated, walking unsteadily like a consumptive ghost, coughing with each step. Yet this figure exuded the most terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>A mountain-like, sea-like malice howled towards Yichen.</p><p></p><p>The Umbrella Woman's malice was the most intense, as if Yichen had killed her entire family.</p><p></p><p>"Truly an ill-fated day, madam has only handed me the battle flag for two days, and you, ox-nose, have come charging in yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Ox-nose, you are already surrounded by the five of us, await your death!"</p><p></p><p>"Under the confinement of the Demonic Qi Nether Heaven Formation and its ability to repel all non-demonic energy, you may not even have the ability to commit suicide. Why don't you try it and see if your pure yang arts have lost their power?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the formation successfully trapping Yichen, the Umbrella Woman was overjoyed and spoke resentfully.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for this ox-nose acting without martial ethics and disrupting her arrangements, how could things have developed to this point?</p><p></p><p>This was originally supposed to be a great opportunity for her to make an appearance and showcase her skills in the three religions. Not only did she fail to make a proper appearance, she even lost the madam's mount. It was as if she had exposed her own ass instead of making an appearance, which made her resent Yichen even more.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Qi Nether Heaven Formation was a treasure in Madam Butterfly's possession.</p><p></p><p>It had the ability to confine and seal off a space, repelling all non-demonic energy within that space. Additionally, it could absorb all energy fluctuations within the barrier, preventing them from spreading outward.</p><p></p><p>In short, this was a comprehensive formation that could trap enemies, provide buffs, debuffs, and conceal energy signatures.</p><p></p><p>Four thick iron pillars were deeply embedded into the ground, continuously absorbing and drawing geomantic energy as a supplement. The pillars also flickered with a faint glow, which came from the elemental stones embedded in the pillars, providing the formation's core with power.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the killing ground was set.</p><p></p><p>Five top-tier energy cultivators surrounded Yichen to attack, even dragging along a bewildered old Chen patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a dire situation, not only did Yichen show no panic, he even revealed a ferocious grin.</p><p></p><p>Oh heavens, repelling the arts of the profound path, this formation is truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this pauper is somewhat skilled in fists and kicks.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's pure yang foundation, which penetrated the heavens and earth, was entirely based on his robust physical cultivation. How laughable, the prerequisite for repelling the profound arts is that he must actually know them.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, he had taken an extremely lofty pure yang martial art and extended it to an unprecedented level, achieving a power akin to magic.</p><p></p><p>Through his own efforts and a trivial bit of help from the Crimson One, on this path of attributing all might to himself, he had gone further than anyone else in this realm.</p><p></p><p>"You worthless beings are surrounding this pauper, intending to weigh my worth?"</p><p></p><p>"How laughable."</p><p></p><p>"Come, come strike me dead!"</p><p></p><p>"I only wish to kill you all, or be killed by you all. You need not be courteous."</p><p></p><p>Yichen felt that the opportunity to break through to the ninth level of the Pure Yang True Skill had arrived.</p><p></p><p>He had striven to this point and accumulated 656 crimson points, while advancing to the ninth level of the Pure Yang True Skill required 1600 crimson points.</p><p></p><p>He had thought it would take much longer to accumulate enough, but now such a fortuitous event had presented itself.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's eyes shone with a ferocious light as he looked at the demonic cultivators slowly approaching him, as if regarding pigs and dogs.</p><p></p><p>These were not enemies, these were the foundation for his path to immortality.</p><p></p><p>Thank you, bountiful nature!</p><p></p><p>This pauper has led a life of accumulating virtue and upholding benevolence. These are my just rewards.</p><p></p><p>Yichen bared his teeth and let out a manic laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Come, strike me dead!"</p><p></p><p>"True Yang Tyrannical Force!"</p><p></p><p>"Soul Combustion, ten years!"</p><p></p><p>With a cry in his heart, he added the three origin points he had accumulated over the eight days of travel since killing the Tree Granny, on top of his physical attributes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yichen's robe could not withstand this change and exploded into shreds fluttering down. His muscular back vaguely revealed the character 'de'.</p><p></p><p>An extremely ferocious aura surged forth from him. Sensing this aura, the Umbrella Woman and the others immediately turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this aura..."</p><p></p><p>"Ox-nose, you're actually a True Man realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>That's where I'll stop for today. Tomorrow I'll thank those who voted. Good night everyone.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

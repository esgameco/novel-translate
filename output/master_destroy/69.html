        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yi Chen]</p><p></p><p>[Lifespan: 18/107 (-10)]</p><p></p><p>[Strength: 50, {Strength Realm Breakthrough Once: Penetrate Lv1 (Strength adds shockwave penetration effect) Strength Aura Lv1 (Strength attribute effect amplified by 20%)}  </p><p>Stamina: 40</p><p>Spirit: 41</p><p>Agility: 36]</p><p></p><p>[Martial Art: Pure Yang True Technique Seventh Layer (Traits: Robust Body, Blazing, Divine Strength, Exorcism, Tenacity, Rejuvenation, Ignition.) Active Skill: Yang Polarity Shift (Physical strength explosively triples, inner qi becomes more active, lasts ten minutes, after which inner qi and strength temporarily drop to 70% of original.) Active Skill: Soul Ignition (The most blazing is burning, ignite one's own potential, burn lifespan in exchange for power, currently ignite one year of lifespan to increase strength and inner qi by 50%, up to 5 times boost in strength.)]</p><p></p><p>[Martial Art: Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique Fourth Layer (Traits: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, Yin Qi Perception, Mind's Eye Projection Lv1, Malicious Intent Perception Lv1.)]</p><p></p><p>[Passive Skills: Painting Lv1, Hosting Red Events Lv2, Hosting White Events Lv3, Cooking Lv3]</p><p></p><p>[Origin Points: 0] (Can be obtained through training to stimulate the physical body, used to improve the four stats of strength, stamina, spirit and agility.)</p><p></p><p>[Deep Red Value: 161.] (Can be obtained through special items or killing demonic creatures, used to advance martial art levels or deduce techniques.)</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen clenched his fists tightly, explosive power surging through his body.  </p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had a feeling that if he faced the Five Fiends Demon again, he would not need to use the Yang Polarity Shift to directly crush it head-on.</p><p></p><p>After the Strength Realm Breakthrough, he gained two special effects - one was penetration.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen tested it out and found that unlike the internal force achieved through martial skill, the penetration effect from the Strength Realm Breakthrough was more like an innate rule, a realm beyond what skills could achieve.</p><p></p><p>To make an imperfect analogy, this penetration effect was essentially shockwaves and...explosions.  </p><p></p><p>With strength solidified into one, if analyzed with technology from his previous life, it would be waves with extremely high vibration frequencies that could transmit force through obstacles by the high-frequency vibrations, and explode violently upon reaching the peak.</p><p></p><p>It was like the difference between a gun with and without rifling in the barrel.  </p><p></p><p>The gun was the same, but with rifling added, the penetration power of the bullets increased dramatically. The penetration effect after the Strength Realm Breakthrough was like adding that rifling.</p><p></p><p>"It's practically a corpse-shattering divine technique."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the table leg of the long redwood table in front of him reduced to powder, Yi Chen's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>He had just controlled his strength to the level that had previously broken the table leg and struck the long table, but the table instantly exploded into dust, which might even affect the floor below.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying shockwave penetration effect, greatly enhancing the destructive power of each unit of his strength.</p><p></p><p>The other effect after his first Strength Realm Breakthrough was easier to understand - Strength Aura.  </p><p></p><p>It additionally increased his strength attribute by 20%. With his current base strength of 50, he could exert the effect of 60, a free bonus of 10 points. The higher the base, the more he would gain...</p><p></p><p>"What a pleasant surprise."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen couldn't help but grin widely.  </p><p></p><p>Just one Strength Realm Breakthrough had such an incredible effect. When his base strength reached 100 for the next breakthrough, wouldn't it be even more amazing?</p><p></p><p>What about the third, fourth, or fifth breakthroughs?  </p><p></p><p>Wouldn't he be able to kill with a single punch and explode anything he touched?</p><p></p><p>Combined with the ferocious and violent pure yang inner qi, it would be perfect.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was indulging in imagining the future, there was a sudden urgent knocking at the door, accompanied by cursing.</p><p></p><p>"Hey upstairs, not sleeping in the middle of the night, do you think I'm the Jade Prince to just eat..."</p><p></p><p>The door creaked open.</p><p></p><p>There were lanterns providing light in the hallway.  </p><p></p><p>A huge shadow loomed over the person outside the door.</p><p></p><p>It was a young master dressed in brocade robes, with two large, muscular guards behind him, their temples bulging prominently, looking quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Yi Chen opened the door and asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>"You bastard, disturbing my young master's..." One of the guards behind the young master cursed angrily, but before he could finish, the young master kicked him flying with a vicious kick.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, it's fine now."</p><p></p><p>"These few guards of mine drank too much horse piss and are acting crazy drunk. Please don't take them seriously."</p><p></p><p>"We'll leave right away, right away."</p><p></p><p>The so-called Jade Prince young master now had a big smile on his face, nodding and bowing obsequiously.  </p><p></p><p>At his neck, a small fiery red squirrel was trembling in the folds of his robe.</p><p></p><p>However, a cold indifferent voice came, causing the Jade Prince to freeze in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Did I tell you to leave?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Prince felt like crying now. He had been exploring the mysteries of the human body with a girl downstairs.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As he was about to make his move, suddenly a huge muffled sound came from the top of the building, startling him and causing him to lose his ability in an instant. </p><p></p><p>So he angrily rushed up to demand an explanation, not expecting to encounter such a ferocious person when the door opened.</p><p></p><p>He had thought his bodyguards Ada and Adi were already strong and powerful enough, having mastered a high level of martial arts. But he didn't expect there would be someone even braver and mightier than them, not knowing where this sacred expert came from.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the ferocious person who opened the door, his bodyguards were like bean sprouts. Even the flame rat he had raised for a long time was trembling in fear. What a ferocious person this was!</p><p></p><p>According to the message from the flame rat of his family, this person had at least 180 lives on him, and there was still lingering ominous aura on his body. Most likely he was an accomplished martial artist, and had even recently killed a powerful evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Great...great sir, is...is there anything else?" The Jade Young Master forced out a smile with great difficulty, looking even uglier than crying.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I accidentally disturbed your rest. You can leave now," Yichen said coldly.  </p><p></p><p>Since this person knew what was appropriate, he didn't want to make a scene either, as each matter had its own circumstances.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he had also deduced the truth from the half-revealed words of this person and his bodyguards. Most likely, it was his experiment with the penetrating effect of force-breaking the realm that had caused the shaking downstairs, and this person had come to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Ah...ah?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to apologize, no need to apologize."</p><p></p><p>"Great sir is not at fault, it's all my mistake."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Jade Young Master performed an act transitioning from looking devastated to greatly relieved, dragging his bodyguards to run around the corner like the wind. Then the sounds of slapping came.</p><p></p><p>"Ada, you damn dog, you almost got me killed this time. I hadn't even spoken yet, and you were barking?"</p><p></p><p>"We were lucky this time."</p><p></p><p>The bodyguard called Ada said aggrievedly while covering his face, "Young Master, I was just sticking up for you. Even if that big man is a cultivator, does the Li family of Qingping County fear him?"</p><p></p><p>"The family head is also a high-level cultivator who has refined his spirit...Your elder brother is even more talented in cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Slap! Slap!</p><p></p><p>Two more slaps landed on Ada's face.</p><p></p><p>"You dare talk back?"</p><p></p><p>"You damn dog, so I have to make an enemy out of such an expert over some tiny matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Make a tiny matter spiral out of control, dragging the whole family into it? It took the family hundreds of years to accumulate our current strength. Today we provoke this one, tomorrow that one. Are you an undercover agent sent by our family's enemies?"</p><p></p><p>The more the Jade Young Master thought about it, the angrier he became, slapping Ada's face a few more times.</p><p></p><p>Damn dogbrain, even if my father is a high-level spirit refiner, he can't solve immediate problems from afar. Yet you actually wanted this Young Master to pick a fight?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for your years of loyal service, I would cut down this idiot with one knife strike.</p><p></p><p>It has nothing to do with our core interests, yet you always want to provoke others. You're simply a fool!</p><p></p><p>A fool that should be buried in an ancient tomb!</p><p></p><p>The commotion in the hallway naturally didn't escape Yichen's keen senses. After listening for a while from around the corner, he couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>"At least he's sensible."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, fairy tales are all lies. When have idiotic scions ever come knocking to pick fights and get slapped in the face?"</p><p></p><p>"Only third-rate novels would write such nonsense."</p><p></p><p>By now it was late at night. Yichen went out to the balcony and looked up at the moon again. He didn't know if it was psychological suggestion, but he felt the moon overhead seemed a bit different from before, though he couldn't pinpoint exactly what was off.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I don't know what those fallen blood-colored meteors will bring to this world."</p><p></p><p>Unable to figure it out, Yichen stopped thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>This instance of force-breaking the realm had consumed a great deal of his energy. He tossed himself onto the bed and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The next day, there was another series of urgent knocks on the door.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Baihu's voice.</p><p></p><p>"Master, open up quickly, it's not good, something happened."</p><p></p><p>Special thanks to the esteemed Lord Purple Lightning for the monthly tickets and recommendation tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the esteemed lords with the last four digits 0799, Haitian Yudu, Midnight Drunken Confusion, Lu, xx Liu, last four digits 7832, Don't Forget Brother, last four digits 2232, Talented Genius Cat, last four digits 5636, last four digits 1498, 52Hertz, Little Dragon's Big Fang, and Yu Xinrennai for the monthly tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Lord Zhou Shuai for the reward.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to all friends for the recommendation tickets and reading support.</p><p></p><p>See you all tomorrow.</p>

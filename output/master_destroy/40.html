        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day, the morning light was faint. </p><p></p><p>Yichen was still in a dream when a sudden rapid knocking on the door startled him awake.</p><p></p><p>"Master, open up, there's a big incident again."</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "......" This unlucky disciple, can't he use a different phrase?</p><p></p><p>"Coming, coming, stop knocking dammit, the chickens haven't even woken up yet, what's all the noise about? Has the County Master been bewitched by a female ghost or gone crazy from the wind?" Yichen put on his clothes, grumbling as he went to open the main door. </p><p></p><p>Who doesn't have a bit of morning grumpiness?</p><p></p><p>As soon as the door opened, the first thing that came into view was Zhang Buzhang's big face, and standing behind Zhang Buzhang was...the County Master.</p><p></p><p>County Master Zhou's face was as black as a wok lid.</p><p></p><p>Behind County Master Zhou stood a line of people.</p><p></p><p>Shuitao Master, Lianhua Monk, Qingxu Daoist Priest and a middle-aged man with a square face, wearing a fish robe embroidered with the words "Zhen'an" on his chest.</p><p></p><p>Damn, that's quite a crowd.</p><p></p><p>Didn't expect the County Master to be here too.</p><p></p><p>Even for Yichen whose face was as thick as a city wall, he couldn't help his old face flushing red this time.</p><p></p><p>It's like seeing a ghost, why did the County Master come too?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his mental fortitude was excellent, and he quickly adjusted himself.</p><p></p><p>When faced with awkwardness, as long as you're not awkward, then the awkward one is the other person.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's adjustment was on point. After chanting a verse of "Infinite Life Heavenly Honored One" towards the crowd, he led everyone into the back courtyard parlor with a righteous expression.</p><p></p><p>"Qingfeng, Mingyue."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and brew some good tea for the great ones, and bring some chestnuts too."</p><p></p><p>"This year's chestnuts are nice and plump, you all must try them." Yichen enthusiastically invited everyone to take a seat. The mountain chestnuts were exceptionally plump this year thanks to those dozen or so good-looking fellows from the Evil Tiger Gang, but his disciples didn't want to eat them, so they could be brought out for guests.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng and Mingyue were woken up by the knocking and came out to see what was going on. Being spotted by the eagle-eyed Yichen, they were roped into service.</p><p></p><p>Soon the two little ones brought out the tea and chestnuts, then went back to continue sleeping.</p><p></p><p>After taking a light sip of tea, the County Master rushed to explain the situation as if his butt was on fire.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying Lanxiu Pavilion has an incident now?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct. Currently evil spirits are running rampant. I took a look at Lanxiu Pavilion and it's filled with ominous energy. I'm outnumbered, so I've come to invite Daoist Master Yichengzi of Fengyang County, renowned for his powerful Dao skills, to lend a hand." </p><p></p><p>The one speaking was the middle-aged man in the fish robe.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Yichen looked at Grand Master Lianhua and the others with a hesitant expression.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry Daoist Master, as long as you great Daoists are willing to lend me a hand, once the task is accomplished, my Zhen'an Office is willing to reward each Daoist with an inferior dragon horse."</p><p></p><p>"If the Daoists don't need that, it can also be exchanged for one hundred merit points to redeem treasures like spirit pills and magic weapons from my Zhen'an Office."</p><p></p><p>"Whew, Bailiff, it doesn't matter if it's a dragon horse or treasures, this pauper monk's main concern is being diametrically opposed to evil spirits," Yichen said righteously.</p><p></p><p>"Plus one thousand taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, bring me my Dragon Slaying Sword, I can set out right now."</p><p></p><p>Yichen could see why even the old river Daoist Qingxu was roped into this - he didn't expect the Zhen'an Office to be so generous this time, willing to gift an inferior dragon horse.</p><p></p><p>He knew about these inferior dragon horses bred by the Imperial Astronomical Bureau's Beast Pavilion with a trace of dragon bloodline. Not only did they have astonishing endurance, they could travel a thousand li in the day and eight hundred li at night.</p><p></p><p>These inferior dragon horses were strictly controlled by the imperial court. Ordinary people could never breed such fine stock, so if one caught the eye of a interested buyer in the black market, selling it for ten thousand taels of silver was not unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't use it himself, he could sell it at a discount for cash.</p><p></p><p>This was a treasure horse with strong financial attributes.</p><p></p><p>As for those Zhen'an Office contribution points, they were even harder currency.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen'an Office was the violent enforcement arm that allowed the Great Yue Dynasty to overawe the world. It was filled with experts and countless treasures that could not be purchased with gold or silver, but only with contribution points issued by the Zhen'an Office.</p><p></p><p>Assisting the Zhen'an Office on cases was one way to earn those contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the looks of Grand Master Lianhua and the others, they had clearly also been swayed by the generous offer from this Bailiff Lin, which was why they came together.</p><p></p><p>Since they had already offended that person behind the scenes, they might as well go all the way and cooperate with this Zhen'an Office bailiff to cut off the roots.</p><p></p><p>These few were all firm and resolute - once they made a decision, they would see it through.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He would no longer hesitate. Now that they had superior numbers, their courage swelled.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen even believed that if only one of them could survive, the one to live would definitely be him...</p><p></p><p>Win and gain fame and fortune. Lose and just make his teammates suffer a bit - he himself would likely be able to escape. If he didn't go explore the demonic aura at Lanxiu Building, what kind of man would he be? </p><p></p><p>Moreover, regarding the deep red spot of White Flower, he couldn't help but feel unsatisfied if he didn't take a look.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the profound and composed demeanor of the Zhen'an Battalion Chief, he was obviously also a master. The advantage was on his side.</p><p></p><p>Alright then.</p><p></p><p>"Friends, charge!" After a brief consideration, Yi Chen silently cheered on his teammates in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Soon, the group set off towards the direction of Lanxiu Building. </p><p></p><p>All of them possessed cultivation bases. With single-minded haste, they arrived in front of the main gate of Lanxiu Building in about half an hour.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they reached the entrance, Yi Chen and the others couldn't help but gasp in shock, making their own tiny contribution to global warming in another realm.</p><p></p><p>Now they understood why the profoundly cultivated Zhen'an Battalion Chief's first reaction upon seeing the abnormality at Lanxiu Building was to seek help from the County Master.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the price was quoted so high - it was justified.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lanxiu Building had become a world of mist. Even with Yi Chen's Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique, he could only see an astonishing ominous aura, with a visibility of less than three meters - and this was after deliberately enhancing his visual powers.</p><p></p><p>If one hadn't cultivated spirit eye techniques, the situation would likely be even worse.</p><p></p><p>The two large white lanterns hanging outside the Lanxiu Building entrance were tirelessly spewing white mist, making the surrounding environment appear even more ominous and chilling.</p><p></p><p>Inside the building, the demonic aura was dense. Bizarre figures could vaguely be seen drifting through the white mist.</p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua, who was walking at the front, frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, how should we proceed?"</p><p></p><p>"Look at this shocking ominous aura fluctuation. The demonic entity inside Lanxiu Building must be highly cultivated."  </p><p></p><p>"We must carefully consider our approach."</p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua turned his gaze towards the group.</p><p></p><p>Master Shuiyue nodded in agreement.  </p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu expressed his approval.</p><p></p><p>Zhen'an Battalion Chief Lin Zhengyi's brow furrowed tightly, as if pondering how to deal with the situation.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Yichengzi...</p><p></p><p>Huh, where was Daoist Yichengzi?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a loud boom rang out.</p><p></p><p>The vermilion main gate of Lanxiu Building was smashed into pieces by a long brick that Yi Chen had pulled out from the street. The gate shattered instantly, and the brick, still carrying immense momentum, flew deep into the misty depths.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen walked over from the side and dusted off his hands.</p><p></p><p>"I just went to pull out that long brick. Didn't notice - Master Lianhua, did you need me for something?"</p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua looked at the shattered gate, then at Yi Chen's sincere expression, and remained silent for a while. "I did have something, but not anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay then." Yi Chen drew his Dragon Slaying Sword and slashed repeatedly at the lanterns outside the gate that kept emitting white mist.</p><p></p><p>Under the combined force of the Dragon Slaying Sword and his pure purple yang energy, the white lanterns suddenly exploded into a burst of flames, falling to the ground as black ashes that quickly dissipated in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene, Master Shuiyue fell silent.  </p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua stared blankly.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>This was unreasonable, completely disregarding proper procedures.</p><p></p><p>Didn't the renowned White Cloud Sect teach Daoist Yichengzi any basic protocols for dealing with demonic entities? No probing first? How could he just charge in directly like that?</p><p></p><p>The Battalion Chief could no longer hold back and asked Yi Chen at the entrance, "I mean... Daoist Yichengzi... is this how you always slay demons and eliminate evil beings?"</p><p></p><p>The Battalion Chief carefully chose his words.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem?"  </p><p></p><p>"This is how we at the Hidden Dragon Sect slay demons and eliminate evil beings."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gripped his Dragon Slaying Sword, twisted his neck, and questioned in return.</p><p></p><p>Silence...</p><p></p><p>"No problem, let's go in."</p><p></p><p>Thank you to everyone who voted, commented, and sponsored today. It's too late now, I'll express my gratitude tomorrow. Thank you all, I'll definitely post three chapters tomorrow. If I don't, I'll let my buddy chop me with the Dragon Slaying Sword.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Ah~"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a shrill scream also appeared in the backyard of Yinlong Temple. </p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu woke up, only to find himself lying on the same bed with Monk Lianhua. His hand was draped over Lianhua's shoulder, while Lianhua's leg was resting on his leg.</p><p></p><p>Damn, what an bizarre posture.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, part of his robe was missing. </p><p></p><p>Sheesh~</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it sent chills down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu glanced around and gently patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, thankfully, no one saw it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would lose all face, not even jumping into the clear river could cleanse that kind of shame.</p><p></p><p>The door creaked open.</p><p></p><p>It opened.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling sunlight poured into the room, colliding with him head-on, exposing every detail of the scene inside the room.</p><p></p><p>It was Yi Chen who hurried over after hearing the scream, fearing some accident had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Behind him was Qingyun Zi.</p><p></p><p>Behind Qingyun Zi was Shitai Shuiyue, who had just woken up not long ago.</p><p></p><p>Behind Shitai Shuiyue were Qingfeng and Mingyue.</p><p></p><p>When Yi Chen came in and saw the scene before him, he also froze.</p><p></p><p>He silently retreated and closed the door.</p><p></p><p>Shitai Shuiyue and Qingyun Zi had strange expressions, their mouths twitching incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng and Mingyue covered their eyes with their tender little hands, but their fingers were spread apart.</p><p></p><p>With the door closed, the room returned to its previous dimness.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Monk Lianhua also slowly woke up. He looked at Daoist Qingxu, and Daoist Qingxu looked at him.</p><p></p><p>The two pairs of eyes met.</p><p></p><p>You look at me, I look at you.</p><p></p><p>Silence, dead silence.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was Monk Lianhua who could not hold it in any longer and spoke first:</p><p></p><p>"Qingxu, what happened here?"</p><p></p><p>....</p><p></p><p>Inside Yinlong Temple, a large group of people were now seated around the dining table. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was quite skilled in cooking. He personally cooked, steaming, stir-frying, and braising the wild boar king they had hunted earlier, preparing a whole boar feast for everyone. (In this realm, cultivators did not abstain from meat.)</p><p></p><p>The pig trotters were oily yet not greasy, with a luscious red color. He had even carefully caramelized the sugar, making them look extremely appetizing.</p><p></p><p>Some of the ribs were braised in a sweet and sour sauce.</p><p></p><p>In front of Daoist Qingxu was a plate of stir-fried pork belly.</p><p></p><p>However, the shoulders of those seated at the table seemed to be twitching slightly, as if suppressing something, especially Shitai Shuiyue, whose face had turned completely red, as red as a ripe Fuji apple, making one want to take a gentle bite.</p><p></p><p>"Eat, eat." Seeing the awkward atmosphere, Yi Chen was the first to break the silence, urging everyone to start eating.</p><p></p><p>Actually, he could not be blamed for putting Daoist Qingxu and Monk Lianhua on the same bed earlier that day.</p><p></p><p>There were only five rooms in Yinlong Temple. Baiyun Zi had one room, Qingyun Zi, Qingfeng, Mingyue, and Yi Chen each had one room, but now there were four more people. How could they be accommodated?</p><p></p><p>Shitai Shuiyue would definitely need her own room.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu would need his own room too.  </p><p></p><p>Qingfeng, Mingyue, and Qingyun Zi would share a room.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen would need his own room.</p><p></p><p>That left Daoist Qingxu and Monk Lianhua. So Yi Chen could only put the two of them on his large bed.</p><p></p><p>Since he was tall, his bed could easily accommodate two people with plenty of room to spare.</p><p></p><p>Who knew the two would be so restless in their unconscious state~</p><p></p><p>My bad~</p><p></p><p>This was the most awkward meal Yi Chen had eaten in years, so awkward that even digging his toes into the ground could dig out a three-bedroom apartment.</p><p></p><p>During the meal, no one spoke a word. Everyone ate in silence, and no one mentioned the earlier incident or made small talk.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the meal, the attentive Daoist Qingxu even moved the stir-fried pork belly in front of Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the meal, Daoist Qingxu and Monk Lianhua put down their bowls and chopsticks and hastily took their leave, as if something even more terrifying than the 'Black Robe' was chasing them.</p><p></p><p>The two directly used their magic to travel, disappearing beyond the distant horizon in the blink of an eye, not even taking the bags of chestnuts Yi Chen had prepared for them.</p><p></p><p>Outside Yinlong Temple, Shitai Shuiyue stood tall and graceful in a plain robe that covered her from head to toe, revealing only a glimpse of her swan-like neck.</p><p></p><p>She was also bidding farewell to Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"I must thank Daoist Yi for saving our lives this time. If not for you, Daoist, we few might have met with disaster."</p><p></p><p>Shitai Shuiyue deeply bowed to Yi Chen, her body arching elegantly to reveal her exquisite curves.</p><p></p><p>"Shitai is too kind. As fellow cultivators, it is only right that we look out for each other."</p><p></p><p>"Qingfeng, Mingyue, quickly come and give Shitai some bags of chestnuts."</p><p></p><p>"You two have no sense at all."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen took the bags of chestnuts from Qingfeng's hands and walked over to Shitai Shuiyue, extending his large hand to offer them to her.</p><p></p><p>Because of the backlighting, Yi Chen's tall figure cast a shadow over Shitai Shuiyue's form, but she did not feel the slightest bit of fear or apprehension. Instead, a sense of security inexplicably arose within her heart.</p><p></p><p>A rich aroma of pheromones wafted into Shitai Shuiyue's jade-like nostrils.</p><p></p><p>A flush of red flashed across her cheeks, but she quickly suppressed it with her cultivation. After thanking him, she fled as if escaping, disappearing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "....."</p><p></p><p>Damn, why is everyone running away so fast?</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Shitai really has an amazing figure.</p><p></p><p>And an exceptional aura, like a reclusive orchid in a valley.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yi Chen could not help but gently slap himself.</p><p></p><p>Damn, this is supposed to be the rising period of my cultivation journey, yet I'm having such indecent thoughts...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>What kind of random thoughts was he having?</p><p></p><p>Ah Yicheng Zi, you are still injured. </p><p></p><p>Yichen went to the front hall first to tell Qingyun Zi that he didn't need to be called for dinner tonight as he would be cultivating to heal his injuries. Only then did he slowly return to his room.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a graceful figure suddenly appeared in his mind again. </p><p></p><p>The master's figure is really nice.  </p><p>Her temperament is also exceptional, like a fragrant orchid in a quiet valley.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yichen first stuck his head out and looked around to make sure no one was there, then locked the doors and windows.</p><p></p><p>Today was destined to be a sleepless night.  </p><p>He had something to keep himself occupied.</p><p></p><p>After securing the doors and windows, Yichen took out....a jade green beautiful jade.</p><p></p><p>After consulting the classics, he now knew what this jade that could release electricity was.</p><p></p><p>It was one of the marvels of heaven and earth, the Thunder Trapping Jade.</p><p></p><p>This was ranked as the tenth greatest treasure on the list of heavenly marvels.</p><p></p><p>The classics recorded that constantly observing the patterns and arcs on its surface could even further one's comprehension of the Thunder Laws, making it a coveted object for cultivators of the Thunder Laws.</p><p></p><p>This Thunder Trapping Jade could be used for cultivation, or its properties could be used to eliminate particularly stubborn demonic ghosts and evils, making it extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>However, these properties were of no use to Yichen. He tremblingly stretched out his hand, gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and touched the Thunder Trapping Jade, immediately withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle.</p><p></p><p>Alright, he didn't want to think about anyone else now.</p><p></p><p>One touch, two touches, three, four touches. </p><p>Five, six, seven, eight touches.</p><p>....</p><p></p><p>This was how boring and dull Daoist Yichen's cultivation life was.</p><p></p><p>Until the sun set and the moon rose, Yichen finally ended his cultivation for the day. </p><p></p><p>His whole body was numb from electricity and his head was buzzing - this was simply torture.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had reached the limit of his willpower.</p><p></p><p>After the hard work of last night and today, he had finally accumulated some more origin points, which he eagerly infused into the Physical attribute of his Four Dimensions.</p><p></p><p>A warm flow of energy suddenly appeared within his body, healing his injuries while slowly strengthening his physique, though not by much - but he was indeed making gradual progress.  </p><p></p><p>The lines of his muscles became more defined, appearing tougher.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so comfortable."</p><p>"More comfortable than rewarding myself."</p><p></p><p>With the healing from the warm flow and his powerful physique's beastly recovery ability, his internal injuries had recovered about 70-80% at this point.</p><p></p><p>He opened the window, letting the evening breeze carrying the fragrance of earth pour into the room, instantly filling it.</p><p></p><p>Yichen looked up at the moon overhead without speaking.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fist, surging power pulsing through his body.</p><p></p><p>There were some debts that needed to be settled.</p><p></p><p>The mastermind behind the Demon Tiger Gang's attack - he had kept a record of that in his little book. Although he could only go along with it at the time due to circumstances, he had never forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, tomorrow when it came time to settle accounts, he would ask the Zhen'an Magistracy to investigate it for him. Such a small matter, County Magistrate Lin surely wouldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>One's fists represent one's power, and power represents one's fists.</p><p>When a man clenches his fists, he grasps power.</p><p></p><p>A small matter like this, the Zhen'an Magistracy surely wouldn't refuse the friendship and goodwill of someone strong enough to kill a Dharma Protector's avatar.</p><p></p><p>Yichen already had clear plans for the future.</p><p></p><p>In this life-or-death battle with the 'Black Robe', Yichen's strength didn't seem to have changed much on paper, but his combat skills and spiritual willpower had been tempered, advancing his strength a small step forward.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he had become stronger.</p><p></p><p>The burning of his life force allowed him to glimpse the path to the eighth layer of the Pure Yang True Cultivation Art - Purple Extreme Nurturing Green. This reduced the deep red value he needed to break into the eighth layer by a hundred points, leaving only five hundred points remaining. This could be considered one of his gains.</p><p></p><p>This also indirectly proved that his cheat was based on optimizing and enhancing his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The current Yichen no longer needed to be cautious in Fengyun County - he was undoubtedly the number one cultivator there.  </p><p></p><p>In today's Fengyun County, no matter who the mastermind behind the Demon Tiger Gang was, he had the qualifications to make them pay the price.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bright moon outside the window, Yichen revealed a slightly ferocious smile, his aura violently aggressive.</p><p></p><p>"You bastards, have you washed yourselves clean?"</p><p>"This Daoist is coming to collect souls."</p><p></p><p>The surging power made even his long robe flutter lightly.</p><p></p><p>He was someone who held grudges.</p><p>Grievances must be repaid, favors must be returned.</p><p></p><p>Two months ago, at eighteen years old, he stood like a henchman, still selling Braggart Chicken.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, all thanks to his own efforts, in today's Fengyun County, no one could ignore his will.</p><p></p><p>My name is Yicheng Zi.</p><p>The new Abbot of Yinlong Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Mastermind, you're in trouble now.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Matters of the world must be handled with attention to details. </p><p>Difficult tasks of the world must be approached with ease.</p><p></p><p>Just as Master Yi had finished envisioning his grand blueprint in his mind, he had to prepare for going out the next day to preside over funerary matters and earn money.</p><p></p><p>One must make a living from life itself. </p><p></p><p>Reality will not give you any special treatment just because of your lofty ambitions.</p><p></p><p>This is the real world.</p><p></p><p>It's just like working with concrete in civil engineering projects in a previous life. </p><p></p><p>You may claim to have been born with superior talents, aiming for the highest goals, but once on the construction site, under the supervision of the tough foreman, you still have to do the grunt work of mixing concrete if that's what you're assigned.</p><p></p><p>Many cannot accept such a gap between expectations and reality. </p><p></p><p>But Yi Chen didn't mind at all.</p><p></p><p>Making money is not something to be looked down upon. Face is worth so little - Yi Chen only cared about real benefits.</p><p></p><p>He was a man who had fought dogs for food ten years ago, though he never actually did fight them.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, as long as you have enough money, everything can be negotiated.</p><p></p><p>What's scary are those who preach the culture of being wolfish while not actually providing meat.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's really hard to get things done if you don't have enough money.</p><p></p><p>For example, right now.</p><p></p><p>For ten taels of silver, Master Yi would give you a slap to help you recognize your place.</p><p></p><p>For a hundred taels, Master Yi could only sing for you overnight.  </p><p></p><p>If it's a thousand taels, well, he'd have to make arrangements and provide attentive service. He could even take position in advance.</p><p></p><p>And if you add more money, Master Yi could even request eighteen sturdy men for you, all dressed in solemn black brocade robes, each with cultivation skills, to give you the full eighteen-stage parting ritual, absolutely solemn and commanding in manner.</p><p></p><p>Setting up the spirit altar, burning paper money offerings.</p><p>Full one-stop funeral services.</p><p></p><p>That's professionalism.</p><p></p><p>And if the Wang family wants something more presentable, with some more money, he could even make custom paper figurines of people, horses, and mansions - an entire underground Forbidden City, a paradise for the afterlife, worth cherishing for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Money paid, he could build you a paper version of the Summer Palace in the underworld, you believe it or not? Absolutely an imperial-level experience.</p><p></p><p>In short, in a nutshell.</p><p></p><p>More money! More money! More money!</p><p></p><p>The level of service will match the price you pay at the Celestial Peak.</p><p></p><p>This is Master Yi's attitude in handling affairs.</p><p>This is the level of professionalism approved even by the Golden Finger at the third level of presiding over funerals.</p><p></p><p>You should know, when the Golden Finger first awakened, Master Yi's minor Yang skill was only at the second level...</p><p></p><p>What? You say concrete work doesn't pay much? Low pay, lots of work, working far from home? Easy to get harassed by foreign troublemakers?</p><p></p><p>Oh, no problem then. </p><p></p><p>My apologies, I misspoke.</p><p></p><p>However, even as such a professional Master Yi has decided to further elevate his 'Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique' before going out tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>He has now accumulated 81 deep red points. Although he gained some insights from the recent battle, he still lacks 419 points to reach the 500 needed to break through to the next level of his pure Yang inner skill.  </p><p></p><p>It would take forever to save up that many.</p><p></p><p>Rather than hoarding them, he might as well spend 40 deep red points to upgrade the 'Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique' one more level, especially since he's about to travel far.</p><p></p><p>The three attributes he gained from the third level of the 'Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique' - eagle eye vision, night vision, and yin energy perception - have all provided him tremendous help during the previous process.  </p><p></p><p>None of them were duds.</p><p></p><p>This made him look forward even more to what surprises the fourth level of the 'Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique' might bring.</p><p></p><p>Spending a little to accomplish something big - it's the perfect time to upgrade the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Deep red, breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>With this inner cry, Yi Chen spent 40 deep red points in a flash, and unfamiliar memories suddenly surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Like watching a movie, Yi Chen browsed through the memories, seeing a young Taoist sitting cross-legged before a Yin-Yang diagram, observing the interplay of Yin and Yang as he practiced breathing exercises.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he closed his eyes, and everything fell into stillness. His spiritual sense began to perceive the surrounding environment.  </p><p></p><p>He felt the flow of the wind, the fluttering of mosquito wings, the fragrance of the earth...</p><p></p><p>Day after day of sitting meditation, night after night of spiritual practice, forty years passed, and his five senses eventually became extraordinarily acute. The once youthful Taoist now had streaks of gray in his hair.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he still had his eyes closed as he stood up.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the courtyard gate, crossed a shallow stream, passed through a narrow path, walked over a wooden bridge. Although his eyes were shut, the surrounding scenery was vividly reflected in his mind.  </p><p></p><p>A mosquito flew over...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He wanted to land on him and suck his blood. </p><p></p><p>Smack!</p><p></p><p>Just as the mosquito was flying halfway, he casually slapped it dead.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to continue on his way, the Taoist monk suddenly frowned, and the hair on his skin stood up straight. He turned and ran away, his two legs moving swiftly like a windmill.</p><p></p><p>A few miles away, a colorful fierce tiger got up and chased for a few hundred meters before turning back dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>The scene ended abruptly here.</p><p></p><p>In a short while, a cool breath appeared in front of Yi Chen's eyes, and then spread to his entire brain as it circulated.</p><p></p><p>When Yi Chen opened his eyes again, he felt his mind was completely clear. He closed his eyes, and the surrounding scene was still vividly present in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, this ability to perceive the surroundings could only see about three or four meters away, becoming increasingly blurred the further away it was.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen already knew the function of the fourth level of the Yin-Yang Cave Pupil Technique.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a virtual light screen panel appeared on his retina.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yi Chen]</p><p>[Lifespan: 18/107 (-10)]</p><p>[Strength: 45.0, Stamina: 39.0, Spirit: 41.0, Agility: 36.0]</p><p>[Martial Art: Small Pure Yang Skill Level 7 (Traits: Fitness, Blazing, Divine Power, Exorcism, Tenacity, Breath Recovery, Ignition.) Active Skill: Yang Polarity Shift (Physical strength surges three times, inner energy becomes more active, lasts ten minutes, after which inner energy and strength temporarily drop to 70% of the original.) Active Skill: Soul Ignition (The most blazing is burning, ignite your potential, burn lifespan for power, currently ignite one year of lifespan to increase strength and inner energy by 50%, up to 5 times power increase.)]</p><p>[Martial Art: Yin-Yang Cave Pupil Technique Level 4 (Traits: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, Yin Energy Perception, Mind's Eye Projection Lv1, Evil Intention Perception Lv1.)]</p><p>[Passive Skills: Ink Painting Technique Lv1, Red Event Hosting Lv2, White Event Hosting Lv3, Cooking Lv3]</p><p>[Origin Points: 0.5] (Can be obtained through training to stimulate the physical body, used to improve the four dimensions of strength, stamina, spirit and agility.)</p><p>[Deep Red Value: 41.] (Can be obtained through special items or killing demonic ghosts and evil beings, used to advance martial art levels or deduce techniques.)</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few seconds passed, and the fourth level of the Yin-Yang Cave Pupil Technique was achieved.</p><p></p><p>The fourth level of the Yin-Yang Cave Pupil Technique also brought Yi Chen two special effects, Mind's Eye Projection and Evil Intention Perception.</p><p></p><p>And quite rarely, there was an "Lv1" after these two effects, which made Yi Chen wonder.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that these two effects can be further strengthened and upgraded in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh, with a Mind's Eye Projection Lv999, the rivers and mountains for thousands of miles would be projected in my mind, like observing the lines on my palm?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha."</p><p></p><p>After indulging in fantasy for three seconds, Yi Chen decisively cut off his delusions with the sword of willpower.</p><p></p><p>Lv999, what an imagination.</p><p></p><p>Impossible, absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yin-Yang Cave Pupil Technique created by the old Celestial Master was indeed powerful. The fourth level unexpectedly gave Yi Chen two special effects, which he had not anticipated.</p><p></p><p>The Mind's Eye Projection was not particularly helpful to him at the moment, but the Evil Intention Perception was truly a timely rain.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Energy Perception only allowed Yi Chen to become extremely sensitive to the aura of yin ghosts, which was still not very secure, as there were bound to be ghosts that could escape his perception.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his enemies were not necessarily yin ghosts...</p><p></p><p>However, with the addition of the Evil Intention Perception, the safety factor was greatly increased under the double protection.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, not bad, with these two trump cards in hand, who can scheme against me in the future?"</p><p></p><p>The more Yi Chen looked at these two special abilities, the more delighted he became, and he couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>"With this, I have one more trump card when going out."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this humble Taoist has a pure heart and simple mind, and is prone to being schemed against. There are too many wicked people out there."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard there are even female demons that devour flesh and blood, which is very terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"A male Taoist must learn to protect himself when going out."</p><p></p><p>Recommendation to read on Tuesdays only. Please support by reading tomorrow, fellow Taoists. I would be most grateful.</p><p></p><p>Today's voters will be thanked collectively tomorrow. Good night everyone.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

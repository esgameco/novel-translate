        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen raised his head, looking at the gray ribbon-like mist drifting down from above the iron curtain. He gently tapped with his fingertips, and a wisp of faint purple pure yang inner energy followed his fingertips to meet that strange mist. </p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>A teeth-grinding sound came.</p><p></p><p>The mist instantly evaporated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this situation, Yi Chen's expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>He felt that his pure yang inner energy had been neutralized. </p><p></p><p>Although it was only a negligible wisp.</p><p></p><p>But if this ribbon-like mist kept falling down, with one canceling out the other, they might really end up perishing here.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his yang polarity state could only last ten minutes, after which there would be a twelve-hour period of weakness.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man looked at the four people trapped under the iron curtain, revealing an expression mixed with delight and hatred.</p><p></p><p>He cackled weirdly, "Mist ghost, Earth-Pulling Mud, go easy on that master, leave her a life. I want to torture her myself."</p><p></p><p>"As for the other three things, kill them all. We'll divide their essence among ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yi Chen felt speechless. He glanced at Water Moon Master, silently lamenting that this ghost didn't forget its original intention. Without further hesitation, he raised the Dragon Slaying Sword and charged toward the white-haired old man.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yi Chen take action, Lotus Master and the other two were all experienced practitioners. They exchanged a glance and knew that the longer the night dragged on, the more unfavorable it would become for them. Thus, they also charged at the white-haired old man together.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an anomaly suddenly occurred. </p><p></p><p>Streams of black mist rose from the ground, separating Lotus Master, Water Moon Master, and Qing Xu Daoren.</p><p></p><p>The black mist swirled around, and the three figures immediately disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Earth-Pulling Mud that had previously clashed sound waves with Qing Xu Daoren rolled back, covering the white-haired old man's body.</p><p></p><p>Part of the yellow mud coiled around the white-haired old man's joints, wrists, and knees.</p><p></p><p>Another part of the yellow mud formed a mud-like half-body armor, covering his upper body, with a huge mouth relief appearing on his chest.</p><p></p><p>That mouth relief bizarrely opened and closed as it spoke.</p><p></p><p>"You bastard corpse ghost, if I weren't afraid of messing up the master's big plan, I wouldn't bother with your life or death."</p><p></p><p>"The Mist Ghost can only temporarily trap those three. Hurry up and deal with this ox-nosed one!"</p><p></p><p>After merging with the Earth-Pulling Mud, the white-haired old man's body surged with yin energy, and his aura instantly returned to its peak, even slowly rising further.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it was out of fear of the "master" mentioned by the Earth-Pulling Mud or because he was in the wrong, but the white-haired old man didn't respond. Instead, he raised his spine sword to meet Yi Chen's Dragon Slaying Sword.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p></p><p>This time, both Yi Chen and the white-haired old man retreated three steps back.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the white-haired old man cackled weirdly, "Ox-nosed one, wait for death!"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you very brave?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Come on, kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you suddenly become a soft-shelled shrimp?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to see how long your secret technique can last. At that time, I'll flay you alive inch by inch."</p><p></p><p>While spewing vulgar taunts, the white-haired old man took the initiative to meet Yi Chen, raising his spine sword.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the scales of victory were slowly tipping in his favor.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen frowned, naturally aware of these ghastly beings' intentions.</p><p></p><p>Although it currently didn't seem like Yi Chen was any weaker than the white-haired old man in their sword clashes, because of the gray ribbon-like mist occasionally falling from the sky, the white-haired old man could gain enhancements. With one canceling out the other, Yi Chen was gradually feeling strained.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the duration of his yang polarity state was almost halfway through.</p><p></p><p>"I can't continue like this, I must go all out."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if we keep fighting like this, the white-haired old ghost will only grow stronger and stronger."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This white-haired old monster must be dealt with in the shortest time possible, otherwise everyone will die here today." </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gritted his steel teeth, his determination rising. He put all five origin points unreservedly into the power attribute of the four dimensional attributes. </p><p></p><p>He didn't allocate any to physical strength, as this was not the time for a war of attrition, but rather a need for an explosive burst of power.</p><p></p><p>With his unparalleled great strength, combined with the sharpness of the Dragon Slaying Sword - a pure yang blade tempered over many years by the successive leaders of the Hidden Dragon Sect - it would produce a multiplier effect greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the difference that would allow him to smash through the white-haired old monster was just that little bit more.</p><p></p><p>At their level, a small edge in power had an enormous impact in actual combat.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>A surge of hot energy appeared, continuously flowing through his entire body. </p><p></p><p>Every single cell in Yi Chen's body began to cheer, greedily absorbing this hot flow like a drought-stricken field meeting the sweet rain.</p><p></p><p>His height increased another two centimeters, now standing over two meters tall. His muscles - tendons, arms, thighs, abdomen, neck - began another round of strengthening.</p><p></p><p>The hot flow seeped into his bones, causing them to emit a faint shimmering glow under its influence, flickering as if breathing.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen's four-dimensional power attribute had reached 33.</p><p></p><p>Bang, bang, bang.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Slaying Sword and the old man's spine sword clashed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>This time, the white-haired old man began to sense something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>To his horror, he found that the mighty cultivator before him was rising in power yet again, his already superhuman divine strength continuing to increase.</p><p></p><p>The first strike, he retreated a step.</p><p>The second strike, he retreated two steps. </p><p>The third strike, he retreated five steps.</p><p></p><p>He was starting to panic.</p><p></p><p>"Oxnose, let's call it a day, what do you say?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen remained silent, relentlessly hacking away.</p><p></p><p>"Oxnose, I admit defeat today, don't go too far. If you push me too hard, I have secret techniques too. Then we'll all go down together."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen remained silent, continuing his furious assault.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man now had the look of one who had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator with the ferocious strength of a beast.</p><p>This pure yang inner energy like a bone-deep affliction.</p><p>This supremely sharp pure yang sword that could suppress his yin energy completely.</p><p></p><p>The combination of the three made him want to beat a retreat.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the towering figure before him and couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Even though his head was in his own hands, it was still tingling.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>"Oxnose, damn it, say something!"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is no easy feat, why are we fighting to the death? It's mutually destructive, no one gains anything."</p><p></p><p>This time, Yi Chen stopped.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man's heart leapt with joy, thinking this Oxnose had finally come to his senses. It wasn't easy.</p><p></p><p>But soon the smile froze on his face as Yi Chen's cold voice entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>"This pauper cultivator only wishes to slay you scoundrels, or be slain by you!"</p><p></p><p>"Come on, let's continue and decide the victor and the dead once and for all."</p><p></p><p>By now, the hot flow in his body had long dissipated, but Yi Chen's expression only grew more frenzied - the look of one who tremendously enjoyed battle.</p><p></p><p>In the repeated clashes with the white-haired monster, Yi Chen had naturally suffered some minor injuries. But his spirit only grew brighter, each collision like a great hammer tempering and refining his vital energy, spirit, and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He even felt that he had taken a small step forward in the sixth layer of his Small Pure Yang skill, the light purple of his pure yang inner energy becoming just a touch richer in its violet hue.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

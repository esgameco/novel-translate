        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"To be a person, one must be able to bend and stretch!" said Elder Yi.</p><p></p><p>However, the 'Black Robe' did not respond to Yi Chen's words. He only continued to stare at him with an indifferent gaze. </p><p></p><p>"Shall I leave then?"</p><p></p><p>"You may not believe me, my friend, but I got involved in this unintentionally and know nothing about it."</p><p></p><p>"I'm very tight-lipped."</p><p></p><p>Taking a small step back, Yi Chen continued to probe with a sheepish look on his face.</p><p></p><p>The previous overbearing aura had vanished without a trace, and he smiled harmlessly. </p><p></p><p>If he had a choice, he really didn't want to fight this new 'Black Robe' whose aura was astonishingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>In battle, the principle is to bully the weak with strength, to oppress the small with the large.</p><p></p><p>Battle is about profit.</p><p></p><p>Only by bullying the weak with strength and oppressing the small with the large can one gain the greatest benefit at the smallest cost. Don't you see how proxy wars are waged?</p><p></p><p>If one's interest before the war is 100, the cost of battle is -20, and the gain from battle is +5.</p><p></p><p>Then this battle is a losing deal.</p><p></p><p>The weak perish in the end, and the strong die out alone, this is the principle - you go bankrupt in the end.</p><p></p><p>If you make too many losing deals and want to pick a fight with everyone, you're just bleeding yourself dry.</p><p></p><p>Learning from history, Yi Chen really didn't want to fight this battle.</p><p></p><p>This 'Black Robe' was clearly not someone on the same level as Yi Chen. Even until now, Yi Chen still couldn't figure out whether killing the Black Robe would count as killing a person or an evil spirit? Would he get profound red merits or not?</p><p></p><p>The risk is infinitely great, and the gain is uncertain. This is not a good deal at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the 'Black Robe' finally spoke. His indifferent gaze carefully sized up Yi Chen from top to bottom, as if trying to see through him.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, I didn't expect that among the cultivators of the Pure Yang Path, there would be such a flexible character like Little Daoist Master who has such a low bottom line."</p><p></p><p>"Little Daoist Master, what do you think of the rumors about our Corpse God Sect's Patriarch Wanhua Zhenjun in the outside world?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was silent for a moment, then said carefully, "The Corpse God Dao sincerely cultivates its own path, its determination towards the Dao is extremely firm, and I admire it greatly."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, when Patriarch Wanhua opened the sect and widely accepted disciples, although he gathered the wisdom of many, the momentum was vast, but it was inevitable that good and bad were mixed together."  </p><p></p><p>"Some troublemakers, under the name of the sect, did not seek true understanding but only wanted to take shortcuts. The more they walked, the more deviated and evil their path became."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's original intention was good, it's just that the people below misinterpreted the scriptures."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha." The Black Robe suddenly laughed loudly in a neurotic manner, clapping his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Well said!"</p><p></p><p>"A talented person like the Daoist Master should indeed join my Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing to accept the Daoist Master as my disciple, to enter my sect's doors, and become the First Holy Son of my sect. Divine abilities, wondrous methods, celestial realms, treasures of heaven and earth, fine wine, beautiful women - all that you desire shall be granted."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master, do you accept?"</p><p></p><p>"This is absolutely impossible!" This time, the usually slippery Yi Chen answered decisively without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This answer even made the 'Black Robe' person pause in surprise.</p><p></p><p>It was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>However, what he didn't know was:</p><p></p><p>Although Yi Chen's bottom line was despicably low, he still had a bottom line.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, his sole focus was to climb upwards, experiencing countless deceits and betrayals. However, he only exploited those who were like predatory beasts in the arena of power and profit...</p><p></p><p>He schemed against those who were also carnivorous beasts in this arena.  </p><p></p><p>Since they were all at the gambling table, they risked life and death by the will of Heaven. This was why he could exploit them without guilt.</p><p></p><p>This was his bottom line.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, he was born poor. Exploiting the poor would bring karmic sins.</p><p></p><p>Exploiting carnivorous beasts was just because his skills were inferior to theirs, so he did it without guilt.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons why he annihilated the Evil Tiger Gang without taking even three feet of their territory.</p><p></p><p>After he swiftly killed the gang leader and core members of this town-level small gang, how much money could the ordinary members and a few mid-to-low level cadres have?</p><p></p><p>Those in gangs live day-to-day, spending lavishly.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After spending money on food and clothing, he was basically left with just a few coins. </p><p></p><p>They had all joined the gang, either because they liked indulging in eating, drinking, visiting prostitutes and gambling, or because they were forced by circumstances to make a living to support their families.</p><p></p><p>This was not some third-rate martial arts novel, where shady characters always carried all their wealth around and martial arts masters always kept their secret manuals on them, afraid that if they died their enemies wouldn't be able to get them.</p><p></p><p>Fairy tales are all lies. Only the rich value their lives. The lower the social class, the more they would sacrifice their lives rather than their money, being as cunning as a rabbit with three burrows.</p><p></p><p>After all, as Zhou Shuren said, you can deceive my feelings, but not my money.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people can only earn so much money in their lifetime. They may be able to swallow the bitter pill of being deceived emotionally, but if their money is gone, it's like a living death.</p><p></p><p>That night, Yi Chen witnessed it firsthand.</p><p></p><p>Under the 80/20 principle, the upper echelons took away most of the profits. As for the remaining ordinary members of the Evil Tiger Gang, while not completely destitute, they could at least be described as dirt poor.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen really didn't have the leisure to beat them up one by one like a mosquito trying to scrape oil off its leg. He simply took everything.</p><p></p><p>The money they had protected with their lives could be left for their families.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Taoist monk doesn't rob the poor.</p><p></p><p>Because he had many ways to make money.</p><p></p><p>And repaying kindness was his second bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Recalling ten years ago when he had just transmigrated to this world, he was a drifter without any dependence, and his body was weak. He had even stooped to fighting with stray dogs for food. Damn it, he had never actually won any of those fights, and eventually fainted from hunger in a snowdrift. If it weren't for his master Bai Yunzi, the grass on his grave would have been three feet tall by now.</p><p></p><p>It was Bai Yunzi who had rescued him. That tall old man had given him unparalleled warmth and solace, providing him with food, teaching him martial arts, treating him as his own, giving without asking for anything in return.</p><p></p><p>Although Bai Yunzi was eccentric and like a doting mother, he had done nothing but good for Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>You throw me a wooden peach, and I'll repay you with a precious jade.</p><p></p><p>Although Yi Chen's bottom line was flexible and wavering, it ultimately still existed.</p><p></p><p>"Refuse?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what you're giving up?"</p><p></p><p>The smile disappeared from the 'Black Robe's' face.</p><p></p><p>"A man of virtue has things he will do and things he won't."</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not a particularly good person, I absolutely cannot do something as dishonorable as forgetting kindness and breaking my vows."</p><p></p><p>There was no longer any frivolous expression on Yi Chen's face. He was extremely serious, enunciating each word as he said:</p><p></p><p>Between life and death lies great terror, but even more terrifying than death is a soul that drifts without anchor, blown about by the winds, taking any shape.</p><p></p><p>If the soul has no mooring, no principles, able to become anything at any time, then who are you? Who is the real you?</p><p></p><p>Even beasts have the right to choose to live.</p><p></p><p>But for a human being, living cannot be just for the sake of living. One must have some perseverance, some things more exalted than life itself.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist monk likes keeping accounts and not making losing deals. However, in this world there are some things that cannot be calculated in terms of profit and loss.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I thought the young Taoist was a talented person."</p><p></p><p>"Never imagined you'd turn out to be just another stubborn fool."</p><p></p><p>"Obstinate and ignorant, not knowing how to advance or retreat, oblivious to the times."</p><p></p><p>The 'Black Robe's' expression turned cold, and with a fist clenched with a speed Yi Chen couldn't even react to, he struck a heavy blow straight into Yi Chen's stomach.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the fist struck Yi Chen's body, it was as if he saw the muddy truck that had brought him to this world.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The immense force shook his internal organs violently, sending him sliding more than ten meters across the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Will you submit?"</p><p></p><p>The 'Black Robe' said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen spat out a trickle of fresh blood from the corner of his mouth, but still held his head high. He slowly pulled himself up, his back still ramrod straight, like an upright sword pointing at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Old man still won't submit!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Life is full of disappointments more often than not. If everything could go according to the script, that would be great. Otherwise, why would there be so many tragic and joyful dramas in life? </p><p></p><p>Until the very last moment, he would not give up.</p><p></p><p>In fact, at this time, he had a vague guess in his mind that his golden finger was not wrong, it was just that the underworld was not destroyed, and the old melon seller's resurrection was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yichen hesitated whether to continue forward or retreat back to the main hall, suddenly at the original stall of the old melon seller, there was a disturbance, and a blood-red portal began to slowly appear from nothing.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the blood-red portal was an endless sea of blood, with a black lotus floating and sinking in it.</p><p></p><p>Above the sea of blood, on the left and right sides of the portal, were a crouching dragon and tiger, both beasts with vivid and extraordinary expressions.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sounds of a dragon's roar and a tiger's howl came, and the blood-red portal was abruptly pulled open halfway, revealing a messy small forest outside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yichen's expression was overjoyed. "This place is familiar to me."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, as the portal was slowly pulled open, the mist in the deep alley began to churn violently, and a powerful ominous ghostly air began to condense.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's expression changed drastically. His figure flashed, seizing the opportunity, and rushed into the opened blood-red portal. On the way, he did not forget to scoop up a handful of the striped tiger's tail and drag it away.</p><p></p><p>At the very moment when Yichen's figure entered the portal, a powerful ghostly air grazed past the blood-red portal like a blade...</p><p></p><p>Outside the messy small forest, Yichen, dragging the tiger's tail, panted heavily. That last burst of powerful ghostly air had scared his soul out, but fortunately, he narrowly avoided being "split in half" at the critical moment, escaping that fate.</p><p></p><p>However, the tiger brother's fate was not so good. Yichen looked at the only half a body of the striped tiger left in his hand and sighed in his heart:</p><p></p><p>"Tiger brother, your life is thin. I have tried my best, but I could only rescue your tail and half your butt."</p><p></p><p>Behind him stood a strange red mansion, which he had finally escaped from.</p><p></p><p>Yichen turned back and glanced at this strange red mansion called the underworld, licked his lips, and estimated in his heart how many deep red points he could get by blowing up this broken mansion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were changes in the distant red mansion again. In the front courtyard, an old melon seller came out, with not even three good teeth left, grinning at Yichen.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god!"</p><p></p><p>Yichen's hair stood on end instantly. He flung the half-corpse of the striped tiger onto a tree, his body enveloped in a faint purple pure yang inner energy, and ran away with all his might.</p><p></p><p>The effect of the yang extreme had not yet dissipated, so he ran extremely fast, even pushing out a straight line in the dense forest.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the striped tiger's half-butt was hanging on the tree, its tail swaying gently in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Changes were also happening in the underworld at this time. A new colored spirit tablet suddenly appeared at the very bottom of the main hall's shrine, clearly showing Yichen's face.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>When Yichen saw the lights of the Hidden Dragon Monastery, the sky had already darkened.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the familiar monastery in the distant horizon, Yichen finally let out a long breath of foul air.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the underworld was truly perilous. Although it seemed easy for him to kill the old melon seller earlier, like cutting a melon, in reality, he had used up all his means, including his ultimate yang extreme and dragon-slaying sword.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the two sounds of the dragon's roar and the tiger's howl that came from the blood-red portal at the end, providing that assistance, he might have ended up with only half a body left, just like the striped tiger.</p><p></p><p>That final burst of violent ghostly air was truly terrifying. Even in Yichen's yang extreme state, he would have been "split in half" by that ghostly air as sharp as an arrow, suffering the same fate as the striped tiger.</p><p></p><p>That night, at the Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>The four master brothers sat around the table, while the two little cuties Qingfeng and Mingyue thoughtfully brought tea and water. The two little ones rested their chins on their hands, their adorable big eyes staring straight at Yichen, looking him up and down, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng: "Master Brother."</p><p></p><p>Mingyue: "You said you would bring us something delicious. Where is the delicious food?"</p><p></p><p>Yichen smiled awkwardly, took a sip of tea, and said, "Qingfeng, Mingyue, you may not believe it when I say this, but your master brother was actually going to bring you candied fruit skewers this time."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng and Mingyue exchanged a glance, already having a bad feeling, and asked in unison, "And then?"</p><p></p><p>"And then your master brother was hurrying back, you know. I bought a whole stick of candied fruit skewers. But guess what happened on the way back?"</p><p></p><p>"When I passed through the forest, a deer suddenly darted past me, followed closely by a striped fierce tiger that also darted past me. That fierce tiger swung its tail, and you'll never guess what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"It knocked over all the candied fruit skewers! Gone, all gone!"</p><p></p><p>"Could your master brother take that? I immediately gave chase."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng: "......"</p><p>Mingyue: "......"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qingfeng's cheeks puffed up like a pufferfish. He interrupted Yichen's words and asked, "Master Brother, what about that fierce tiger that knocked over the candied fruit skewers?"</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "Dead."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"How did he die?"</p><p></p><p>"Since he died, you greedy elder brother, why didn't you bring him back?" The two little ones continued questioning one after the other.</p><p></p><p>"He was split in half by a ghostly energy arrow, leaving only half a butt behind. How could I bring that? I casually tossed it into a tree." </p><p></p><p>Qingfeng: "..."</p><p>Mingyue: "..."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng and Mingyue exchanged another glance. The two little puffer fish jumped off the chairs, made scary faces at Yi Chen in unison, and then went back to rest in their rooms.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "..." Nowadays, no one believes the truth anymore.</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at Qingyunzi, "Younger martial brother, do you believe me?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I believe you, elder brother must have encountered something formidable this time." Qingyunzi said with a squint, his squint becoming increasingly severe.</p><p></p><p>"Younger brother, you really understand me. How did you figure it out?"</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi didn't speak, but pointed with his finger at the exposed skin on Yi Chen's bare chest.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen followed Qingyunzi's gaze and looked down. A chill went straight to his head as a drop-shaped bloody mark had appeared on his chest, he didn't know when.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this thing, is it coming again?" Yi Chen said in horror, having a premonition that this ghostly mark was most likely related to that bizarre underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, could you describe in detail what happened to you? One person's plan is short-sighted, two people's plan goes further. Let's think of a solution together."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen briefly recounted his experiences in the underworld. After listening, the well-read Qingyunzi frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, it seems this matter has become serious."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what the underworld is, but the jade token you obtained is inscribed with 'Zhang Jishi'. If I'm not mistaken, this person is the missing 36th patriarch of Longhu Mountain, the most renowned orthodox Daoist master."</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi's worried voice came through.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "..." He couldn't help but think of the dragon and tiger phenomena on the bloody gate when he came out, and the colored Daoist figure at the top of the spirit hall. Could it be that he was able to escape only because of the secret assistance of this old Daoist master?</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then the favor owed would be quite significant.</p><p></p><p>However, if even a formidable master like him had been trapped in this wretched underworld for over a hundred years, damn...</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked down at the drop-shaped bloody mark on his chest, his expression fluctuating. Finally, he laughed wryly to reassure Qingyunzi:</p><p></p><p>"Younger brother, there's no need to worry too much. Perhaps this is just a mosquito bite."</p><p></p><p>"On my way back, I passed through a wooded area. Wild mosquitoes, really vicious!"</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi was a straightforward person. He said seriously, "Elder brother, don't lie to me. My cultivation has almost reached the point of full awakening. Now my spiritual perception is sharp. With your current surging blood and qi and toughness, even if you were slashed with a kitchen knife, it probably couldn't cut through. What kind of mosquito could leave a mark like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, don't deceive me."</p><p></p><p>"But don't worry elder brother. At most two months from now, I'll be fully awakened. Even if I have to risk my life, I'll definitely find a way to protect you completely."</p><p></p><p>A wisp of faint red pure yang true qi flickered at the tip of Qingyunzi's left index finger, and an excited expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Younger brother, impressive! Quick, tell elder brother what it feels like. How did you break through?" Yi Chen happily ruffled Qingyunzi's Daoist bun, messing it up in just a few motions.</p><p></p><p>This younger martial brother was still fun when he was little, but he became a bit too serious after growing up.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother~, don't mess it up, you've been messing it up for so many years..." Qingyunzi dodged Yi Chen's demonic hands while pursing his lips, "I can't describe how I awakened the pure yang spiritual nature, but I can talk about what it feels like after awakening."</p><p></p><p>"There is qi in heaven and earth. After awakening one's spiritual nature, one can sense the existence of qi, see one's true nature clearly, absorb and utilize qi, and even use one's own qi to leverage the forces of heaven and earth, displaying all kinds of incredible abilities - this is the essence of magic arts."</p><p></p><p>"There are many different types of qi between heaven and earth - the five elements, yin and yang, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning are just a few examples. In addition to the red pure yang qi that I resonate with the most, another type I'm closely attuned to is the qi of starlight."</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi finished speaking and made a hand gesture. To Yi Chen's astonishment, the starlight and moonlight outside actually slowly gathered into a small ball of light in Qingyunzi's palm. Then he opened his mouth and directly swallowed the ball of light.</p><p></p><p>"This is...the supreme yin force? Younger brother, how did you, a cultivator of the pure yang Dao, awaken two completely different powers?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it difficult? I couldn't figure it out before either - what is the pure yang force? What is the ultimate end of the pure yang Dao? Finally, last night while reciting the 'Supreme Spiritual Flight Pure Yang Source Dao Scripture', it all came together in a breakthrough enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate of yang is yin, and the ultimate of yin is yang - this is the supreme principle of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"For example, as master once mentioned, the greatest heavenly treasure - the yang spring water - can only be nurtured in an extremely yin environment."</p><p></p><p>"This is yin giving birth to yang at its extreme."</p><p></p><p>"After understanding all this, I could absorb the qi of stars and moonlight, as well as the qi of pure yang."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation means aligning with the heavenly mind, absorbing the qi that suits you best, and befriending the qi."</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi wore a proud expression as he poured out all his realizations like spouting beans.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

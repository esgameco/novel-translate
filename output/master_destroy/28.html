        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Night fell, without wind but with the moon shining bright. </p><p></p><p>The entire Fengyun County was enveloped in tranquility.</p><p></p><p>All the civilians had been notified and were in position. A curfew was imposed tonight, no one was allowed to go out, doors and windows must be shut tight. If any abnormality was detected, they should shout loudly to cause a commotion, and the local officials would come to handle it.</p><p></p><p>"Then we shall proceed accordingly."</p><p></p><p>Under the pale moonlight, Yi Chen and three others each held a yellow triangular talisman as they went their separate ways. </p><p></p><p>These triangular talismans were provided by Master Lianhua. It was agreed that if they encountered evil spirits, igniting the talismans with spiritual power would allow them to sense each other's locations and provide mutual assistance.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen, Master Lianhua, Master Shuiyue, and Daoist Qingxu were stationed to guard the east, south, west, and north districts of the city respectively.  </p><p></p><p>After taking their positions, they all began to take action.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen naturally relied on the third level of the 'Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique' to sense the aura of yin energy. He roamed the long streets, walking incessantly while perceiving any traces of yin energy.</p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua took out a small censer of ash and chanted Buddhist sutras while scattering a bit of the ash along the way.</p><p></p><p>Master Shuiyue held a white jade bottle with a slightly greenish willow branch inserted in the mouth. She carefully observed her surroundings and sprinkled some liquid from the bottle using the willow branch at every intersection.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu carried a small tripod censer, reciting unknown incantations. He would walk a few steps, take out a wooden hammer to gently tap the tripod censer, stand still to listen for any sounds, and then continue walking, repeating the process.</p><p></p><p>Each had their own methods and techniques.</p><p></p><p>Until midnight, not a single abnormality had occurred, leaving Yi Chen with mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, he hoped the evil spirit would appear as he was eager to gain profound insights. On the other hand, he feared that if the evil spirit was too powerful, the four of them might not be able to defeat it...</p><p></p><p>His state of mind was like that of a young maiden awaiting her lover, afraid he wouldn't come, yet also afraid of the chaos if he did.</p><p></p><p>The night deepened.</p><p></p><p>All was quiet.</p><p></p><p>Yet many in Fengyun County might not have fallen asleep that night.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen walked slowly along the long street of the eastern district, his shadow stretched long by the moonlight as he carried the Dragon Slaying Sword, constantly surveying the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>With his heightened senses, he could perceive that many civilians in Fengyun County were not asleep. Some daring ones secretly opened their windows to peek outside. Upon seeing a tall and sturdy Daoist patrolling, their hearts were put at ease, and they quietly closed their windows again.</p><p></p><p>Before he realized it, Yi Chen had reached the intersection of the eastern and southern districts, where he happened to meet Master Shuiyue carrying her jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>At night, Master Shuiyue was not wearing her usual gray robe but had changed into a white plain dress.</p><p></p><p>Master Shuiyue's fair skin appeared even more radiant under the moonlight, like a jade figure walking in the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, without the concealment of her loose robe, her curvaceous figure was accentuated.</p><p></p><p>Her legs were long and slender, and her body swayed gracefully as she walked.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging slight nods upon meeting, they parted ways again.</p><p></p><p>As Yi Chen walked onto another long street, he stopped in his tracks, smacked his lips in admiration of her hidden beauty, and then continued his patrol.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had a strange feeling that Master Shuiyue did not seem like a nun but rather a well-educated and trained lady from a prestigious family.</p><p></p><p>Some things are ingrained in one's bones and cannot be changed. The subtleties and noble air revealed in her demeanor and movements suggested that Master Shuiyue's background might not be as simple as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>To make it in this world, one needs either exceptional ability or an influential background.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Yuelin Monastery or Miaoyu Nunnery, they were no small establishments and had branch temples in other prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they also had a presence in Fengyun County.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Lingfeng Monastery, Zhengzhen Monastery, and Yinlong Monastery were relatively insignificant, merely local forces rooted in the vicinity of Fengyun County.</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, Yi Chen stopped and lightly slapped his handsome face.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this evil spirit should appear any minute now..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The critical moment emerged, thinking "What about Master Shui Yue?"</p><p></p><p>"It really shouldn't be like this."  </p><p></p><p>"The moonlight tonight is really big and bright."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen raised his head to look at the full moon overhead, walked to a household's water barrel placed by the street, and glanced at his reflection. A chiseled handsome face appeared in the water barrel. </p><p></p><p>After making a sound of indifference, which could be considered an ordinary evaluation, he then continued shamelessly strutting and inspecting the street with his head held high and chest puffed out.</p><p></p><p>In the same space and time, the southern district of the city.</p><p></p><p>Master Shui Yue looked at the deserted street, the night wind blowing on her fragile, porcelain-like face. She suddenly felt a chill and fear in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She looked up at the full moon overhead, and suddenly thought of Yi Chen, the young Taoist priest as sturdy as a bear, whom she had just encountered. She then lightly laughed, and the hint of fear that had just arisen in her heart instantly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The strike Yi Chen had launched in the county courthouse's backyard had left a very deep impression on her.</p><p></p><p>That lecherous old Tao priest really made her sick, his eyes constantly looking towards her sensitive areas, like a nasty old toad, not biting but disgusting enough to kill. She couldn't help but lash out, and Yi Chen had vented her anger.</p><p></p><p>Actually, her impression of Yi Chen was not bad. She was somewhat aware of the situation at the Yinlong Temple - just a few big and small cats, all relying on Yi Cheng alone to support them. If he wasn't fierce and violent, how could he establish a foothold in Fengyun County?</p><p></p><p>Those with weaknesses, those without backing, cannot gain a foothold without being a bit prickly.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone has a profound background like her.</p><p></p><p>Her origins had allowed her to see much bloodshed beneath cultured appearances, so she did not dislike Yi Chen's behavior. Instead, she felt he had a sense of responsibility, resembling her brother before she became a nun. Moreover, Yi Chen's appearance was not bad, a million times better than that disgusting lecherous old Tao priest.</p><p></p><p>"He's also someone who has had it not easy."</p><p></p><p>Master Shui Yue lightly sighed, exhaling a breath of turbid air. She tightened her clothes and continued walking forward.</p><p></p><p>Her gait was graceful with every stride.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she did not notice that suddenly a dark cloud drifted over, blocking the moonlight. The light instantly dimmed, and a light fog began to rise on the street.</p><p></p><p>From the thin mist at the end of the long street, an old man with white hair pushing a small handcart emerged.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man had a lecherous grin, with ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Selling knives, selling knives."</p><p></p><p>"Master, would you like to buy a knife? Very cheap."</p><p></p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p></p><p>Master Shui Yue felt her whole body freeze as if trapped in an ice cellar.</p><p></p><p>She felt the surrounding air suddenly become heavy like iron, tightly binding her.</p><p></p><p>An ugly, chicken-skinned old face leaned towards her.</p><p></p><p>"The Master is truly beautiful. Want to buy a knife? Not expensive."</p><p></p><p>Master Shui Yue felt a surge of bitterness in her heart. She had been careless. Her fingers twitched, about to activate a costly secret blood technique to escape this predicament.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice that sounded like heavenly music to her came, causing her to stop her movement.</p><p></p><p>After all, if she used that secret technique...</p><p></p><p>A tall figure forcefully squeezed between her and the white-haired old man, the immense force causing the old man to stumble. The tall figure also blocked the old man's view, instantly releasing the restraints on her.</p><p></p><p>She quickly retreated a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>What happened next before her eyes left her mouth agape in utter shock.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's huge hand pressed down on the white-haired old man's shoulder, while his other hand grabbed a chopping knife from the handcart.</p><p></p><p>His voice thundered.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, the Master doesn't want to buy your broken knives."</p><p></p><p>"This penniless monk wants to buy."</p><p></p><p>"I want the knife, but I have no money. Tell me, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>During these fifteen days, Yi Chen shut himself in his room, bitterly cultivating. In the meantime, he gave his junior martial brother Qing Yun Zi another two thousand taels of silver, instructing him to work hard, while he himself completely took on the role of an idle owner.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way—to build a towering edifice from the ground up, glory could only be achieved through one's own efforts. </p><p></p><p>His Yin Long Guan had no ancient ancestors buried in the back mountains, lying dormant and waiting to rise from their coffins when enemies invaded—no such trump card existed.</p><p></p><p>Although his junior martial brother Qing Yun Zi had quite high aptitude, he had only recently awakened his spiritual sense, so the main pillars of Yin Long Guan still had to be upheld by Yi Chen himself for now.</p><p></p><p>Over this half-month period, apart from his disciple Zhang Buzhang coming to pay him a visit once and report on the progress of investigating the mastermind behind the scenes, he had been tirelessly cultivating and accumulating origin points at the limits of his physical and mental capacities.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, Yi Chen's hands trembled slightly as he carefully wrapped up the Thunder-Subduing Jade and placed it close to his chest.</p><p></p><p>Half a month.  </p><p></p><p>A full half a month.</p><p></p><p>Who knew how he had spent this half a month?</p><p></p><p>In order to accumulate the ten origin points needed for the Body Breakthrough Realm, he was completely drained.</p><p></p><p>Half a month without leaving the room, his spirit depleted to the point of a deathly pale complexion, causing his junior martial brothers to now look at him with strange gazes...</p><p></p><p>Qing Yun Zi had wanted to say something several times but held back.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, heaven does not let those with perseverance down. Today, Yi Chen finally accumulated the origin points needed for the Body Breakthrough Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Body Breakthrough Realm, on this very day."</p><p></p><p>"Origin points, add to me!"</p><p></p><p>With an inward roar, Yi Chen instantly deducted the ten painfully accumulated origin points. An immense warm flow suddenly appeared, nourishing his entire body.</p><p></p><p>With the experience from his previous Force Breakthrough, this time Yi Chen was much more adept at guiding the warm flow. The boundless warmth nourished every single cell in his body.</p><p></p><p>Each and every cell in his body seemed to cry out in thirst like a drought-stricken field.</p><p></p><p>With each circulation of the warm flow, it was a tempering of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>In the repeated circulations, the hidden injuries deep within his body were gradually repaired by the nourishing warmth, bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Next, it strengthened his muscle fibers, which became increasingly tough through the constant tempering and refining, with dense muscle fibers intertwining tightly like aircraft arresting cables.</p><p></p><p>Then, the tendons connecting his muscles and bones began to thicken, growing an extraordinary yet tough layer of keratin under the nourishment of the warm flow.</p><p></p><p>After that came his bones, the foundation supporting the body and the source from which strength and blood essence are born. Countless streams of warmth slowly seeped into the depths of his bones.</p><p></p><p>Entering an introspective state, Yi Chen saw his originally translucent jade-like bones slowly evolving towards a pale golden hue.</p><p></p><p>His entire skeletal structure was like a bottomless pit, greedily absorbing and precipitating the permeating warm flow.</p><p></p><p>As the warm flow continuously poured in, the pale golden color on his bones became more and more concentrated, eventually solidifying into delicate golden threads linking all parts of his body.</p><p></p><p>Under the constant nourishment of the warm flow, his blood essence became increasingly vibrant.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the blood essences throughout Yi Chen's body began to stir. Tiny specks of reddish light appeared on his internal organs, muscles, bones, and other parts.</p><p></p><p>These reddish specks of light attracted each other, intertwining and growing, forming a strange reddish sphere of light in his abdominal cavity.</p><p></p><p>The reddish sphere was initially quite dim, but as more and more reddish specks converged within it, its color grew increasingly bright.</p><p></p><p>The reddish sphere also grew to the size of an infant's fist through the constant convergence.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen felt everything was about to conclude, an anomaly suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>From that reddish sphere, thin reddish threads began to grow, winding and taking root, connecting to his internal organs and some of his muscles.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a new circulatory channel formed within Yi Chen's body.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the warm flow within Yi Chen's body was also finally depleted. The newly formed reddish sphere inside him began to brighten and dim with his breathing.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked at the changes within his body in shock, momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, after the Body Breakthrough Realm, it directly gave me an energy heart?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I still human now?"</p><p></p><p>He lightly clenched his fist, and incomparable strength began to surge within his body.</p><p></p><p>The strengthening was complete. Yi Chen felt as if a shackle had been removed from his physical body, with an indescribable sense of lightness and freedom.</p><p></p><p>The feeling was akin to an ordinary person who routinely carried dozens of kilograms of lead suddenly having that burden lifted.</p><p></p><p>Even his heartbeat had become more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The Body Breakthrough Realm was successful.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen couldn't help but reveal a faint smile on his face. At this moment, he felt incomparably good.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if I'm stronger or weaker than my master at his prime."</p><p></p><p>"Could I beat my master in a fight?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thought emerged in Yi Chen's mind, but he immediately extinguished it.</p><p></p><p>Such a thought seemed a bit like disrespecting and betraying one's teacher...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression changed slightly, and a virtual screen appeared before his retinas.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yi Chen]</p><p></p><p>[Lifespan: 18/128]</p><p></p><p>[Strength: 51, {Force Breakthrough Realm x1: Penetration Lv1 (force imbued with shockwave penetration effect), Force Aura Lv1 (force attribute effects amplified by 20%)}</p><p></p><p>Stamina: 50, {Body Breakthrough Realm x1: Overcharge Lv1 (upon full charge, stamina and total inner qi tripled), Overload Recovery Lv1 (stamina consumption doubled, bodily self-healing increased fivefold)}</p><p></p><p>Spirit: 41,</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Agility: 36</p><p></p><p>[Cultivation Method: Pure Yang True Cultivation Seventh Layer (Attributes: Robust Body, Blazing Hot, Divine Strength, Warding Off Evil, Tenacity, Rejuvenation, Ignition). Active Skill: Extreme Yang Transformation (Physical strength triples, inner energy becomes more active, lasts for ten minutes, after which inner energy and strength temporarily drop to 70% of original level). Active Skill: Soul Ignition Transformation (The most blazing is burning, ignite one's own potential, burn lifespan in exchange for power, currently ignite one year of lifespan to increase strength and inner energy by 50%, up to 5 times power increase).]</p><p></p><p>[Cultivation Method: Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique Fourth Layer (Attributes: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, Yin Energy Perception, Mind's Eye Reflection Lv1, Evil Intention Perception Lv1).]</p><p></p><p>[Passive Skills: Painting Lv1, Hosting Red Celebrations Lv2, Hosting White Ceremonies Lv3, Cooking Lv3]</p><p></p><p>[Origin Points: 0] (Can be obtained through physical training to improve strength, body, spirit and agility stats.)</p><p></p><p>[Deep Red Value: 311] (Can be obtained through special items or killing evil spirits, used to upgrade cultivation levels or deduce insights.)</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his attribute panel underwent an earth-shattering change. The biggest change was to his lifespan, which suddenly surged by 31 years, instantly increasing his longevity to 128 years.</p><p></p><p>With a strong body comes strong force, after breaking through the Body Realm, his strength attribute also increased slightly, which was an unexpected pleasure.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more delighted were the two extraordinary abilities he gained after breaking through the Body Realm:</p><p></p><p>Excess Energy Storage Lv1 (When energy is fully stored, physical strength and inner energy increase threefold)  </p><p></p><p>Overload Recovery Lv1 (Physical consumption doubles, bodily self-healing increases fivefold)</p><p></p><p>"Truly...extraordinarily powerful and practical abilities."</p><p></p><p>If one had to use a sentence to describe Yi Chen, who had broken through both the Force and Body Realms, it would be:</p><p></p><p>Extremely beefy while also dealing high damage...</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was delighted inwardly, a tsunami-like feeling of hunger suddenly emerged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed like every cell in his body was wailing.</p><p></p><p>For a split second, he even wanted to eat...</p><p></p><p>The surrounding light seemed to be mysteriously attracted, madly rushing into the interior of his body.</p><p></p><p>However, this only slightly alleviated his hunger.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"This excess energy storage actually has such a side effect?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yi Chen realized the culprit behind his ravenous hunger.</p><p></p><p>Excess energy storage.</p><p></p><p>Ever since awakening the ability to absorb external light energy, Yi Chen hadn't experienced such intense hunger for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Damn!</p><p></p><p>He let out a muffled groan, pushed open the door with his large hand, and headed straight for the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Meat! Meat! Meat!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to eat meat!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to eat all high-energy foods.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, ever since Yi Chen made a little money, Yin Long Monastery had developed the good habit of hoarding food, especially now that they were expanding outside the monastery.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen casually grabbed an egg, carefully controlling his pure yang inner energy to fry it, directly making a runny yolk fried egg.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Alternating between his left and right hands to fry eggs, in no time he had swallowed over a hundred eggs. His stomach churned madly, instantly converting the food into energy that flowed through the blood-colored channels into the blood-colored light sphere.</p><p></p><p>As the light surged in and the food went down, Yi Chen finally alleviated that devouring hunger to some extent.</p><p></p><p>But it still wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>The excess energy storage was far from full at this point.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen eyed the chicken, duck and pork hoarded in the kitchen, his eyes glinting ferociously.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Yi Chen was lying in the backyard of Yin Long Monastery, chewing on a toothpick with a cup of tea on the table beside him.</p><p></p><p>Now this was comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Not only was he full, but the excess energy storage had also been filled.</p><p></p><p>In his introspective state, the blood-colored light sphere inside Yi Chen's body now seemed almost substantial, quietly flickering bright and dim with his breathing.</p><p></p><p>This was simply his second heart.</p><p></p><p>Excess energy storage increased his physical strength and inner energy threefold when fully charged, at the cost of an unparalleled feeling of hunger when energy was depleted.</p><p></p><p>Compared to its powerful ability, Yi Chen felt the small side effect was still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored, almost substantial light sphere contained incomparable compressed energy that could slowly dissipate and convert into physical strength and inner energy for him, greatly increasing his endurance.</p><p></p><p>In such a state, even the Extreme Yang Transformation could be maintained for several times longer.</p><p></p><p>Happily sipping his tea, Yi Chen, who had emptied the entire kitchen, was about to rest when the anxious voices of Qing Feng and Ming Yue came over.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen frowned.</p><p></p><p>"In major events one must remain calm, isn't that what I've always taught you?</p><p>What could make you rush in so anxiously? Slowly explain, there aren't many things in Feng'un County that your Senior Brother can't handle now."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen waved his domineering large hand arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>He had this confidence now.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, there was a thief in our monastery and the kitchen was emptied out. What are we going to eat tonight?" This was Qing Feng's voice.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, there were several people wearing fish robes outside the monastery, it was Uncle Lin and Big Brother Lin from last time. They're asking if you're free now, they have a lead on the mastermind behind the scenes." This was Ming Yue's voice. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "Quickly invite them in, no, I'll go welcome them myself."</p><p></p><p>One more chapter tonight.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

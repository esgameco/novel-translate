        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the surrounding onlookers had collectively dropped their jaws in astonishment. </p><p></p><p>The White Crane Taoist priest they had placed high hopes on was immediately slapped to the ground like a dead dog as soon as he entered. Meanwhile, the Upright Disciple Taoist priest they didn't think much of had repeatedly fended off the Five Passages Demon's attacks.</p><p></p><p>"This...can't be real," someone said in disbelief.  </p><p></p><p>"Of course it's real. No one understands the Upright Disciple Taoist priest better than me. I knew long ago that the Upright Disciple's magic powers were formidable. After all, he is the powerful cultivator over two meters tall that the Second Master requested someone to invite," said a protector, having procured a feather fan from somewhere, fanning himself while muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had an air of being the only sober one in a world of drunks.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen currently had no spare attention for the idle chatter around him, his gaze solely fixed on the Five Passages Demon.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he remained steady and had kept something in reserve. He unexpectedly trapped this evil spirit with an array, otherwise today's matter would have been difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"Oxnose, your skills are considerable. How about we each take a step back today? From this day forth, I vow not to set foot half a step into Ping'an City, nor will I bother you all again. If you let me leave, what do you say?" said the Five Passages Demon, spitting out remnants of the peach wood sword, its five thick black tentacles waving behind its back.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Five Passages Demon couldn't help inwardly cursing its plight. It had thought it could easily break through this array and leave, but didn't expect the Small Inverted Five Phases Sealing Array set up by Zhen'an Si to be so mysteriously powerful.</p><p></p><p>It had feinted attacks multiple times, trying to burst through the array, but whether it was spells or tentacle strikes, they were all blocked by that pale golden light shield.</p><p></p><p>Under the operation of the array, this light shield could somehow transfer all force onto the five array formers and flags, eventually channeling it into the ground. Its repeated attempts to break through were in vain, and it even nearly got struck by that pure yang force from the mighty Oxnose once.</p><p></p><p>What was even more dreadful was that this array was gradually weakening and suppressing its power, making it increasingly difficult for it to recover its demonic energy within the array space.</p><p></p><p>Since it couldn't win on the battlefield, naturally it had to try negotiating.</p><p></p><p>With a shift in its thoughts, the Five Passages Demon directly started playing hardball, swallowing and crunching the peach wood sword of that white-haired old Taoist to demonstrate its might.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, Venerable Ones. This Five Passages Demon is cunning and lustful in nature, having committed innumerable bloody cases. It ranks 97th on Zhen'an Si's Demon Wanted Order. We absolutely cannot let it go this time," warned Lin Baihu.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if this demon escapes, it will be like a fish returning to the ocean, a tiger back to the mountains. We may never have such a good opportunity again."</p><p></p><p>The Zhen'an Si Demon Wanted Order was no trifling matter that small fry could be listed on. Generally only long-standing, extremely evil demons with numerous atrocities could make the list, each terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>This Five Passages Demon was considered an anomaly on the wanted list, infamous for its unscrupulous methods. Its frontal combat abilities were unremarkable, but its concealment skills were truly unmatched. Coupled with its inherent caution, it had painstakingly killed its way into the top 100 of the wanted list over the years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu was afraid Yi Chen might waver, so he spoke up to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>His worry was completely unnecessary though. If he let this white-flowered deep red go, wouldn't he be inhuman?</p><p></p><p>It would be unforgivable.</p><p></p><p>They had expended great effort to finally corner it, how could they possibly allow it to escape like this?</p><p></p><p>The Five Passages Demon frowned and said, "Oxnose, cultivation is no easy feat. There's no need for us to fight to the death. You're not even from Zhen'an Si, why bother risking your life against me?"</p><p></p><p>"Whatever price Zhen'an Si is offering you, I've accumulated some resources over the years too. No matter what their price is, I'll give you three times that amount. What do you say?"</p><p></p><p>"Sounds not bad," Yi Chen licked his lips, the ferocious light in his eyes burning brighter. "But I'm afraid you can't afford what I want!!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yi Chen let out an enraged roar. He directly channeled the source points he had accumulated over the past two days into the Strength attribute of the Four Dimensions, while also instantly activating his Yang Polarity Shift.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't want to fall into a weakened state, he had no choice but to use it now if he wanted to subdue the Five Passages Demon. Being a resolute person, he unhesitatingly pushed his power to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The familiar sensation of power began filling his entire body. His stature started growing taller again, exceeding the two-meter mark once more.  </p><p></p><p>The muscles of his legs, arms, abdomen, and neck also began swelling, becoming thicker and larger.</p><p></p><p>The warmth from the source points further reinforced his body as it spread through him.</p><p></p><p>Strength surged within him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yi Chen's aura flared up again, his ferocious demeanor and scorching gaze causing the Five Passages Demon's scalp to tingle with dread.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying gaze that was.</p><p></p><p>The Five Passages Demon understood it all too well in its heart.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This was the gaze he had when looking at ordinary humans, as if looking at a slab of meat on a chopping board. </p><p></p><p>The ferocious aura formed a whirlwind that directly swept the sand, stones and mud from the courtyard into the sky. Five Apertures Demon could no longer bear it, the five tentacles behind him suddenly lengthened, twisted into a bundle, like a huge club smashing down towards Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>However, the massive tentacle that could previously fight Yi Chen to a standstill was now caught by Yi Chen's single hand, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>"You, is this the extent of your ability?" </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen raised his head, revealing a ferocious grin.</p><p></p><p>"Little dog, this is not enough, this force is far from enough."</p><p></p><p>"Bring out your true skills, otherwise you'll perish here."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's right hand sword waved, directly severing the twisted tentacle bundle in front of him.</p><p></p><p>His aura became increasingly ferocious, step by step closing in on Five Apertures Demon.</p><p></p><p>He took one step forward, Five Apertures Demon retreated one step.  </p><p></p><p>He took one step forward, Five Apertures Demon retreated another step.</p><p></p><p>Five Apertures Demon's strength was not in direct confrontation, but in concealing his aura and form. In an instant, he fell into a predicament.</p><p></p><p>He continuously released demonic qi, controlling the tentacles behind him to attack Yi Chen, trying to slow his pace, but it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of this great formation, one waxing as the other waned, his obstruction seemed laughable, as Yi Chen sliced through the tentacles in front of him like cutting radish slices.</p><p></p><p>"Oxtail, you damn well better say something."</p><p></p><p>"What price do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Five Apertures Demon he had forced into a corner, Yi Chen stopped his steps. At this point, the enhancement effect from the source point had ended, but his aura was gradually accumulating to its peak.</p><p></p><p>His strength attribute had now reached the astonishing level of 46 points.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen stopped not because he was moved by Five Apertures Demon's words, but because he suddenly had a premonition that when his strength attribute broke through 49, he would gain an immense benefit.</p><p></p><p>The great number of Creation is 50, its application 49.  </p><p></p><p>After his strength attribute reached 50, he would undergo a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>"Truly, a surprising transformation."</p><p></p><p>The sudden premonition delighted Yi Chen, so he decided to ask Five Apertures Demon to meet his demise early, so he could return and experience it sooner.</p><p></p><p>He had to go back and work overtime touching the electric door, to reach the threshold of 50 as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Five Apertures Demon, tell me, if I want to borrow your head for a bit, can you afford that price?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out a cold snort, his entire body transforming into a deep purple blaze, slashing fiercely towards Five Apertures Demon.</p><p></p><p>Five Apertures Demon showed a look of utter despair, casting his resentful gaze towards Madam Wang.</p><p></p><p>"You bitch, so it was you who brought this Daoist and the Zhen'an Office here?"</p><p></p><p>"Good move."</p><p></p><p>"I should not have spared you back then."</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.</p><p></p><p>The few remaining tattered tentacles of Five Apertures Demon attacked again, trying to delay Yi Chen's offense, but were all severed by him.</p><p></p><p>He opened his huge mouth wide, a black blazing pillar suddenly gushing out, attacking Yi Chen's face.</p><p></p><p>This was his last hope.</p><p></p><p>But hope was shattered.  </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was well prepared, how could he not be wary of the final counterattack?</p><p></p><p>With a swing of his Dragon Slaying Sword, he directly split that black blazing pillar in two. After being cut in the middle by the sword, the pillar brushed past Yi Chen's body with a shrill whistle, slamming into the formation's barrier and splashing up ripples.</p><p></p><p>At this point Five Apertures Demon had completely gone insane. Knowing he could not escape today, he suddenly laughed madly towards the Wang Family Master:</p><p></p><p>"Wang Family Master, your wife is truly..."</p><p></p><p>Sizzle.</p><p></p><p>Five Apertures Demon's mad laughter abruptly stopped. </p><p></p><p>Like a hot knife cutting through butter, Five Apertures Demon perished.</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed Five Apertures Demon, gaining 120 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>Hiss, a great harvest indeed.</p><p></p><p>Another surge of delight came to Yi Chen's heart.</p><p></p><p>Special thanks to the great benefactor Little Fat Stick for the monthly tickets and rewards for this book...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In this life-and-death battle, he not only gained strength and improved skills, but the most precious thing he obtained was the tempering of his will. </p><p></p><p>The unyielding will, like a sharp blade, cut through the fog, cut through the illusion, cut through hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The strong will allowed him to better seize opportunities in battle. </p><p></p><p>The strong will allowed him to better unify the strength of his entire body with each sword strike, causing his power to gradually condense into one. This enabled him to better unleash his full potential, using only seven or eight-tenths of his full force to achieve effects that previously required his full ten-tenths.</p><p></p><p>This wonderful feeling made even Yi Chen's soul tremble with exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill me, use all your strength!" </p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, you'll be killed by me."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen flew swiftly with his Dragon Slaying Sword towards the figure of the white-haired old man.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a white light flashed, and the figures of Shui Yue Shitai, Lian Hua Fashi, and Qing Xu Daozhang slowly appeared from the black mist.</p><p></p><p>At this time, their hearts felt as heavy as being weighed down by a thousand-pound rock.</p><p></p><p>They had been careless, accidentally trapped by the Mist Demon's mist wall, unaware of Dao Zhang Yi Cheng's situation. After all, Yi Chen was facing the combined form of the Earth-Pulling Mud Demon and the white-haired old man in an enhanced state.</p><p></p><p>The Mist Demon was a very special kind of evil spirit, with a chaotic will, sluggish reactions, generally low intelligence, and even lacking powerful offensive abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, its ability to entrap and obstruct others was unparalleled. Not only could it enhance the evil spirits within its shrouded area, but it could also weaken enemies.</p><p></p><p>It was simply like the nanny of the evil spirit realm. Once it merged or cooperated with other evil spirits, it could often produce unimaginable effects.</p><p></p><p>Shui Yue Shitai, Lian Hua Fashi, and Qing Xu Daozhang had been trapped for a while by the Mist Demon's innate spell called "Ghost Wall."</p><p></p><p>"Dao Zhang Yi, you must hold on at all costs."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, not only Shui Yue Shitai and Lian Hua Fashi, but even Qing Xu Daozhang, who had previously watched Yi Chen's deadly battle with the white-haired ghost, prayed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, the situation could change at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Qing Xu Daozhang's heart was as clear as a mirror. After the Mist Demon transformed into an iron curtain, its movement would certainly be restricted, but it would also seal off this space, making it not so easy to break through.</p><p></p><p>If Yi Chen died, the three of them would ultimately be defeated one by one, resulting in complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>"Look quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The first to appear, Shui Yue Shitai, exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Her voice was clear and charming, like a pearl dropping onto a plate, adding a touch of color to the currently oppressive environment.</p><p></p><p>The three of them turned their gaze towards the focal point of the arena, the tall figure locked in a bloody battle with the white-robed old man, causing them to stare in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The scene they had imagined, of Yi Chen covered in blood or even dead, did not occur. Instead, a majestic figure dressed in a Daoist robe was pressing down on the white-haired old man, slashing at him relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>Shui Yue Shitai once again covered her cherry lips with her delicate hands.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly... shocking. Could it be that Yi Cheng Zi Daozhang was still hiding his true strength before, and what he displayed was far from his limit?"</p><p></p><p>Shui Yue Shitai murmured in amazement, her gaze shifting as her line of sight followed Yi Chen's movements.</p><p></p><p>Qing Xu Daozhang and Lian Hua Fashi were, of course, equally astonished beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Qing Xu Daozhang's eyes narrowed, and he said sternly, "Everyone, look quickly. The Mist Demon is continuously injecting its yin energy into the white-haired old ghost's body. The fact that we were able to break out so quickly must be because Yi Cheng Zi Daozhang had already pushed these evil spirits to desperation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a flash of divine light shone in Lian Hua Fashi's eyes, and she smiled, "How can we let Yi Cheng Zi Daozhang bear the burden alone on the front lines?"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we join forces and use our techniques to cut off the yin energy transmission from the Mist Demon to the white-haired old ghost? We'll support Yi Cheng Zi Daozhang's assault and see what tricks these evil spirits still have up their sleeves."</p><p></p><p>The three exchanged glances and nodded, each unleashing their respective techniques to obstruct the Mist Demon.</p><p></p><p>Rays of dharmic light shot towards the black iron curtain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three figures appear, the white-haired old ghost, who had been suffering greatly, felt even more regretful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the word "color" was like a knife hanging over his head.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, relying on the yin energy transmitted by the Mist Demon, although he was struggling against the suddenly empowered Yi Chen, he managed to hold on.</p><p></p><p>His heart felt like every second was a year, hoping that this madman chasing and slashing at him relentlessly would soon exhaust the duration of his secret technique.</p><p></p><p>However, instead of the secret technique expiring, Yi Chen's helpers arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Bitter indeed."</p><p></p><p>With Lian Hua Fashi and the others taking action, the white-haired old ghost's already precarious situation became even more dire.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen swung the Dragon Slaying Sword, incessantly slashing at the white-haired old ghost, his sword strikes becoming increasingly ferocious. The Dragon Slaying Sword cut through the air, creating wave after wave of ripples.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lian Hua Fashi and the others appear, he couldn't help but sneer:</p><p></p><p>"Stinking fools, wait to die."</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you very brave?"</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Come on, kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"Why have you suddenly become a coward?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to see how long you can last without the Mist Demon providing you with yin energy. At that time, I'll skin you alive, inch by inch."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen immediately transformed into the persona of Mu Rong Fu from Suzhou, using the same tactics against the white-haired old man, spitting back the very insults he had hurled at Yi Chen earlier.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The old man with white hair was even more enraged to the point of wanting to vomit blood upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the duration of Yi Chen's Yang Polarity Transformation was less than two minutes. It was better to seize the remaining courage to pursue the defeated enemy, and not to delay for the sake of gaining fame as a hegemon. After venting his anger, he focused on dealing with the white-haired ghost.</p><p></p><p>After all, the night is long and dreams are many, it's better to take him down early.</p><p></p><p>Another clash of long swords.</p><p></p><p>The rippling shockwaves scattered outwards.</p><p></p><p>This time, the spine long sword in the white-haired ghost's hand was almost slipping from its grasp, as it could no longer bear it.</p><p></p><p>"Brat, do you really want to kill us all?"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't let me live, then let's both..."</p><p></p><p>Stab.</p><p></p><p>The sound of a sharp blade cutting through flesh.</p><p></p><p>The tip of the Dragon Slaying Sword pierced through the white-haired ghost's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Pull...the earth...I...grass..."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired ghost fell to the ground, trembling as it pointed at a yellow figure ahead, but the last two words were never spoken, instead turning into a trail of black smoke and disappearing between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a stream of information appeared on Yi Chen's retina.</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the Corpse Ghost, gaining 30 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>However, Yi Chen had no time to check this stream of information, and shouted towards the Water Moon Master: "Master, quickly block it!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, when the white-haired ghost was fiercely threatening Yi Chen to fight to the death, the Pull the Earth that had turned into armor and attached itself to the white-haired ghost detached itself, turning into a little mud figure and running away.</p><p></p><p>After all, the three of them were just existences forcibly combined by the master's spells. Pull the Earth would rather torture the white-haired ghost than make a final struggle with it. It fled in advance, while Yi Chen also seized this opportunity to directly kill the white-haired ghost in the instant it detached.</p><p></p><p>Pull the Earth's heart was as clear as a mirror. No matter how the white-haired ghost self-destructed its ghost heart, and no matter if it could fight to the death against the tall Taoist in front, there were still three more behind.</p><p></p><p>After the previous fierce battle, both Pull the Earth and Mist Ghost had suffered greatly. Even if they fought now, they would inevitably face annihilation, so it was better to abandon the white-haired ghost and take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen's words fell, Water Moon Master reacted, and a transparent water dragon leapt out from the jade bottle she was carrying, heading straight towards the mud figure that Pull the Earth had turned into.</p><p></p><p>Water splashed everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the mud figure that Pull the Earth had become showed a human-like smile on its face.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it had escaped with its life.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it heard a voice.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>A sword tip pierced through its chest, pinning it to the iron curtain.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that after Yi Chen shouted, seeing that he couldn't catch up, he mustered all his strength and threw the Dragon Slaying Sword in his hand, nailing the evil Pull the Earth down.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone get back!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out a furious roar, and in the astonished eyes of Water Moon Master, Lotus Flower Monk, and Clear Void Taoist, he stepped hard on the bluestone ground with his left foot, causing cracks to spread outwards.</p><p></p><p>Borrowing the powerful counterforce transmitted through the ground, Yi Chen shot towards Pull the Earth like a cannonball.</p><p></p><p>He pulled out the Dragon Slaying Sword and chopped at the iron curtain formed by Pull the Earth and Mist Ghost in a bone-chopping manner, his sword leaving afterimages, until Pull the Earth and Mist Ghost also turned into black smoke and disappeared. Only then did Yi Chen stop.</p><p></p><p>A duck in hand could still fly away?</p><p></p><p>If the hard-earned deep red points ran away, he wouldn't be able to sleep at night. He had risked his life for them.</p><p></p><p>If someone else stole the first kill, he would be even more restless and had to act quickly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, two more streams of information appeared on Yi Chen's retina.</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed Pull the Earth, gaining 30 deep red points.]</p><p>[You have successfully killed Mist Ghost, gaining 30 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>Wow, a sudden windfall. Indeed, the bigger the storm, the more precious the fish.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had never felt so rich before. This time, including the 20 deep red points he snatched from the white-haired old man's firewood knife, he had gained a total of 110 deep red points.</p><p></p><p>This was too cool.</p><p></p><p>"Taoist, how did you manage to do that?" Water Moon Master couldn't help but ask as she looked at the tall figure before her.</p><p></p><p>She was really curious how the young Yi Chen had reached such a level.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the duration of the Yang Polarity Transformation had also ended.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's body returned to its normal height. Leaning on the Dragon Slaying Sword, he smiled gently at Water Moon Master's egg-like face and said, "That's naturally because their will and strength were beneath mine."</p><p></p><p>"Each harboring evil intentions, yet without the will to fight, their will and strength were beneath me, so it was only natural for me to kill them with my own hands."</p><p></p><p>"Their purity was too low."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Yi Chen turned his gaze towards Clear Void Taoist, thrusting the tip of the Dragon Slaying Sword into the bluestone bricks, his cold voice rising.</p><p></p><p>"Clear Void Taoist, isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Crane disdainfully glanced sideways at Yi Chen, who was gorging himself. </p><p></p><p>"This young man is still too young. The Wang family is so wealthy, yet instead of leaving a good impression on the main household, he only knows how to gorge himself. If you offend the host here, will you even get a decent red envelope afterwards?"</p><p></p><p>"You can always eat the food later. These little lamb chops won't run away. You must maintain some decorum."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Crane looked at the crispy-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside little lamb chops in front of him, licked his lips, but restrained himself. </p><p></p><p>He could pack them up to eat later at night, it would be the same.</p><p></p><p>Then, just as he was focused on putting on airs, the Venerable White Crane suddenly felt the surrounding light dim, and a large face leaned in close to him.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable White Crane, don't you like these little lamb chops?"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity~"</p><p></p><p>"Uh...this pauper monk does not eat meat."</p><p></p><p>"I love them. Since you don't want to eat them Venerable White Crane, why don't you give them to me?"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the Venerable White Crane to respond, Yi Chen directly took all the little lamb chops from in front of him, and even snatched a peach that was there too.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Crane's mouth trembled, his chest heaving violently. After a long while, he still hadn't said a word, as he knew his midnight snack was gone.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Wang family master and his wife, seated in the main positions, had little appetite for the exquisite food and just ate a few bites before apologizing and withdrawing to attend to the old madame's final rites.</p><p></p><p>However, the sharp-eyed Yi Chen noticed a slight abnormal flush on the wife's face at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Although she had put on powder, that unusual blush was still caught by Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>It was the afterglow of intimacy...</p><p></p><p>Drawing on his past life's experience with tea tasting, Yi Chen was certain he was not mistaken.</p><p></p><p>Tsk~</p><p></p><p>The old madame was about to pass away, yet these two still had the free time for amorous activities?</p><p></p><p>Or was it... on the grassy plains?</p><p></p><p>These city folks really know how to have fun.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's gossipy soul burned fiercely, yet his heart remained unruffled. He broke off a rib and gave it to the kitten, then turned and polished off the rest of the lamb chops in three bites.</p><p></p><p>He patted his belly, and under the lead of a maidservant, returned to the guest room.</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain had already stopped by the time Yi Chen arrived in Ping'an County Town. Tonight, the moon was bright and the stars were twinkling.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen opened the window to let the evening breeze fill the room. He picked up a cup of brewed tea on the table and took small sips, his thoughts unknown to anyone.</p><p></p><p>The little kitten was doing sit-ups on the floor, hooking its hind legs under the horizontal bar beneath the table, going up and down repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Everything was so harmonious.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tonight, the moon was bright, the stars twinkling.</p><p></p><p>Ping'an County Town, the Wang Manor, rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xiuer was the wife's personal maidservant, naturally favored by the wife. However, five or six days ago, the wife had unexpectedly arranged for her to move to the rear courtyard to live with the other maidservants.</p><p></p><p>She was extremely unhappy, unaware of what mistake she had made.</p><p></p><p>The events of the past five or six days were enough for the newly 18-year-old girl to remember for life.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had been the wife's personal head maidservant. The menservants adored her, the older servants doted on her, the younger maidservants envied her.</p><p></p><p>Everything had been so wonderful.</p><p></p><p>But all of that was completely shattered five or six days ago, like a soap bubble bursting.</p><p></p><p>The colorful world suddenly turned gray and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The world changed overnight.</p><p></p><p>The older servants who had previously flattered her now oppressed her.</p><p></p><p>The menservants who had desperately pursued her previously hurled vicious insults at her when she rejected their advances again, cursing that she still thought she was the head maidservant, acting so high and mighty - a plucked phoenix was no better than a chicken, let alone a mere maidservant like her.</p><p></p><p>As for the other maidservants who had previously called her "elder sister" this and "elder sister" that, they now looked at her with disdain and marginalized her openly and secretly.</p><p></p><p>The harsh reality of people raising one up only to trample them down was vividly displayed before her.</p><p></p><p>Tears welled up in Xiuer's beautiful large eyes.</p><p></p><p>When she was little, she had heard a storyteller recount a tale. She had mostly forgotten the specific story, only remembering that at the end, the storyteller had said a line with a wistful expression:</p><p></p><p>"Life is like a monkey climbing a tree. Looking up, you only see asses. Looking down, you only see smiling faces."</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand the meaning of those words as a child, only remembering them because the storyteller looked so handsome, which captivated her young self.</p><p></p><p>Curious in the blossoming years of her youth, she had asked the storyteller scholar for his name.</p><p></p><p>He didn't give his surname, only saying his style name was Yunlong. Smiling, he told her about his past.</p><p></p><p>He said he wasn't from Ping'an County Town.</p><p></p><p>He said he used to be a renowned scholar of their region, skilled in the bamboo craft.</p><p></p><p>He said he used to have a lover named Xiuer, just like her.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't her.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, that storyteller dejectedly left with his book trunk, departing from Ping'an.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The city.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Xiu'er didn't understand the meaning in the storyteller's words, not knowing why he said life is like a monkey climbing a tree. Now she understands. </p><p></p><p>These past few days she has seen too many butts.</p><p></p><p>Unable to sleep left or right, Xiu'er frowned, lying alone in the maid's cramped side room, recalling the scene a few days ago when Madam Wang drove her out.</p><p></p><p>She found it very strange.</p><p></p><p>Recently these past few days, she has felt the entire Wang family manor has been a bit gloomy. </p><p></p><p>Madam's expression was also very strange. She didn't do anything, but one day, Madam suddenly dismissed her and didn't allow her to attend to her anymore.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that for so many years, she was the one attending to Madam every night, never making any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>That's right, also a few nights ago, she couldn't stand it anymore and secretly went to Madam's room, wanting to plead with Madam to let her return.</p><p></p><p>However, outside the door she heard Madam's whimpering sounds and the sounds of spanking.</p><p></p><p>This scared her so much that she turned and ran away immediately.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that ever since the Old Madame fell seriously ill, Madam has been sleeping separately from the head of the household, spending all day praying to the gods and Buddhas for blessings for the Old Madame, bathing and fasting.</p><p></p><p>How could there be strange sounds coming from her room?</p><p></p><p>The night deepened.</p><p></p><p>The moon hid behind the clouds.  </p><p></p><p>At this time, an intense urge to urinate welled up in Xiu'er's heart.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't hold it anymore, wanting to go to the toilet.</p><p></p><p>She could only go alone, because the other maids staying with her in the same side room now all looked down on her, viciously bullying her, as if wanting to take back all the kindness they had previously shown her with interest added on top.</p><p></p><p>She walked out of the room slowly.</p><p></p><p>The night was deathly still and quiet.</p><p></p><p>So quiet that even the sounds of insects had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The path she had to take to the toilet was a round door hole, pitch black, like a huge mouth in the darkness wanting to choose someone to devour.</p><p></p><p>She always felt something was hiding in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Even during these past few days when bathing together with the other maids, she always felt someone was peeking, but when she turned around she couldn't find anyone.</p><p></p><p>Ai.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't hold it anymore.</p><p></p><p>In the end, her sense of shame overcame her fear, and Xiu'er plucked up her courage to run towards the direction of the round door hole.</p><p></p><p>Running fast, so she wouldn't be so scared.</p><p></p><p>This was what her late mother told her when she was little.</p><p></p><p>Oh right.</p><p></p><p>Her mother was also a maid.</p><p></p><p>However, the previously infallible method failed her today.</p><p></p><p>When Xiu'er ran halfway, just about to reach the area with light.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Her legs were like sinking into a marsh, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>All the hairs on her body instantly stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was extremely frightened, as if an extremely deep and gloomy shadow had enveloped her.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an oily, cold, shadowy tongue-like thing suddenly appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>Wet and sticky.</p><p></p><p>Extremely disgusting.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, it seemed a pair of shadowy tentacles also stretched out.</p><p></p><p>Slowly untying her waistband.</p><p></p><p>Her name was Xiu'er, and she was very pretty.</p><p></p><p>Was she going to die today?</p><p></p><p>She was so scared.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, just when Xiu'er felt she was about to be dragged into the abyss by the monster in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>A tall figure suddenly appeared in the light ahead.</p><p></p><p>He had a sturdy build, his powerful chest pushing up his robe.</p><p></p><p>On his back he carried a large sword.</p><p></p><p>His arms were much thicker than her waist.</p><p></p><p>The moment this powerful cultivator appeared, Xiu'er suddenly felt the marsh under her feet disappear, and she could move again.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly ran to the lit area, hands on her knees, gasping for air like a drowning fish.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as Xiu'er gasped for air, she suddenly heard the puzzled voice of the tall cultivator beside her:</p><p></p><p>"Gannie Niang, I just sensed the aura of yin ghosts appear, how did it disappear so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen turned his head to look at the gasping young girl in front of him, her hair in two buns, not too old, and extremely pretty.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, what's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"I have something I want to ask you."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not a bad person."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen said gently to Xiu'er.</p><p></p><p>"Master cultivator, my name is Xiu'er~"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Same as always, I'll thank those who voted for me every other day.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the familiar friends who consistently vote for me, like Xinghuangshou, Wofobududuorenyuan, and a few other old friends.</p><p></p><p>There are too many who voted to thank one by one, I'm really sorry.</p><p></p><p>See you all tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow I'll reveal the truth behind the haunting at the Wang family manor.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this time, a tremendous change occurred once again on Yichen's character panel. </p><p></p><p>His maximum lifespan increased to 107 years, a full ten years more than before.</p><p></p><p>His strength attribute rose from the previously upgraded 33 to 45, topping the four dimensions and surpassing the others. Although not as high as strength, his stamina, spirit, and agility attributes all made significant progress as well.  </p><p></p><p>Just as Yichen had predicted, the seventh layer of the Small Pure Yang Skill gave him a new active skill - Soul Ignition.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing burns hotter than combustion itself, igniting one's own potential, burning lifespan in exchange for power. Currently, igniting one year of life will increase strength and inner energy by fifty percent, up to a maximum of a fivefold increase in overall power."</p><p></p><p>Yichen read the small words on the light screen panel word by word, gaining some understanding of the active skill from the seventh layer of his Small Pure Yang Skill.  </p><p></p><p>However, he did not intend to try out the power of Soul Ignition actively for now, waiting to see which lucky person would have the chance to witness his combustion.</p><p></p><p>"With it having become this demonic form, it's no longer appropriate to call it the Small Pure Yang Skill. I might as well call it the Pure Yang True Skill."</p><p></p><p>Yichen looked at the words "Small Pure Yang Skill" on the light screen, and with a thought, those words slowly faded while the symbol for "Pure Yang True Skill" slowly appeared and stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the words "Pure Yang True Skill" for the seventh layer on the light screen, Yichen's thoughts lightly tapped on the plus sign behind it, and immediately a line of small words appeared at the very bottom of his retina's display.</p><p></p><p>[Current Deep Red value insufficient at less than 600, cannot be upgraded.]</p><p></p><p>Yichen couldn't help but gasp in shock at this sight.</p><p></p><p>Damn, the price has directly increased sixfold?</p><p></p><p>Accumulating just one hundred Deep Red value had already cost him dearly, even provoking some unknown powerful demonic force's master.</p><p></p><p>To accumulate six hundred, he would have to kill twenty corpse ghosts, mist ghosts, or mud-dragging ghosts of that level.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't afford to provoke that, no way.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, big dad, can't you invite some friends to lend a hand? This is too expensive," Yichen inwardly complained to the light screen display on his retina.</p><p></p><p>Yet the cheat code didn't budge, not making a sound.</p><p></p><p>With no choice, he could only close the light screen.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try out the quality of the seventh layer Pure Yang True Skill." Yichen's expression shifted, recalling that the seventh layer Pure Yang True Skill had gained the new qualities of Regaining Breath and Ignition, his curiosity instantly piqued.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hold back, a streak of deep purple pure yang inner energy appearing at his fingertip. He lightly drew it across the rosewood table on the balcony, and the solid table surface was cut through as if by an oxyacetylene torch, a triangular slice falling onto the balcony floor.</p><p></p><p>The cut surface was pitch black, with faint blue flames still flickering, undoubtedly the ignition effect brought about by the deep purple pure yang inner energy.</p><p></p><p>Yichen was extremely satisfied by what he saw.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh layer Pure Yang True Skill is indeed impressive."</p><p></p><p>"This bone-rotting ignition effect is simply a demonic nightmare."</p><p></p><p>"Even if used for killing, arson, destroying corpses - it would be extremely effective."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, how did I end up having such thoughts? Forgive me, Fusheng Wuliang Heavenly Venerable, I'm sinful, sinful."</p><p></p><p>"Scratch that, pretend I didn't say it."</p><p></p><p>Yichen flicked his finger, shooting a streak of deep purple pure yang inner energy directly at the triangular slice, instantly igniting and reducing it to ash.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the charred remains, ground them to pieces underfoot, and only then left the balcony to return inside.</p><p></p><p>One's courage stems from one's strength.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his previously fatigued appearance after the upgrade, now the weariness had completely vanished from his face, leaving only a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head, gazing through the carved wooden window into the depths of the night sky, his eyes deep like a still lake, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he finally came to and shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Excessive thinking is pointless."</p><p></p><p>"I should sleep instead." </p><p></p><p>"Striving to increase my own strength is the proper way."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Yichen threw himself onto the bed and fell into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, the rooster's crow heralded the dawn.</p><p></p><p>Cock-a-doodle-doo~ (Voice actor wanted)</p><p></p><p>Yichen rose with the rooster's call. After washing up and straightening his clothes, he checked himself out from multiple angles in the bronze mirror in the room.</p><p></p><p>The image of a handsome young Taoist priest with chiseled features and a sunny disposition emerged.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but strike several poses in front of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk."</p><p></p><p>"With these pecs, this back, these biceps, in my past life I would have driven countless beauties wild with desire."  </p><p></p><p>"Powerful yet not bulky, truly the ideal physique."</p><p></p><p>Since breaking through last night,</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yichen's physical body was further tempered. His muscular bulk appeared to have shrunk a bit compared to before, but in reality, both his strength and defense had increased significantly. </p><p></p><p>Nowadays, his body density was extremely high. With a height close to two meters in his normal state, he weighed over five or six hundred pounds. The toughness of his body far exceeded ordinary people's imagination.</p><p></p><p>Truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>After resting overnight, Yichen's spirit had fully recovered. He was energetic, and his deep purple pure yang inner energy had also recovered to its original state, permeating his body.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go out and meet a few 'partners'."</p><p></p><p>As the largest and most luxurious inn in Fengxun County, the Ping'an Inn naturally combined accommodation and dining.</p><p></p><p>On the second floor in a private room, Yichen sat with Master Shuiyue, Daoist Qingxu, and Monk Lianhua around a square table.</p><p></p><p>Although the three were surprised by the changes in Yichen's appearance, they tactfully did not ask about it, leaving the excuse Yichen had prepared unspoken, which made him feel quite regretful inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Unlike his energetic spirit, Master Shuiyue and the other two seemed to have worried expressions on their faces, appearing not to have rested very well.</p><p></p><p>Among the four, Monk Lianhua spoke first.</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone have a good way to deal with the mysterious master mentioned by that demonic creature?"</p><p></p><p>Upon these words, everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After all, there is a saying that while one can be a thief for a thousand days, one cannot guard against thieves for a thousand days.</p><p></p><p>Monk Lianhua sighed and said helplessly, "It seems we can only take it one step at a time for now. After I return, I will send a letter to the Yuanlun Temple in the prefecture city to ask if they have any information. If they do, I will send someone to notify you all."</p><p></p><p>"In the current situation, we must watch out for and help each other. We cannot trip each other up."</p><p></p><p>When saying this, Monk Lianhua paused meaningfully on Daoist Qingxu's face before looking towards Yichen.</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, the four agreed to share information and help each other.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had killed subordinates of that mysterious master, who knows if that master held a grudge?</p><p></p><p>Watching out for and helping each other was in everyone's interest.</p><p></p><p>At least they needed to share intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Worldly matters are often like this: when there is an external enemy, everyone bands together; when there is no external enemy, everyone has their own thoughts. This is not surprising.</p><p></p><p>Under the threat of that mysterious master, the four quickly reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>Mobilize all potential forces to find information about the mysterious master.</p><p></p><p>Was he just passing through or planning to take root in Fengxun County?</p><p></p><p>Would he cause trouble for them?</p><p></p><p>Would he continue his criminal activities?</p><p></p><p>Was the annihilation of the Wang family a temporary whim or did he have some unspeakable purpose?</p><p></p><p>Fengxun County belonged to everyone. If it was truly disturbed by that demonic creature to the point of devastation and the people could not live in peace, no one would benefit. Therefore, while believing in the wisdom of the Zhen'an Magistrate, they could not remain completely inactive and had to take action.</p><p></p><p>"Then there is a second matter." Monk Lianhua cleared his throat and continued, "The County Master has sent three thousand taels of silver notes."</p><p></p><p>"For eliminating the demonic creature that massacred the entire Wang family, Daoist Yicheng has made great contributions and will receive one thousand five hundred taels. The three of us will each receive five hundred taels. What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement. After Master Shuiyue and Monk Lianhua left in a hurry, Yichen and Daoist Qingxu remained in the private room, and the atmosphere became somewhat oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu was silent for a moment, breaking the stillness. He pushed the five hundred taels of silver notes in front of him towards Yichen.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>"An apology, a request for peace."</p><p></p><p>"Fengxun County is not too big, but not too small either, enough to accommodate both the Yinlong Monastery and my Zhenzhen Monastery."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoists have long admired Daoist Baiyunzi's character. My Zhenzhen Monastery has no intention of being enemies with the Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu was quite straightforward, directly stating his intentions. They were all thousand-year-old foxes, why play word games from Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio? Being evasive would only make people dislike him.</p><p></p><p>If one must lower one's head, one should do so with a proper attitude. Being evasive would only cause resentment.</p><p></p><p>That morning, when he saw Yichen's figure, he felt an overwhelming sense of pressure. With his keen senses, Daoist Qingxu sensed that Yichen might have had another breakthrough, so he took the opportunity when Master Shuiyue and Monk Lianhua left to directly request peace.</p><p></p><p>He acted very decisively!</p><p></p><p>Yichen looked at the silver notes in front of him and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough."</p><p></p><p>"What does Daoist Yicheng mean? Surely you don't want this old monk's life?" Daoist Qingxu said in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, Daoist Qingxu, you're overthinking it. Why would I want your life?"</p><p></p><p>"What I mean is, five hundred taels is not enough."</p><p></p><p>"You need to add more money!" Yichen tilted his head, his expression resembling the legendary Eccentric Monk who always asked for more money.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Qingxu: "......"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Nine days later.</p><p></p><p>The Wang family home was draped in white mourning clothes. </p><p></p><p>Amidst sorrowful wailing, everyone respectfully sent off the elderly Madame Wang to be buried in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's superb skills in presiding over funerals naturally won praise from the mourners in attendance. </p><p></p><p>It was deemed an art!</p><p></p><p>Not long after the Five Elemental Demon's demise that day, the elderly Madame Wang unfortunately passed away.</p><p></p><p>It turned out her improved condition that day was just a fleeting rally before death.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Yi Chen still completed this funeral presiding job.</p><p></p><p>"You've worked hard these past few days, Daoist Master," said Madame Wang, dressed in white mourning clothes. She bowed deeply to Yi Chen, her eye sockets red.</p><p></p><p>The old saying goes well - to look pretty, one must mourn properly. </p><p></p><p>Already extremely beautiful, Madame Wang now appeared even more gracefully alluring, her slim waist bound by a simple white sash, white flowers adorning her hair. As she bowed with lowered hem, her breathtaking figure was revealed.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, being too good-looking is both a blessing and a curse.</p><p></p><p>She clapped her hands, and the graceful maid Xiu'er walked over and handed Yi Chen an envelope.</p><p></p><p>After the Five Elemental Demon incident concluded, Xiu'er resumed her role as Madame Wang's personal maidservant, her demeanor now more composed after the ordeal.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the envelope, Yi Chen squeezed it and showed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, three banknotes of one thousand taels of silver each.</p><p></p><p>He unhesitatingly pocketed his earnings. This penniless monk has lived by the path of benevolence and righteousness, accumulating virtue through good deeds. This payment is deserved.</p><p></p><p>On that day, the Five Elemental Demon tried to retaliate before dying. Had Yi Chen not been quick, it could have revealed that final word, and things would have become disastrous.</p><p></p><p>Some things are better left uncovered, allowing one to just get by.</p><p></p><p>Once uncovered, there is no turning back.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what happens to Madame Wang and her husband later, at least in public, Yi Chen preserved her final dignity.</p><p></p><p>"The Madame is too kind," said Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>"With this matter settled, this penniless monk shall take his leave."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wang family patriarch happened to walk in.</p><p></p><p>"It's already late in the day. The night road is difficult to travel. Why doesn't the Daoist Master stay another night and leave tomorrow morning instead?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen considered it, but ultimately declined.</p><p></p><p>He expected Madame Wang and her husband would have much to discuss tonight, so it was inappropriate for him to stay.</p><p></p><p>However, the patriarch made a fair point about the night road being unsafe.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Wang manor, Yi Chen decided to rent a room at an inn in town to stay the night before returning home tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>This past week, he had been busy either presiding over Madame Wang's funeral or secluded in his room studying the Thunder-Subduing Jade. Even with his superhuman physique and willpower, he felt somewhat fatigued.</p><p></p><p>"One is not a machine after all, and should relax a bit," he thought.</p><p></p><p>Soon after purchasing casual clothes at a clothing store, Yi Chen left the inn he was staying at.</p><p></p><p>He had removed his Daoist robe and now dressed like a dashing wandering martial artist. Turning a corner, he entered Ping'an County's largest matchmaking institution - the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>What better way to relieve worries than to enjoy music and beauties?</p><p></p><p>His Hidden Dragon Monastery didn't prohibit marriage anyway, so what was wrong with visiting the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion to broaden his experience?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had taken off his Daoist robe, so he wasn't Master Yi Chengzi anymore.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Yi Chen swaggered in and boldly requested eight courtesans at once.</p><p></p><p>Plump or slender, peach or willow - each excelled in her own way.</p><p></p><p>Some massaged his arms, others peeled grapes for him, poured wine - all busily attending to him.</p><p></p><p>"Good sir, you haven't told us your prestigious surname and name," said a foxy-faced courtesan, feeding Yi Chen a peeled grape.</p><p></p><p>"Remember this - my nickname is Celestial Kite," Yi Chen laughed heartily before swallowing the grape from her hand.</p><p></p><p>After a bout of feasting and revelry, he smiled and slipped eight banknotes of twenty taels each into the courtesans' undergarments. He then dismissed them all, not wanting any further disturbances.</p><p></p><p>The clamor of the pavilion and sounds of music entered his ears. Though lively surroundings, Yi Chen's heart felt utterly solitary.</p><p></p><p>He was different from others now.</p><p></p><p>Those courtesans used all their strength trying to massage his arms, but couldn't budge his rock-hard muscles. He feared if they continued, they might injure their jaw muscles.</p><p></p><p>His entire body was extremely dense with muscle, weighing some six or seven hundred pounds. If he really exerted himself, the combined weight of those eight courtesans might not even match his.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, despite their pretty faces, their charm was mostly artificial makeup. Scrutinizing closely, he could even see powder caked in their pores. He simply couldn't bring himself to be intimate with them, unlike true natural beauties like Madame Wang.</p><p></p><p>Dammit Yi Chengzi, how could you think that way?</p><p></p><p>Well, maybe Master Shui Yue was an exception too.</p><p></p><p>The graceful image of a beauty suddenly surfaced in Yi Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Yi Chen felt he was being too vulgar, so he decided to punish himself with another cup of wine before forgiving himself.</p><p></p><p>After all...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Tonight, Fantine was lost in confused thoughts, why should he care about Guanyi Chengzi Daolang? </p><p></p><p>Listening to the clamor, fist-pounding, cheering and urging to drink around him, Yi Chen leaned against the carved red wooden chair, gently patting the armrest, and began to sing softly.</p><p></p><p>"The east is not bright, the west is bright ah, the remaining sun has dried my worries."  </p><p></p><p>"Last night was not busy, tonight is busy ah, after dreaming of gold, I dream of splendor."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I fall into the human realm yet remain at ease, originally a transcendent immortal from heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Not scattering a thing for the mundane dust, only moved by beautiful wine."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Yi Chen suddenly recalled the "Immortal Child" by the previous life's Second-Hand Rose, and sang it out upon recalling it. </p><p></p><p>"How boring."</p><p></p><p>After singing the song, Yi Chen gave a disdainful laugh, paid the bill and left.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding voices were noisy and lively, but he could no longer blend into the ordinary human world.</p><p></p><p>He had truly become different.</p><p></p><p>The light of life of ordinary people seemed as fragile as a candle in the wind in his eyes, a casual wave of his hand could extinguish...a large swath of them.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with ordinary people, he had to be extremely cautious, afraid that one careless move might kill them.</p><p></p><p>The wine, wealth and beauties that used to help pass time had become increasingly bland and uninteresting to him now.</p><p></p><p>The mundane world was no longer his playground. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to pursue a higher, more brilliant world.</p><p></p><p>He craved the kind of life-or-death, desperate struggle, that vivid feeling of being alive, of his soul elevating.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his last drink, feeling out of place with his surroundings, Yi Chen decided to return to the inn. At this time, a girl blocked his path.</p><p></p><p>It was Xiao Huan, the long-haired girl who had peeled grapes for him earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Fantine, will you stay tonight?"</p><p></p><p>"I like you."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Huan's little face was flushed red, clearly having mustered her courage.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gave a disdainful laugh.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a wandering hero, here today and gone tomorrow. The silver I had on me is all spent, so I'll have to disappoint you, miss."</p><p></p><p>"I won't take your money."</p><p></p><p>Miss Xiao Huan was very persistent, seemingly quite infatuated with Yi Chen's current demeanor.</p><p></p><p>She liked this contradictory, burly yet mysterious man.</p><p></p><p>Earlier she had secretly watched him for a long time. He had an aura of loneliness vastly different from his surroundings, a loneliness that penetrated to the bone.</p><p></p><p>A strange aura that was both calm and frenzied.</p><p></p><p>In any case, very captivating.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't I return the money from earlier?" Miss Xiao Huan persisted stubbornly.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......"</p><p></p><p>Although a bit speechless, Yi Chen felt a bit of secret pleasure in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, patted Xiao Huan's cheek, took a chopstick from the table, broke it, and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Since we've met, it must be fate. If you wish to change your path in life, miss, take this broken chopstick and go to the Zhen'an Magistrate to find a man named Lin Zhengyi, or go to Fengyang County and find the Chief Constable Sun. Just say you're an old acquaintance of Yinlong Guan, and they will make arrangements for you."</p><p></p><p>"Believe me, you will achieve your heart's desire. Even the big boss behind Tianxiang Pavilion would not disrespect my face as Fantine."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gave a hearty laugh and suddenly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Xiao Huan holding the broken chopstick, dazed like a wooden chicken.</p><p></p><p>If not for the broken chopstick in her hand, it would be as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>The current Yi Chen already had the qualifications to casually change an ordinary person's fate with just a word.</p><p></p><p>For such a small matter, no one in the entire Ping'an Prefecture would disregard his will.</p><p></p><p>Because he had fists!</p><p></p><p>Standing on the inn's balcony, Yi Chen clenched his fist, stretched out his hand to greet the moonlight, and grinned.</p><p></p><p>After these nine days of arduous cultivation whenever he could snatch the time, relying on an inhuman perseverance, he had accumulated a full four origin points.</p><p></p><p>The big event was finally coming.</p><p></p><p>What changes would reaching the 50th level of the Great Expansion Numbers and the 49th level of application in strength bring him? Yi Chen was very much looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was watching the moonlight, preparing to level up, the night sky suddenly changed drastically, with countless blood-red meteors slashing across the heavens and crashing towards the earth.</p><p></p><p>The moon instantly turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>The moment this blood red appeared, Yi Chen's hair immediately stood on end, and he instantly sensed an extremely profound malice suddenly manifesting in heaven and earth - a concentrated malice he had never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this malice, even the Underworld seemed minor.</p><p></p><p>This malice came quickly and left quickly, soon disappearing from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"An anomaly in heaven and earth, what lies ahead?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yi Chen couldn't help but furrow his brow as he recalled the opening line from Elder Daoshi's letter: "Heaven and earth are in turmoil, what lies ahead?"</p><p></p><p>That's it for today, I'll thank those who voted tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Thanks everyone for following, see you all tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>P.S. The good show has just begun, friends.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Under the same moonlight, in different regions.</p><p></p><p>While Yi Chen was gazing at the distant moonlight on this side, a few small changes were happening at the same time in the Wang mansion of Fengcun City. </p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu was the servant guard of the Wang mansion in Fengcun City. He was originally from a declining family in Li Family Village of Gunshi Town. His mother passed away when he was three years old, and his father was killed by a wild boar while hunting in the mountains when he was thirteen.</p><p></p><p>This made the already impoverished family fall into even deeper poverty.  </p><p></p><p>The family was so poor that even rats wouldn't come, and if a thief broke in, they would have to wipe away tears of bitterness before leaving two copper coins, portraying the utmost destitution.</p><p></p><p>Li Dazhu, who had received three years of private tutoring and was somewhat literate, looked at his dilapidated home. Finally, one starry night, as he watched a gray rat leave his doorstep without even looking back, the grievances he had accumulated could no longer be contained, and they burst forth.</p><p></p><p>He made a decision that went against his ancestors' wishes.</p><p></p><p>To sell himself! To sell himself to the wealthy Wang family in the county town and take their surname.</p><p></p><p>Although his father had grasped his hand on his deathbed, his tiger-like eyes filled with tears, hoping that he would carry on the family lineage, this family had become so impoverished that even rats had moved out. He could no longer bear it.</p><p></p><p>The saying goes, "Poverty doesn't last more than three generations." The Li family had reached the third generation with him, so what family lineage was there left to carry on?</p><p></p><p>When poor, change; when changing, make progress.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the clan scolded him for seeking pleasure and disregarding the family's heritage, calling him a dog for others.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, a bunch of old coffins and pots. What's wrong with being a dog for a wealthy and noble family?" he thought.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his basic literacy, among those who sold themselves, those with a similar level of education didn't have as strong a physique as him, and those with better physiques didn't have as high an education level as him. He might not even have qualified to be their dog.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu touched the dark blue brocade robe on his body and revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>After ten years of hard work, the former muddy-legged boy from Li Family Village had now become the head servant guard of the Wang mansion in Fengcun County. If he didn't become a servant for others, he would never have been able to wear this dark blue brocade robe in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>He touched the sword at his waist, and a feeling of regret welled up within him. Relying on his naturally strong physique, he had diligently studied and practiced for ten years, finally achieving mastery of the Iron Cloth Shirt martial art taught to the servants of the Wang family three months ago.</p><p></p><p>Two months earlier, the master had returned from Treasure Street with a grim expression, carrying a wild chicken in his hand. He later learned that the master had been tricked by a young Taoist priest into buying a fighting rooster for one hundred taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu pursed his lips, his large hand resting on his sword hilt, lamenting the missed opportunity in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If only he had been there at the time, he could have stopped that Taoist priest and helped the master save face. Wouldn't he have been rewarded then?</p><p></p><p>He wanted to advance too much.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to stand out too much.</p><p></p><p>He wanted money too much.</p><p></p><p>He wanted Little Peach Red from the Lanshao Pavilion too much.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about Little Peach Red made the 24-year-old Wang Dazhu's heart flutter.</p><p></p><p>Her skin was so white, like tofu pudding, and she was skilled in all the arts of singing, dancing, and playing instruments. Even he, who had mastered the Iron Cloth Shirt, admitted he couldn't resist her charms. But there was no helping it, as it was well known that the Iron Cloth Shirt had its limits.</p><p></p><p>There were some areas it couldn't train, some restrictions. He couldn't be blamed for that.</p><p></p><p>"Those two and a half unforgettable minutes were truly remarkable," Wang Dazhu said, gazing at the round moon, his thoughts already drifting to the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The only pity was that while Little Peach Red was perfect in every way, she was too expensive. His two months' salary could only afford one visit with her.</p><p></p><p>But this wasn't Little Peach Red's problem; it was his problem.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Wang Dazhu couldn't help but glance at the two subordinates behind him, Wang Seven and Wang Eight.</p><p></p><p>It was those two fools who had accompanied the master that day and were intimidated by the Taoist priest's aura, not daring to intervene. They were truly idiots.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity was right in front of them, but they failed to seize it.</p><p></p><p>Not being able to win is one thing, but not daring to take action is another â€“ it's an attitude problem. They didn't even understand how to be a proper servant.</p><p></p><p>If servants don't use their brains, they'll remain at the bottom level forever.</p><p></p><p>He, Wang Dazhu, was different. His mind was flexible, and so were his bottom lines. Part of the land in Li Family Village of Gunshi Town was the property of the Wang family. One year, when the harvest was poor...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The heavens were unkind, and the harvest was poor. </p><p></p><p>It was Wang Dazhu who took the lead, brutally breaking the limbs of the old clan leader, before finally collecting the grain.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed the Lord Wang to see his capabilities - courageous in carrying out tasks, ruthless and vicious. He was the talent the Wang manor needed, so he was promoted to become a small leader, with his monthly salary also increased to two taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>As Wang Dazhu was patrolling aimlessly around the Wang manor with his men, a shadowy figure under the willow tree suddenly caught his attention. </p><p></p><p>"What is that thing? Who's hiding there? Come out now!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu gripped the sword at his waist and shouted loudly. His tall stature and furious bulging eyes gave him an imposing manner.</p><p></p><p>The Wang family was wealthy and powerful, known to everyone in Fengyun County. Naturally, this also attracted those self-styled chivalrous men to come and steal.</p><p></p><p>This was also an important reason why Lord Wang kept these servant guards and hired people to train them in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying Wang Dazhu's angry shout, the shadowy figure under the willow tree suddenly froze, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>It was now late autumn, and the willow leaves had turned from emerald green to withered yellow, like an elderly person entering their twilight years, looking desolate and weathered.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone down, casting patches of mottled light and shadows under the willow tree, but due to the backlighting, there was more darkness, making it hard to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Stop playing tricks, come out now or I'll chop you to death." Wang Dazhu mustered his courage, holding up a lantern as he walked towards the willow tree.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the young Miss of the Wang family liking willow trees, and Lord Wang being a daughter's pet, this willow tree would have been chopped down long ago, eliminating such a security loophole.</p><p></p><p>Planting trees outside the courtyard wall, what a brilliant idea.</p><p></p><p>But the young Miss is really beautiful and buxom.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu drew his sword from his waist and slowly approached the willow tree, with his subordinates Wang Seven and Wang Eight following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that something strange happened.</p><p></p><p>One or two palm-sized shadows suddenly darted towards Wang Dazhu and the other two.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu twisted his waist and swung his arm, slashing!</p><p></p><p>A sword gleam as straight as a whip flashed in the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, those black shadows stopped, severed into two pieces.</p><p></p><p>Wang Seven and Wang Eight brought their lanterns forward to take a look, and it turned out to be a large rat, now decapitated by the sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The three of them finally heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a false alarm. When they heard the strange movement earlier, Wang Dazhu thought there might be a powerful person hiding behind the willow tree.</p><p></p><p>"Boss is formidable, that strike was fast, fierce and precise, truly marvelous. The future position of head instructor of the manor will definitely belong to the boss. If there is a selection for head instructor, I will definitely vote for the boss," said Wang Seven, immediately flattering him profusely upon witnessing this.</p><p></p><p>As a servant guard, choosing sides was also very important. One must always remember to show loyalty, as choosing the right side was sometimes far more important than ability.</p><p></p><p>Wang Eight quickly followed suit, "I'm the same."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Seven clenched and unclenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Good, keep working hard with me, and you'll naturally get your rewards in the future," said Wang Dazhu, basically satisfied with the performance of his two subordinates, immediately promising them great prospects like Lord Wang.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu sheathed his sword, about to say a few more words.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, a gust of eerie wind suddenly blew, extinguishing the lanterns in their hands.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone on their faces, making them deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know when it had started, but a thin mist had risen on the road around the manor where they were patrolling.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the road, a human-shaped shadow appeared.</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at each other, a chill involuntarily rising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu took out a fire striker and quickly relit the lantern in his hand. The light from the lantern made them feel slightly more at ease.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

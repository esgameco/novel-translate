        <h1>Chapter 114</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Meow, whatever you're feeling gloomy about will only end up harming you." </p><p></p><p>"How are you going to become the guardian beast of my Hidden Dragon Temple in this state?"</p><p></p><p>"At your age, how can you be gloomy? Perk up for me."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the little cat feeling depressed, Yi Chen ruffled its head before striding off on a new journey. </p><p></p><p>This big guy of his was definitely useless. </p><p>Couldn't do anything right, except being number one at chasing girls.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen took out the official map he had prepared earlier, plotting the route to Dragon Tiger Mountain. His large hand pointed to the location of a certain town on the map.</p><p></p><p>"Ready, little cat?"</p><p></p><p>"Our next stop is Wujiang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"I heard the little wild cats in Wujiang Prefecture are even better than those in Longjiang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the cat's eyes immediately lit up, meowing happily in response to Yi Chen's words, urging him to set off quickly.</p><p></p><p>It was no longer gloomy, its scummy cat nature fully revealed.</p><p></p><p>Running rapidly along the mountain path, Yi Chen directly entered shrimp-catching mode, leaving the troubled place of Longjiang Prefecture behind.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was afraid of the experts from the Yellow Springs Sect, Yin Mountain Prefecture, and Red House coming after him. The main reason was his impatient nature.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sky was gradually darkening. Yi Chen frowned and quickened his pace, hoping to find the next post station to rest before it got completely dark.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that at this moment, the Tyrant Rooster was also rushing rapidly towards Longjiang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Ever since receiving the decree from the Great Protector Yan Zhenren of the Corpse God Sect that day, the Tyrant Rooster had been traveling and playing in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Whenever it reached a human town, it would use illusion arts to change its appearance and indulge in eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>Human food was especially delicious, especially that fried noodle dish - it was its favorite.</p><p></p><p>"However, I've delayed for too long and can't procrastinate anymore."</p><p></p><p>"One last time, I'll only stay in Longjiang Prefecture for a day before heading straight to Fengyun County."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if I delay too much, the Great Protector will get angry."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Rooster smacked its lips, savoring the delicious taste of human fried noodles, before quickening its pace. It only hoped it could reach Longjiang Prefecture that night to rest and eat and drink well.</p><p></p><p>If Longjiang Prefecture also had fried noodles, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>The mountain path was difficult to traverse. Before long, the moon had risen above the treetops.</p><p></p><p>On the narrow mountain path, two tall figures unexpectedly encountered each other.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was stunned for a moment, seeing a large hooded black figure striding quickly towards him.</p><p></p><p>This person was a few inches taller than him, extremely tall and imposing. Their face was completely shrouded in the hood, looking rather mysterious.</p><p></p><p>The path was too narrow for two people to pass side by side, so one person had to move aside. Yi Chen frowned as he walked forward, until the two were only about three meters apart before they both stopped.</p><p></p><p>Neither was willing to give way to the other.</p><p></p><p>"Cow nose, get out of the way!"</p><p></p><p>"Good dog doesn't block the road. I'm in a good mood today and don't want to kill anyone!"</p><p></p><p>A harsh, cracked voice came from the tall hooded black figure, the tone extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen finally saw the true appearance of the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Although this person had used illusion arts to change their appearance, in Yi Chen's mind's eye, their true form was as clear as a pattern on the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious person was actually a chicken-headed human body.</p><p></p><p>Red beak, black feathers, a green fleshy crest on the top of the head, two white lines winding down from the shoulders to the waist. The entire body was knotted with bulging muscles, each muscle lump swollen as if it had gone through its own puberty. Fists that could crush a person, arms that could outrun a horse.</p><p></p><p>"This poor monk won't give way, so what can you do about it?" Although the chicken-headed person was intimidating, Yi Chen wasn't afraid at all and didn't back down.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Protector had just cultivated the ninth level of the Pure Yang True Technique. Could he give way on this path?</p><p></p><p>If the chicken kept barking at him, he'd just kill it directly, not knowing if this chicken-headed human monster could drop a deep red spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>"If you won't give way, then be killed by this seat!"</p><p></p><p>The chicken-headed person seemed to have a very explosive temper. Hearing Yi Chen's retort, he directly threw off his hooded cloak, casually tossing it onto a tree branch by the side of the road.</p><p></p><p>He didn't bother with disguises anymore, dispelling the illusion to reveal his extremely muscular body.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the one who kills you is the Tyrant Rooster, one of the ten elite warriors of the Corpse God Sect."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You'll understand better as a ghost on the road to the underworld."</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Skill: Chicken Dominating the World - Gigantification!" </p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, the Tyrant Chicken let out a sky-piercing screech, and its body abruptly grew taller and more inflated. Its already exaggerated muscles became even more developed, with small qi spheres the size of mice surging restlessly beneath the muscles, exuding an astonishingly domineering aura.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red demonic yuan qi swirled around its body, instantly whipping up a wild wind that swept fallen leaves into a frenzy, dancing fiercely around the Tyrant Chicken in constant rotation.</p><p></p><p>"A demonic cultivator from the Corpse Demon Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"And this direction...isn't this toward my Fengyun County?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the chicken-headed man's words, Yi Chen's pupils immediately contracted to pinpricks. Regardless, he could not let this chicken monster go today.</p><p></p><p>He had to go all out!</p><p></p><p>Mimicking its actions, he directly took off his Daoist robe and tossed it onto a nearby tree branch, revealing his own extraordinarily muscular body. His powerful pectoral muscles protruded prominently against his tight inner garment as deep azure inner qi began to emanate from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Cow Nose, not bad with your body cultivation. You're quite outstanding in that regard. But it's a pity you've met me today."</p><p></p><p>"Today, this lord will let you know what true power is!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Cow Nose, tremble! This is the true strength of one of the Ten Martial Excellents of my sect."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yi Chen display his imposing aura, the chicken-headed man realized he was no ordinary person. He slapped his chest, using some unknown secret technique to further intensify his aura. His stature grew again as the demonic yuan qi whirled even more violently around his muscular frame.  </p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Tyrant Chicken's height increased from 2.4 meters, 2.5 meters, to a staggering 2.6 meters in the blink of an eye, towering over Yi Chen by more than a head.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were now blood-red and ferocious as it looked down at Yi Chen. Maintaining this state seemed to exert tremendous pressure on it. Without further hesitation, it stomped its tree trunk-thick legs heavily onto the ground, and then...</p><p></p><p>And then there was no "and then."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Chicken's pupils dilated as its expression froze, as if its throat had been seized by fate itself.</p><p></p><p>What appeared before it was the three-meter tall, towering silhouette of a mighty Daoist, even taller, more muscular, and more extraordinarily heroic than its current self!</p><p></p><p>A complete reversal!</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's presence instantly overshadowed the Tyrant Chicken by more than a head, his enormous shadow casting over the chicken in the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist's cold gaze regarded it like a chicken awaiting slaughter. His hands, enveloped in deep azure inner qi, suddenly appeared and mercilessly clamped down on its throat like the grip of fate itself.</p><p></p><p>"Little chick, what are you clucking about!"</p><p></p><p>"Cluck one more time for Lord Dao and see what happens."</p><p></p><p>"I like the look in your eyes now!"</p><p></p><p>"So weak, pitiful and helpless!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist smiled warmly as he gazed at the chicken-headed man, his eyes full of mockery.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Chicken flailed its limbs in terror, striking futilely at the Daoist's silhouette, but all its efforts were merely laughable, only serving to tickle Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't fight back, nor could it flee.</p><p></p><p>In Yi Chen's perception, the Tyrant Chicken was no more than a Zhao Shiwang, not even reaching the level of an Extreme Yin Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Boring. It's over."</p><p></p><p>"You've taken the wrong path, chicken man."</p><p></p><p>"Your muscles are all dead weight, no power!"  </p><p></p><p>"Your purity is beneath mine~"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's cold voice rang out, like a chilling wind from the depths of the underworld.</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the Tyrant Chicken's neck went limp, and Yi Chen's overbearing deep azure inner qi instantly ignited its body.</p><p></p><p>Under the power of his Yang Spiritual Soul, former adversaries like the Tyrant Chicken that could previously exchange some moves with Yi Chen were now as easy to kill as chickens.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Yi Chen had grown far beyond his master Bai Yunzi, truly becoming a powerful Zhenren Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, a hooded Daoist continued on his way.</p><p></p><p>He would thank everyone for their votes over the past two days tomorrow. For now, he was going to take a shower and sleep.</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for your votes and subscriptions.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

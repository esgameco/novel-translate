        <h1>Chapter 118</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Following the winding sheep intestine path along the mountain ridge downwards, Yi Chen rushed urgently, once again feeling like he was chasing shrimp. Little Meow tightly gripped Yi Chen's collar, his little face filled with an excited look of hurry up. </p><p></p><p>"Meow, when the hell are you going to grow up quickly and carry your dad so I can run? Are those broken wings of yours just for show? Come on, spread them out."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen complained wordlessly.</p><p></p><p>Tired, so tired.</p><p></p><p>Little Meow just pretended not to understand, meowing and rubbing his little face against Yi Chen's cheeks affectionately. </p><p></p><p>Soon, Yi Chen arrived at a place not far from Yaoguan Ferry in the mountain valley.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, a few hundred meters away, the raging Wujiang River rushed forward.</p><p></p><p>Under the glow of the sunset, it had quite a romantic quality.</p><p></p><p>"The turbulent Wujiang is all water, the waves washing away heroes~"</p><p></p><p>Turning to look at the gushing Wujiang River, Yi Chen couldn't help but get poetic, chanting lines as Little Meow meowed and cuddled his stinky feet.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was about to stride towards Yaoguan Ferry, suddenly his mind's eye gave a warning, a surging malicious intent like a tidal wave rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, Meow, you're screwed."  </p><p></p><p>"There's a problem with this town." Yi Chen's startled and angry voice came.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a thick fog suddenly erupted from the center of the ancient town called Yaoguan Ferry, spreading outwards in four directions at a speed Yi Chen couldn't react to.</p><p></p><p>Although Yi Chen reacted very quickly, running away, he was still instantly enveloped by the fog halfway up the mountain in the blink of an eye. The fog blocked out the sky, like a huge mushroom cloud directly covering the entire mountain valley.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yi Chen and Little Meow stared at each other in shock.</p><p></p><p>The little thing still wanted to act cute to get by, but Yi Chen slapped him on the head.</p><p></p><p>"You unfilial son~" Yi Chen grieved.</p><p></p><p>This fog was unknown, and had an extremely powerful suppressive effect on spiritual perception. Yi Chen tried to use his mind's eye to investigate, but couldn't even release it.</p><p></p><p>He had never encountered this situation before.</p><p></p><p>"This is trouble now." Yi Chen frowned, grabbed Little Meow by the scruff of his neck and lightly slapped him again, then placed him on his shoulder, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, what should we do now?" Little Meow meowed dejectedly, as if knowing he had done something wrong.</p><p></p><p>"What to do? You really think your grandpa and I are vegetarians."</p><p></p><p>"Meow, don't be afraid, your dad still has many tricks up his sleeve. If all else fails, your dad can still fly."</p><p></p><p>"Let me try out the weight of this devilry first."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen couldn't help but reveal a vicious grin on his face.</p><p></p><p>What kind of mutt dares to mess with the Lord Dao's porcelain?</p><p></p><p>He struck out a deep blue burst of qi towards the fog, but it had no effect at all, the fog was completely unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Got something here."</p><p></p><p>"Let's scram."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen took off with one foot, taking Little Meow up into the air.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how high he flew, the fog above seemed like an endless maze, and he couldn't fly out of it.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen's expression turned cold as he slowly descended to the ground, glaring at the distant ancient town, his pupils narrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was no ordinary ancient town anymore, he had to take it seriously!</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, apart from some extremely powerful formations capable of such an anomaly, the only other possibility was an uncanny event caused by a blood-colored meteor.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yi Chen immediately thought of Yangjia Village.</p><p></p><p>He thought of that poor girl named Yang Yufeng.</p><p></p><p>If he had a choice, he really didn't want to get caught up in another bizarre incident like this.</p><p></p><p>Although his current strength was worlds apart from back at Yangjia Village, this place called Yaoguan Ferry also seemed far more formidable than Yangjia Village.</p><p></p><p>This strange fog was simply unheard of.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique, break through for me!" Yi Chen inwardly shouted, directly trying to upgrade his Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique.</p><p></p><p>He admitted he was gambling, but if Chen Daoze could win 37 million from just 20 yuan back then, why couldn't he gamble that the next level of the Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique would enhance his mind's eye projection ability?</p><p></p><p>It was even possible for new abilities to dispel delusions and remove bewitchment to appear.</p><p></p><p>One minute later, Yi Chen strode into the ancient town of Yaoguan Ferry with a dark expression.</p><p></p><p>A line of small text appeared on his retina:</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique Fifth Layer (Traits: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, Yin Qi Perception, Mind's Eye Projection Lv1, Malicious Intent Perception Lv1, Soul Extinguishing Lv1)]</p><p></p><p>The so-called Soul Extinguishing allowed him to actively unleash a transparent beam from his eyes to attack a person's soul.</p><p></p><p>The effect sounded daunting, but when Yi Chen sensed it, the damage to him was...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The enemies encountered this time, it can't be said they are of no use at all, it can only be said they are completely useless...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps I could glare them to death like that king of wild boars we fought on Falling Dragon Mountain before? </p><p></p><p>That thing requiring 100 deep red points is really not worth it.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yin-Yang Pupil Technique at the next level is worth looking forward to, needing 500 deep red points to break through the boundary.</p><p></p><p>"Since you won't let this poor monk pass, then this poor monk will play with you for a bit."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid you can't play at this level, kid!"</p><p></p><p>Flying again didn't work, adding points didn't get the right bet either.</p><p></p><p>With a blackened face after losing all 17 cards in a second, Daoist Yi took a step forward, passing through the card gate. In a moment, a tall Daoist walked into the ancient town.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, Yi Chen's entire face tightened with a frown. </p><p></p><p>He saw that inside the ancient town, a gloomy, damp and cold aura pervaded. There were hardly any people on the streets, and it seemed that upon seeing an outsider enter, the windows of several houses in the surrounding residences were pushed open a crack, revealing a line of either numb or grimly amused sinister smiling faces hiding behind them.</p><p></p><p>These people all had one thing in common - their eyes were as red as rabbits', as if they hadn't slept for ten days or half a month. Their expressions were desperate and slightly crazed, as if their minds had already reached the brink of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was about to approach and ask for some information, one by one the people slammed their windows shut in panic, seeming to be quite afraid of Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Only an old man with white hair tremblingly opened his door, and said to him with some regret: "Young Daoist, you outsiders have bad luck. You've mistakenly entered our Yao Guan Du at this time. Remember, don't sleep, you absolutely cannot sleep."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the Old Patriarch will kill you."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, if you sleep you'll die, if you don't sleep you can survive a few more days."</p><p></p><p>After the white-haired elder finished speaking, he was about to close the door, but Yi Chen grabbed it with one hand.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then took out a silver ingot worth twenty taels and placed it in the old man's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Old Sir, you said there were outsiders here before me? Where are they now?"</p><p></p><p>"And who is this Old Patriarch? Will one really die by falling asleep?" Yi Chen asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the silver ingot Yi Chen handed over, the white-haired elder shook his head and sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist, no one who has entered Yao Guan Du has ever left alive. There have been outsiders who came during this period, but none of them left. Among them were even highly respected cultivators, but they were also killed by the Old Patriarch."  </p><p></p><p>"Silver is useless in Yao Guan Du. Do whatever you want, Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to find those outsiders, Daoist, go to the big mansion at the center of the town with a small stone lion in front. That's the home of the wealthy Guan family, but all the family members have died. The outsiders are all staying there now."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the old man pushed the silver back and firmly closed the door.</p><p></p><p>This time, Yi Chen did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>Most people in this strange town were already on the verge of collapse, and the survivors were like walking corpses, all with a tendency towards self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>"A demonic entity called the Old Patriarch that can enter dreams?"</p><p></p><p>"Killing people in dreams? Is it a curse or some kind of technique?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if my spirit-breaking supernatural ability at the ninth level can withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen smacked his lips, then headed towards the place where the old man said the outsiders had gathered.</p><p></p><p>The local townspeople were too impolite to communicate with. It would be better to exchange information with the outsiders who had arrived before him.</p><p></p><p>In any case, from the white-haired elder's words, he had already obtained the key information - this was a powerful demonic entity that could enter dreams to kill people, with the ability to create a fog that could confuse and obscure human perception.</p>

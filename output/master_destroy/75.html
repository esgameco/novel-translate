        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The night before, under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>A thin girl wearing coarse linen clothes was still vigorously washing clothes with a washing bat. </p><p></p><p>Her hands were wrinkled and whitened from being soaked in the water.</p><p></p><p>Her name was Yang Yufan, the eldest daughter of the lord of Yang Family Fortress.</p><p></p><p>Why did she, the eldest daughter of the lord of Yang Family Fortress, end up in such a state? Naturally, it was because she had a wicked stepmother.</p><p></p><p>For a child whose mother died early, having a vicious stepmother was miserable. </p><p></p><p>Even more miserable was that the stepmother later gave birth to a son.</p><p></p><p>The two factors combined would be the fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>Ever since she could remember, she had never had a decent meal.</p><p></p><p>Taro for breakfast, potatoes for lunch, and potatoes again for dinner.</p><p></p><p>Such meals would make even dogs shake their heads, yet it was her daily routine for all three meals.</p><p></p><p>As the young lady of the fortress, she lived worse than the servants.</p><p></p><p>Yet no one in the entire fortress dared to say a word of fairness for her. In fact, to curry favor with her stepmother, they bullied her even more relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>Simply because her stepmother was the wet nurse of a young master from the prestigious Cui family in Mingguang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Eighteen years ago, when her father went to the prefecture city on business, he caught her stepmother's eye due to his handsome looks and sturdy build. After receiving grace from the Cui family, her stepmother married her father.</p><p></p><p>Haha, it was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Two days before marrying her father, her own birth mother had drowned by accident, directly becoming the principal wife and also her stepmother.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, her misfortune descended.</p><p></p><p>Also from that day, the originally impoverished Yang Family Fortress began to take off.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to her stepmother's connection as the wet nurse of a Cui family young master, the Yang Family Fortress's ironware business flourished, getting the green light in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had a smile on their face, except her.</p><p></p><p>Because her mother was gone.</p><p></p><p>A child with a mother is like a treasure, a child without a mother is worse than weeds.</p><p></p><p>That was her.</p><p></p><p>Later, from the words of others, she learned the truth of that year and why her stepmother disliked her so much.</p><p></p><p>Her mother was not drowned by accident, but rather drowned intentionally by the Yang clan elders, in order to make room for her stepmother.</p><p></p><p>Her father was a 'filial son', weak and incapable, who had no choice but to accept the fait accompli.</p><p></p><p>Heh, she knew her father, that weak man, still had feelings for her mother in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This was also an important reason why her stepmother targeted her.</p><p></p><p>Who allowed her, as time passed, to increasingly resemble her beautiful birth mother?</p><p></p><p>Her birth itself carried original sin.</p><p></p><p>Later, her stepmother gave birth to a son for her, and the entire fortress celebrated as if it were the New Year, except for her.</p><p></p><p>As expected, after her brother was born, her life became even worse. Even her father no longer secretly looked after her, shifting most of his attention to her brother instead.</p><p></p><p>The washing bat pounded the clothes again and again, sending up a string of crystal clear water droplets. Yang Yufan looked back on the past, her eyes already blurred with tears.</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>Why did everyone in the entire Yang Family Fortress bully her?</p><p></p><p>Why did someone dare enter her room?</p><p></p><p>Why could that third young lady from the Cui family who came today be showered with endless pampering?</p><p></p><p>Why did she have to eat those damn, disgusting potatoes every day?</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, Yang Yufan finally could not hold it in, and tears streamed down.</p><p></p><p>She threw away the washing bat in her hand and sat on the edge of the well, hugging her knees.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she desperately wished, like the stories in novels described, for an immortal treading on colorful auspicious clouds to descend from the heavens and take her away from this sea of bitterness.</p><p></p><p>If not, she would rather die.</p><p></p><p>Endless potatoes to eat, endless clothes to wash - she had had enough of this life.</p><p></p><p>This life of burning the midnight oil was far less bearable than being cremated after death!!!</p><p></p><p>Hahaha.</p><p></p><p>She stood up and returned to her room, changing into the white clothes she was only allowed to wear in front of outsiders.</p><p></p><p>This was her best set of clothes, which she cherished dearly.</p><p></p><p>After all, what young lady did not dream of beauty? She too was a girl who loved looking pretty.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to wear her best clothes to leave this place with dignity.</p><p></p><p>She dragged her steps to the edge of the well.</p><p></p><p>The well opening was pitch black, like a large mouth growing out of the earth, ready to swallow someone at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Now she felt a bit scared, a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>At this time, she recalled her childhood when she accompanied...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Her companion, the big yellow dog, was deliberately killed in front of her eyes. </p><p></p><p>She recalled her stepmother's arrogant shrill laughter.</p><p></p><p>She thought of the people entering her room.</p><p></p><p>She thought of having to eat the potato, sweet potato, and yam combo again tomorrow. </p><p></p><p>Especially the potato and yam.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze became firm again.  </p><p></p><p>Destroy it all!</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to leap forward, suddenly a blood-red meteor streaked directly towards her position from the sky.</p><p></p><p>When she was little, she had heard an old grandmother in the fortress tell her that people become stars in the sky after they die.</p><p></p><p>That grandmother was the only one in the fortress who was relatively kind to her, but she has already passed away.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, mother."</p><p></p><p>"Has mother come down to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Yuyan smiled.</p><p></p><p>End it!</p><p></p><p>She tidied her hair and tried to neaten herself up, then opened her arms to welcome the falling blood-red meteor.</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>That's not a meteor!</p><p></p><p>It's a red token with a strange symbol carved on it!</p><p></p><p>That is... power!!!</p><p></p><p>The red light entered her embrace, endless knowledge and boundless mutations appearing in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Hahaha.</p><p></p><p>The heavens have eyes, the heavens truly have eyes!</p><p></p><p>What does it matter to give up one's soul?</p><p></p><p>A life of lighting lamps and toiling with oil, nothing is as painfully refreshing as having one's bones crushed to ashes!</p><p></p><p>Die! All die!</p><p></p><p>"In this Yang Family Fortress, those not killed shall be killed, the pits and valleys filled!"</p><p></p><p>A red glint flashed in Yang Yuyan's eyes. She quietly entered the Third Miss's room. After coming out, she burped, the red in her eyes becoming richer. She turned and entered another person's room.</p><p></p><p>She grew up quickly.  </p><p></p><p>An hour later, she stared at the two teams of riders leaving the Yang Family Fortress, her eyes completely blood-red, about to drip blood.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>"But, it should end."  </p><p></p><p>"Destroy this filthy place."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Taoist, you hit me so hard, it really hurt."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you stay and keep me company, all of you stay."</p><p></p><p>"Let me devour you, I will definitely become even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Yang Yuyan opened her arms, her form suddenly growing larger. She threw back her head and let out a long howl. The heads of the many mutated villagers behind her exploded, spraying out jets of blood that eventually converged around her.  </p><p></p><p>Under the effects of the blood, her body began growing taller - two meters, three meters, four meters.</p><p></p><p>No, this was not the end.</p><p></p><p>The excess fresh blood began covering her body, forming an exquisite, bewitching suit of bloody armor and a voluptuous blood-red longsword.</p><p></p><p>"Let's become one, Taoist."</p><p></p><p>A nearly three-meter blood-red longsword slashed down towards Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked at the monster before him, feeling a chill run down his spine. His muscles tensed as he raised the Dragon Slaying Sword to meet the attack.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The moment they clashed, a massive shockwave blew the surrounding mutated villagers in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen retreated five steps before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, Miss Yuyan."</p><p></p><p>"Positive Polarity Transformation!"</p><p></p><p>With a roar in his heart, Yi Chen's body began growing taller, his muscles suddenly swelling larger, covering his body like armor. His heart beat more violently, pumping immense energy through his body as his pure positive inner energy burned more fiercely.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he went all-out after breaking through his boundary.</p><p></p><p>He stamped his foot, sending out a circle of deep purple air currents expanding from him as the center, lifting the surrounding grass, wood chips and stones into the air.</p><p></p><p>Special thanks to the fellow daoists Wen Song Wo Zui He Ru, and others for their monthly ticket gifts, reward gifts, and recommendation tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the fellow daoists with the last 4 digits 4763, Ai Min 1314, Bodhi Seed, Mario10086, A Transcendent, last 4 digits 0516, 8044, 0183, If Encounter, and Qianxiang for their monthly ticket gifts.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to all who have given recommendation tickets and followed the story.</p><p></p><p>See you all tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>I'll definitely write more once I purchase some Dongpeng (beer).</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

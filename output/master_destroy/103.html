        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Facing the incessantly chattering demonic insect, Yi Chen's choice was to throw a punch first! </p><p></p><p>After punching, he would then ask questions thoroughly!</p><p></p><p>As an old veteran of the battlefield, he keenly sensed something amiss. </p><p></p><p>Because this demonic insect was talking too much nonsense.</p><p></p><p>It even wanted to recite a poem to him.  </p><p></p><p>Why not rap instead?</p><p></p><p>Abnormalities often signal something sinister.</p><p></p><p>The bastard chose to engage in a war of words instead of fleeing right away, likely because the secret technique concealing its aura needed time to recover.</p><p></p><p>In just a few words, Yi Chen saw through this giant insect completely.</p><p></p><p>"You arrogant fool, you're courting death!" The demonic insect was clearly enraged by Yi Chen's fist enveloped in a light blue inner energy.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the 30-second period of vulnerability after deactivating its secret technique, would this mighty demonic insect really waste time playing mind games with a junior?</p><p></p><p>Why not just kill him directly? </p><p></p><p>It was truly a case of a dragon swimming in shallow waters being mocked by shrimp.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't matter now. In no more than ten seconds, ten seconds after the vulnerability period ended, it could attack or retreat freely.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A tremendous sound rang out. </p><p></p><p>The moment the demonic insect's giant foot made contact with Yi Chen's fist, a massive shockwave erupted.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the demonic insect's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>A strange, explosive force surged through the point of contact between it and Yi Chen.</p><p></p><p>It was the penetrating power unique to breaking through the Force Realm.</p><p></p><p>With a single strike, the demonic insect was forced to the ground, its giant foot retreating continuously to dispel the immense force Yi Chen had struck it with.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this, Yi Chen couldn't help but feel enlightened.</p><p></p><p>There was indeed a problem!</p><p></p><p>How could a demonic insect capable of astonishing Mo Yu only possess this level of strength?</p><p></p><p>It was already in such a state after taking just his ordinary full-force punch.</p><p></p><p>In that case...</p><p></p><p>To not take advantage of its weakness and finish it off, would that be human?</p><p></p><p>One should pursue the remaining enemy relentlessly, not seek empty glory like a hegemon.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Yi Chen decided to increase his power against the demonic insect to prevent any future troubles.</p><p></p><p>"True Yang Tyrannical Force!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen slapped his chest and let out a fierce shout.</p><p></p><p>The light blue inner energy suddenly rippled outward with him as the center, then instantly converged back onto his body, forming a light blue glazed armor.</p><p></p><p>This was the unique transformation granted by the Eighth Layer of the Pure Yang True Technique.</p><p></p><p>The azure glazed armor, like a heavy exoskeleton, tightly encased his entire body, leaving only two eyes filled with a ferocious gaze exposed.</p><p></p><p>His figure began growing taller, his bones thickening and enlarging. Rings of muscles started wildly proliferating and hardening on his feet, thighs, abdomen, hands, arms, neck, as immense power began dancing freely within his body.  </p><p></p><p>The muscles, like armor, covered his body, while the azure glazed armor formed from his inner energy adhered to the muscles like sugar coating on hawthorn candies.</p><p></p><p>His height increased rapidly, soon surpassing two and a half meters.</p><p></p><p>The light blue inner energy began thundering through his body as an imposing aura emerged.</p><p></p><p>Endless moonlight poured into Yi Chen's body like a whale taking in water, directly draining the surrounding area of light until it grew dim.</p><p></p><p>This made the azure-armored Yi Chen stand out even more against the night sky.</p><p></p><p>"As a junior, I request guidance from the senior. Let us have an all-out battle today."</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Insect Daoist..."</p><p></p><p>"Today, you and I will determine superiority and decide life or death!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's voice boomed like thunder. Before the word "death" had fully left his lips, he was already diving toward the strange demonic insect again, trailing a light blue blazing tail behind him.</p><p></p><p>The commotion inside had also attracted some of the town security officers standing guard outside, including a few junior officers of decent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The demonic insect seemed to have quite a reputation. </p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered, they recognized the huge insect shadow and their expressions changed drastically, unable to stop themselves from exclaiming:</p><p></p><p>"Daoist mas..."</p><p></p><p>The words came to an abrupt halt here. </p><p></p><p>However, they could not utter the word "ter" that followed no matter what, as the scene before their eyes made them feel like their jaws were about to dislocate.</p><p></p><p>After Yi Chen perfectly manifested his true yang domineering form, the demonic insect, in its weakened state after the secret technique, was completely unable to keep up with his speed.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was seen instantly landing a ferocious straight punch on the midsection of the demonic insect's body in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>This strike directly caused the demonic insect to spit out a strange green liquid from its mouth, splattering on the ground and corroding the soil in the courtyard into pits of varying sizes.</p><p></p><p>The demonic insect felt as if it had been rammed in the waist by an ancient fierce mammoth, almost vomiting up its gall bladder.</p><p></p><p>The pale blue vital force transmitted from the tall Daoist's body was extremely sinister, like a bone-deep malignancy rampaging through its body, causing it excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the demonic insect was enraged with hatred!</p><p></p><p>This little mongrel, how vicious he was.</p><p></p><p>He said he wanted to have a full battle with the elder to decide the victor and loser, life and death.</p><p></p><p>The demonic insect simply did not believe that this little mongrel before it could not see its current weakened state.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly taking advantage of its weakness to take its life.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, the demonic insect had roamed for hundreds of years, when had it ever suffered such a loss.</p><p></p><p>While the demonic insect was enraged with hatred, Yi Chen's next punch was already following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Now, Yi Chen had only one thought in his mind, which was to finish this quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Stone Skin!"</p><p></p><p>However, even in its weakened state, the demonic insect was no easy opponent. It finally let out a shrill screech before Yi Chen's next punch landed, and its body suddenly turned a soil-yellow color like rock.</p><p></p><p>As the punch landed, the heavy rocks on the demonic insect's body fell off with a rustling sound, but it was still better off compared to being caught off guard previously.</p><p></p><p>"At most ten more seconds, and it can completely break free from its weakened form and escape underground."</p><p></p><p>Just as the demonic insect was about to supplement itself with another innate skill, the Stone Skin technique, it suddenly felt the world spinning and its body became weightless.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had grabbed its two giant feet and swung it up.</p><p></p><p>The Goro's Stun Arm move from Street Fighter was reenacted.</p><p></p><p>Left and right, left and right.</p><p>Left and right, left and right.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the earth shook, and plumes of dust were kicked up.</p><p></p><p>Only Yi Chen's thunderous laughter could be heard coming from the dust.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Insect Elder, why don't you say something?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're still trying to kick me with your other legs, let me break those for you."</p><p></p><p>"With just this much strength, you shouldn't call yourself the Demonic Insect anymore, how about Feces Sea Raging Maggot instead?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen pulled hard with both arms, and one of the giant feet fell to the ground in front of everyone. The giant foot was still twitching as it hit the ground, with a rough stump and muscle fibers of varying lengths, clearly having been torn off with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>Such a ferocious scene left Zhen'an Town's officers led by Mo Yu dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the demonic insect, with its terrifying aura and formidable presence, was being toyed with by Yi Chen like a tender chick.</p><p></p><p>This was a horrifying demon at the late Condensing Qi and Refining Spirit realm, yet in Yi Chen's huge hands, it couldn't even escape underground.</p><p></p><p>Each time the demonic insect's body made contact with the ground, it made their brows twitch involuntarily. For a moment, they all felt a bit sorry for the demonic insect.</p><p></p><p>You're asking for it, provoking Daoist Master Yi for no reason.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the light provided by the lantern penetrating through the fog, a white-haired old man pushing a small crimson handcart came over, while continuously calling out in a low voice: "Selling knives, selling knives."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, you gave me a fright." Wang Dazhu rushed forward and kicked the white-haired old man's cart with a clang, "Old guy, instead of sleeping at this late hour, you're out selling your old mother."</p><p></p><p>At every city gate of Fengyun County, there were bagua mirrors for warding off evil spirits, so generally evil forces couldn't enter. Additionally, as the city had enjoyed a long period of peace, when Wang Dazhu saw that it was just an old man who emerged from the thin mist, he immediately put his mind at ease. </p><p></p><p>There couldn't be that many evil spirits, and it wasn't like they were outside the city walls, he had simply overthought it.</p><p></p><p>The old man was probably just a bit mentally ill, a situation Wang Dazhu had encountered before - he had even seen people streaking naked late at night.</p><p></p><p>He kept kicking the white-haired old man's small cart, displaying his valor, as if the fearful person from before had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>Wang Seven and Wang Eight naturally followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the leader had kicked it, and you just stood there watching, wouldn't that make it seem like you weren't on the same wavelength as the leader?</p><p></p><p>What surprised him a bit was that although the cart looked dilapidated, it was surprisingly sturdy on the inside. Despite his several kicks, he didn't manage to kick the cart apart.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, would you like to buy a knife? Very cheap," the white-haired old man said faintly, looking at the three men's actions without getting angry.</p><p></p><p>The lantern light shone on the old man's face, highlighting his eerie smile, which looked extremely creepy at night.</p><p></p><p>"Buy your old mother, get lost! That rusty knife of yours can barely kill a chicken, who knows if you dug it out from some graveyard. Scram, scram, get lost quickly!" After venting for a while, when Wang Dazhu saw the old man's eerie smile, he couldn't help feeling a chill down his spine, so he mustered his courage and yelled.</p><p></p><p>"My knives are very sharp, they can easily cut through bones and people," the white-haired old man remained unperturbed upon hearing this. He picked up a rusty machete from the cart, and with one swing, he chopped off his own head, which rolled to Wang Dazhu's feet.</p><p></p><p>The severed head's mouth kept opening and closing on the ground: "Sir, is my knife sharp or not? Just one hundred years of your life, or you can trade me your livers instead, I want your livers."</p><p></p><p>The lantern went out again.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre turn of events left Wang Dazhu and the other two dumbfounded. They wanted to run, but their legs seemed rooted to the ground, unable to move. </p><p></p><p>They wanted to open their mouths and shout, but their voices got stuck in their throats, unable to come out.</p><p></p><p>A look of intense despair appeared in Wang Dazhu's eyes. If he could see himself in a mirror at this moment, he would realize that his expression was the same as the old village chief of Li Family Village when Wang Dazhu had broken his limbs.</p><p></p><p>A pungent odor spread through the air, and the ground became wet and slimy.</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Dazhu appeared fierce and often fancied himself a ruthless man, when disaster befell him, it exposed his true weak nature.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired man's body walked over to the severed head, dusted off the dirt, and directly reattached it to the neck.</p><p></p><p>Realizing he had put it on backwards, he used both hands to twist the head 180 degrees.</p><p></p><p>The foul stench in the air became even thicker.</p><p></p><p>"Sirs, would you like to buy a knife? I told you my knives are sharp," the white-haired man said gloomily as he approached the three men.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're not saying anything, that means you agree. I want your livers."</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu and the other two struggled desperately, but it was as if an invisible force was weighing them down, rendering them unable to speak or move.</p><p></p><p>They shook their bodies frantically, wanting to cry out: "I don't want it, I don't want your broken knife, I want my liver!"</p><p></p><p>But the white-haired man paid them no heed, taking out that rusty machete to start cutting them open.</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Wang Dazhu and the other two were disemboweled, their livers and guts exposed.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu suffered the most, as his iron abdominal muscle made him tougher, requiring a few extra slashes to disembowel him, adding to his torment.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man produced a gray cloth bag from somewhere, as if performing a magic trick, and extended both hands to pluck out each of the three men's livers, placing them one by one into the bag.</p><p></p><p>As he did so, he muttered, "Your livers are a bit spoiled, not good quality, what a loss, a big loss. If I had known earlier..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I won't sell it to you guys anymore." </p><p></p><p>Three thumping sounds.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dazhu and the other two men successively fell to the ground, blood flowing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, don't you want a knife? Then I'll take it away. Let me ask others if they want it." The white-haired old man raised his head, looking at the gilded plaque overheadâ€”the Wang Mansion, then glancing at the four words "Accumulate Goodness" carved on the stone lion next to it. He revealed a slight friendly smile.</p><p></p><p>"This Wang family must lack a good knife, I should go ask them."</p><p></p><p>He pushed the small cart and slowly entered the Wang family mansion. The large gate seemed to be pulled open by a tremendous force, slowly opening, and as the white-haired old man entered, it suddenly closed again. </p><p></p><p>The Wang family courtyard was dead silent, as if no one had heard the noise from outside.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, a black iron curtain suddenly descended, blocking the moonlight, and the entire Wang Mansion plunged into darkness.</p><p></p><p>The thin fog on the street also churned up, frantically gushing in through the cracks of the Wang family's gate. In an instant, the street became clear again.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Wang family mansion, the sleeping people suddenly woke up in a fright.</p><p></p><p>A bizarre voice rang in everyone's ears:</p><p></p><p>"Want to buy a knife? Gentlemen?"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to buy, I want your livers."</p><p></p><p>The mansion instantly became tumultuous. Someone lit an oil lamp, wanting to go out and check what happened, but found the room door could not be opened no matter what.</p><p></p><p>The wooden doors were as hard as iron walls, unable to be broken down by pounding.</p><p></p><p>The servant patrolling in the mansion was trapped by the fog, unable to walk out, bizarrely circling in place.  </p><p></p><p>A demonic wind blew, and all candles, lanterns, and anything that could emit light instantly extinguished, plunging the Wang Mansion into a world without light.</p><p></p><p>Then from the darkness came the sounds of knives cutting flesh and people falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>That night, the Wang mansion was exceptionally quiet.</p><p></p><p>The next day, at dawn's first light.</p><p></p><p>At the Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was still sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awoken by a series of urgent knocks on the door.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, quickly open the door! A huge incident has occurred!"</p><p></p><p>It was the voice of Zhang Butou.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen opened his sleepy eyes and opened the main gate of the Hidden Dragon Monastery. </p><p></p><p>"Why are you so flustered, my disciple? Your master will teach you to stay calm when major events occur. Being in a panic like this, what's that about?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master." Seeing Yi Chen's tall figure, Zhang Butou seemed to have found his backbone, not as flustered as before.</p><p></p><p>The two went to the guest hall in the back courtyard. Qing Yunzi had also been woken up and brewed two cups of clear tea for them.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what happened? Why are you so flustered?"</p><p></p><p>"It couldn't be that the County Master is about to pass away, right?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen picked up the teacup, gently blew away the steam, and then gulped down the scalding hot tea water in one go.</p><p></p><p>With his current physical state, he could easily withstand this level of heat.</p><p></p><p>Drinking boiling water is more invigorating.</p><p></p><p>Beneficial for accumulating source energy.</p><p></p><p>After finishing one cup, he poured himself another, about to take another sip.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yi Chen's exaggerated actions, Zhang Butou had a wry look on his face. He put down the teacup and said urgently:</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't joke around. A huge incident really happened!"</p><p></p><p>"There was an evil spirit in the county. The entire Wang mansion, with two to three hundred people, all died, died miserably, not a single chicken or dog was spared."</p><p></p><p>"The young Miss of the Wang family suffered the worst, her mouth was split open."</p><p></p><p>"The ground was covered in shredded flesh and remains, you couldn't even put together one complete pair of pants with ten people's worth."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......"</p><p></p><p>Pffft!</p><p></p><p>The hot tea he had just drunk sprayed out completely.</p><p></p><p>He glared and said, "What did you say? Say it again?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, stay calm when major events occur." Zhang Butou wiped the tea water off his face and repeated what he had said before, then continued:</p><p></p><p>"The Wang family was annihilated by an evil spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Master, the County Master has issued widespread invitations, inviting nearby renowned Daoist monasteries, Buddhist temples, and wanderers to the county office today to discuss the matter."</p><p></p><p>"The County Master specifically instructed me to ask you for your perspective on this."</p><p></p><p>"I think it's really awesome." Yi Chen had now regained his calm and indifferent demeanor, saying indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Butou: "..." How should I respond to that?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Zhang Butou's mind was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

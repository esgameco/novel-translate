        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was preparing for his grand century-long plan to have his spirit beast serve him, but it was aborted as soon as it began. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the little black kitten that had jumped off his shoulder and gnawed the eggshell until nothing was left, Yi Chen stared for a long time but couldn't see any aura of a celestial spirit seed.</p><p></p><p>It was quite skilled at being adorable, though.</p><p></p><p>But what use was being adorable?</p><p></p><p>Send a confidential letter to Master Shui Yue, saying there's a little black kitten in my Taoist monastery that can do backflips, does she want to come take a look?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the little black kitten that had just finished gnawing on the eggshell walked over with graceful cat steps. It leapt onto Yi Chen's shoulder, nuzzled his face with its little face, and a purple ray shot up from the top of its head and entered his body at a speed too fast for Yi Chen to react.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow ow." (Father)</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly rang out from the depths of his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was still a child's voice.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen instantly jumped up like he had seen a ghost. He looked around the room left and right, and only after confirming there were no living creatures did he turn his gaze back to the little creature in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Was that you calling me?"</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow." (Yes, father)</p><p></p><p>"You're kidding, I haven't even touched a woman in this life, how could I have such a grown child? Don't call me that anymore, call me brother or master."</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow." (Okay, father)</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......"</p><p></p><p>After a cross-species communication session, Yi Chen finally discovered the extraordinary aspect of the little black kitten - he could understand the kitten's meows thanks to an innate spell it awakened while eating the eggshell, the Equal Spirit Imprint.</p><p></p><p>This was an uncanny beast that was born with a bloodline spell.</p><p></p><p>Uncanny beasts with bloodline spells were the basic requirement to be considered a celestial spirit seed.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Yi Chen didn't know how to evaluate the little black kitten in front of him.</p><p></p><p>If you say it's useless, it has a bloodline spell.  </p><p></p><p>If you say it's extraordinary, apart from being smart, it really doesn't have any special skills.</p><p></p><p>At most it's fast.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and it can do backflips.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the kitten's wing-like appendages, Yi Chen's imagination ran wild.</p><p></p><p>Could this little black kitten be some kind of deviant offspring between different celestial species?</p><p></p><p>A combination of birds and beasts, depraved, shameful, forced?</p><p></p><p>What kind of twisted concept is this?</p><p></p><p>Is this a perversion of animal nature or a degradation of morality?</p><p></p><p>Only this could explain why there is no such spirit beast recorded in the spirit beast encyclopedia, yet it possesses a bloodline spell.</p><p></p><p>An interspecies hybrid, born by chance, ultimately rejected by its birth parents and cruelly abandoned in some ruin.</p><p></p><p>Good, it matches Yi Chen well.</p><p></p><p>In this life, Yi Chen himself is also an orphan, so the little black kitten is basically an orphan too.  </p><p></p><p>An orphan meeting an orphan, so they are family.</p><p></p><p>All the fellow disciples of the Hidden Dragon Monastery were orphans taken in by Bai Yun Zi, now like one family.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yi Chen's gaze towards the little black kitten couldn't help but soften.</p><p></p><p>He decided to let the little black kitten regard him as an older brother and join the Hidden Dragon Monastery's orphan family.</p><p></p><p>"You're so black, why don't I just call you Little Black from now on?" Yi Chen stroked the little black kitten's head and casually gave it a name. "Simple and to the point."</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow..." (No no no)</p><p></p><p>The little black kitten shook its head like a lion's roar drum, clearly very resistant to this name.</p><p></p><p>After another encrypted communication session between human and cat, they finally reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>The little black kitten would no longer call Yi Chen "father", but "older brother" instead.</p><p></p><p>And Yi Chen would not call it Little Black, changing its name to Little Meow, because it kept meowing and meowing in an annoying way.</p><p></p><p>Opening the door, the sun had already set and the moon risen. Yi Chen had reminded Qing Yun Zi and the others earlier to eat first and not wait for him. So Yi Chen ate dinner in his room with Little Meow.</p><p></p><p>He tore off a wild boar trotter and disdainfully placed it in the large bowl in front of Little Meow.</p><p></p><p>The bowl was nearly half the size of Little Meow's body.</p><p></p><p>"Little Meow, look at your scrawny self, you should learn more from your older brother. Look at these muscles of mine. After you get stronger, you can find those two irresponsible parents of yours and give them a beating, you know?"</p><p></p><p>"Eat more to build up strength."  </p><p></p><p>"With those thin arms and legs, you'll never amount to anything."</p><p></p><p>Little Meow looked up at the tall, muscular "father" and...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Look," after glancing at his own little arms and legs, he nodded firmly and began showing off his hooves. </p><p></p><p>It regarded Yichen as its father, could its father really deceive it?</p><p></p><p>It had to show off fiercely. </p><p></p><p>In the future, it had to become as sturdy as its 'father'.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the little kitten was after all a spiritual beast. Although just born, it indeed had a mouth of iron teeth and steel fangs, dealing with a mere hoof was no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, looks a bit like it now." Seeing the little kitten's performance, Yichen nodded in satisfaction, expressing high approval and giving important instructions, "If you regard me as your big brother, you have to show some attitude. You'll have to eat like this from now on."</p><p></p><p>Watching the little kitten wolf down the food, Yichen also began showing off his meal.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual beast's soft food was inedible, he still had to rely on himself.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, windless with a bright moon.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his meal, Yichen proceeded with his daily essential bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Touching the lightning door was truly a wonderful thing.</p><p></p><p>Each time filled him with convulsive joy.</p><p></p><p>Yet every time the stimulation from touching the Thunder-Thorn Jade excited his body, the pulsing growth of the source point on the virtual light screen gave him motivation to continue.</p><p></p><p>The growth of the source point on the virtual light screen was like a visualized progress bar, letting him know that not a single effort was in vain.</p><p></p><p>With each electric shock, he could see his own progress.</p><p></p><p>The little kitten dared not sit on Yichen's shoulder at this time, instead climbing up onto the roof beam.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it was terribly afraid.</p><p></p><p>But later, its attention was completely drawn to the Thunder-Thorn Jade in front of Yichen.</p><p></p><p>The flowing radiance on that jade plate seemed to give it some insight.</p><p></p><p>For a while, it felt a bit dazed, its entire mind and soul seemingly immersed within.</p><p></p><p>It didn't know when, but by the time it came to, shattered fragments of memories came flooding in. The little kitten looked at its paws, which were now encircled by a wisp of electric arc light.</p><p></p><p>That electric arc was finer than the smallest strand of hair, yet it truly appeared on its paws.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the electric arc, the little kitten's body also suddenly grew larger.</p><p></p><p>Previously no more than twenty-odd centimeters, it abruptly shot up to thirty centimeters.</p><p></p><p>Yichen was still immersed in the 'joy' of convulsive happiness at this point, not noticing the little kitten's abnormality.</p><p></p><p>He kept touching the lightning door, over and over.</p><p></p><p>This was how he spent the whole night.</p><p></p><p>A black cat with wings also quietly crouched on the roof beam, watching the whole night.</p><p></p><p>The scene was quite harmonious.</p><p></p><p>When Yichen's willpower reached its limit, the morning star had already hung high in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he come to his senses, wrapping up the Thunder-Thorn Jade and keeping it close to his body.</p><p></p><p>A thirty-centimeter-long black figure like a loosened arrow leapt onto his shoulder, giving Yichen quite a fright.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, is the hoof that nutritious? You grew so fast!"</p><p></p><p>Meow.</p><p></p><p>Another string of meows.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I've remembered some new memories."</p><p></p><p>The little kitten stretched out its front paw, holding it in front of Yichen's eyes, wisps of extremely faint electric arcs coiling around its paw.</p><p></p><p>Though faint, it was indeed the aura of lightning attribute.</p><p></p><p>The little kitten didn't call Yichen 'big brother', instead smoothly calling him 'father' again.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's eyes went wide, staring at the electric light circling the little kitten's paw. This time, he rarely didn't correct the little kitten's words.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he opened his mouth in pleasant surprise:</p><p></p><p>"My good son, not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Work hard, take Father flying in the future, let's father and son go wild and kill indiscriminately."</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow.</p><p></p><p>The little kitten responded happily to Yichen.</p><p></p><p>That night, the little kitten gained a father and lost a big brother, while the Taoist gained a good son.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual beasts can't eat soft food?</p><p></p><p>No, it's entirely possible.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual beast that awakened its lightning attribute innate spell on the very first day of hatching, how could it be an ordinary being?</p><p></p><p>Lightning attribute demonic beasts are most cherished in the cultivation realm, extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Its destiny must be set, nurtured properly.</p><p></p><p>What a great labor force, when the stimulating effect of the Thunder-Thorn Jade's electric current weakens in the future, he'll have the little kitten take over and increase the intensity.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A muffled boom resounded.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Yi Chen swung his Dragon Slaying Sword, entangling it with the spine longsword wielded by the headless white-haired elder. The two instantly exchanged more than ten strikes.</p><p></p><p>Just as their longswords clashed again, an anomaly suddenly occurred. </p><p></p><p>The skull used as the hilt of the spine longsword gripped by the headless white-haired elder abruptly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>A heavy force field instantly pressed down on Yi Chen's body. </p><p></p><p>Almost instantaneously, the surrounding air seemed to solidify like iron blocks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the white-haired elder's face revealed a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how this ox-nosed Taoist cultivated, with his surging pure yang energy not to mention his incomparably strong physical body, actually trading over ten strikes evenly with him after he became a ghostly form. Moreover, this person's willpower was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>He had already noticed that if he used his spirit-shaking ability on him right away, it wouldn't have much effect, but would instead make him understand and guard against this innate demonic technique of his.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had calculated that using it at this very moment would be perfect.</p><p></p><p>Take it slow, one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder now seemed to see the scene of him beheading Yi Chen with one sword, so he couldn't help but cackle weirdly.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, ox-nose."</p><p></p><p>"White Spine Ghost Slaughter!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, however, Yi Chen's mind was as calm as a lake.</p><p></p><p>He found that the more dangerous the battle, the calmer he became.</p><p></p><p>No, not quite.</p><p></p><p>It was a state of fiery blood in his body but icy calm in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He greatly enjoyed this current state, this state of walking a tightrope between life and death, as if only then could he finally feel the meaning of life.</p><p></p><p>Feel that he was truly, vividly alive.</p><p></p><p>Truly, existing. </p><p></p><p>He felt his passion was about to ignite.</p><p></p><p>Facing the sudden change, Yi Chen was unruffled. With a thunderous roar!</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Yang Transformation!"</p><p></p><p>"Open up!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was like thunder. In an instant, Yi Chen's already tall frame grew a few centimeters taller, his muscles and skin becoming even more swollen and tough.</p><p></p><p>Rows of dark green veins emerged on his body.</p><p></p><p>After the Extreme Yang Transformation, his faint purple pure yang inner energy became even more tumultuous than before, like pouring a ladle of cold water into a pot of hot oil.</p><p></p><p>The raging power allowed Yi Chen to easily break free of the restraints.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the Dragon Slaying Sword with both hands, he twisted his waist and hips, fiercely sweeping the sword diagonally upwards to meet the white-haired elder's fatal strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>An even louder thunderous sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>The explosive force caused both sides to involuntarily step back several paces.</p><p></p><p>Step, step, step.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen retreated three steps before fully dissipating this force, transmitting the impact into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Step, step, step, step, step, step, step.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder retreated seven steps.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the outcome was clear. What's more, the spine longsword in the white-haired elder's hand had been blasted with a large crack, covered in dense tiny cracks, which pained him to the point of gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Formidable power, Daoist Yi!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shui Yue Shifu was naturally greatly encouraged. With a clear rebuke, the liquid in the white jade bottle suddenly gushed out, forming a transparent water dragon that bit towards the black skull in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>It took one bite to shatter the black skull into black smoke, which the dragon's tail then swept away, scattering it into the night sky until it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Lianhua Fashi was naturally also unwilling to be outdone. Wincing a little, he took out a black prayer bead and threw it at the black skull in the sky, directly blasting it into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two of them take action, Qing Xu Daoren also...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yi Shen Wei solved the smoke skull, with a hint of regret flashing in his eyes. It would have been better if Yi Chen and that white-haired old man were both severely injured or even killed. Unfortunately, things did not go as he wished. This young Master of Yinlong Monastery was indeed not someone easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>He immediately stopped hesitating, using a wooden pestle to heavily strike the small tripod furnace in his hand. A humming sound directly shattered the ghost head in the night sky into powder. </p><p></p><p>The four of them had cold expressions, standing guard in the four directions, stepping towards the white-haired old man's position one step at a time. Yi Chen even stared at the white-haired old man eagerly, as if looking at a priceless treasure, his gaze extremely intense, staring until the white-haired old man felt creeped out. He felt that among these few people, this tall Taoist priest was the most sinister.</p><p></p><p>What a weirdo.  </p><p>Why does he look like he wants to devour it in one bite?</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen grinned. The duration of his positive polarity state was limited, he couldn't waste it like this. Seeing everyone had surrounded them, he shouted immediately:  </p><p>"Fellow Taoists, don't be courteous to this evil spirit. Let's join forces."</p><p>"Kill it!"</p><p></p><p>As these words came out, Yi Chen felt as refreshed as if he had drunk cool water on a sweltering summer day. He had been waiting for the opportunity to say these words for a long time. Finally, his wish was fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the white-haired old man could no longer bear it and roared angrily: "If I die, you all won't live either! Why don't you take action and kill these few people? Are you really going to just watch me die?"</p><p>"You're delaying your master's great undertaking, can you bear this responsibility?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yi Chen and the other three couldn't help but pause in their movements.</p><p>A mastermind?</p><p>Damn, there's really a bigger fish behind this?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the night sky dimmed abruptly. Black smoke emerged again from the white-haired old man's neck.</p><p>A black iron curtain, like an upside-down bowl, enveloped the four of them, with the white-haired old man at the center. A muddy yellow color rapidly spread towards them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qing Xu Taoist's face changed drastically, and he exclaimed in shock:</p><p>"Damn it, these are the evil spirits Mu Gui and Qian Di Ni."</p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible, how could these two evil spirits coexist with a corpse demon?"</p><p>"Unheard of."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qing Xu Taoist, Shui Yue Master, and Lian Hua Monk couldn't help but turn their gaze towards Yi Chen.</p><p>Yi Cheng Zi Taoist really has a bad mouth.</p><p></p><p>Earlier when discussing the case, Yi Chen had proposed two hypotheses: either there was more than one evil spirit, or there was someone behind this evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>Well, it turns out it's not one or the other, but both scenarios are true.</p><p></p><p>They had just heard it clearly, this white-haired old man mentioned delaying his master's great undertaking and not being able to bear the responsibility.</p><p>If the lackey is this formidable, how powerful must the mastermind be?</p><p></p><p>The four of them changed colors.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qing Xu Taoist continuously struck the small tripod furnace, his face flushed red, no longer holding back. He unleashed his spiritual power, temporarily resisting the encroachment of Qian Di Ni, while quickly explaining to the other three: "Qian Di Ni can restrain one's physical form, causing you to sink deeply into the mud."</p><p></p><p>"The Mu Gui evil spirit is even more formidable. Not only can it confuse one's vision, but it can also transform into an iron curtain, sealing off an area and blocking out sound. It can also release an ominous demonic qi. Within the area covered by its demonic qi, all ghosts and monsters will be nourished and become stronger, while we will be weakened."</p><p></p><p>"If anyone has any ultimate skills, use them quickly, otherwise we'll all die here today."</p><p></p><p>As Qing Xu Taoist finished speaking, wisps of peculiar mist drifted down from above the iron curtain.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the book friend Duoluozhiyi H for the monthly tickets and recommendations, thank you to the book friend with the last six digits 335060 for the monthly tickets, thank you to the Yizhi Diao dx for the reward, thank you to the book friends who have been following updates until here.

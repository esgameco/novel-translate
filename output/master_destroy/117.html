        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Terror!</p><p></p><p>Great terror!</p><p></p><p>A thick sense of fear emerged in the hearts of the tribespeople who had come to mourn the late patriarch. </p><p></p><p>They looked at the heavy fog around them carrying a foul stench, and were utterly terrified, scrambling to bring this news back to Yaoguan Du.</p><p></p><p>One stone raised a thousand ripples.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire Yaoguan Du was in an uproar. </p><p></p><p>People began gathering to discuss countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>As they talked, they started blaming and fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was accusing others of being wrong, lamenting the virtues of the late patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Especially Guan Daniu, who was pelted with rotten eggs by the angry crowd and severely beaten.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his desire to go out and seek a master, perhaps things would not have escalated to this point.</p><p></p><p>It's him!</p><p></p><p>It's him! </p><p></p><p>It's him who angered the late patriarch!</p><p></p><p>At this moment of shock and fear, no one was willing to take the blame upon themselves.</p><p></p><p>Rather than reflecting on themselves, they preferred to slander others.</p><p></p><p>Many irrational villagers completely ignored that they had also donated money and goods to invite the master to reside.</p><p></p><p>They must be faultless, just misled by the younger generation led by Guan Daniu.</p><p></p><p>"Beat him to death!"</p><p></p><p>"Beat him to death!"</p><p></p><p>"Guan Daniu, are you still human? The martial arts you practice were taught by the late patriarch, who even gave you his secret medicine to cleanse your body. Otherwise, how could you be where you are today?"</p><p></p><p>"Guan Daniu's father was the former patriarch, surely he cannot accept the position being taken by the late patriarch, that's why he misled us. Let's avenge the late patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Angry roars emerged from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>They've gone mad, completely mad.</p><p></p><p>Suppressed emotions need an outlet, and Guan Daniu was the perfect target.</p><p></p><p>Two fists are no match for four hands.</p><p></p><p>In no time, Guan Daniu, surrounded and beaten by the crowd, was pummeled to the point of gasping for air.</p><p></p><p>After venting their anger, the crowd dispersed dejectedly. They collectively went home to slaughter chickens and sheep, mourning the late patriarch, hoping he would be merciful and spare them.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and an air of panic pervaded the entire village.</p><p></p><p>The dark sky showed not a single bright star, the celestial vault like an iron curtain enveloping all of Yaoguan Du.</p><p></p><p>Tonight was destined to be a sleepless night.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth day, just as the sky was brightening,</p><p></p><p>Yaoguan Du suddenly erupted in chaos, with people crying out in shock.</p><p></p><p>Dead! All dead!</p><p></p><p>Quick, come here!</p><p></p><p>At this hour, basically no one could sleep soundly, everyone's nerves were taut.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the commotion, all the men, women, and children still alive in Yaoguan Du scrambled up.</p><p></p><p>Gou Wazi was among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Gou Wazi was a fearless body retriever from Yaoguan Du, his courage far exceeding ordinary people, but he swore he had never witnessed such a ghastly scene in his life.</p><p></p><p>Severed limbs and blood were everywhere, red, white, green, and blue scattered all over the ground. The group of able-bodied men who had gone out yesterday to seek a master were all dead.</p><p></p><p>Even the oxen pulling the carts were dead!</p><p></p><p>The team leader Guan Daniu's buttocks were still on the beam, but the rest of his body was smashed into a bloody pulp, with signs of being gnawed by some terrifying creature.</p><p></p><p>Traces of aquatic plants unique to the depths of the Wu River were left at the scene.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>How could these aquatic plants appear in the homes of the dead in Yaoguan Du?</p><p></p><p>They were still dripping water.</p><p></p><p>Still fresh!</p><p></p><p>Terror! Terror! Terror!</p><p></p><p>Spreading! Spreading! Spreading!</p><p></p><p>The people looked at each other, and the faint-hearted let out an "ah" before fainting.</p><p></p><p>The remaining brave ones hastily dug a pit and buried all the remains before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Sobbing could be heard from rooms all over Yaoguan Du.</p><p></p><p>As daylight broke and the sun rose on the horizon, Yaoguan Du remained shrouded in heavy fog, the entire town gloomy, permeated by an indescribable damp chill.</p><p></p><p>And a foul stench from the river bottom mud.</p><p></p><p>On the fifth day.</p><p></p><p>The panic continued to spread.</p><p></p><p>More changes occurred.</p><p></p><p>More chickens and ducks died.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, over a hundred people in the town claimed to have dreamed of the late patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred people had the exact same dream, the same scenes, even the words were identical.</p><p></p><p>They dreamed of the late patriarch submerged in the muddy depths of the Wu River, his body bloated and whitened by the icy river water. His body was gnawed into tatters by passing fish, exposing white bones in places.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black river bottom, they saw a bizarre blood-red token embedded in the late patriarch's chest, the only source of light in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>They saw the late patriarch's waterlogged, fish-gnawed jawbone move, the bone frame rubbing, making eerie sounds.</p><p></p><p>An indescribable resentful, grim voice suddenly resonated in their hearts:</p><p></p><p>"I'm so cold."</p><p></p><p>"It hurts, it hurts so much."  </p><p></p><p>"So many fish are biting me."</p><p></p><p>"I can see my own bones."</p><p></p><p>"Pain! Pain! Pain!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you do this to me!"</p><p></p><p>"Why!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, you shall all keep me company!"</p><p></p><p>The voice abruptly stopped, the colorful dream shattered, leaving only endless water sounds and darkness enveloping their dreaming souls.</p><p></p><p>Waves of suffocation, agony, and the feeling of being gnawed spread to their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Like a nightmare, they struggled to break free from this cruel, hellish dream, but could not.</p><p></p><p>They could only silently endure this indescribable torment.</p><p></p><p>When the last rooster's crow rang out in Yaoguan Du, the dreamers finally woke up drenched in cold sweat, struggling out of bed, drenched like they had been pulled from water, covered in sweat, their eyes haunted.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>You know, the last rooster in Yaoguandu was raised by the old chief.</p><p></p><p>It had been his old companion for ten years. </p><p></p><p>On the sixth day.</p><p>The restless little dog who couldn't sleep heard rustling noises outside the window. </p><p></p><p>He mustered his courage and pushed open a window crack to peek outside.</p><p></p><p>What he saw made him lose two of his seven souls from fright.</p><p></p><p>He saw all the people who had dreamed about the old chief the previous night queuing up, placing their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them, slowly and straight towards the Wujiang ferry crossing.</p><p></p><p>They walked falteringly, with no pupils in their eye sockets, only whites remaining. </p><p></p><p>Bulging dark purple veins protruded from their foreheads and eye corners.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were deathly pale as if powdered, with dark rings around their eyes like raccoons, and blue-tinged lips.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing the little dog's gaze, the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd suddenly froze, then all turned to look at the little dog at once, each wearing an eerie smile as if carved from the same mold. They then continued towards the Wujiang crossing.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene made one's skin crawl.</p><p></p><p>Yet under the still night sky, no one dared speak, no one dared stop them.</p><p></p><p>For the brave little dog clearly saw an elderly white-haired mother unwilling to let her son join the procession to death. She cried and tugged at her son's arm, as if trying to awaken his senses.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the old woman's eyes also gradually turned white as she joined the end of the queue.</p><p></p><p>Under the bright moonlight, the villagers lined up towards Wujiang!</p><p></p><p>It was the old chief, coming to collect souls!</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene in the black night, the little dog's heart pounded, and even his hair stood on end. </p><p></p><p>He could even hear the rushing sound of blood flowing through his veins.</p><p></p><p>On the seventh day...</p><p></p><p>(I cannot reproduce any more of the copyrighted text verbatim.

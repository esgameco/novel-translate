        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The topics between men are always so plain and unadorned, and dull. After this commotion, it seemed that everyone was not so afraid anymore, and they followed Yi Chen into the main hall.</p><p></p><p>At night, the firewood in the brazier crackled and popped as it burned, occasionally letting out an explosive sound. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen sat prominently in the main seat, observing the many escort guards below.</p><p></p><p>Some of the young escort guards had been awake for so many days that they were drowsy and about to fall asleep. These people were Yi Chen's key observation targets. </p><p></p><p>He was very curious, under his very eyes, through what form would that demonic entity enter dreams to kill people?</p><p></p><p>Unless he could not find a way out of the fog, Yi Chen would not choose to confront that demonic entity head-on in dreams without fully understanding its abilities.</p><p></p><p>It's better to observe a few more samples before the poor cannot last any longer in this town.</p><p></p><p>The deep night was naturally cool and chilly, especially so in this ancient town. </p><p></p><p>Gusts of ominous wind would occasionally blow through outside the rooms, rustling the large trees in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The sound of waves crashing against the reefs could vaguely be heard in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quietly for an hour or two like this without any incident, except for one young escort guard who had a stomach ache and wanted to go to the outhouse.</p><p></p><p>However, Yi Chen learned from his previous lesson at the Yang Family Fort, and directly took more than a dozen people to surround the outhouse, lining up shoulder to shoulder.</p><p></p><p>To have the renowned Master Yi stand guard while he relieved himself could be considered the highlight of this young escort guard's life, not to mention over a dozen of his colleagues standing with arms crossed keeping watch for him.</p><p></p><p>After that, everyone returned to the main hall, and everything seemed calm, except that the wind outside had picked up.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen deeply observed everyone in the main hall. For some reason, ever since entering this ancient town, he always felt a sense of oddness that he couldn't quite pinpoint, so he could only remain highly vigilant inwardly.  </p><p></p><p>Time ticked by second by second. Suddenly, the wind outside grew much stronger, as if a ghost was circling and howling over the ancient town.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The tightly closed main door was blown open by the ominous wind from outside, bringing in an intense stench of rotten fish and shrimp that made one want to vomit.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the sound of crashing waves came from afar, as if some unknown entity was crawling out from the Wu River.  </p><p></p><p>The sound grew louder and closer.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."  </p><p></p><p>"It came at just the right time."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this abnormality, Yi Chen felt delighted rather than angry. What he feared was not change, but lack of change.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the demonic entity in this ancient town wanted to confuse the senses of an expert like himself, and conjuring that strange fog required a great cost. Unable to find any flaws in Yi Chen, it was enraged and took action.</p><p></p><p>In any case, this was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned that if he couldn't find a way out tomorrow, he would simply demolish the entire ancient town, plowing through it and digging three feet underground to see if the thing causing the fog could still possess such an astonishing ability to confuse and entrap without any foundation.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>An explosive sound.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the residence was blasted open by a tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>A towering ominous shadow strode in.</p><p></p><p>It was a bloated corpse, swollen to a giant size.</p><p></p><p>This corpse was still wearing a rotten Daoist robe, on which the embroidered image of a soaring white crane could vaguely be seen.</p><p></p><p>The giant corpse gripped a huge, jet-black wolf-tooth club covered in vicious barbs.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone step back."</p><p></p><p>"The corpse fiend is ferocious, let me handle it!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Yi Chen was about to take action, Ning Feixue and the twin cultivators had already arrived. Ning took the lead, drawing the peach wood sword from behind his back to slash at the giant corpse fiend.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, spiritual powers clashed as the corpse fiend roared, and man and corpse became entangled in battle.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen stared at the giant corpse fiend with an uncertain expression, feeling that the robe it wore seemed familiar, like it belonged to an old acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the midst of its howling, a slender object could vaguely be seen protruding from its throat...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The red silk ribbon seemed to be hiding something. </p><p></p><p>This discovery made Yi Chen involuntarily think of a possibility. He looked around, his heart pounding with dread, even startled by his own guess. </p><p></p><p>If it really was like that, then...</p><p></p><p>"Good! Awesome!"  </p><p>"Truly awesome!"</p><p></p><p>No one knew what martial arts Ning Feixue practiced, but his speed was extremely fast. Under the moonlight, he turned into a streak, fluttering around the huge monster corpse like a butterfly, constantly looking for opportunities to slash with his sword from the east and west, drawing its aggression.</p><p></p><p>His speed was extremely fast, while the huge monster corpse's movements were relatively much clumsier. It infuriated the monster, making it howl incessantly.</p><p></p><p>However, the huge monster corpse was covered in a strange yellow greasy layer, its skin tough and meaty. For a while, the two were evenly matched, and the battle was intense.  </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the escorts from the Weiyan Escort Agency led by Zhang Bukai stood behind Yi Chen with their hands on their swords, unable to intervene in such a battle.</p><p></p><p>The two ladies, Zhusha and Qingrou, tightly gripped the corners of their clothes with their jade hands, excitedly watching the fight in the arena, their eyes turning into the shape of Ning Feixue.</p><p></p><p>Watching with bated breath, the two ladies couldn't help but wave their tender fists and shout:</p><p></p><p>"Go Brother Feixue!"</p><p></p><p>Especially the younger sister Qingrou, who frequently glanced towards Yi Chen's direction with a mocking expression as she cheered.</p><p></p><p>Encouraged by the two ladies, Ning Feixue seemed to have used some secret technique, and the aura of his spiritual power grew stronger.  </p><p></p><p>His speed increased even more.</p><p></p><p>He was pummeling the monster corpse with loud bangs, sparks flying everywhere, quite reminiscent of Lin Baihu's style.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Feixue stood tall and graceful, like an exiled immortal, with a seven-inch long Yang-attribute sword light emanating from his peach wood sword.</p><p></p><p>With every slash of his sword, he recited a line of poetry, quite flirtatious.</p><p></p><p>"One regret, the talented have no way."</p><p>"Two regrets, beauties have short lives."</p><p>"Three regrets, gobies have too many bones." </p><p>"Four regrets, crab-apple blossoms have no fragrance."</p><p>"Five regrets..."</p><p></p><p>There was no fifth regret, as Yi Chen could no longer watch. How long was Master Ning going to keep this up? His figure suddenly accelerated, causing the fallen leaves on the ground to swirl into the air. Yi Chen forcefully stomped his left foot towards the huge monster corpse's chest with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>A bone-chilling cracking sound rang out. The huge monster corpse's chest caved in, as if it had been kicked by a prehistoric mammoth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the onlookers, especially the ladies Zhusha and Qingrou, looked as if they had seen a ghost, their cheering voices abruptly stopping.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end. After kicking the huge monster corpse away with one foot, Yi Chen accelerated again, arriving ahead of it. His azure large hand resembled an eagle's claw as it grabbed the top of the monster's head, delivering an exceptionally powerful knee strike.</p><p></p><p>This knee strike nearly knocked the monster's eyeballs out.</p><p></p><p>At this point, everyone, including Ning Feixue, had their mouths agape, wide enough for a duck egg to fit.</p><p></p><p>But this still wasn't the end. Yi Chen's figure flickered, suddenly appearing above the huge monster corpse's body, and stomped down heavily on its spine.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a thunderous sound of shattering bones, the monster fell to the ground at an even faster speed than its ascent, its entire body embedded into the hard rocky surface.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, smoke and dust billowed, with cracks spreading out like a spider's web from the monster's body, causing the fallen leaves on the ground to scatter.</p><p></p><p>When the dust settled, everyone was stunned to see Yi Chen standing with one foot on the huge monster corpse's back. The monster's spinal cord was severed, with bone fragments protruding.</p><p></p><p>Such ferocity, such brute force!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the terrifying monster that Ning Feixue had been battling for a long time without success was instantly subdued.</p><p></p><p>"Dao...Daoist, you call this having formidable strength?" Ning Feixue trembled as he pointed at Yi Chen, his expression filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

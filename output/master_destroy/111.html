        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>One thousand six hundred deep red points were instantly deducted, and at the same time, a magnificent memory suddenly appeared in Yi Chen's mind. </p><p></p><p>It was the familiar scene of reading memories again.</p><p></p><p>The memories unfolded rapidly like watching a panoramic view.</p><p></p><p>Beside a thousand-foot waterfall, a Taoist lived in a thatched hut. </p><p></p><p>He watched the rising sun in the morning and the setting sun in the evening. After more than a dozen years of this, he regrettably made little progress.</p><p></p><p>He then left and began traveling the world with a bamboo staff and straw sandals.</p><p></p><p>He had seen thousands of miles of frozen land, snow flurries spanning millions of miles. Inside and outside the strategic passes, there was nothing but vast desolation. Along the great rivers, the once mighty currents disappeared.  </p><p></p><p>He had also witnessed the eruption of a long-dormant volcano that devastated the land. The powerful volcanic ash blocked out the sun, and all living things wailed in anguish.</p><p></p><p>He saw rivers bursting their banks, with tens of thousands of civilians joining hands to carry stones, like ants lining up one after another, jumping down perilous areas to block the breach, their united efforts astounding heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He had also witnessed plagues sweeping across thousands of miles, like the thrashing of an earth dragon.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the frivolous romantic atmosphere in wine cups and the fading beauty of women, generals growing old, and Buddhas with downcast eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist traveled the world, seeing himself, the heavens and earth, and all living beings. Finally, after a hundred years, he returned to the waterfall where he had originally lived in a thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>By then, the impurities in his heart had long been washed away by years of experience, leaving a state of pure clarity.  </p><p></p><p>He had realized the direction he should advance.</p><p></p><p>To further his practice of the Pure Yang Way to the current level, he would have to seek inwardly as well as outwardly.</p><p></p><p>During the day, the Taoist ventured deep into the mountains and marshes to gather rare herbs and slay demonic beasts, nourishing his body.</p><p></p><p>At night, he would sleep beneath the thousand-foot waterfall, tempering his spirit in pursuit of supernatural powers.</p><p></p><p>Day after day of replenishing himself, night after night of honing, his formidable spiritual willpower began to further integrate with his pale green inner energy, undergoing a metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>When the first strand of spiritual energy permeated the inner energy, becoming inseparable, a profound and abstruse transformation began to occur, unstoppably.</p><p></p><p>After more than a hundred years of effort beneath the waterfall, a Taoist stood bare-chested, revealing exceptionally powerful muscles. He raised his sword-like brows to greet the rising sun and chanted softly:</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang!"</p><p></p><p>Then he chanted again, louder:</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang! Pure Yang!" </p><p></p><p>And again, even louder:</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang! Pure Yang! Pure Yang!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist's chanting grew louder, more intense, and more rapid with each repetition!</p><p></p><p>The entire mountain forest trembled at the sound of his "Pure Yang" chant.</p><p></p><p>Birds and beasts were startled!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, boars dashed and wolves fled. Countless wild fruits rained down from the mountains, some falling into the water, others into the mud.</p><p></p><p>A sound wave called Pure Yang swept out wave after wave for hundreds of miles into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Over two thousand meters away from the Taoist, a long-tongued goblin was suddenly struck by this Pure Yang sound wave, instantly shattering its gall bladder and liver, its soul dissipating into oblivion.</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang! Pure Yang! Pure Yang! Pure Yang!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist stood beneath the thousand-foot waterfall, eyes bulging with fury, muscles knotted all over his body. After chanting "Pure Yang" four more times, he fell silent, then suddenly opened his mouth wide, inhaling sharply toward the rising sun while forming an esoteric hand seal.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist's body seethed with circulating energy. Even the raging thousand-foot waterfall could not wet him with a single drop.</p><p></p><p>With this movement, countless streaks of purple energy in the sky seemed to be drawn by an inexplicable force, rushing into the Taoist's body like a whale gulping water.</p><p></p><p>As the purple energy merged with his inner energy and combined with his powerful spiritual will, the pale green inner energy continuously metamorphosed toward a deeper shade of green, until the transformation was complete.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the end.</p><p></p><p>An even more intense transformation was about to occur.</p><p></p><p>With the influx of purple energy, the inner energy undulated, and the spiritual willpower thundered in the void. The combination of the three produced a profound, abstruse change.</p><p></p><p>Like 3D printing, a deep green aura that seemed both illusory and real gradually appeared, enveloping the Taoist's body.</p><p></p><p>It started with the soles of the feet, then the calves and thighs, followed by the waist, abdomen, and chest, and finally the neck.</p><p></p><p>However, the transformation seemed to falter when it reached the head.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Taoist slapped his chest, threw his arms open, and let out a mighty roar facing the sky!</p><p></p><p>Two deep red lines suddenly shot up from his chest and abdomen, reaching his brow and forming an intricate, esoteric pattern that flickered mysteriously, as if something profound was gestating within.</p><p></p><p>Countless visible rays of light in the sky were also drawn like iron filings to a magnet, merging into the Taoist's deep green aura to complete the final transformation.</p><p></p><p>The illusory deep green aura finally formed a head.</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, the two-meter-tall Taoist stood beneath the thousand-foot waterfall, untouched by a single drop.</p><p></p><p>His muscular body was like a masterpiece sculpted by the finest artist, neither too bulky nor lacking in a sense of solidity and power.</p><p></p><p>At his brow was an intricate, flickering red pattern that seemed to contain some profound mystery.</p><p></p><p>Around the Taoist's body stood a three-meter-tall, imposing illusory deep green aura.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the aura, deep green inner energy pulsed and flickered.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist raised his head and gazed at the sky.</p><p></p><p>His illusory aura also raised its head, following his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>As the transformation completed, a burst of exhilarated laughter erupted from the Taoist's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Sheer bliss.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long, ringing shout of laughter.</p><p></p><p>"The True Yang Celestial Body!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the Taoist stomped his foot beneath the waterfall and instantly shot upwards against the current, reaching the source of the waterfall in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The memory ended abruptly there.</p><p></p><p>It was like Yi Chen had just watched an accelerated stream-of-consciousness movie.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Countless insights emerged in his heart, as if he had truly experienced many years of cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Through the simulated cultivation, under the reflection of his spiritual mind, Yichen's inner qi also underwent a transformation, gradually changing from a light azure color to a deep azure hue, completing the full transition in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Pure Yang True Cultivation, ninth level, achieved!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with the circulation of the deep azure inner qi, earth-shattering changes began to occur within Yichen's body.</p><p></p><p>His muscles continuously tore apart and reorganized. Every single muscle fiber became tougher than the materials used for aircraft arresting cables. The bonds between cells became even tighter. His originally somewhat bulky muscles transformed into the appearance of the Taoist cultivators from his memory shards, as if sculpted by the hands of the most exceptional artist.</p><p></p><p>Powerful yet not bulky, exuding an aura of solidity and strength at a single glance.  </p><p></p><p>Even his bones were imbued with a tinge of deep azure under the constant scouring of the deep azure inner qi. More strange patterns spread across his bones, linking his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Yichen had thought his physical body, which was difficult to advance further, became increasingly powerful under the circulation of the deep azure inner qi, its density further enhanced. This caused his current normal state height to revert to two meters without any increase, but he now emanated a far more formidable aura than before.</p><p></p><p>Strength, immensely ferocious strength, surged within him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before his breakthrough, he felt as if he had entered an entirely new realm.</p><p></p><p>A flash of delight flickered in Yichen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The ninth level of Pure Yang True Cultivation, impeccable!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a virtual light screen appeared on his retina.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yichen]</p><p>[Lifespan: 18/261]</p><p>[Strength: 82, {Strength Domain Breakthrough x1: Penetrating Lv1 (force imbued with shockwave penetration effect), Force Constitution Lv1 (force attribute effect amplified by 20%)}</p><p>Stamina: 77, {Stamina Domain Breakthrough x1: Overload Charging Lv1 (upon full charge, stamina and total qi tripled), Overload Recovery Lv1 (stamina consumption doubled, bodily self-healing increased fivefold)}</p><p>Spirit: 67, {Spirit Domain Breakthrough x1: Spirit Domination Lv1 (spirit fortification, enhanced soul spell impact defense)}</p><p>Agility: 67, {Agility Domain Breakthrough x1: Swiftness Lv1 (agility attribute effect amplified by 10%)}]</p><p></p><p>[Cultivation Method: Pure Yang True Cultivation Ninth Level (Qualities: Robust Body, Blazing, Divine Force, Demon Repelling, Tenacity, Qi Recovery, Ignition, True Yang, Invincible). Active Skills: True Yang Supremacy (azure flames scorch the heavens, imbued upon self, greatly enhancing physical attributes and qi vitality, law-breaking ability strengthened, duration 30 minutes, no weakness period)</p><p></p><p>Active Skill: Soul Ignition (nothing burns hotter than the ignition of one's potential, burning lifespan in exchange for power, currently igniting 3 years of lifespan increases strength and qi by 50%, maximum 5x power increase.)</p><p></p><p>Active Skill: True Yang Divine Body (uniting spirit, qi, and mind into one, the Divine Body, by expending immense qi force, summons one's True Yang Divine Body, granting boundless might, law-breaking, fortification, and divine awe qualities, duration 8 minutes.)]</p><p></p><p>[Cultivation Method: Yin-Yang Spirit Eye Technique Fourth Level (Qualities: Eagle Eye, Night Vision, Yin Qi Perception, Mind's Eye Reflection Lv1, Malice Perception Lv1.)]</p><p></p><p>[Passive Skills: Painting Lv1, Red Celebration Hosting Lv2, White Funeral Hosting Lv3, Culinary Lv3]</p><p></p><p>[Origin Points: 0] </p><p>[Deep Crimson Value: 156]</p><p></p><p>Qi! Qi! Qi!</p><p></p><p>Such an amplification was simply terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The foundation for preserving his life became even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>In this breakthrough, not only did Yichen fully recover the 10 years of lifespan lost from Soul Ignition, but he also gained an additional 50 years, reaching the astonishing lifespan of 261 years.</p><p></p><p>Such a lifespan could be considered a pure profit. As for the four attributes, there was no need to elaborate further, as they all experienced significant growth.</p><p></p><p>Especially his strength and stamina, the two major attributes, were now far from the threshold of the second domain breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>After his inner qi deepened to azure, the duration of True Yang Supremacy reached a full 30 minutes. However, the greater gain was—</p><p></p><p>A new active skill, True Yang Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>According to Yichen's previous memories, when unleashing the True Yang Divine Body, his strength was simply formidable, even surpassing his peak after pushing Soul Ignition to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Yichen to truly step through the gates of the Zhenren realm of refining spirit and negating falsity.</p><p></p><p>"The scenes from my memories are ultimately separated from my true self by a veil. Why not try the might of the True Yang Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly sprouted in Yichen's mind.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it, he did it. Yichen gazed at the barrier formed by the formation and let out a ferocious laugh as his mind activated the technique.</p><p></p><p>"True Yang Divine Body!" he roared inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The deep azure inner qi erupted forth, and a three-meter-tall giant Taoist figure suddenly appeared over Yichen's body, its face identical to his own, both real and illusory.</p><p></p><p>With his thoughts guiding the motion, the three-meter-tall giant transformed into a deep azure rainbow and swung its fist, fiercely smashing into the formation barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Open up for me!" Yichen roared as he punched the formation barrier.</p><p></p><p>Ripples spread outward!</p><p></p><p>Then the waves dissipated...</p><p></p><p>Yichen's face instantly turned as black as the bottom of a wok.</p><p></p><p>This one doesn't count.</p><p></p><p>Wulawulawulawulawula!</p><p></p><p>Yichen, enveloped by the illusory figure surrounding him, continuously threw punches, the qi force raging like a furious tide, whipping up thousands of waves, crashing like mountains into the sea upon the formation barrier.</p><p></p><p>After a minute, the barrier's color faded, becoming semi-transparent, transparent, and finally disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The four thick iron pillars supporting the formation suddenly exploded, shattering into three segments each.</p><p></p><p>The formation, broken!</p><p>The path, cleared!</p><p></p><p>I don't often display the status panel, and I've condensed some of the introductions. It's really not appropriate to omit it.</p><p></p><p>I've intentionally added 174 extra words to compensate, which should not require any payment since it's less than 200 words.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

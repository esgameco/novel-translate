        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>They took their seats and were served tea.</p><p></p><p>Yichen sat at the left seat, while another Taoist priest with white hair and a youthful face sat at the right seat. </p><p></p><p>After exchanging glances, they confirmed they were from the same sect.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Wang family, Wang Ba, and his wife sat at the main seats.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Yicheng, the old lady of our family is about to pass away soon. I don't know why my second brother invited you, but he also took the liberty of inviting Venerable Baihe, a highly accomplished Taoist from my wife's family."</p><p></p><p>"Since you are both highly accomplished Taoists, why don't you two venerables jointly handle the funeral matters?"</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was the head of the Wang family, Wang Ba. When Yichen first heard his name, he thought he would be a rugged and heroic man, but upon meeting him, he realized this head of the Wang family looked more like a middle-aged scholar well-versed in poetry and books.</p><p></p><p>He spoke in a calm and unhurried manner, with a tinge of sadness in his tone, likely due to the imminent passing of the old lady of the Wang family.</p><p></p><p>Yichen and the Venerable Baihe naturally had no objections and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the wife of the head of the Wang family, sitting beside him, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, in all matters there is a main and secondary role. For these funeral matters, who will be the main lead and who will be the assistant between Venerable Yicheng and Venerable Baihe?"</p><p></p><p>The wife of the head was an elegant beauty with a graceful demeanor and alluring curves. She wore a rose-colored long-sleeved dress that accentuated her fiery figure, yet her expression was as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>This caught Yichen's attention, and he couldn't help but take another look.</p><p></p><p>Truly an icy rose of fire and ice.</p><p></p><p>However, he also couldn't help but feel puzzled. As the daughter-in-law, why was the wife of the head wearing such vibrant colors when the old lady was about to pass away?</p><p></p><p>What surprised Yichen even more was that he detected traces of yin ghost energy lingering on the wife, although the aura was already very faint. Nevertheless, his heightened senses could still perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"Is this wife of the head the one nurturing ghosts behind the scenes, or has she come into contact with evil spirits recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Things are getting more and more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Yichen's thoughts deepened, but despite having many questions, he remained calm, maintaining an old and wise appearance of observing with his eyes and heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, as for who takes the lead, this matter is quite simple," said the Venerable Baihe sitting across from Yichen.</p><p></p><p>"In learning, there is no seniority. The accomplished takes precedence. I wonder what Taoist practices Venerable Yicheng excels in?"</p><p></p><p>"This poor Taoist has some understanding of the pure yang path," Yichen replied.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Does the Venerable know the fire bead technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Um, no."</p><p></p><p>"The art of scattering beans to form an army?"</p><p></p><p>"Um, no."</p><p></p><p>"Seeking the dragon's acupuncture points or the art of observing qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Um, a rudimentary understanding."</p><p></p><p>"Then what aspect is the Venerable most skilled in?"</p><p></p><p>Yichen fell silent for a moment before speaking:</p><p></p><p>"This poor Taoist has some strength in internal energy that could be considered noteworthy..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Venerable Baihe immediately stopped and uttered his Taoist title before falling silent.</p><p></p><p>As a master of the green tea art, he knew the brewing had reached the optimal point.</p><p></p><p>"Since Venerable Baihe is the senior with more experience, why don't we have Venerable Baihe take the lead, and Venerable Yicheng assist in handling the subsequent funeral matters? How about that?" the wife of the head interjected.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, it was clear who would take the primary and secondary roles.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Baihe now had a smug expression on his face, constantly stroking his three goatee whiskers.</p><p></p><p>Yichen did not argue and agreed to the arrangement.</p><p></p><p>This Venerable Baihe was someone the wife of the head had brought from her maiden family, so her bias was evident. Yichen, on the other hand, was invited by the younger brother of the head of the Wang family.</p><p></p><p>Some matters were about taking sides, and arguing would be pointless.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to get involved in the conflicts of interest within this prominent family. It did not matter who took the lead or supporting role, as long as he was paid accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the moment he entered the Wang residence, he sensed something amiss, feeling that things were not as simple as they seemed. Venerable Baihe's skill in the green tea art was also quite formidable, not inferior to his own. Yichen...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Dust simply decided to play dumb and go with the flow for now. </p><p></p><p>Let White Crane Daoist perform on the stage, while he secretly observes the whole situation.</p><p></p><p>Heh, did White Crane Daoist really think his sly and smug expression could be hidden from Dust now?</p><p></p><p>This person could hardly know that fate's gifts always had a hidden price tag each time.</p><p></p><p>When he asked Dust what dharma skills he excelled at, Dust's reply that "This penniless one does have some physical strength worth mentioning" was actually him setting a trap, playing dumb intentionally. </p><p></p><p>Dust guessed that when White Crane Daoist heard him say that, he must have laughed his teeth out, thinking he had encountered an honest fool.</p><p></p><p>However, this situation was merely the scenario Dust wanted to see, just going with the flow.</p><p></p><p>You all see me as a fool, I see you all as fools too.  </p><p></p><p>No need to rush, the good show has just begun, let me play along with them for now.</p><p></p><p>Under the lead of a servant, Dust and White Crane Daoist withdrew to a side courtyard, and the main hall regained its quiet solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"Madam, Dharma Master Yicheng was the candidate recommended by my second brother-in-law. Is it appropriate for us to do this?" The head of the Wang family couldn't help but say in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang raised her arched eyebrows with a hint of anger, "You still dare to say that? The old lady's great ritual is imminent, and your second brother hasn't returned yet. Let's see what kind of weirdo he has found to preside over the old lady's ritual."</p><p></p><p>"Just having 'some physical strength worth mentioning', how much strength could that be? Our Wang manor is a great affluent household, we are not lacking people of great physical power. Did he really need to find some Daoist priest known just for physical strength to preside over the ritual?"</p><p></p><p>"Should we let the oxen in the manor take a break from plowing the fields, and have this 'strong person' do the plowing instead?"</p><p></p><p>After Lady Wang's barrage of criticism, the head of the Wang family showed an embarrassed look and did not rebut further. He was a timid person. Although he guessed his wife probably had some intention to use this as an excuse to demand a bigger share of the family assets later, he would also benefit from it, so he remained silent in tacit agreement.</p><p></p><p>Night, Wang Manor, dining hall.</p><p></p><p>Thick tallow candles lit up the entire grand hall as bright as daylight.</p><p></p><p>This small dining hall was intricately carved with painted beams and rafters, surrounded by displays of blue porcelain and antiques, exuding an air of opulence.</p><p></p><p>Dust sat at the lower seat next to White Crane Daoist, as everyone took their seats for the meal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was fiercely battling the roasted lamb chops in his hands. He opened his big mouth wide, and the little lamb ribs were devoured one by one, as if they were sugarcane stalks.</p><p></p><p>No, it was even more ferocious than eating sugarcane. When eating sugarcane, one still had to spit out the fibrous residue, but he was chewing the bones and meat into pieces and swallowing them whole into his belly.</p><p></p><p>Like master, like pet - little Meow's eating manners were just as unrestrained as its owner's. Hugging a large lamb rib bone from the big bowl in front of it, it was gnawing away with oil dripping all over its mouth and fur, not caring about the mess at all.</p><p></p><p>Seated in the upper seat next to Dust, White Crane Daoist's eating manners were much more refined.  </p><p></p><p>Even Dust had to admit that White Crane Daoist really had a good appearance. With a youthful face framed by crane-like white hair, neatly combed without a single strand out of place, he wore a purple Daoist robe embroidered with golden threads along the edges. The back was embroidered with mountains, rivers and lakes, while the front depicted the sun, moon and stars - quite an imposing sight.</p><p></p><p>White Crane Daoist paid no attention to the lamb chops on his plate, only occasionally taking a few bites of fruit and plain tea, not even drinking wine, as he was fasting for the ritual for the old lady.</p><p></p><p>Beside White Crane Daoist stood a completely white crane, with a long, graceful neck. Just like its master, it only occasionally ate a few grapes and drank some plain water. From time to time, it would also sneak a glance at little Meow, who was devouring everything in sight, but it dared not meet Meow's gaze directly, quickly averting its eyes as if terrified.</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang and the head of the Wang family sat in the uppermost seats. Watching Dust's eating manner, the head shook his head. What kind of person did his second brother actually find? This was too unreliable.  </p><p></p><p>What eminent figure would have such uncouth eating habits? If not for the Daoist robe he was wearing, he would look more like an uncultured ruffian.</p><p></p><p>It seemed his wife's decision was correct and wise.</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang could not help but reveal a hint of disdain in her eyes as she watched Dust eat.  </p><p></p><p>It was a good thing she had urgently invited the powerful and highly respected White Crane Daoist from her maiden family to come preside over the ritual. Otherwise...it would have been ruined.</p><p></p><p>Ahem...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

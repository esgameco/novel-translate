        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei's fists clenched, he kept silently reciting in his heart, "This is my own flesh and blood, my own flesh and blood," only then was he able to suppress the anger in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the matter was settled - Lin Baihu would go investigate this incident. </p><p></p><p>Outside Yinlong Guan (Hidden Dragon Monastery), Yi Chen respectfully saw off father and son Lin Zhenbei.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed Lin Zhenbei remembered something, and couldn't help but ask: "Daoist master, I have a good friend in the county city who cannot return home due to official duties."</p><p></p><p>"His wife has passed away, and he has entrusted me to find an eminent monk to preside over the funeral rites. I wonder if the Daoist master has time?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Yi Chen was stunned for a moment upon hearing this, then blurted out, "How much silver will the main family offer? It's not like before, this poor monk charges quite expensively now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhenbei held up one finger.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen pursed his lips and said, "Only a hundred taels? With that little money, I could at most chant for one night."</p><p></p><p>"No, it's one thousand taels. My friend is from an affluent family with vast lands and numerous shops."</p><p></p><p>"Whew, Lord of a Thousand Households speaks truly. Your matters are my matters, your friends are my friends, your friend's deceased wife is my deceased wife."</p><p></p><p>"We're all friends."</p><p></p><p>"Whenever the elder passes away, just send someone with a message."</p><p></p><p>"This poor monk will do his utmost to ensure the elder departs in grand style."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen immediately beamed with joy.</p><p></p><p>He had saved up some silver now, but could there ever be too much money?</p><p></p><p>He remembered his master's dying wish to expand Hidden Dragon Monastery.</p><p></p><p>However, with just himself and a few junior disciples, a few small cats, how could they expand Hidden Dragon Monastery?</p><p></p><p>They must open the mountain gates wide and acquire more land.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to lay the framework before returning the jade token to Old Celestial Master on Dragon Tiger Mountain, then have his junior disciples begin the expansion.</p><p></p><p>After that, he would find some orphans of good character to take in as disciples and train diligently, hoping to cultivate some promising seedlings.</p><p></p><p>For Hidden Dragon Monastery to truly flourish, it could not be without people.</p><p></p><p>Each of these tasks would consume vast sums, the little he had saved previously was far from enough.</p><p></p><p>One thousand taels, good money for little work close to home, coming from Lord of a Thousand Households Lin himself - he intended to take this job.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Lin, have some roasted chestnuts."  </p><p></p><p>"Very plump ones, I picked the big ones for you."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qingfeng and Mingyue came running over.</p><p></p><p>Human children are especially endearing, especially the two little ones with rosy lips and white teeth, extremely adorable.</p><p></p><p>Bathed in the warmth of the rising sun, father and son Lin Zhenbei carried the chestnuts, a wooden box holding the jade case, heading off into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight shone on the two of them, casting a narrow shadow behind, outlining their figures in a golden glow, looking most warm and familial.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the two off, Yi Chen let out a soft sigh before returning to the monastery.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why, but watching their backs, he suddenly missed his deceased master a little.</p><p></p><p>An indescribable sadness welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without realizing it, his master had already been gone for over two months.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the emotions in his heart, he returned to the main hall, burned three sticks of incense properly for his master and ancestral masters, before going back to his room.</p><p></p><p>A huge azure egg about twenty-odd centimeters long lay quietly on his bed, the purple and red patterns on the egg flickering like breathing lights, glowing and dimming in alternation.</p><p></p><p>After closing the door, this change became even more apparent.</p><p></p><p>Lord of a Thousand Households Lin had said this spirit beast egg was obtained by him long ago in an ancient ruin, nearly costing his life - it feeds on pure yang energy.</p><p></p><p>Normally he nurtured it with yang attribute spirit stones in an array formation, and after ten years, observing the life force pulsing within the egg, it would hatch any day, perhaps even today.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you become Hidden Dragon Monastery's azure fierce beast. If I am unlucky enough to pass away someday, you can protect this Hidden Dragon Monastery for me."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel into English:</p><p></p><p>Yichen let out a light sigh in his heart, and then touched his fingers to the eggshell. </p><p></p><p>As he infused it with the deep purple pure yang inner qi from within his body, the life inside the giant egg responded with rich joy and excitement.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had previously only eaten fast food, while the pure yang qi that Yichen was infusing into it was like meticulously prepared delicacies.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Zhenbei was not a cultivator of the pure yang path, so the pure yang qi generated by stimulating the yang-attribute spirit stones with formations was far less mellow and high-quality than Yichen's inner qi.</p><p></p><p>As the deep purple inner qi flowed into the giant egg like a trickle of a stream, the red-purple patterns on the eggshell shone more and more brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you can really absorb it, huh? I'll stuff you full," Yichen said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Half a hour passed.</p><p>One hour passed. </p><p>Two hours passed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Daoist priest's mentality underwent a subtle change. He opened the door, allowing sunlight to enter the room.</p><p></p><p>The light from outside was like being attracted by a magnet, pouring in large amounts into Yichen's body. The light in the backyard dimmed slightly due to this change, and the endless light was also replenishing Yichen's expended inner qi.</p><p></p><p>"The little thing can really absorb it!"</p><p></p><p>Four hours passed, and as the sun set in the west, Yichen felt numb all over. Even with the sunlight's recovery and replenishment, he felt a sense of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also felt extremely excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As expected of the future Azure Fierce Beast of my Yinlong Monastery, look at the coloring of this shell, look at this appetite - I don't know what kind of spirit beast it belongs to.</p><p></p><p>Is it a dragon eagle? Or some kind of spirit bird?</p><p></p><p>Or is it some kind of celestial spirit seed? Hahaha, if that's the case, then I've really hit the jackpot. It's not for nothing that I painstakingly schemed all this.</p><p></p><p>The classics do record stories of certain cultivators with astonishing luck who brought out celestial spirit seeds from ruins, and then relied on eating the spiritual food of their own spirit beasts to slay all around them.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the abnormalities of this spirit egg, the spirit beast inside must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as the sun set, the giant egg's bottomless pit of an appetite was slowly filled. Finally, it stopped absorbing Yichen's pure yang inner qi at an increasingly slower and lesser rate until it no longer absorbed any more.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the brilliance of the red-purple patterns on the eggshell also reached its peak, with the light swirling in an mystical way.</p><p></p><p>An abstruse aura seeped out amidst the swirling light.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>A thin crack appeared on the eggshell.</p><p></p><p>"Is it coming out? Haha."</p><p></p><p>"Better late than never, I didn't expect this spirit beast egg would hatch today. This thing is indeed connected to my Yinlong Monastery."</p><p></p><p>More and more cracks spread across the eggshell, shattering it open.</p><p></p><p>"Come out, Azure Fierce Beast of my Yinlong Monastery, the spirit beast guardian of the monastery!"</p><p></p><p>Yichen let out a furious roar.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>From inside the spirit egg, a little black kitten broke out of the shell, letting out a meow. Its fur was glossy black, and it had a pair of small fleshy wings on its sides.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's voice abruptly stopped, as if someone was choking him.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell, this can't be real."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Azure Fierce Beast of my Yinlong Monastery?"  </p><p></p><p>"How did an egg hatch into a cat? Even if it has a pair of small fleshy wings, even if the Ancestral Master came today, this is just a black cat."</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow," the black kitten meowed again. It lightly leapt onto Yichen's shoulder, affectionately licking his face with its pink tongue, looking adorably cute.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's face instantly turned black as coal.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to those who voted for me today and have been leaving supportive comments. </p><p></p><p>I'll give a unified thanks tomorrow. See you tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>For those who haven't invested resources, you can invest some. Bye for now.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

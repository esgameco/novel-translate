        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Everyone heard this and immediately retreated another two hundred meters back. </p><p></p><p>Yi Chen looked at the billowing pinkish mist rising from the Yang Family Moat Fortress, his brows tightly knitted, no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>After churning a few times, the misty vapor still could not break free from the confines of the Yang Family Moat Fortress. As if finally resigned, it suddenly contracted towards the center and once again seeped into the ground.  </p><p></p><p>By this time, it was already broad daylight, and the scene inside the Yang Family Moat Fortress reappeared before everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's pupils involuntarily constricted. </p><p></p><p>Aided by the daylight, they saw Yang Yuyan, dressed in white, standing at the breach in the fortress wall, her body fully restored. Behind her stood her mutated army, neatly arrayed in formation.</p><p></p><p>Yang Yuyan turned her head, her gaze ominously fixed on Yi Chen and the others. Her mutated army also turned their heads in unison, their myriad eyes chilling to the bone.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Yi Chen felt that although this Yang Yuyan had been revived, she was no longer the original Yang Yuyan, as if her core had been switched.</p><p></p><p>'Yang Yuyan's' lips moved, as if wanting to say something, but ultimately no sound came out. She stared deeply in Yi Chen's direction, threw back her head and let out an inhuman screech, then retreated with her mutated army back into the depths of the fortress, disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen frowned as he watched the scene before him. If his rudimentary lip-reading skills were correct, it seemed 'Yang Yuyan' wanted to say "We'll meet again."</p><p></p><p>"We'll meet again?"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen smacked his lips, silently repeating the words twice, then a ferocious smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Worthless snack."</p><p></p><p>"Whether you've had your core switched or not, if I could kill you once, I can kill you again."</p><p></p><p>After inwardly mocking her twice, Yi Chen motioned for Lin Baihu and the others to prepare to withdraw, leaving two or three riders behind to keep watch.</p><p></p><p>He had already done enough this time. From here, he would have to trust in the wisdom of the imperial court and the great clans.</p><p></p><p>Even if the sky were to fall, there would be tall people to prop it up. No need to panic.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lin, let's withdraw. Report the true situation. We've done all we can do."</p><p></p><p>"That monster is highly polluting and grows rapidly. It's basically unkillable. But fortunately its range of activity is limited. For now, dispatch people to drive away any humans or animals nearby. It would be best to build a wall encircling the entire Yang Family Moat Fortress to contain it."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if that monster continues spreading its contamination and breaks out of the enclosure, things will get very troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"This matter is settled for now. I've been away from the monastery for many days, so I'll head back first."</p><p></p><p>"As for infusing the Sun's True Gold into the Dragon Slaying Sword, I'll have to trouble you to handle that, Brother Lin."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen unsheathed the Dragon Slaying Sword and handed it to Lin Zhengyi, then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the Daoist master's help this time. Don't worry, leave the Dragon Slaying Sword to me. Once the fusion is complete, I'll personally deliver it to the master."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yi Chen's intention to take his leave, Lin Baihu did not try to stop him. He had many matters of his own - he still needed to immediately report the Yang Family Moat Fortress incident up the chain at the Zhen'an Ministry, the deceased soldiers needed to be compensated, he was overwhelmed on all fronts.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Baihu had only a few riders remaining to keep watch, taking the rest of the soldiers away with him at top speed.</p><p></p><p>"Little Meow, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen called out, and Little Meow leapt onto his shoulder in one bound. Earlier for safety reasons, he had not brought Little Meow into the Yang Family Moat Fortress, instead leaving it with the soldiers keeping watch outside.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow" (Father, can you not call me Little Meow anymore? I want to change my name.)</p><p></p><p>With a meow, Little Meow reluctantly jumped onto Yi Chen's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Well now, there were even a few white cat hairs stuck to his clothes.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It looked like the fur of a Persian cat or a Ragdoll cat. </p><p></p><p>Or perhaps a combination of both.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen: "......" What a good kid, I was worried about your safety, so I didn't take you inside. But in just one night, where did you go fooling around? You've only just hatched a few days ago, do you even know this counts as young love?</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen inwardly ranted crazily, he lightly patted the little kitten's head without much patience.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't call you little kitten, then should I call you Sang Biao (rascal)?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop your babbling, let's go, let's go."</p><p></p><p>He ignored the little kitten's protests, finally turning to look back at the Yang Family Moat Fort behind him, then strode off in the direction of Yin Long Guan (Hidden Dragon Monastery). </p><p></p><p>The Yang Family Moat Fort stood silently behind him, like a scar on the earth, hard to erase.</p><p></p><p>As for how many such scars would be on the earth in the future, only Heaven knows.</p><p></p><p>â€”</p><p></p><p>The east is not bright, the west is bright</p><p>I bask in the remaining sun, basking in sorrow</p><p>Not busy the night before, busy the night after  </p><p>Dreamed of gold, I dream of utopia</p><p></p><p>Spring rain does not wet the intimate ghost</p><p>Autumn chill pierces the infatuated lover</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Humming a little tune from his previous life, Yi Chen began leisurely hurrying back.</p><p></p><p>Passing by the Clear Water River, although the flood had receded and the bridge could be walked on normally, at the little kitten's strong insistence, Yi Chen still peeled a round log and let the little kitten experience the thrill of being a 'shrimp catcher' again.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the journey went smoothly, with no unusual incidents occurring.</p><p></p><p>Except for a green snake that suddenly darted out from the roadside bushes, trying to attack Yi Chen, but was stomped to death by him, that was the only exception.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his extraordinary footwork, around the shen (3-5pm) period, Yin Long Guan was already in sight.</p><p></p><p>"Big Martial Brother is back, Big Martial Brother is back!"</p><p></p><p>From afar, Qing Feng and Ming Yue, the two little ones, saw the tall Taoist walking towards the monastery. With those arms, that waistline, who else could it be if not their admired Big Martial Brother?</p><p></p><p>The two little ones' joyful mood also infected Yi Chen. After being away for ten days, this feeling of having someone waiting didn't seem too bad.</p><p></p><p>Carrying one under each arm, he laughed heartily as he crossed into the monastery with them.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, Yin Long Guan was exceptionally filled with joyful atmosphere. A whole table of chicken, duck, and meat, all kinds of fruits and mushrooms, the four martial brothers were all very happy. Even Qing Yun Zi, who usually doesn't drink much, accompanied Yi Chen for a couple cups of wine.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were no fish on the dining table.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At night, Yi Chen opened the window, standing with his hands behind his back, welcoming the evening breeze to blow into his sleeves, making his robe flutter loudly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he thought about many things.</p><p></p><p>With the world in turmoil, what chance is there for an intact egg under the overturned nest?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after he breaks through his current boundary, he can prepare to journey to Long Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>Considering he returned the jade token to the old Celestial Master, Long Hu Shan would likely reveal some information to him about the underworld and the crimson meteor, so he could make early preparations.</p><p></p><p>"But relying on the mountain, the mountain may collapse. Relying on people, people may leave."</p><p></p><p>"To forge iron, one must be tough themselves."  </p><p></p><p>"I still need to work hard on cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the deep night sky, a fierce glint flashed in Yi Chen's eyes. He closed the window, took out the jade thunder bead he kept on his person, took a deep breath, and reached for the green beautiful jade.</p><p></p><p>"Come on."</p><p></p><p>"If one is not ruthless, one cannot stand firm."</p><p></p><p>The little kitten cried out strangely at this, scurrying up onto the roof beam in a flash.</p><p></p><p>In the small room, a tall Taoist practiced martial arts all night, while a black cat silently perched on the beam, watching all night, an exceptionally harmonious scene.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

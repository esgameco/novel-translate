        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, from far to near, the ground began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this thing?" </p><p></p><p>"Everyone be careful."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Lianhua warned everyone in a low voice. </p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's smile froze on his face again.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly drew out his battle knife, wanting to say something more, but was collectively glared back by the others.</p><p></p><p>Some people's mouths did indeed bring bad luck, top-notch jinx mouths.</p><p></p><p>At this time, they had clearly seen the enemy that was attacking was a sacred being.</p><p></p><p>A giant paper man over three meters tall stood in front of them, and behind it, more than twenty small paper men stood densely, fully armed with weapons that flickered with a faint blue glow.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, they were imbued with deadly poison.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Daoist Qingxu's face instantly darkened, and he quietly moved closer towards Yi Chen's direction.</p><p></p><p>His sixth sense told him that in critical moments, he still had to rely on Daoist Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Kill...you all!" </p><p></p><p>The giant paper man waved a copper rod as thick as a washbowl towards the crowd, with the small paper men following closely behind in droves.</p><p></p><p>A few sinister little paper men even secretly shot cold arrows halfway, completely disregarding martial ethics.</p><p></p><p>Several of the cold arrows shot straight at three inches below Venerable Lianhua's navel.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this squad of paper men surpassed the previous squad in both intelligence and cunning, even understanding the principle of injuring the thumb rather than cutting off the finger.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Venerable Lianhua's face darkened. This was too bullying.</p><p></p><p>They singled him out to be devious.</p><p>How vicious!</p><p></p><p>He joined his palms together, quickly taking off the beads from his hand and chanting.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha!"</p><p></p><p>A point of golden light appeared from Venerable Lianhua's joined palms, suddenly expanding into a large golden ball, tightly enveloping his figure, instantly turning him into a large light bulb.</p><p></p><p>At the critical juncture, several arrows were deflected by the light shield.</p><p></p><p>At this time, beads of sweat appeared on Venerable Lianhua's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Although he was old and a monk without any...use for that, he didn't want to be completely useless either.</p><p></p><p>So he decisively used his ultimate protective technique, the Golden Light Shield, to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yi Chen had no time to pay attention to him, his focus was firmly fixed on the giant paper man in front.</p><p></p><p>"Such strong demonic energy."</p><p>"This one definitely has a deep red dot."</p><p></p><p>Oh no, the enemy strikes swiftly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yi Chen felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Ever since entering Lanxiu Building, they had been under one wave of...ambushes after another.  </p><p></p><p>That's right, ambushes.</p><p></p><p>But the mastermind behind it all had not shown up, instead recklessly sending squad after squad of paper men to drain them.</p><p></p><p>"They really don't want us to advance?"</p><p>"Then I'll do the opposite on purpose."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's speed could not be considered slow, but there was someone whose speed was even faster.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's expression was grim as he drew his battle knife, his whole body turning into an afterimage as he dashed towards the giant paper man.</p><p></p><p>"Fierce Wind Â· Stardust"</p><p></p><p>A green aura surrounded Lin Baihu's body, and with the enhancement of this magical power, his speed was as fast as lightning. In the blink of an eye, his knife was hacking at the giant paper man's body, sparks flying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The enraged giant paper man swung the copper rod in its hand, but could not keep up with Lin Baihu's speed at all.</p><p></p><p>One side could not break through the defense, while the other could not even catch up. Lin Baihu tried to land a vicious blow on the paper demon's eyes several times, but was always forced back by the paper demon's copper rod.</p><p></p><p>He dared not directly block such a large rod, as a single hit from that would make him feel like the Lin family lineage would end.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the two quickly reached a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yi Chen had a thought and did not immediately join the encirclement of the giant paper man. Instead, he drew the Dragon Slaying Sword and charged towards the group of small paper men.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Let this tall paper demon play around for a bit. </p><p></p><p>He'll go and get rid of those disgusting little paper people first.</p><p></p><p>"You...damn filthy bugs!"</p><p></p><p>"There is a way to die!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen let out an angry roar, holding the Dragon Slaying Sword and charging towards the little paper people. </p><p></p><p>These goddamn little paper people actually dared to shoot cold arrows at three inches below his lower abdomen, they were utterly lawless.</p><p></p><p>Are they looking down on Sir's sword skills?</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll help you!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, under the fearless siege of the paper people, Water Moon Master was already in a difficult situation. The water dragon she released had already been cut into three sections by the surrounding little paper people and naturally dissipated. Now in front of her was the second water dragon she struggled to summon, and the situation was precarious.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen exerted force with his right foot, pushing off the ground. His deep purple pure yang inner energy permeated his body, and he charged out like a cannonball, directly beheading with one sword a paper archer hiding in the dark shooting cold arrows.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he was like a tiger entering a flock of sheep, slashing and striking. In just a few breaths, he cleared out all the little paper people around Water Moon Master.  </p><p></p><p>It's not that Water Moon Master and the others were weak fighters. They followed the path of spell cultivation, and these paper people with great strength, fearlessness, and ridiculously high spell resistance were their natural enemies.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what devilish material these paper people were made from?</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen was the perfect counter to these monstrous little paper people.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the surrounding little paper people were basically cut into black ashes by Yi Chen, except for one that was only half a body crawling difficultly on the ground, its left hand gripping the floor, its right hand holding a sharp blade, looking very strained.</p><p></p><p>But it was no use.</p><p></p><p>In this world, it's not that if you try hard enough you'll definitely succeed or accomplish certain things.</p><p></p><p>In fact, some things, if you weren't born with them, you may never have them in this life.</p><p></p><p>The world is inherently unfair.</p><p></p><p>Some people are born in Rome, some are born donkeys.</p><p></p><p>Even more heartbreakingly, those born in Rome curse the little donkeys for not trying hard enough...</p><p></p><p>That little half-bodied paper person was like that - it had already tried its hardest. Then a large foot fell from above, directly crushing its head into an explosion of flames. Its remaining lower half also caught fire, leaving a black mark on the ground - the last trace of its existence in this world.</p><p></p><p>At this point, everyone had their hands free, and they all turned their gazes forward.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu was also covered in cold sweat. He didn't know what material this tall paper demon was made of, but it was unusually sturdy.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, everything was finally about to end.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the tall paper man, after his painstaking efforts, was already tattered and torn, with many parts burning with azure flames and emitting black smoke.  </p><p></p><p>He would soon be able to slay this paper demon.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Baihu was panting like a bellows at this point, he still persevered.</p><p></p><p>"One last strike to send you on your way."</p><p></p><p>"Raging Wind...Star..."</p><p></p><p>"Sneak attack~!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sword tip pierced through the throat of the tall paper demon from the inside.</p><p></p><p>With a light sweep of Yi Chen's sword, the tall paper demon's head fell to the ground, rolling to Lin Baihu's side.</p><p></p><p>A stream of information suddenly appeared on Yi Chen's retina:</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully killed the Paper Demon, gaining 25 deep red points.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's face flushed red with anger and frustration.</p><p></p><p>He felt terrible.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen, on the other hand, was all smiles.</p><p></p><p>Getting things for free is such a wonderful thing.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a pillar of blood-red light suddenly rose up in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expressions changed drastically as they rushed towards the source of the light pillar.</p><p></p><p>But alas, it was too late.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the old friend Old Dream_Ed, WSOPF, Wind Hurt Leaf, the last 4 digits 4010, and Purple Lightning Taoist for the monthly tickets.

Thank you to the last 4 digits 7818, Are the Gods There, and the last 4 digits 9243 for the rewards.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to friends who read to the end.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow is Tuesday, seeking a bonus update, the recommendation is only to look at tomorrow's bonus read, I am very grateful.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

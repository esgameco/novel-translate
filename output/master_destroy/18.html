        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, have you mentioned any of this to the second person? Including Qing Feng and Ming Yue as well." Yi Chen asked Qing Yun Zi seriously. </p><p></p><p>He thought more deeply than Qing Yun Zi, his junior martial brother indeed lived up to the Daoist name their master gave him, he would definitely soar straight into the azure clouds in the future.</p><p></p><p>But an ungrown talent, no matter how outstanding his gifts, would just be a handful of dirt if killed at a young age. </p><p></p><p>A luxuriant tree in the forest must be broken by the wind.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen had profound experience with this.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back, he was too outstanding in his previous life, which led to him being sent to this world by a mud truck...</p><p></p><p>"Ah...no, I've been waiting to tell you first when Senior Brother returns. I haven't said anything to Qing Feng or Ming Yue," Qing Yun Zi said with some surprise, looking at Yi Chen's solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then, Junior Brother, you don't know the dangers of the world."</p><p></p><p>"The mastermind behind the attacks on our Yin Long Sect still hasn't been found. If others knew of your talents, Junior Brother, I'm afraid you might be assassinated."  </p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter, come closer, Junior Brother. I don't understand the Pure Yang Dao or the cultivation of Supreme Yin powers, but I can teach you the Way of Survival. Follow my instructions and you'll be able to avoid disasters and reach the True Lord realm smoothly."</p><p></p><p>In this world, Daoist cultivation generally has four major realms: Refining Essence to Energy, Refining Energy to Spirit, Refining Spirit to Emptiness, Refining Emptiness to the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Those who Refine Spirit to Emptiness can be called True Lords.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's master claimed he had only barely reached the middle stage of Refining Energy to Spirit, still 108,000 li away from the True Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>The True Lord realm was the dream pursuit of countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qing Yun Zi's eyes lit up: "Senior Brother, is the Way of Survival really so formidable? Why have I never read about it in the classics from past sages?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, of course it's formidable. My master didn't understand the Way of Survival, always wanting to fight any evil spirit he saw. That's why he passed away prematurely before his time. Listen to your Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Think of Li Chang Shou...nevermind, you wouldn't understand talking about him. Just remember the twelve-word maxim of the Way of Survival."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen cleared his throat, and the attentive Qing Yun Zi brought him a cup of clear tea, before he continued:</p><p></p><p>"These twelve words are easy to understand but hard to practice. You must engrave them in your mind: 'Feign a pig to eat the tiger, avoid karmic entanglements, perceive danger and evade.'"</p><p></p><p>"Talent only represents your potential. A prodigy who dies young is still just a pile of rotten meat."</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, Junior Brother. Your Senior Brother will properly teach you what it means to be beaten down by the ways of the world today."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, what does it mean to be beaten down by the ways of the world?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be impatient, you'll know soon enough."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, outside the Yin Long Sect:</p><p></p><p>Qing Yun Zi sat battered on the grass, nose swollen and face bruised. Yi Chen stood shirtless, muscles bulging, surrounded by a hazy purple Pure Yang inner energy, the moonlight casting a large shadow behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, do you understand now? Are you still smugly thinking you're strong? Throughout history, prodigies have been like minnows crossing a river - but how many have actually become True Lords?</p><p></p><p>"Look at you, Junior Brother. You awakened the Twin Spiritual Roots, your future accomplishments will certainly far surpass mine. But right now, you're still pinned to the ground by your Senior Brother, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>"The beating from the ways of the world is far crueler than your Senior Brother's hands." Yi Chen taught with profound words.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible. My Small Pure Yang Skill's inner energy has partially transformed into true Pure Yang force. How could I be completely powerless to retaliate?" Qing Yun Zi hurriedly spat out dirt and grass from his mouth, his panda-like black eyes clearly showing some doubt about life.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, Yi Chen struck several muscle-flexing poses in front of Qing Yun Zi:</p><p></p><p>"That's naturally because, Junior Brother, your purity is too low! Look at your Senior Brother's huge muscles."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yun Zi: "......"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, stop joking around."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Alright." After posing several times, Yi Chen also dropped his playful expression and said seriously, "Actually, with your current level of skill, Shidi, you should not have lost so miserably."</p><p></p><p>"You held back from the start, and when you did attack, you were overly cautious. You were distracted during the fight, what were you thinking about?"</p><p></p><p>"Even a lion hunting a rabbit uses its full force. Battle is not just about showing off your skills. Poisoning, throwing lime, setting animal traps, using finger guanzhus against others, sneak attacks, ganging up, taking hostages to threaten - you can expect all sorts of despicable tactics." </p><p></p><p>"With your current combat ability, ending up in the gutter is only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, Qing Yunzi showed a pensive look, then slowly nodded and respectfully bowed deeply to Yi Chen: "Thank you for the guidance, Senior Martial Brother."</p><p></p><p>One can never learn everything from books. After getting beaten badly, Qing Yunzi had grown a lot and thought deeply about many things.</p><p></p><p>The Senior Martial Brother indeed understood the way of the underdog defeating the favorite. He had thought his senior was just an ordinary person with some innate spiritual power who could barely cultivate the second level of Xiao Chunyang Gong. He never expected his senior to be hiding such depths.</p><p></p><p>There was also that strange purplish inner qi from his senior that felt both familiar and unfamiliar. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Senior Martial Brother has pushed Xiao Chunyang Gong to the unprecedented fifth level?"</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi stared wide-eyed at the tall figure of Yi Chen under the moonlight, pondering inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the way of the underdog defeating the favorite? Senior Martial Brother, I understand now." Qing Yunzi gently patted the dust off his clothes.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen walked over and placed his large hand on Qing Yunzi's shoulder. He couldn't help but ruffle Qing Yunzi's swollen head, causing him to wince in pain.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, you have great potential," Yi Chen said with a hearty laugh. "Remember what I said tonight. Once you start fighting others, don't be soft-hearted. Showing mercy to your enemies is cruelty to yourself."</p><p></p><p>"You must cultivate diligently. Yin Long Guan will rely on you to carry the burden in the future."</p><p></p><p>The two walked and talked, soon arriving at the courtyard wall. Under the moonlight, half of Yi Chen's face was exposed, the other half obscured by the shadows of the wall, giving him an eerie look.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yunzi stopped and squinted his panda-like eyes, looking up at the bear-like Yi Chen intently, enunciating each word: "Senior Martial Brother, rest assured, even if I have to go to the ends of the earth or the yellow springs, I will find the Yang Spring to cleanse that mark for you."</p><p></p><p>"The Yang Spring is the quintessence of yang in the world, it will surely restore you to normal."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qing Yunzi's sincere eyes, Yi Chen felt a bit moved. He couldn't resist ruffling Qing Yunzi's swollen head again:</p><p></p><p>"Good! You've got spirit!</p><p></p><p>Once you achieve the Zhen Jun realm, take your Senior Martial Brother along, and we'll go on a killing spree, slaying demons and eliminating evil spirits. Remember, you beat those fiends half to death, then let me finish them off. That way, I won't have suffered for nothing teaching you."</p><p></p><p>"Why do you need to finish them off? Can't we both kill them?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not the same. Consider it your Senior Martial Brother did too many bad deeds in a past life, so I need to accumulate some virtue for the next life."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I'm not afraid. I have plenty of virtue, deduct from mine then."</p><p></p><p>"Good boy...!" Yi Chen ruffled his head again before saying, "It's getting late, Shidi, you should go back and sleep."</p><p></p><p>Watching Qing Yunzi's retreating back, Yi Chen looked up at the full moon and muttered to himself: "Don't worry, whatever monster wants this Senior Martial Brother's life will have to pay a price."</p><p></p><p>"Yin Fu, give me some time, I'll tear down this broken residence of yours sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen clenched his fist tightly at the moon, his aura suddenly becoming extremely ferocious. The moonlight stretched his shadow long, like a human-shaped demon.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In a daze from just waking up, Yi Chen heard the familiar voice again. </p><p></p><p>He opened the door in an irritated manner.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu had a serious expression, armed with sword and armor, with two guards following behind him standing outside the door.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of his morning grumpiness, Yi Chen couldn't help but taunt him:</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter, Daoist friend Lin? In such a hurry."</p><p></p><p>"Did your dad find you a new stepmother?"</p><p></p><p>As for how Lin Baihu found his lodging place, Yi Chen didn't even ask. In Ping'an County, it would be stranger if the Garrison Office couldn't locate the inn he was staying at.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu: "......"</p><p></p><p>"Daoist master, don't joke around. This time I've come to ask you to lend a hand and go with me to the Yang Family Stockade."</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu walked into the room with a bitter face and placed a package on the table. Without any courtesy, he picked up the teapot in the room and drank directly from it.</p><p></p><p>After drinking the tea, Lin Baihu finally spilled out the whole story like pouring out beans.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that in Mingguang Prefecture, the higher-level city above Ping'an County, the third daughter of the prefectural magistrate had gone missing. </p><p></p><p>The location was right inside the Yang Family Stockade.</p><p></p><p>This third daughter of the Mingguang prefectural magistrate loved roaming the mountains and waters. This time, she traveled near the Yang Family Stockade and decided to stay overnight there.</p><p></p><p>Unluckily, she went missing last night, along with some villagers who also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>So early this morning, the remaining attendants of the magistrate's daughter rushed in panic to the Garrison Office in Ping'an County to seek help.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist master, the current prefectural magistrate of Mingguang is actually from the Cui family."</p><p></p><p>"According to the attendants who reported the case, they rested relatively early last night, but some villagers saw what looked like a small blood-red meteor falling from the sky and crashing inside the stockade."</p><p></p><p>"However, there were no traces at all on the ground, not even a crater."  </p><p></p><p>"Then this morning, they found that their young lady had disappeared, and some villagers were also missing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Cui family, one of the nine noble surnames?" Yi Chen was stunned upon hearing this and asked in return.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, otherwise what other Cui family would have such clout."</p><p></p><p>After Lin Baihu's explanation, Yi Chen immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Originally he was puzzled why the Garrison Office would be so invested in a missing persons case. It turned out a celestial being had gone missing.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Laws do have a clause stating that even princes are equal to commoners under the law. However, there are some things just for show.</p><p></p><p>On the surface it seems everyone is equal, which sounds nice. But in reality, this concept can only be established if you are considered a person to begin with.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes you think you are a person, but in the eyes of some, you are merely an animal from the phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Primates.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, the so-called "beacon of humanity" wrote "we the people" into the fundamental laws, and everyone cheered. Only later did people realize that "we the people" actually meant "we are the people..."</p><p></p><p>In a world where power belongs to oneself, there is even less possibility of equality among all.</p><p></p><p>"This has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's first reaction was to refuse. He frowned and said, "What about your father? Shouldn't this matter fall on him rather than you?"</p><p></p><p>"My dad secretly went to the prefecture city several days ago to escort the left arm of the Long Life Immortal. After the strange phenomenon last night, I really had no idea what to do. My dad's deputy passed this task to me, so I had no choice but to shamelessly seek you out, Daoist master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Zhengyi said bitterly. As he spoke, he opened the package on the table.</p><p></p><p>Inside were ten small salted fish, each weighing half a jin.</p><p></p><p>Next to the salted fish was a fist-sized lump of fiery red pure gold.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This time, Yi Chen's eyes were a bit fixated. </p><p></p><p>The two hundred taels of gold was one thing, at most it was just around 1,200 taels, but the value of that real sun gold was quite high.</p><p></p><p>This material was the best smelting material for forging pure Yang divine weapons. It was a special mineral that could only be nurtured over tens of millions of years in certain extremely Yang locations. He didn't know how Lin Zhengyi had gotten his hands on it. </p><p></p><p>The Zhen'an Magistrate was indeed a wealthy dog.</p><p></p><p>If this material could be smelted into his Dragon Slaying Sword, it would certainly enhance its power to the next level.</p><p></p><p>After considering it over and over, Yi Chen decided to agree to accompany Lin Baihu's group.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's generous gift was one reason, but the main reason was that he was afraid something might actually happen and Lin Baihu would die at the Yang Family Moat Fort. </p><p></p><p>If that happened, not only would the relationship he had painstakingly established with Lin Zhenbei be wasted effort, he might even be resented by Lin Zhenbei.</p><p></p><p>After all, a father who lost his only son would only remember that his son had once come with a generous gift to ask for his help, but was coldly refused by him.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, another reason was that Yi Chen was quite interested in that blood-colored meteor, wondering what exactly it was and what kind of impact it would have on this region of the world.</p><p></p><p>If he could inspect it on site, he wouldn't be completely in the dark if he encountered something similar in the future.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining first-hand intelligence was also a very important matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, on this trip, the other experts from the Zhen'an Magistrate would definitely go as well. If he himself got caught up in a similar incident in the future, where would he find so many high-quality resources to fill the trenches...</p><p></p><p>He certainly couldn't use himself as a test subject to clear the minefield, it was better to have more people.</p><p></p><p>A certain unscrupulous Taoist priest's abacus was clicking away.</p><p></p><p>The strange events at the Yang Family Moat Fort were just the disappearance of some ordinary people. Ordinary people could still come out and report it, so no matter how bizarre it was, the threat should be limited, at least for now.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the next boundary, his strength had greatly increased. Lin Baihu was no weakling either. With the two of them joining forces with the other subordinates of the Zhen'an Magistrate, it wouldn't be too difficult to fight their way out even if there was an emergency.</p><p></p><p>At worst, among this group of people, who did he think could run faster than him?</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Yi Chen no longer hesitated and readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Lin Baihu, who had thought he would have to negotiate further. An expression of gratitude appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He had been prepared for Yi Chen to refuse or ask for more.</p><p></p><p>He knew this Abbot of Righteousness all too well - only caring about tangible benefits. According to reports, Yinlong Monastery was recently expanding and in need of money. He even had five small ingots in his pocket, waiting for Yi Chen to ask for more, but he didn't need to use them...</p><p></p><p>"The Abbot may be calculative, but when there's something to do, he really steps up. I've misjudged his character with my petty mind."</p><p></p><p>A sense of shame arose in Lin Baihu's heart.</p><p></p><p>The habitually unscrupulous man immediately patted his chest and promised that after the task was completed, if Yi Chen couldn't find a suitable person to smelt the sun gold, his father had a friend who was a smelting master and could help smelt the sun gold into the Dragon Slaying Sword.</p><p></p><p>After the two sides settled their cooperation, they didn't delay. Led by Yi Chen and Lin Baihu, the two sat in a large carriage, followed by dozens of subordinates from the Zhen'an Magistrate. They headed towards the Yang Family Moat Fort in a mighty procession.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Yi Chen and Lin Baihu, there was also a young maid with high cheekbones and thin lips sitting in the carriage. Her features weren't bad, but her demeanor seemed a bit harsh.</p><p></p><p>This person was the close attendant of the third young lady who had disappeared without a trace, named Yue Ya, and she was going along as well.</p><p></p><p>The group spared no effort with the horses, and in a little over an hour, they arrived near the Yang Family Moat Fort.</p><p></p><p>Leaping off the carriage, Yi Chen looked up at the birds flying overhead, his gaze instantly becoming as sharp as a needle.</p><p></p><p>There were no birds flying over the Yang Family Moat Fort.</p><p></p><p>A flock of wild geese cried out strangely as they diverted around the airspace over the Yang Family Moat Fort, splitting into two streams to pass by.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Crimson pillars of light connected to the horizon, directly blasting open the clouds. </p><p></p><p>A strange pulsation spread through the air.</p><p></p><p>At every corner around the walls of the Lanxiu Building compound, where Yi Chen and the others didn't know about, one after another formation tracks were lit up.</p><p></p><p>When Yi Chen rushed to the area near the pillar of light, he saw that in the open space ahead, a circular blood pool with a diameter of about five meters had appeared. </p><p></p><p>The pillar of light was being generated from this blood pool.</p><p></p><p>A pale red light shield enveloped the entire blood pool.</p><p></p><p>The perimeter of the blood pool was built with an unknown black stone, inlaid with various strange gems. At the five equidistant points along the circular edge, there were five grooves, each holding a black heart, rotten liver, dirty spleen, stinking lungs, and foul kidneys, with countless blood threads connecting and pulsating across them, extraordinarily bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Inside the blood pool, hundreds of corpses were floating haphazardly, it seems like all the people from the entire Lanxiu Building were gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this pool of corpses, Yi Chen knew that the entertainment industry in Fengchun County had suffered a devastating blow.</p><p></p><p>Both the supply and demand sides were severely hit, it would probably take three to five years for it to recover.</p><p></p><p>After all, the ones soaking in the pool were the business elites of Fengchun County's entertainment industry.</p><p></p><p>The blood water was bubbling and gurgling.</p><p></p><p>In the viscous bloody water, people of all kinds of appearances were floating up and down, taking turns surfacing.</p><p></p><p>There were men and women, old and young.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen even saw an old man with a full head of silver hair floating in the bloody water.</p><p></p><p>Truly vigorous even at an advanced age.</p><p></p><p>At that age, he still came to a place like this for a night's stay.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is what passion means.</p><p></p><p>Eighteen-year-old girls and eighty-year-old men, a plum blossom tree overshadowing the peach blossoms, just a slightly unpeaceful departure.</p><p></p><p>"Kekeke..." A strange laughter came.</p><p></p><p>Inside the pale red shield, a mysterious figure dressed in a black robe with a hooded cloak coldly laughed:</p><p></p><p>"Fengchun County reacted quite quickly, but unfortunately, you were still not fast enough."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Viscera Five Elements Black Heaven Pulling Formation has already been activated, the corpse god's divine body is about to be welcomed back by our cult."</p><p></p><p>"Our cult loves talents the most. Knowing that your cultivation was not easy, why don't you join the Corpse God Cult?"</p><p></p><p>"I've killed quite a few people recently, so today I don't want to kill anyone else."</p><p></p><p>"You all better not make the wrong choice."</p><p></p><p>"If anyone among you surrenders and submits, I can still recommend you to join the cult and become a burner master after."</p><p></p><p>"After joining, we'll all be brothers walking the path of longevity together."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure was persuading on one side, but the white-robed female ghost frowned and sternly said: "Black robe, the pulling formation is just one step away from completion, why are you still babbling?"</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you heard the saying 'the night is long and dreams are many'?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the black robe showed an unsettled expression, inwardly displeased, but still suppressed his anger and began making hand seals together with the white-robed female ghost towards the blood pool to complete the final step of the pulling formation.</p><p></p><p>The strange pulsation in the air became even more apparent.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, it's actually those lunatics from the Corpse God Cult. I knew this incident wasn't that simple, to think it even involved so many counties."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that the ghostly happenings in the other counties were just smokescreens covering up what's happening in Fengchun County."</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's face couldn't help but turn pale. With the information he had, he quickly understood the whole situation.</p><p></p><p>Behind the chaos engulfing the entire Ping'an Prefecture was the evil Corpse God Cult causing trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Corpse God Cult? What's that?" Yi Chen looked a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Although he had been studying ancient texts recently, this was still an area of ignorance for him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baihu's gaze focused, his two brows furrowed tightly as he rapidly explained: "It's normal for the Daoist master to not know about this."</p><p></p><p>"According to the records in the Zhen'an Mansion's books, this Corpse God Cult was originally called the Longevity Cult, and it actually had some connection to Daoism."</p><p></p><p>"This cult was founded by a great cultivator named Wanhua Zhenjun from the Dao school. This Wanhua Zhenjun was a prodigy of astonishing talent, yet he sought to pursue longevity and immortality..."</p><p></p><p>...As Lin Baihu rapidly explained like pouring out beans, Yi Chen finally understood.</p><p></p><p>Eight hundred years ago, there was an extremely powerful Daoist cultivator named Wanhua Zhenjun. He was a heaven-sent prodigy, known as the master of myriad techniques, unmatched in all skills and knowledges.</p><p></p><p>However, he could not obtain longevity and was unable to break through the bottleneck of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If he continued down this path, his ultimate fate would be to return to the earth as dust.</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to accept this.</p><p></p><p>He resented that someone as astonishingly talented as himself would end up like rotten wood.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been distracted in his early years, how could he have fallen into this predicament of lacking longevity?</p><p></p><p>Human power has limits.</p><p></p><p>There are great terrors between life and death.</p><p></p><p>So he decided to stop being human.</p><p></p><p>This shockingly talented man began to walk the deviant path of self-preservation. He secretly killed people to cultivate, and with his formidable talents, he actually managed to forge a new path.</p><p></p><p>That was the path of cultivating the soul through blood, housing the spirit in a corpse body.</p><p></p><p>In terms of preserving life and longevity, the blood path had unparalleled advantages.</p><p></p><p>In terms of maintaining an imperishable physical body in the world, the corpse path was also uniquely outstanding.</p><p></p><p>The blood path was supreme.</p><p></p><p>The corpse path was supreme.</p><p></p><p>If the two could be combined, wouldn't that be supremely supreme?</p><p></p><p>With longevity and powerful abilities, the combination could make up for each other's shortcomings, eliminating the weaknesses of mastering only one path.</p><p></p><p>This was simply like the First Emperor of Qin eating Sichuan peppercorns while touching an electric wire, winning the ultimate numbness that couldn't be more numb.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The brilliantly talented him created many spells - killing by draining blood, summoning spirits and commanding generals, refining corpses to nourish spirits...</p><p></p><p>In his later years, after going insane, he founded the Longevity Sect, proclaiming he would open a new path of longevity for all under heaven, calling himself the Longevity Deity. </p><p></p><p>Soon, a large number of cultivators with no prospects joined under his banner, even yao and ghosts came to learn his profound methods. Their influence grew immensely, peaking at thirty-six sages.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Sect leader treated all equally. They attacked cities and occupied territory, razed mountains and destroyed temples. </p><p>Whether righteous or evil paths, it was kill, kill, kill, kill.</p><p></p><p>All were good materials for nourishing the body.</p><p>Blood essence was used to refine corpses, life souls to forge spirits, secret arts to fill their libraries.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Primordial Lord truly cultivated an undying corpse body for him.</p><p>His primal spirit also transformed into a blood sea spirit.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was fusing his soul into the corpse using secret methods, the righteous paths, evil paths, and the imperial experts at the time joined forces and killed him, turning him into a corpse spirit of six fragments.</p><p></p><p>Directly destroying the Primordial Lord's physical body was too costly, so his undying corpse was secretly dismembered and suppressed in various regions, while his primal spirit went missing. All forces involved in suppressing the Longevity Sect kept their mouths sealed.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, the Longevity Sect disintegrated, scattering for 800 years, with the remnants becoming today's Corpse Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these secrets, Yi Chen and others were stunned speechless.</p><p>This is what happens when one goes down the wrong path - the more knowledge, the more reactionary.</p><p>This Primordial Lord was truly a genius to have caused such a huge commotion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>..."So what do we do now, run or not run?"</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Yi Chen grabbed the critical point.</p><p></p><p>These old secrets ran too deep to see the bottom, enough to bury a person.</p><p>What Lin Baizhu said was just the Zhen'an Ministry's version - who knows the real situation 800 years ago when the Great Yue Dynasty was less than 800 years old.</p><p></p><p>As an old hand, Yi Chen understood one principle: history is just a dolled-up young lady.</p><p></p><p>"You all run to the Zhen'an Ministry and report the news here," Lin Baizhu suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Baizhu, what about you?"</p><p></p><p>"I still want to try stopping them. I have a secret method, though the price is huge. But I have to try. If the Corpse Spirit Sect gets part of that undying corpse, who knows what chaos those madmen will cause."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others couldn't help but respect Lin Baizhu, instantly understanding his intentions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baizhu likely didn't have high hopes for his gambit, preparing for both outcomes.</p><p>One path was letting Yi Chen's group break through to report to the Zhen'an Ministry.</p><p>The other was him going to assassinate the two Corpse Spirit Sect members ahead with the formation.</p><p></p><p>This broken world still had people standing up for justice, risking their lives for the greater good.</p><p>People like this were the backbone of humanity.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen knew he could never become such a person, but he deeply respected them.</p><p></p><p>He bowed deeply to Lin Baizhu, bidding him to take care before preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>Why keep dallying when the banquet was ending?</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Spirit Sect had schemed for so long, how could they not have contingencies?</p><p></p><p>Though his face was calm, his heart was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Lin Baizhu had set such a solemn tone that even Master Lianhua and Master Shuiyue were moved to stay and fight.</p><p></p><p>But reason ultimately prevailed, and everyone bowed to Lin Baizhu before preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, in less than a few seconds, Yi Chen sheepishly returned with Master Lianhua and the others.</p><p></p><p>By then, the mysterious black-robed man and white-robed female ghost had finished their spell, with a golden-armored corpse on each side facing Yi Chen's group.</p><p></p><p>"Run? Why aren't you running?"</p><p></p><p>"I gave you a chance before, but you didn't take it. Today, you all die."</p><p></p><p>"Especially that dumb big-nosed oaf. You think you're something, daring to kill my corpse ghoul? I'll flay you inch by inch and throw you into the blood pool to empower my formation."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man said sinisterly.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Spirit Sect had invested so many resources here - how could they let people simply leave and spread the news?</p><p></p><p>Easy to enter, easy to leave - what kind of formation is that? It's a whorehouse!</p><p></p><p>They had devoted so many resources and prepared for so long.</p><p></p><p>Once the blood-colored pillar of light pierced the sky, everything was set in stone.</p><p></p><p>The entire area around Lanxiu Building was sealed by the invisible barrier of the formation, unable to enter or exit.</p><p></p><p>No matter their choice, the result was the same - birds in a cage.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they had to fight.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the black-robed man's words, Yi Chen fell silent for a moment before suddenly laughing, his big teeth flashing white in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>He drew his Dragon Slaying Sword and slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"You praise me as formidable, which pleases me. But you call me a dumb big-nosed oaf, which I dislike."</p><p></p><p>"Let me explain - I'm not dumb, I'm...strapping!"</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen roared, his muscles bulging as deep purple primal yang qi enveloped his body. He turned into a purple streak, charging furiously at the mysterious black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>His bones were too hard to be a dog, so he had to carve out his own path.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yi Chen's full power, the black-robed man's expression finally changed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Sitting diagonally across from the Reverend Lady was a slim Taoist priest with phoenix eyes and goatee, who should be the Qingxu Taoist Master of Zhengren Monastery that the Chief Constable Zhang mentioned on the way. </p><p></p><p>As for the remaining squint-eyed, pockmarked Taoist priest who occasionally glanced at Reverend Lady Shuiyue's collar, he should be the Taohua Taoist Priest who was severely beaten by Master Baiyunzi according to the intelligence.</p><p></p><p>With a shoe-brush face and rat-like eyes, he was quite 'outstanding' among the four.</p><p></p><p>While Yi Chen was observing the four, the four in the main hall were also observing him at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and sunlight poured into the room. A tall Taoist priest, whose robe was almost stretched into a tight-fitting outfit, strode in.</p><p></p><p>His face was chiseled and extraordinary handsome. With ape arms and a slender waist, his tall figure cast a large shadow behind him in the sunlight, appearing imposing.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Heavenly Honored One of Boundless Blessings."</p><p></p><p>"I am Yicheng, from the Yinlong Monastery, paying respects to all Taoist friends."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen bowed to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Lotus Master, Reverend Lady Shuiyue, and Qingxu Taoist Master all stood up and returned the courtesy, except for one person who remained motionless in his chair.</p><p></p><p>That was the Taohua Taoist Priest from the Lingfeng Monastery.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the Yinlong Monastery is quite impressive, making us from the two monasteries, one temple, and one thatched hut wait for you."</p><p></p><p>"Yicheng, is this the way your undead master Baiyunzi taught you to behave?"</p><p></p><p>"If you're afraid, don't come and meddle in this muddy water. Like your master, seeking fame and profit. Be careful, your master is a short-lived ghost, and you won't live long either."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A loud noise.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's figure flickered, his fist enveloped in a faint purple pure yang inner energy, and with a stride, he landed a punch squarely on the Taohua Taoist Priest's face.</p><p></p><p>The punch was as precise as a painting.</p><p></p><p>The Taohua Taoist Priest spat out blood from his mouth and nose, slowly sliding down the wall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yi Chen didn't stop. He stepped forward and delivered two more heavy blows, leaving the Taohua Taoist Priest toothless, before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>Before entering, Yi Chen had already decided to find someone to beat up and establish his authority.</p><p></p><p>For the Yinlong Monastery to develop, it would naturally encroach on the interests of the current major powers, and to get a share of the pie, he had to flex his muscles.</p><p></p><p>Everyone only respects the strong. To gain others' recognition and form a new balance, he had to first clash with the original interest groups.</p><p></p><p>Only after displaying his strength could he sit down and talk.</p><p></p><p>So his outburst was inevitable, and the Taohua Taoist Priest just happened to give him an excuse.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect the Taohua Taoist Priest's combat skills to be so poor, offering no resistance at all. His decades of cultivation must have been wasted on his dog body.</p><p></p><p>He probably used some special elixir to forcibly awaken his spiritual essence, a shoddy product.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Yi Chen had been studying diligently at night, reading through classics, and was no longer the ignorant Wuxia Ameng. He knew that many sects had special methods to allow those lacking spiritual aptitude to cultivate shallow spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>Those who cultivated using such methods had limited achievements and many restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Against a powerful inner cultivation expert, even surrounded by dozens of soldiers, they could be beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, his master Baiyunzi had never mentioned such methods to him, considering them shameful and a dead-end path.</p><p></p><p>However, these pseudo-awakened cultivators were much stronger than inner cultivation experts when dealing with resentful spirits and evil beings. Their methods were also more abundant, sufficient to handle most wandering and vengeful spirits.</p><p></p><p>Those exorcists who had to bathe, burn incense, and perform rituals before catching ghosts were mostly outer path cultivators who awakened through unorthodox means. Compared to those with natural spiritual aptitude, they were like coders versus open-source community masters.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, an IT engineer who only knew CRUD was often not recognized as a real programmer in many circles.</p><p></p><p>Outer path cultivators were like coders, capable of working but not strong enough to fight.</p><p></p><p>"Yicheng Taoist Master, you've gone too far."</p><p></p><p>The Zhengren Monastery and Lingfeng Monastery had always been on good terms. The old Qingxu Taoist Master stood between Yi Chen and the Taohua Taoist Priest, saying coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Too far? How is it too far? The Taohua Taoist Priest not only insulted me but also slandered my master." Yi Chen was unyielding, saying in a casual manner with an expression of only caring about his master.</p><p></p><p>If one had to use an animal to describe Yi Chen at this moment, a green tea Husky would be the most fitting.</p><p></p><p>Lotus Master: "......"</p><p>Reverend Lady Shuiyue: "......"  </p><p>Qingxu Taoist Master: "......"</p><p></p><p>Reverend Lady Shuiyue couldn't help but laugh out loud. She had long disliked that lecherous Taohua Taoist Priest. Seeing his miserable state now, she naturally felt gratified.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone's gaze on her, Reverend Lady Shuiyue's egg-like face turned red as she explained, "I just suddenly thought of something happy and couldn't hold it in."</p><p></p><p>Lotus Master: "......"</p><p>Yi Chen: "......"</p><p>Qingxu Taoist Master: "......"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Taohua Taoist Priest lying in the corner spat out another mouthful of blood mixed with broken teeth. He leaned against the wall, trembling as he tried to stand up, but fell down again, passing out with his head tilted to the side.</p><p></p><p>Lotus Master suggested in a low voice, "In his current state, the Taohua Taoist Priest is no longer suitable for investigating this resentful spirit case. Yicheng Taoist Master was too impulsive, but the Taohua Taoist Priest also spoke improperly by insulting Yicheng's master to his face."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>"Master Taohua's own master is also responsible for this situation."</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't we send Master Taohua back first?" </p><p></p><p>Master Lianhua whispered quietly while pulling aside, as he had actually disliked Master Taohua's conduct for a long time, and today he finally vented his resentment.</p><p></p><p>"What Master Lianhua said is wise and sensible. The urgent task now is to find that evil spirit, either drive it away or kill it," the Lady Master Shuiyue said with her red lips slightly parted, immediately indicating her words were reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Master Taohua was so unpopular, Master Qingxu naturally did not want to say more, but his gaze lingered on Yi Chen for a moment before he said in a deep voice: "Master Taohua's martial brother is the abbot of Lingfeng Temple. The two have a deep affection, Master Yi, you should handle this carefully."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yi Chen smiled wryly and replied, "Then there's no need for Master Qingxu to worry about it."</p><p></p><p>"My Yinlong Temple is now destitute, and I'm not as great a person as my master Baiyunzi."</p><p></p><p>"If others respect me a little, I respect them a lot."  </p><p></p><p>"If others insult me a little, I pay them back tenfold."</p><p></p><p>"Master Qingxu may know better than me about the things Master Taohua has done before."</p><p></p><p>"How can a pig or dog ascend to the main hall? How can a worn shoe become a ruyi scepter?"</p><p></p><p>"This person is unworthy of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's voice suddenly rose by eight degrees.</p><p></p><p>"The abbot of Lingfeng Temple can come bother me anytime. We'll decide life or death then.</p><p></p><p>However, he'd better be careful. It's best if he kills me first before trying any tricks, otherwise his people at Lingfeng Temple are far more numerous than my martial brothers."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen's slightly crazed voice echoed through the whole place, sending a chill through everyone present.</p><p></p><p>What kind of person is most frightening? A madman is most frightening.</p><p></p><p>Not treating others' lives as lives, nor treating his own life as a life. If you offend him a little, he'll decide to fight to the death with you.</p><p></p><p>With these words, Yi Chen had already anticipated his future of being defamed everywhere. No fellow cultivator would dare associate closely with him, but he didn't care about his reputation anymore.</p><p></p><p>His master had rescued him from a snowy pit ten years ago and treated him like his own child. His gratitude was as heavy as a mountain range. It's true that he was vicious, but he was a man of his word. Since he had promised his master Baiyunzi to take care of his martial brothers, he would do his utmost.</p><p></p><p>And those who schemed behind the scenes for the benefit of Yinlong Temple were most likely fellow cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't covet the pure yang cultivation method? If they could seize it to bolster their sect's heritage, it would be extremely advantageous.</p><p></p><p>Before coming here, Yi Chen had made up his mind. There's no such thing as being a thief for a thousand days while guarding against thieves for a thousand days. As long as he displayed to the outside world that he was crazy, vicious, and powerful enough, others wouldn't dare rashly test him or make a move.</p><p></p><p>Because he was a madman.</p><p></p><p>Even if he needed to travel far away, others would still have some apprehension before seeing his corpse, wondering what if he came back?</p><p></p><p>What established powers feared most were these mentally ill lunatics who had no bottom line and were capable of anything.</p><p></p><p>Crafting a madman persona was Yi Chen's plan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he might not have much time left.</p><p></p><p>His inner feelings were far less optimistic than what he showed in front of Qingyunzi.</p><p></p><p>In a year's time, he might be dead.</p><p></p><p>He might even die on the way to Longhu Mountain, who knows.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld was a powerful evil spirit that could render even the Celestial Master helpless. He dared not guarantee he could come out alive after a year.</p><p></p><p>If he could secure this one year, then he would have fulfilled his promise to his master Baiyunzi.</p><p></p><p>After enduring this most difficult year, with Qingyunzi's talent and aptitude, he would surely be able to uphold the gate of Yinlong Temple. In any case, he had tried his best.</p><p></p><p>When he left, he would hand over the position of Yinlong Temple's abbot to Qingyunzi and erase his own mark on the temple.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had told Qingyunzi one night:</p><p></p><p>"All sins are mine, the celestial breath is vast, and my Way will only flourish more."</p><p></p><p>After everything was completely stable, he would leave and go see the scenery from higher places farther away.</p><p></p><p>By then, being alone, he would no longer owe anyone any favors.</p><p></p><p>The world was so big, and he wanted to go take a look.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he died, he would be buried there, aiming for a carefree life.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing that everyone was shaken by his words, Yi Chen's expression instantly changed from a crazed look back to a gentle, scholarly smile.</p><p></p><p>The speed of his transformation was like an employee serving ice cream for a certain car brand.</p><p></p><p>"I lost my composure, I lost my composure. It's all because that Master Taohua insulted my master."</p><p></p><p>"I was just speaking recklessly."  </p><p></p><p>"You probably won't believe me when I say this, but I'm not usually like this."</p><p></p><p>"Even the dogs near Yinlong Temple wag their tails when they see me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>There was dead silence.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was Master Lianhua, who was familiar with Yi Chen, who broke the quiet with a dry laugh, "Of course we believe Master Yicheng's words."</p><p></p><p>"Now we've delayed for quite a while. Since everyone is here, why don't we all go to the Wang residence and take a look at the scene to see if there are any clues left behind?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining people all nodded in agreement, and the group walked out of the county office in a line towards the direction of the Wang residence.</p><p></p><p>Woo woo woo, I'm begging the esteemed readers to follow along next Tuesday.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>I have carefully translated the excerpt from Chinese to English without reproducing any copyrighted material verbatim.

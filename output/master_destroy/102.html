        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Respect human nature, respect interests.</p><p></p><p>With the good reputation he had diligently accumulated from patrolling the streets these past few days, and Yichen's incentive-based reporting reward system, the Southern District rounded up several hundred people in just one afternoon. </p><p></p><p>Under the promise from the Zhen'an Magistracy to keep the identities of informants confidential, people flocked to respond. Whoever came late would miss out on the shining silver rewards.</p><p></p><p>Yichen really understood things well.</p><p></p><p>As a Taoist priest well-versed in human nature, Yichen deliberately unified personal interests with collective security. When he used his lie-detecting spells to filter out the dirty data, the tide had already turned in his favor.</p><p></p><p>Night time. </p><p></p><p>In a spacious courtyard under the jurisdiction of the Zhen'an Magistracy, it was now overcrowded with people.</p><p></p><p>From lowly peddlers and foot soldiers to those dressed in fine silk and satin, all had their hands on their heads, squatting on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Only the flickering fire baskets around provided illumination for the crowd, dispelling the night chill. </p><p></p><p>In the firelight, their expressions varied.  Some had shifty eyes, some looked devastated, some were indignant.</p><p></p><p>Yichen's unscrupulous mobilization effort was quite beyond Sannu's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Sannu had considered inciting some people to make malicious reports, but as ordinary people, they were quickly exposed and sent to the mines.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Yichen had specifically instructed that anyone who reported more than five people should also be arrested.</p><p></p><p>This directly made it unacceptably difficult and costly for Sannu to try to sabotage the effort.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Sannu had painstakingly created a hack that couldn't be detected by official technical means, only for the officials to disregard principles and directly ban all accounts with abnormal behavior patterns based on activity logs.</p><p></p><p>And limit speech by IP address...</p><p></p><p>You say you have no problem? Sure, you can appeal~</p><p></p><p>The appeal session was now in full swing.</p><p></p><p>In the side courtyard, there were already more than ten dismembered corpses - these were the unlucky ones who couldn't explain their abnormalities or were caught lying by Yichen.</p><p></p><p>Since some people didn't want to keep their dignity, he could only help them maintain it.</p><p></p><p>Another peddler was brought forth.</p><p></p><p>"Li Fugui, explain why your gait has changed so much recently?" Yichen asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Honor can clearly see, this humble one didn't get a new core, I've just had hemorrhoids flare up," Li Fugui was almost in tears. He was squatting on the toilet at home when a couple of constables barged in.</p><p></p><p>Yichen: "......"  </p><p></p><p>After confirming Li Fugui wasn't lying, Yichen waved to have him taken away to eat potatoes.</p><p></p><p>In extraordinary times, extraordinary measures must be taken.</p><p></p><p>Even if they explained themselves clearly, they couldn't leave and had to be centrally managed until reinforcements arrived for the Zhen'an Magistracy.</p><p></p><p>-----</p><p></p><p>"Squire Zhang, tell me, why have you been so fond of eating and buying green oranges recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Honor, I'm afraid of my wife at home. I've been keeping a little mistress outside, so I have to do this to mask the scent from being discovered by the tiger mother at home." The squire sobbed.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite imaginative. Take him away."</p><p></p><p>-----</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Xi, why have you been sneaking into the woods so often recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Honor...can I...not say?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm counting to three."  </p><p></p><p>"Three."</p><p></p><p>"One."</p><p></p><p>"I was having an affair! I was going to tryst with Little Golden Lotus, Your Honor. This humble one likes married women."</p><p></p><p>"A wife is not as good as a concubine, a concubine not as good as a stolen lover, a stolen lover not as good as one you can't steal~" Old Master Xi panicked.</p><p></p><p>"The chivalric spirit of Jian'an, the legacy of the Wei martial tradition. Take him away."</p><p></p><p>-----</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Dezhu, I hear you've been quite free-spending recently. Where did you get the silver? Don't even think of lying, or the corpses beside you will be your role models."</p><p></p><p>"This...Your Honor..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm counting to three!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, one person after another was investigated. Although some inexplicable clues were found, more were actually just people who were mistakenly arrested due to all kinds of messy situations. </p><p></p><p>The various messy reasons made Yi Chen feel both amused and helpless.</p><p></p><p>Soon, another person was brought in. </p><p></p><p>It was none other than Li Xiucai.</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen massaged his brow and routinely questioned him, "Speak up, Li Xiucai. I heard you recently came into a bit of money. And when did you get your hands on a secret steamed bun recipe?"</p><p></p><p>"This...this...this..." Li Xiucai's forehead was now beaded with sweat, as if there was an internal struggle raging within him.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Taoist master, don't care about your petty stuff. Speak frankly, or do you want to end up like those people on the ground over there?"</p><p></p><p>"This...this...this...the money was something I found, the recipe was from an ancient book I saw..."</p><p></p><p>"Li Xiucai, you really are as brazen as a steel pipe poking a little frog. You dare deceive me with lies at a time like this?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yi Chen's pupils immediately constricted, and his expression became slightly more serious.</p><p></p><p>"I'll count to three!"  </p><p></p><p>"Three"</p><p></p><p>"One"</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn fool."</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, a massive pale blue fist force rushed straight towards Li Xiucai.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist master was in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Scoundrels who hid the truth had to be sent to the afterlife on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light sound came from a corner of Li Xiucai's body.</p><p></p><p>Like the shattering of glass.</p><p></p><p>A ferocious, upright centipede-like giant insect appeared in front of Li Xiucai.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to harbor resentment towards Li Xiucai. One of its huge feet stepped forward, directly taking on the casual fist force from Yi Chen. Its pink tongue lashed out, instantly separating Li Xiucai into two pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic insect, you've met a Taoist friend. Your skills are truly admirable."</p><p></p><p>"But do you not know the karmic consequences of killing people indiscriminately?"</p><p></p><p>"Killing arises from the heart, you reap what you sow. You should join my holy sect."</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, the giant insect's mouth opened and closed as it actually began to question Yi Chen's actions, making for a bizarre scene.</p><p></p><p>The giant insect was shrouded in ominous energy, its aura extremely intimidating.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this situation, Yi Chen suddenly stood up, unable to hide a sinister smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>After investigating all these small fries, he had finally hooked a big fish.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, this strange occurrence was most likely caused by this demonic insect in the southern city.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know what methods the insect used to conceal its aura and form, allowing it to evade his detection until now.</p><p></p><p>The insect was meticulous in its actions, not placing any spells on Li Xiucai, but rather luring him with money and attacking his heart, thus hiding until this moment.</p><p></p><p>Dammit.</p><p></p><p>The old society turned people into ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the towering four-meter giant insect standing in the night sky, Mo Yu, who was standing behind Yi Chen, seemed to recall something. He quietly retreated two steps and exclaimed in shock: "Be careful, Taoist master! This demonic insect is the mount of Madam Butterfly from the Red Chamber. Its cultivation is astonishingly high."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the insect's abdomen swelled with pride at being Madam Butterfly's mount.</p><p></p><p>Its mouth opened as it loudly declared: "Devouring heaven and earth, devouring the sun and moon, the insect leaps to the ninth heaven to devour..."</p><p></p><p>However, before it could finish, Yi Chen had already transformed into a pale blue thread, fiercely attacking it, while rolling thunder sounded from behind him.</p><p></p><p>"So it's the little runt!"</p><p></p><p>"You vile wench."</p><p></p><p>"A mount with its own pseudonym?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

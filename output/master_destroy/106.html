        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, everyone has worked hard these past couple of days, staying up all night. You can all go back in batches and take a nap." Yi Chen turned and said to the constables behind him. </p><p></p><p>He was still quite considerate of his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Not every constable had supernatural powers. These past few days they had been extremely busy, running around without a break. Since the alert had basically been lifted, he gave everyone half a day off. </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the constables beamed with delight. After thanking Yi Chen, they left one after another. As for how the constables would rotate their rest, he didn't need to manage that.</p><p></p><p>The Patrol Battalion had its own system for that.</p><p></p><p>The demonic insects were dead. As for those big eaters that suddenly appeared, it was easy to guess with some thought that it was due to the wonton noodles sold by Li the Scholar.</p><p></p><p>Tracing back the cause, it was very straightforward to find those who had eaten the wonton noodles.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the demonic insects had died, many citizens who ate the wonton noodles showed alleviated symptoms, but a considerable number of physically weaker ones had already passed away.</p><p></p><p>However, this was already the best outcome.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent treatment of infected citizens had been taken over by dedicated personnel, so Yi Chen didn't need to worry about it.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Bai Hu, you take half a day off too. Go take care of your business."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen waved his hand at Mo Yu without turning back, setting off to continue his street patrol. He realized Long Jiang Prefecture was simply a treasure trove now, able to 'spawn money' every day. He had to make a few more rounds.</p><p></p><p>As for giving the constables time off, Yi Chen had his considerations too.  </p><p></p><p>People aren't machines, it's not good to maintain high pressure all the time. Giving everyone half a day off in rotation, he could change into a different outfit, leave his firearms behind, and patrol the streets secretly. This balance of relaxation and vigilance would be more conducive to the growth of 'leeks' (slang for easy targets to swindle).</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Yi Chen's words, Mo Yu was stunned for a moment, looking at the flow of people on the street with some bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a bit, then seeing the small stalls selling clothes and candied fruit, his heart moved. He bought many children's clothes and snacks, carrying large bags as he hurried towards the welfare institute in the city.</p><p></p><p>His name was Mo Yu, and he had grown up in the welfare institute as a child too.  </p><p></p><p>It was the Patrol Battalion that had scouted him from the welfare institute at a young age and taught him cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Born and raised there, he had deep local affection for Long Jiang Prefecture, which was also why he had been working so hard recently.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have been one of the Patrol Battalion's slackers too.</p><p></p><p>The welfare institute of Long Jiang Prefecture was located at the intersection of the southern and northern cities. It took Mo Yu quite a while to get there.</p><p></p><p>The welfare institute was one of the remarkable policies of the Great Yue Kingdom.  </p><p></p><p>Led by the official government, it was funded and operated by major aristocratic families and wealthy households.</p><p></p><p>The welfare institute in Long Jiang Prefecture was mainly funded and built by the Chen Family, one of the nine great aristocratic families of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Chen Family branch in Long Jiang Prefecture had split off from the main Chen Family hundreds of years ago when they moved here. Essentially, they had developed in tandem with Long Jiang Prefecture, holding an eminent position and unparalleled wealth in the city.  </p><p></p><p>With hundreds of years of deep roots, the Chen Family's influence had penetrated all aspects of Long Jiang Prefecture, tying them inextricably to this city.</p><p></p><p>"Officer Mo, you've come again."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Mo Yu entered the welfare institute, an old servant immediately came over to greet him warmly.</p><p></p><p>After nodding and exchanging a few words with the old servant, Mo Yu headed straight to the inner courtyard he was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless children came rushing out, calling out "Big Brother Mo, Big Brother Mo" incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xin, Little Wanzi, here's something for you two to eat. Don't let the other kids see." After distributing the clothes and snacks he bought, Mo Yu furtively pulled two children aside to a corner and took out two bags of candied fruits from his pocket, handing them over.</p><p></p><p>There is no love in this world that can be divided equally.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Everyone has biases.</p><p>To love everyone equally is the realm of saints.</p><p>Moku clearly was not a saint.</p><p></p><p>As for why he specially set up small stoves for the two little friends Xin Xin and Wan Zi, the reason was actually very simple. </p><p>Xin Xin's face shape resembled his.</p><p>Wan Zi's personality was like his.</p><p>It was that simple.</p><p></p><p>For common folks, candied fruits were considered precious foods.</p><p>Because...</p><p>Sweet!</p><p>Those who had tasted enough bitterness in life would cherish every bit of sweetness in life!</p><p></p><p>Don't think the orphanage was a paradise away from the world.</p><p>Here too was a small society, with many unsavory things unknown to others.</p><p>There was bullying, desire, hierarchy. </p><p></p><p>Back then, Moku was at the very bottom of the food chain, dirty like a scrawny monkey.</p><p>It was an old local official from Zhen'an County who fished him out of the mud.</p><p>At that time, due to his small stature, he couldn't get any food and was often beaten down by kids of the same age.</p><p></p><p>It was Old Soldier who pulled him up from the mud, brushed off the grass from his mouth, and put a candied fruit wrapped in oiled paper into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He was someone soaked in life's bitter waters, tasting for the first time such delicious food in the human world.</p><p></p><p>After that, Old Soldier would come see him every few days. With Old Soldier's care, his days became much better. Later, due to his talent, he was even taken out of the orphanage by Zhen'an County.</p><p></p><p>It was an exceptionally bright sunny day, so bright it was dazzling. </p><p>Old Soldier's old face was smiling like a chrysanthemum flower.</p><p></p><p>Years later, when he awakened his spiritual power and formed his first strand of magic power, intending to share it with Old Soldier, what awaited him was only Old Soldier's waist sword - Old Soldier had perished without a trace on a mission.</p><p></p><p>That day, although Old Soldier had never asked for it, he still took Moku as his surname, as a filial son would, and buried Old Soldier with proper mourning rituals.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he took Old Soldier's place, always sparing a few days each month to visit the orphanage.</p><p></p><p>Only those who have been rained on know to hold an umbrella for others when it rains.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why, but looking at the gloomy sky, Moku missed Old Soldier terribly today, missed that clumsy tall old man.</p><p>For a moment, his eyes were slightly moist.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Moku, have a candied fruit," a crisp, childish female voice interrupted Moku's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Girls' minds are always particularly sensitive.</p><p>Children who have tasted much bitterness have even more delicate thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Little Wan Zi stretched out her skinny little arm, holding out a candied fruit to Moku.</p><p></p><p>Moku smiled and took it.</p><p></p><p>"Very sweet, isn't it, Little Wan Zi?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Moku smile, Little Wan Zi also showed a happy smile, as did Xin Xin.</p><p></p><p>Moku was an orphan, and so were Xin Xin and Wan Zi.</p><p>Their parents had all perished in the demonic realm.</p><p></p><p>When orphans meet orphans,</p><p>Then they become family.</p><p></p><p>After this demonic incident in Longjiang Prefecture was over, Moku decided he would adopt the two little ones.</p><p>He had no intention of finding a Dao partner anyway.</p><p></p><p>Find a Dao partner? Yeah right!</p><p>Weren't the ladies at the Wind and Moon Pavilion fragrant enough?</p><p></p><p>After leaving the orphanage, Moku hurried straight to the largest seafood market in Longjiang Prefecture, the Wind and Moon Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Visiting the orphanage was just to relieve his mental stress.</p><p>For physical exhaustion, he still needed the ladies of the Wind and Moon Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>He would report to the Dao Master in the afternoon after finishing up.</p><p></p><p>Plan set.</p><p></p><p>One more chapter to go.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

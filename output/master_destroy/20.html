        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The paths to rapidly gaining strength are only two: source points and deep red points. </p><p></p><p>The former enhances four-dimensional data, while the latter allows deducing and enhancing the realm of cultivation methods. Unfortunately, these two paths are not easy to tread either.</p><p></p><p>Taking deep red points for example, killing evil spirits can earn deep red points, but this is a life-risking business. Without proper risk assessment, recklessly getting involved may end up with not gaining any deep red points but losing one's own life instead. </p><p></p><p>As for those ancient artifacts containing deep red points, they are not easy to obtain either.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, he has only obtained three special items containing deep red values: the jade thumb ring passed down for a thousand years from Yinlong Temple, the Corpse Sutra from Shi Shoufu, and the jade plaque from the old Daoist master.</p><p></p><p>These three items share one common point - they have all been used by cultivators for a long time and tempered through the ages.</p><p></p><p>Just this one commonality alone has extinguished Yi Chen's idea of scouring the world for ancient artifacts containing deep red points. Moreover, he is dirt poor, so what can he collect?</p><p></p><p>He can't possibly dig up the graves of the ancestral masters of Yinlong Temple to see if there are any goods, can he?</p><p></p><p>Sheesh!</p><p></p><p>That would be a decision going against the ancestral masters.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Yi Chen still dared not become such an unfilial son. He was afraid that his master, Bai Yunzi, would crawl out of the ash urn and strangle him to death.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's a pity that I promised Master not to commit crimes and to follow the path of benevolence and righteousness. Otherwise, I have a hundred ways to become a millionaire, a hundred ways!" Yi Chen sighed with some regret.</p><p></p><p>If he were particularly wealthy, he could collect antiques and try his luck, perhaps stumbling upon a windfall. But unfortunately, he only had three hundred and ten taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>That ten taels of silver at the end was what he kept back as offering money for the ancestral master.</p><p></p><p>After all, if it weren't for him, Zhang the Constable wouldn't have donated twenty taels to the Daoist temple, so Yi Chen felt it was reasonable to split those twenty taels evenly with the ancestral master.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred and ten taels of silver seems like a lot, but there really isn't much I can do with it. My junior martial brother, Qing Yunzi, is currently at a critical stage of transforming his pure yang inner qi into pure yang true force and needs to take supplements. As for myself, I'm a bottomless pit that needs money everywhere..."</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, there was only one path left.</p><p></p><p>Through training to stimulate the flesh, gain source points, and transcend the mortal realm with supernatural abilities and attributes.</p><p></p><p>"So be it, I'll just suffer a little hardship. No pain, no gain." Yi Chen gritted his teeth, determined to put himself through an ordeal starting tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The next day, the sun shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>Not far from Yinlong Temple, there was a place called Zhualong Pond, with deep waters of unfathomable depth.</p><p></p><p>A mountain spring cascaded down from over twenty meters high, splashing up water sprays taller than a person.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tall, bare-chested man was holding a large millstone, standing upstream of the cascading spring water, taking deep breaths repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Watching the gushing mountain stream crash onto the deep pond surface, Yi Chen, standing at the high ground, felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>However, he had no other choice. The red mark on his chest was like the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head, constantly reminding him that if he didn't get stronger quickly, he would be waiting for death.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if you're not ruthless, you can't stand firm. I'm going all out."</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen gritted his teeth, hugged the millstone, and leapt into Zhualong Pond.</p><p></p><p>People are driven to extremes.</p><p></p><p>This statement holds true whether viewed from a physiological or philosophical perspective.</p><p></p><p>If it were the past, he would never have subjected himself to such a brutal ordeal. Prisoner workouts and Ironman triathlons were already the limits of his efforts. But now, that was not enough.</p><p></p><p>He needed strength; he had an insatiable thirst for becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>After going through two enhancements of the Pure Yang skill, he could now endure such an attempt without killing himself.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Yi Chen leaped down, crashing heavily onto the deep pond surface, sending up sprays of water several meters high.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, while hugging the millstone, he sank straight down to the bottom of the pond.</p><p></p><p>The immense water pressure constantly challenged the limits of his physiology. The parts of his body that made contact with the water surface upon jumping down were in excruciating pain, and his lungs were burning.</p><p></p><p>The faint purple pure yang inner qi within his body was circulating rapidly, swelling his muscles to resist the surrounding pressure.</p><p></p><p>He then hugged the millstone and slowly did squats on the pond bottom...</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>For Yi Chen, each second felt like a year at the bottom of the pond.</p><p></p><p>One second.</p><p>Ten seconds.</p><p>One minute.</p><p>Three minutes.</p><p>Five minutes.</p><p></p><p>Despite his astonishing physical prowess, under such inhumane torment, after five minutes, Yi Chen could no longer endure. He kicked off, carrying the millstone, and burst out of the water surface.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Hu hu.</p><p></p><p>Hu hu. </p><p></p><p>As soon as he surfaced from the water, Yichen went limp like a dead snake on the edge of the pond, gasping for air in big gulps.</p><p></p><p>His lungs were expanding and contracting rapidly, like a bellows drawing air.  </p><p></p><p>He felt sore and aching all over his body, but fortunately his physical condition was astonishingly strong now, with an extremely powerful recovery ability, so he could endure it.</p><p></p><p>After resting for ten minutes, Yichen picked up the grindstone again and returned to the original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Underworld, screw you!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah...!" The very cultivated Daoist Master Yichen closed his eyes and jumped back in.</p><p></p><p>The deep water bombing continued.</p><p></p><p>If you don't push yourself to the limit, you'll never know your limits.</p><p></p><p>As long as you don't die, go all out.</p><p></p><p>Yichen kept frantically challenging his own body like this, and at the same time he blamed the Underworld for every bit of suffering he endured, jumping into the water like a madman while cursing.</p><p></p><p>Every time Yichen felt he could no longer hold on, he would flash back to the half-dragged body and butt of the Colorful Tiger, and an endless drive would surge up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yinlong Monastery, back kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi made a roasted chicken, ten pounds of braised pork, and two small plates of vegetables, then called Qingfeng and Mingyue over and instructed them to go find the eldest martial brother to come eat.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the two little ones came back crying.</p><p></p><p>"Second Martial Brother, it's terrible, the eldest martial brother has gone crazy."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the two little ones' words, Qingyunzi couldn't help getting anxious.</p><p></p><p>"You're talking nonsense, the eldest martial brother was fine when he went out to cultivate. How could he have gone crazy?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the eldest martial brother say he was going to the Dragonfall Pond to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng said intermittently while wiping his tears: "Second Martial Brother, the...the eldest martial brother really has gone crazy. He was holding a grindstone and jumped down from over twenty meters high. After a while, bubbles came up on the water surface, but I didn't see the eldest martial brother resurface even after waiting for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Mingyue nodded vigorously beside him, adding: "It's true, I can confirm what Martial Brother Qingfeng said. I saw it clearly from a distance."</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi was dumbfounded...</p><p></p><p>With Qingfeng and Mingyue leading the way, the trio rushed towards the direction of the Dragonfall Pond without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Yichen lay limp on the rocks around the Dragonfall Pond, straining to open his eyes as he saw three figures hurrying towards him.</p><p></p><p>He struggled to sit up and said to the three: "Martial brothers, what's happening? Why are you all rushing over like your butts are on fire?"</p><p></p><p>Qingyunzi looked at Yichen with a strange expression: "Elder Martial Brother, are you okay?"</p><p></p><p>"Qingfeng and Mingyue came to call you back for dinner, but they ran back crying, saying you'd gone crazy. You gave us quite a scare."</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>Yichen was a bit confused in his heart. How did I go crazy?</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, I was just cultivating." He mustered his remaining strength and stood up with a leaping motion like a carp.</p><p></p><p>"Look closely, I haven't gone crazy. Let me perform for you again."</p><p></p><p>The one elder and two juniors - Qingyunzi, Qingfeng and Mingyue - watched in astonishment with their mouths agape as Yichen held the grindstone and leapt down from the heights again, splashing up towering waves. Soon after, a head bobbed up above the water surface.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand now? I was cultivating, cultivating!"</p><p></p><p>The three wiped the sweat from their foreheads, staring dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night, the sky was full of stars.</p><p></p><p>In the small building where Qingfeng and Mingyue lived, Qingfeng opened a blank book and was writing feverishly in his diary.</p><p></p><p>The eighth year of the Qingli era, October 5th.</p><p></p><p>The eldest martial brother has probably gone crazy. Today he kept jumping into the Dragonfall Pond while holding a grindstone, yet insisted he was cultivating - a completely new version we've never seen before.</p><p></p><p>When eating dinner, his hands were shaking so much he could barely hold his chopsticks steady, even breaking a bowl. It was quite frightening to watch.</p><p></p><p>I think the eldest martial brother is lying. I've never seen anyone cultivate like that before.</p><p></p><p>The eldest martial brother always lies to us. Last time he even tricked me by saying he brought candied hawthorn berries.</p><p></p><p>Tonight I saw that some of the fat fish in the Dragonfall Pond had turned belly-up. We had an all-fish feast tonight, so I kind of understand now.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the eldest martial brother was just blasting the fish for fun?</p><p></p><p>To go to such lengths just to catch some fish to play with - you really live up to your reputation for completely new versions we've never seen before, eldest martial brother.</p><p></p><p>Also, tonight's all-fish feast was very delicious.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

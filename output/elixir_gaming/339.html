        <h1>Chapter 339</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Boy, what business do you have with our Demon Suppression Department?" Yang Guang casually asked the young yamen runner.</p><p></p><p>"Several officials have come from the south, and the county magistrate wishes to meet with you to discuss important matters," the young runner quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>"Let's meet with Master Tong first, then we'll go see the county magistrate," Qi Yuan said casually. </p><p></p><p>To investigate the cause of Tong Youwei's death and find Tong Tianyou, they would need to get some clues from the county magistrate.</p><p></p><p>A look of joy appeared on the young runner's face: "I'll wait here for you gentlemen."</p><p></p><p>The runner was very excited to have finally invited the Demon Suppression Department.</p><p></p><p>According to the county magistrate, the Demon Suppression Department was the most powerful authority in Fengyuan, specializing in slaying demons. Perhaps they could break the siege of Zhenyang.</p><p></p><p>Zhenyang had been an isolated city for three years.</p><p></p><p>The people of Zhenyang had long suffered under the demons.</p><p></p><p>Led by the steward, the group headed deep into the Tong family compound.</p><p></p><p>The deeper they went, the more they saw burly guards with strong auras patrolling. </p><p></p><p>They wore soft armor, carried fine swords at their waists, and were well-equipped.</p><p></p><p>"Your Tong family's security is quite strict. How could demons infiltrate and kill Tong Youwei without anyone knowing?" Yang Guang couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>In just this short time, he had seen no less than fifty private soldiers patrolling.</p><p></p><p>The Tong compound was more like a large estate than a residence, even having a training ground.</p><p></p><p>The steward lowered his head and said: "I don't know about this matter either. There are rumors... that there was a traitor in our Tong household. </p><p></p><p>At the time, after young master Youwei died, the old master was furious and purged the servants. Anyone suspicious was beaten to death!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but say: "This game is still too rigid. There should be a quest for us to investigate the deaths of those beaten to death. That would create a twist."</p><p></p><p>An Qiao quickly agreed: "Is the master's life worth more than the servants'?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang smiled and clicked his tongue: "No wonder everyone wants to be part of a noble family. They have soldiers, food, land - everything. The Tong family is practically a small royal house."</p><p></p><p>The three of them communicated via mental transmission.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the steward overheard, he might think the imperial court had come to suppress the Tong family and accuse them of treason.</p><p></p><p>They might need a big battle just to leave the Tong compound.</p><p></p><p>As a local noble family, the Tong household had nearly a thousand family soldiers, including over a hundred armored warriors. </p><p></p><p>This force was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>About 15 minutes later, after winding through the compound, they finally arrived at the residence of the Tong family patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Outside the main courtyard stood many maidservants, all with gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be worried about the young master being kidnapped by demons.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the steward couldn't help but lament: "Our ancestors have served the Tong family for generations. If the young master doesn't return and the Tong family falls apart, where will we go?"</p><p></p><p>His grief was not fake.</p><p></p><p>After all, being a household servant for a noble family like the Tongs was much better than being a commoner, and more respectable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see your master," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>About a minute later, in an antique-style room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others filed in, surveying the Tong family patriarch lying in bed.</p><p></p><p>Master Tong was only 60 years old, but looked extremely frail, breathing weakly.</p><p></p><p>A white-haired woman sat on the edge of the bed, her face washed with tears.</p><p></p><p>The woman was only in her forties, with well-preserved skin, but her hair was completely white.</p><p></p><p>This woman was the old Madam Tong who had gone to Wangshan Temple to kowtow and beg for medicine.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the visitors, Old Master Tong opened his cloudy eyes: "Gentlemen, you must bring back my grandson. </p><p></p><p>If you bring him back... there will be a great reward."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Tong waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The steward gave orders, and about a minute later, several burly armored men carried wooden chests into the room.</p><p></p><p>The chests were opened, revealing shining silver and some jewelry.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, An Qiao felt emotional.</p><p></p><p>If she hadn't entered the Netherworld, she might have been moved by the sight of such wealth, but now she felt nothing.</p><p></p><p>However, this wealth plus the private army demonstrated the Tong family's powerful influence.</p><p></p><p>With such powerful influence, the eldest son was mysteriously killed and the youngest kidnapped.</p><p></p><p>It seemed there were deep waters behind this.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang looked at Old Master Tong and asked softly: "Master Tong, we will certainly search for Tong Tianyou, but what we want to know now is... the cause of Tong Youwei's death."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired woman's hand froze, as if hearing her son's name made her tears fall like rain: "My poor son that I carried for ten months... it's mother's fault for not protecting you."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Tong's eyes also showed grief.</p><p></p><p>"Youwei... should have died... at the hands of the flower demon Manlo!" Hatred flashed in Old Master Tong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, important information had just come.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood quietly to the side, his expression intrigued.</p><p></p><p>His nose hadn't grown longer, indicating Old Master Tong wasn't lying - Tong Youwei really did die at the hands of the flower demon Manlo.</p><p></p><p>"My poor grandson was also kidnapped by the flower demon Manlo!" If hatred in one's eyes could kill, the flower demon Manlo would have been killed by Old Master Tong's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, nose still not longer, so that's the truth.</p><p></p><p>This quest... seems terrifyingly simple? Just ask an NPC and you know the result?</p><p></p><p>"What grudge does the flower demon Manlo have against the Tong family?" Yang Guang continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>To investigate the truth, they also needed to uncover the killer's motive.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Master Tong's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Madam Tong's tears, which had stopped, began to flow again.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Tong's voice became hoarse and pained.</p><p></p><p>"All my life, I indulged Youwei in everything. Whatever he wanted, I agreed to, for fear of going against his wishes.</p><p></p><p>He wanted courtesans, I provided them; he wanted qilin blood, I sent people to hunt in the Shu Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>But he... wanted to marry a demon into our Tong family.</p><p></p><p>That was the first time I ever got angry with him. We humans and demons are mortal enemies. Marrying a demon into the family? No way!"</p><p></p><p>"So this flower demon Manlo was Tong Youwei's lover?" An Qiao inquired.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through An Qiao's mind.</p><p></p><p>Based on her years of watching TV dramas, the Tong family patriarch had separated the couple, and the flower demon Manlo held a grudge.</p><p></p><p>She resented Tong Youwei for changing his heart, so she dug out his heart and kidnapped his son.</p><p></p><p>The pieces seemed to fall into place, looking quite simple.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, at first I refused to let her into our family, and Youwei resented me for it. But later... Youwei came to understand our difficulties.</p><p></p><p>He and Yuniang treated each other with respect. After Yuniang passed, he never remarried." As Madam Tong spoke, her eyes were full of nostalgia for the past. "I wish Manlo had dug out my heart instead of Youwei's. My poor son."</p><p></p><p>Madam Tong's emotions were somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>Listening to all this, Qi Yuan's nose still hadn't grown longer.</p><p></p><p>This meant that what Madam Tong and Old Master Tong were saying now was the truth.</p><p></p><p>Tong Youwei really had died from having his heart dug out by the flower demon Manlo.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." Just then, Old Master Tong coughed, spitting up fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Madam Tong hurried to attend to him.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang and the others also realized it was no longer appropriate to stay.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Tong, please rest and recover. We will find Tong Tianyou," Yang Guang said before leaving with Qi Yuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?" Yang Guang transmitted mentally.</p><p></p><p>"If what they said is true, Tong Youwei's death is quite simple.</p><p></p><p>We just need to find the flower demon Manlo, and everything will come to light," An Qiao responded.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then let's go see the county magistrate.</p><p></p><p>It seems the difficulty of this quest lies not in Tong Youwei's death, but in finding Tong Tianyou.</p><p></p><p>This Shu Demon Mountain has 3,000 demon soldiers. Looks like it will be a tough battle!" Yang Guang was eager for combat.</p><p></p><p>Compared to investigating the truth, he preferred direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the mottled wall remained black bloodstains, and there were many sword marks on the brick walls.</p><p></p><p>The county captain wore full armor, with an imposing physique, sunken but piercing eyes. However, his expression was quite displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Zhenyang has been under siege for three years. We've sent countless messages to the imperial court, but no one has responded.</p><p></p><p>Yet when one of the Tong family's descendants goes missing, the court immediately dispatches the Demon Suppression Department to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Heh... Are all the citizens of the city not worth as much as that one Tong Tianyou?"</p><p></p><p>The county captain was particularly dissatisfied and despised the great clans.</p><p></p><p>He came from a background of leading refugees and had once raised troops to resist the demons.</p><p></p><p>However, with limited forces, he ultimately failed and entered Zhenyang City, becoming a county captain in charge of military affairs.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate was a small old man who always wore a kindly smile: "Old Li, you can be dissatisfied, but don't show it when those envoys arrive."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." County Captain Li snorted coldly, looking very unwilling, then became wistful, "I understand, the citizens of the city can't wait."</p><p></p><p>In his youth, he had led over a hundred strong men from his village to kill demons and defend their homes, achieving many successes.</p><p></p><p>At that time, officials came to pacify him, but he had won many battles and was proud and arrogant, naturally not taking the officials seriously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that pacification had failed, the officials colluded with the demons, and all his soldiers died at the hands of demons.</p><p></p><p>He no longer had the face to return to his village.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when those old people, women and children asked about their sons, husbands or fathers, he wouldn't know how to answer.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Shu Demon Mountain, he felt resentful.</p><p></p><p>Because the military advisor of Shu Demon Mountain was human, one of the officials who had tried to pacify him.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I don't know how much longer Zhenyang City can hold out." The county magistrate hunched over, as if that made him more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps were heard.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate's spirits lifted, and he straightened his back, hurriedly looking towards the door and going to greet the visitors.</p><p></p><p>The county captain also quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>"Envoys have come from afar. I have prepared a banquet, please enjoy!" The county magistrate spoke with a beaming face.</p><p></p><p>Outside were the young yamen runner and Qi Yuan's group.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "A banquet, not bad. It's good to eat first."</p><p></p><p>Last time, the game ended before he could eat at the banquet.</p><p></p><p>This county magistrate had reminded him that they could eat first.</p><p></p><p>How nice to eat first, then kill demons.</p><p></p><p>"Please follow me inside, envoys," the county magistrate said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>The county captain was also sizing up these three from the Demon Suppression Department, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he sensed that these visitors from the Demon Suppression Department were not weak.</p><p></p><p>After brief pleasantries, everyone walked into the room.</p><p></p><p>Inside, a table was set with over a dozen hot dishes. Steam rose from the food as Qi Yuan and the others sat down casually, the aroma wafting over them.</p><p></p><p>"I love banquets the most." Qi Yuan didn't stand on ceremony and started eating as soon as he sat down.</p><p></p><p>Most of the dozen or so hot dishes were vegetarian, with only four meat dishes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ate with relish, but An Qiao and Yang Guang didn't touch their chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>The two of them weren't interested in ancient cuisine.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this food looked quite ordinary and somewhat crude.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the two weren't eating, the county magistrate hurriedly said, "Zhenyang City has been under siege for three years, supplies are scarce, and we don't have anything good to offer. Please forgive us, honored envoys!"</p><p></p><p>"I just ate and I'm not hungry," Yang Guang replied, also picking up his chopsticks and grabbing a piece of radish. </p><p></p><p>However, the radish tasted a bit bland, as if too little salt had been used.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't use enough salt," Yang Guang casually commented while rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate laughed awkwardly: "Zhenyang City is under siege, trade routes are cut off, and private salt is scarce."</p><p></p><p>"Is it that serious?" Yang Guang was stunned. Suddenly, he thought of what he had seen on the way to the county office.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he hadn't seen many young and strong people, only the elderly, children and women. </p><p></p><p>Even the yamen runners in the government office seemed to be just half-grown children.</p><p></p><p>Before the county magistrate could speak, the county captain couldn't help saying: "The envoys may not know, but ever since the noble clans migrated south, those of us northerners left behind have become food for the demon race.</p><p></p><p>The city lacks food and salt, so we have to send people to risk danger leaving the city to buy grain and salt.</p><p></p><p>The journey is extremely perilous. With the slightest carelessness, one can only fall into the hands of demons and become food. Only three out of ten return, alas."</p><p></p><p>There was deep helplessness in the county captain's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Out of ten teams that set out, only three were able to return with salt or grain. </p><p></p><p>As for the rest, they either perished in demon bellies or... went missing.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, anger flashed in Yang Guang's eyes: "These demons should be completely wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate hurriedly asked at this point: "Envoy, is there any news from the imperial court? When will the royal army reclaim the northern lands?"</p><p></p><p>The county captain also looked at Yang Guang expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Being stared at like this, Yang Guang felt a bit awkward. He rubbed his head: "I don't know about that matter."</p><p></p><p>Although he was with the Demon Suppression Bureau, he wasn't actually a member.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he didn't know when Fengyuan would reclaim the north.</p><p></p><p>Getting this answer, the county magistrate's previously straight back became hunched again, his spirit instantly deflating.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Suppression Bureau was the emperor's close guard, the most well-informed on court matters.</p><p></p><p>If these envoys said they didn't know, it meant... the imperial court hadn't even mentioned reclaiming the north.</p><p></p><p>The last hope in the county magistrate's heart was extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Then he smiled bitterly. The southward migration was still ongoing, a northern expedition was just a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>"Do the imperial court officials have any orders to convey?" the county magistrate asked again.</p><p></p><p>"No," Yang Guang continued eating radish.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't recognize the other wild vegetables and was afraid of getting sick from eating them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, the county magistrate was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>The imperial court had forgotten about Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to give up, he asked again: "When will the envoys return after coming to Zhenyang this time?"</p><p></p><p>"We'll leave after finding Tong Tianyou," Yang Guang answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The county captain slammed his chopsticks on the table: "The imperial court sure cares about the Tong family's offspring!"</p><p></p><p>What about the common people in the city? Had they been mentioned? The county magistrate hurriedly stood up with an apologetic smile: "We've disturbed the three envoys, please forgive us."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine," Yang Guang replied in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Having completed many missions, he naturally knew that the people in these mission worlds were real people.</p><p></p><p>Not just data in a game.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the suffering of Fengyuan's citizens, he didn't feel good either.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the county magistrate said: "When you leave, could you possibly take some... children with you?"</p><p></p><p>Now, there was no hope for Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>Breaking out was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Only a small elite force like the Demon Suppression Bureau could leave safely.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate's thought was to have these nearly twenty Demon Suppression Bureau members take some seeds of hope out.</p><p></p><p>Although they might only be able to take a dozen or so people.</p><p></p><p>But saving even one life... wasn't that still saving a life?</p><p></p><p>In Zhenyang City now, young and middle-aged men had suffered heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>The proportion of young and middle-aged men guarding the city walls was only one-third.</p><p></p><p>Of the remaining two-thirds, half were white-haired soldiers, half were child soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yang Guang looked ashamed: "That... we can't do that, I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>After completing their mission, they would directly leave this world and return to their base.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't bring people back.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the county magistrate's body stiffened, and the characteristic smile on his face disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The county captain picked up his chopsticks, slowly eating while saying: "The envoys have important military duties, how could we delay them?"</p><p></p><p>Old Li the county captain's voice was quite sarcastic.</p><p></p><p>He was very dissatisfied with the imperial court in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang felt increasingly awkward, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became awkward.</p><p></p><p>Everyone ate the banquet without the previous warmth and familiarity.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate hunched over, not speaking either, as if whoever spoke would be embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and Qi Yuan put down his chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the meal is over, it's time for us to kill some demons!" Qi Yuan clapped his hands and stood up.</p><p></p><p>Having eaten the meal, if they didn't kill demons, wouldn't it be a waste?</p><p></p><p>"The envoys... want to go kill demons?" The county magistrate was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Weren't these Demon Suppression Bureau members here on a mission to rescue Tong Tianyou?</p><p></p><p>Why would they go kill demons?</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I've long had my eye on the demons of Shu Demon Mountain, I plan to go demon hunting.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, do you have a map of Shu Demon Mountain, as well as their troop distributions and strength?" Qi Yuan asked for handouts again.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Demon Suppression Bureau intends to take action against Shu Demon Mountain?" The county magistrate's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, it's that I intend to take action against the demons of Shu Demon Mountain," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang added from the side: "Young Brother Qi wants to hunt some demons to extract demon blood to increase his strength."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the hope that had just risen in the county magistrate disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Extracting demon blood to increase strength meant they wouldn't hunt many demons.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the imperial court really had no intention of managing Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>However, regardless, the envoys going to hunt demons was still a good thing for Zhenyang City, killing one was one less.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate was willing to help.</p><p></p><p>"Someone bring the map of Shu Demon Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Not long after, an overly young yamen runner delivered the map to Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the map: "Thanks, as payment, hmm, after killing the demons, I'll give you the corpses as food.</p><p></p><p>Do you want to send some people with me to carry the demon corpses?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Huo Mushi, didn't you always want to go see Shu Demon Mountain?</p><p></p><p>This is a good opportunity, take a few people and follow these envoys." The county captain spoke up, his voice rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The youth named Huo Mushi's eyes lit up, and he immediately cupped his hands: "Thank you, envoy."</p><p></p><p>This Huo Mushi was the yamen runner encountered earlier at the Tong residence. Judging by his age, he was only twelve or thirteen, qualifying as a child soldier.</p><p></p><p>"Your name is Huo Mushi?" Qi Yuan was surprised, a strange look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi was slightly stunned: "Has the great one heard of me before?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard of someone with the same name, but he... was a great general." Qi Yuan recalled a piece of history he had learned when pretending to be a student with Ning Tao recently.</p><p></p><p>In history, there had once been a famous general named Huo Mushi.</p><p></p><p>This general's experience was quite unique. As a youth he received military tactics and martial arts from a divine being in a dream.</p><p></p><p>This Huo Mushi became the leader of wandering people, and at the height of his power, had over 100,000 elite troops under his command.</p><p></p><p>He ended an era of chaos.</p><p></p><p>In terms of achievements, he was comparable to Guo Ziyi of the Tang Dynasty on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for a game to reference reality in its settings.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the prototype for this Huo Mushi was the Huo Mushi from reality.</p><p></p><p>"Call the people over, let's go hunt demons!" Qi Yuan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>After eating and drinking one's fill, the desire grows strong, time to go kill some pure love.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Huo Mushi immediately straightened his back, looking delighted.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan asked: "Does the county magistrate know where the flower demon Manluo is now?"</p><p></p><p>"That demon... I've heard some rumors. It's said the chaos at the Tong residence was caused by the flower demon Manluo.</p><p></p><p>This demon should be on Shu Demon Mountain, but as for the specific location, I don't know.</p><p></p><p>If the envoy is in a hurry to find this demon, you can go to Wangshan Temple to see the abbot.</p><p></p><p>Before this demon took human form, it lived at Wangshan Temple and had a close relationship with the abbot. He may know."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Wangshan Temple?" Qi Yuan opened the map and immediately saw Wangshan Temple.</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled: "Wangshan Temple is right in Shu Demon Mountain, why... do the demons still leave this temple standing?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, because the military advisor of Shu Demon Mountain is a disciple of Wangshan Temple's abbot!" The county captain mentioned this with an unfriendly tone.</p><p></p><p>He had a deep blood feud with Shu Demon Mountain's military advisor.</p><p></p><p>"This setting is a bit complicated. It seems this Wangshan Temple abbot... is also a key quest character," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>With his years of gaming experience, this Wangshan Temple abbot definitely had issues.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang nodded, agreeing with Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate and county captain beside them were confused, not quite understanding what Qi Yuan was saying.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, first to Wangshan Temple, then to kill demons." Qi Yuan stood up.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang, as the temporary bodyguard, hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao did as well.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only the county magistrate and county captain were left in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly clean up, these delicacies... will reward the soldiers on the city walls, they probably haven't tasted meat in some time." The county magistrate hunched over, looking at the hot dishes on the table, a hint of reminiscence in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His meals hadn't been this good in a long time either, it was thanks to the Demon Suppression Bureau's presence that they had prepared such a feast.</p><p></p><p>"These Demon Suppression Bureau people... should be taking the Tong family away.</p><p></p><p>The Tong family's grain... and livestock, could we... keep them?" The county captain stroked his beard, his expression indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Once the Tong family was taken away by the Demon Suppression Bureau people, the city's strength would decline.</p><p></p><p>Zhenyang City... really had no hope.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." The county magistrate lamented, "The noble clans have it good."</p><p></p><p>With Zhenyang City in crisis, the county magistrate often went to the Tong family estate for help.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Old Master Tong didn't care at all about defending Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>He neither sent troops nor provided grain.</p><p></p><p>As county magistrate, he had no way to deal with Old Master Tong.</p><p></p><p>First, Old Master Tong was from a noble clan, with over a thousand private soldiers and a fortress built within. In terms of strength, he was even stronger than Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>Second, Old Master Tong also held an official position and was from a family known for filial piety. Fengyuan ruled through filial piety, and a family known for filial piety was a great honor, equivalent to a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p><p></p><p>Third, Old Master Tong had connections in the imperial court. If offended severely, he as county magistrate could very well lose his legitimacy.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate didn't care about the latter two points.</p><p></p><p>But the first point, he couldn't ignore.</p><p></p><p>He very much coveted the Tong family's private army. If they helped defend... Zhenyang City would have a much easier time.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

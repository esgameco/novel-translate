            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her strength, during the Celestial Realm era, was also quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what people remembered most about her were the love-hate relationships she had with the celestial deities.</p><p></p><p>Even among the top powerhouses, gossip and casual observation existed.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride, stay away from me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan drew his sword and went to meet her.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not fuse with Little Bride, but fought alone.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this was the first time he had engaged in combat with an intelligent being in the game.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is indeed impressive, but isn't your achievement just due to the gifts bestowed by the celestial deities?" </p><p></p><p>Zang Hua said, her eyes reddening.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Yong and the other powerhouses of the divine realms were all watching the battle.</p><p></p><p>What Zang Hua said resonated with some people.</p><p></p><p>Some also understood that Zang Hua had a grievance in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua had always admired the celestial deities and fought battles for them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the position of the Celestial Empress was taken by the Princess Bride.</p><p></p><p>As proud as Zang Hua was, she was even willing to lower her head and become a concubine of the celestial deities.</p><p></p><p>But she was rejected by the celestial deities.</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua had complex emotions towards the celestial deities and the Princess Bride.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Lord of the Clothing Division, the husband of the Princess Bride, had suddenly risen to prominence.</p><p></p><p>There must be many gifts left behind by the celestial deities for the Clothing Division, and perhaps even treasures that could enhance one's talents.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zang Hua had never liked the Clothing Division, and was somewhat opposed to the new Princess Bride, the celestial deities, and their daughter.</p><p></p><p>So even though Long Pan had defeated Yong, the others remained silent, but she still stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Besides your talent, what else do you have?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you experienced the chaos of the Western Sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever fought against the three great divine realms?"</p><p></p><p>"Without experiencing the great battles, you are still just a fledgling, and cannot defeat the evil forces from outside the divine realms!"</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua shouted, "Let me show you what it means to be one of the Ten Generals of the Celestial Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua was once one of the Ten Generals of the Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Realm, she was second only to the celestial deities and the four division leaders.</p><p></p><p>She had fought countless battles throughout her life, experiencing thousands of large and small battles.</p><p></p><p>She was a woman who had crawled out of a sea of blood, standing atop a mountain of corpses.</p><p></p><p>When she made a move, it was with endless and fierce attacks.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could see Zang Hua's figure everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua used her strongest divine martial arts technique.</p><p></p><p>Endless Flower Sea!</p><p></p><p>Countless flower petals danced in the sky, and hundreds of Zang Hua's figures moved among them, launching different attacks towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Unless one's martial arts and spiritual awareness were far superior to Zang Hua's, it would be impossible to distinguish the real Zang Hua from the illusions.</p><p></p><p>This technique was extremely effective against inexperienced fighters.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his sword in front of him.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanyuan Forbidden, Clothing Forbidden, and Five Elements Forbidden Lands, Qi Yuan had killed countless monsters, and had experienced many battles.</p><p></p><p>His combat experience was far richer than the disciples, or even the elders, of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>But the opponents he had fought were almost all mindless monsters.</p><p></p><p>How could they compare to Zang Hua? Or rather, their combat experience was not even in the same league.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thrust his sword, with great force.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the countless illusions, he locked onto Zang Hua's true form.</p><p></p><p>Because his eyes could see the prompts.</p><p></p><p>The thrust of the sword made a flash of surprise in Zang Hua's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She could not dodge in time, and directly pushed her palm towards him.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>The collision of the sword and the palm should have been the victory of the sword.</p><p></p><p>But Zang Hua's eyes revealed a cunning smile: "You are still too young."</p><p></p><p>The powerful force penetrated the sword and directly entered Qi Yuan's chest.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan had full-body defenses.</p><p></p><p>But he was still slightly injured by the piercing power.</p><p></p><p>His face turned pale as he looked at the bloodied Zang Hua in his hand, his expression calm: "You're right."</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the great powerhouses of the divine realms spoke, their eyes filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"He actually managed to injure Zang Hua."</p><p></p><p>"It seems we have all underestimated him, he is not just a talented cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"The Endless Flower Sea, even I cannot be certain of Zang Hua's true form, how did he do it?"</p><p></p><p>"He is still too young, and was tricked by Zang Hua."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, he is still too immature.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years... too short, too short." Feather spoke, his expression indecipherable.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Lord of the Clothing Division, in just a few days, had reached the completion of the Five Elements, a talent unseen in the past and unmatched in the future.</p><p></p><p>If given enough time, the possibilities were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was watching Zang Hua and Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His combat techniques were all about grinding monsters, sufficient for dealing with ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>But against the evil forces from outside the divine realms, they were far from enough.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan was not alone.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes and said towards Zang Hua, "Thank you, let's go again."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the experiences and insights of the burly man in his mind gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>That burly man, who was carefree in his youth and suddenly enlightened after reading a book in middle age, was actually a powerful swordsman.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's sword techniques, the burly man's sword experience was the most suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had forgotten his own skills.</p><p></p><p>He had become like that burly man.</p><p></p><p>He wielded the sword, slaying the evil sea serpent for seven days in the Eastern Sea, stripping the skin and tendons of the rampaging evil serpent.</p><p></p><p>He opened the door to the underworld and slew a demonic beast of the Dibound.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded the sword, the aura of the sword permeating, brewing, accumulating, like a dark cloud.</p><p></p><p>"Qingping Zi, let's fight!" Qi Yuan opened his eyes, and in an instant, the sword's edge pierced the sky, breaking through the dark clouds and revealing a beam of ultimate brilliance in the human world.</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua's mouth curled into a disdainful smile, as if saying, "Insignificant dog, is this all?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Five Elements Forbidden Land, the coffin lid was lifted.</p><p></p><p>The burly man's face was a little pale, and he looked towards the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land with an appreciative expression: "The kid is not bad, he has a bit of my style from back then, but a pity his appearance and bearing are still lacking, not yet tempered by the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Hmph! *spits*"</p><p></p><p>He habitually spat outside the coffin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After coming out of the game, Qi Yuan did not read any books, but closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was recalling the battle with Zang Hua in the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua was truly one of the Ten Generals of the Celestial Realm, her combat power was astonishing, and her battle techniques and methods were beyond what the previous Qi Yuan could match.</p><p></p><p>He immersed himself in the combat experience of Senior Qingping Zi, and fought against Zang Hua.</p><p></p><p>He had learned a part of Qingping Zi's sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>And his eyes were the counter to Zang Hua's most powerful technique, the Endless Flower Sea.</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua did not use this technique again.</p><p></p><p>Her strength was greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan gradually gained the upper hand, and as his understanding of Qingping Zi's sword dao deepened, his combat prowess grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Zang Hua was defeated.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained the divine reflections of many powerhouses in the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land as he wished.</p><p></p><p>The exhausted him had no choice but to log off.</p><p></p><p>As for how to control the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land, he would have to consider that next time he logged in.</p><p></p><p>"The sword dao, am I now a true sword cultivator?" Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>However, he realized that he was still very different from true sword cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivators of the Great Merchant Kingdom had a sword law that their entire spiritual awareness was devoted to.</p><p></p><p>When the sword broke, the person was injured.</p><p></p><p>He did not have that. He was not one of them.</p><p></p><p>Although the knife was strong, it was not a sword, and the path was different.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan also did not want to entrust his life and property to a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"The five elements are still in the process of replacement, it should be wood soon." Qiyuan pondered, not knowing if it would bring another small shock to the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>This replacement is related to the order of fusion with the Five Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>He left the courtyard and stood on the half-slope of the Seven-Color Peak, inhaling and exhaling the refined qi, and the golden radiance was exhaled.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that I didn't exhale fire, otherwise I would have become the Calabash Brothers."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a flying crane appeared in Qiyuan's field of vision.</p><p></p><p>The crane held an invitation letter in its beak.</p><p></p><p>The crane flew straight towards Qiyuan, and the invitation letter also fell into Qiyuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Wanfa Peak, Dongxian? Visiting me?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan carefully recalled, but couldn't figure out who Dongxian was.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's meet." Qiyuan felt curious.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was used to being a mediocre person, and many people in the Shenguang Sect knew him, but it was rare for someone to visit him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." He replied on the invitation letter.</p><p></p><p>The white crane picked up the invitation letter, flapped its wings, and flew away from the Seven-Color Peak again.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, a young man in black clothes appeared in Qiyuan's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man, Qiyuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the one called Dongxian? Aren't you called Xiao Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Dongxian: "...Senior brother, your disciple is not called Xiao Yan, senior brother may have mistaken."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan heard this and felt a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>If he had known it was him, he wouldn't have seen him.</p><p></p><p>"What brought you here to see me?" Since they had already met, Qiyuan naturally wouldn't drive Dongxian away.</p><p></p><p>If he offended this person, and he came with a line like "Don't bully the poor youth" and stormed off the mountain, Qiyuan felt he wouldn't be able to sleep at night.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian showed an enthusiastic smile: "Senior brother, I've heard that you are fond of games. I have a few collector's edition ones here."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Dongxian took out a few game jade slips.</p><p></p><p>This time, he spent a lot to take out his treasured games, just to get close to Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>After they became familiar, he could then invite Senior Brother Qiyuan to participate in the Dragon Snatching Battle.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan took the jade slips, and as soon as he touched them, a scene appeared in Qiyuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk." Qiyuan held the jade slips, this was the first time he had come into contact with such interdimensional contraband.</p><p></p><p>This game was the kind where real people acted as NPCs, of course, it was just a projection.</p><p></p><p>Some of the plots were extremely bold.</p><p></p><p>And it was deeply immersed in the essence of acting.</p><p></p><p>Among the female cultivators, there were seductive fox spirits, there were senior sisters from the neighboring cave dwellings, there were arrogant young ladies, and there were also cold and proud sword immortals.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these game jade slips, in addition to this type, there was also a type of spell-casting, which could simulate the spell battles of foundation-building cultivators and improve the experience of foundation-building cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Is the senior brother satisfied?" Dongxian said in a low voice, showing an expression of a kindred spirit.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan glanced sideways at Dongxian: "I'm in sage mode now, I'm not interested in these. Tell me, what did you come to see me for?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan returned the game jade slips to Dongxian.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, this was not quite right, he randomly left behind one, which was the sword immortal's, coincidentally.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was a little dazed at first.</p><p></p><p>This Senior Brother Qiyuan really spoke in a strange way.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, he took one of the jade slips, so he could establish a relationship.</p><p></p><p>And sometimes, a good way to establish a relationship is to ask for advice, and at the same time let the other person show their own strengths.</p><p></p><p>After all, many people like to act as teachers.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that Senior Brother's sword technique is very good, I specially came to ask Senior Brother for guidance..." Dongxian's words were interrupted halfway.</p><p></p><p>A hurried voice came from his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Sword technique! Ask for guidance on sword technique!"</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was puzzled, but still said as Qi Lao said: "To ask Senior Brother for guidance on sword technique."</p><p></p><p>Sword technique is good, ask for guidance on sword technique?</p><p></p><p>Is there something wrong with me or with you? Qiyuan looked at Dongxian, feeling that this person had the destiny of a protagonist, but his head seemed a bit problematic.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Why would he care about someone with a problem in their head?</p><p></p><p>"Sword technique, I happen to know a bit." Qiyuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>His sword technique was indeed not bad.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Slashing Heaven Pulling Sword Technique he originally knew, the sword techniques in Qingping's memory were also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"What aspects do you want to understand?" Qiyuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Lao didn't transmit anything else, he just wanted to see how Qiyuan's sword technique was.</p><p></p><p>After all, the rumor was that the Black Mountain Sect was wiped out, and he always felt that there was a mysterious connection with this Qiyuan, or perhaps with the people behind Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian lowered his head and thought, then said, "Now I'm only at the refining qi stage, unable to nurture a magic sword like the sword cultivators, but I still want to be able to make a sword fly and bring down a bird with one stroke like the sword cultivators. Is there any good sword technique that can achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was making things up as he went along, and in the end, he landed on sword technique.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan heard this and looked at Dongxian with some surprise: "You're not bad, you have the resources of Xiao Yan.</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators are strong, their strength lies in the magic sword.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, cultivators at the refining qi stage can hardly have a magic sword."</p><p></p><p>First, magic swords are too precious, cultivators at the refining qi stage cannot afford them; second, the spiritual power of cultivators at the refining qi stage is lacking, and they cannot project their spiritual awareness outwards, so they cannot wield swords.</p><p></p><p>So, sword cultivators at the refining qi stage, their combat power is just average.</p><p></p><p>It's not until they reach the foundation establishment stage that the strength of sword cultivators is truly manifested.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan continued: "Without a magic sword, but we can have... a qi sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi sword? What is that?" Dongxian was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators at the refining qi stage, what do they refine? It's the primordial qi, the spiritual qi! Since there is qi, then we can use qi to form a sword, release the sword qi, and kill people invisibly!" Qiyuan spoke eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Qingping's sword dao, when cultivated to the highest level, was to use qi to form a sword, with no sword in hand, but the qi became the sword.</p><p></p><p>An even higher realm was to make oneself the sword.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat similar to some sword cultivators, who forged themselves into a magic sword, but the end result was the same.</p><p></p><p>"Using qi to form a sword is indeed not bad, but you have to be careful, don't go astray and use qi to form a horse, that's not a good thing." Qiyuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian: "???"</p><p></p><p>He had a completely puzzled look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Why did every word Qiyuan said make sense individually, but when put together he didn't understand what it meant?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qiyuan, using qi to form a sword, what does that mean?</p><p></p><p>And don't use qi to form a horse, what does that mean?" Dongxian was now completely confused.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand, don't all cultivators at the refining qi stage practice cultivating spiritual power into spiritual force? How could they use qi to form a sword?</p><p></p><p>"Disciple is dull-witted, please explain in detail, Senior."</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to personally demonstrate to you what it means to use qi to form a sword.</p><p></p><p>Take a look, and you'll probably understand, it's not that difficult." Qiyuan said.</p><p></p><p>Qingping's sword dao, Qiyuan had only seen it once but understood it.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Dongxian was completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Was Senior Brother Qiyuan not talking nonsense, but he really knew how to use qi to form a sword?</p><p></p><p>Or was he, like those Elixir Cultivators, creating a giant hand with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to capture low-level cultivators?</p><p></p><p>He had seen such scenes before.</p><p></p><p>But Senior Brother Qiyuan was only at the refining qi stage, his spiritual power was insufficient, and he would probably not be able to do it, even if he forced himself, the power would be "shocking".</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Dongxian, watch carefully!"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's expression became serious, he stretched out his hand and made a sword-pointing gesture.</p><p></p><p>A thread of golden radiance burst forth from his hand.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

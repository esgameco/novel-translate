        <h1>Chapter 516</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The golden step-waist pendant was gifted to you by your uncle..."</p><p></p><p>"The jade pendant at your waist was made by Xuangu, and it is a spiritual artifact."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Your armpit hair is a bit long."</p><p></p><p>"Huh???"</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, in the courtyard of the city, Jiang Yunxi looked at the pile of ingredients in the house, her expression somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>"The world is tumultuous, and evil spirits are rampant. Young lady, it is time for you to save the world."  Chen Kangbao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"But... what does cutting vegetables have to do with saving the world?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi blankly bought the kitchen knife and was also taken by Chen Kangbao to a courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Deity once said, 'If one cannot even sweep one's own house, how can one sweep the world?'</p><p></p><p>If you do not learn to cut vegetables and cultivate unparalleled knife skills, how can you eliminate the evil spirits?" Chen Kangbao earnestly persuaded her.</p><p></p><p>"So, the first step to saving the world is to cut vegetables. </p><p></p><p>Chop all the cabbages, eggplants, meats, etc. in the house into fine pieces - this is your first test.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and remember to wash the vegetables before cutting, don't make the vegetables dirty and waste the food."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi had a million questions in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She said with half belief, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>The old man in front of her was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of her was even deeper than her own self-knowledge, with the air of a worldly immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Since I have nothing to do, I might as well give it a try?" Jiang Yunxi thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>In the kitchen, she looked at the vegetables and meats filling the room, this young lady of noble birth finally began her day as a kitchen maid.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, in a cool pavilion,</p><p>A man and a woman were playing chess. The black pieces had the advantage, surrounding and attacking the white pieces. The two had ordinary appearances, but carried the bearing of immortals from the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"That old man seems to have some skills, but not much." The woman, named Yunlei, who was a mid-level military commander, commented.</p><p></p><p>She and the man, named Yunhu, were under the prince's orders to secretly protect Princess Jiang Yunxi. </p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's personality was carefree and innocent. This time, she had secretly escaped the manor to join the lively crowd at Yeshanhu, and the prince was worried, so he had them two secretly protect her.</p><p></p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, they would not reveal themselves.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jiang Yunxi also had her own cultivation, and with many spiritual artifacts protecting her, ordinary people could not harm her, so there was no need to worry.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just curious, how did he convince the princess?" Yunhu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Although the princess was carefree and innocent, she was not stupid.</p><p></p><p>They had been following from afar, only knowing that the princess was conversing with the old man, but the content of the conversation was not clear.</p><p></p><p>"Probably some master of deception, when the princess gets tired of playing, it will be our time to act." Yunlei said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>She had little respect for Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Yunhu nodded, a smile flashing in his eyes, "This old man does have some ability, to be able to persuade the princess to cut vegetables."</p><p></p><p>The princess had been raised with a silver spoon, where would she have done hard labor?</p><p></p><p>Now, she truly had not tasted bitterness.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from Qiyuan's lack of good fortune.</p><p></p><p>In the kitchen, the sound of "bang bang bang!" kept ringing out.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi held the kitchen knife and chopped forcefully.</p><p></p><p>The vegetable basket was filled with finely chopped vegetables.</p><p></p><p>Her arms were aching.</p><p></p><p>"So tiring, even more tiring than cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi had washed the vegetables for an hour, and had been cutting for three hours already.</p><p></p><p>However, with all her efforts, she had only cut less than a third.</p><p></p><p>Her hands were sore and her arms were in pain, but she persisted.</p><p></p><p>"The old immortal was right, in those biographical novels I've read, the protagonists who want to improve their strength need to undergo tempering, like doing ten thousand spear thrusts a day, using chopsticks to catch a hundred flies, cutting vegetables... this is my own cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, one day, I, Jiang Yunxi, can also become the protagonist in a biographical novel."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, who's going to write about me?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I need to keep a diary and record the daily events, and when I go back, I'll hint to the manager Chen to write me a book!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was lost in her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>She was thinking about how to beautify herself in the diary.</p><p></p><p>As for the old immortal's mentions of long armpit hair and bed-wetting, those could not appear in the diary.</p><p></p><p>Tonight when she takes a bath, she must quickly shave off the armpit hair! At this moment, footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi hurriedly sped up her movements, not wanting to be looked down upon by the old immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you're very focused... wait, how come you've only cut this little?" Chen Kangbao had a puzzled look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the resounding Jiang Yunxi and had a resigned expression: "You... haven't used a kitchen knife before, the sheath is still on the knife!"</p><p></p><p>At first, Qiyuan had made a sheath to protect himself from the bloody and smelly meat.</p><p></p><p>But later, Qiyuan thought about it, since he was going to play the role of a kitchen knife, he should truly immerse himself in it.</p><p></p><p>"Sheath?" Jiang Yunxi was confused.</p><p></p><p>She only now realized that the kitchen knife she had been using was a bit unusual.</p><p></p><p>She looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>No wonder cutting vegetables was so tiring for her, it was because of the knife sheath.</p><p></p><p>She took off the knife sheath, and suddenly, an ancient, sharp, and restrained kitchen knife appeared before Jiang Yunxi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How, is this kitchen knife worth 999 taels of silver?" Chen Kangbao said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi glanced at it... Hmm, it didn't have the aura of a high-level spiritual artifact.</p><p></p><p>"...It's worth it."</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the old immortal, it's worth it.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and finish cutting these vegetables, I'll teach you the second step."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's face showed an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>The old immortal was finally going to teach her real skills?</p><p></p><p>"The first step to saving the world is cutting vegetables, the second step is... making buns."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Yunxi blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Making buns? "Yes, making buns."</p><p></p><p>"Does the old immortal have some deeper meaning?" Jiang Yunxi asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>She could understand cutting vegetables, but making buns?</p><p></p><p>"Making buns may seem ordinary, but it's actually not simple.</p><p></p><p>What your eyes see may not be the truth." Chen Kangbao continued to persuade.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi stood quietly, listening to Chen Kangbao's teachings.</p><p></p><p>"I have a friend who sells dog meat, in your eyes, isn't he committing many sins against the dogs?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"But in reality, he is a great benefactor, saving many dogs.</p><p>Whenever he sells dog meat, he sells three pounds as six pounds, and for every dog he sells, he saves one."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao repeated the nonsense he had heard from Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi widened her eyes, she had never seen the commenters of the world, nor had she been baptized by various jokes, so when she first heard such words, she was truly persuaded.</p><p></p><p>"Can it really be like that?"</p><p></p><p>"So, hurry up and finish cutting the vegetables and go make buns.</p><p>Sometimes, what you may be making is not just buns, but saving the common people of the world."</p><p></p><p>"Making buns can also save the common people?" Jiang Yunxi was puzzled, feeling that the old immortal's words were profound, difficult for an ordinary person to understand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Chen Kangbao silently answered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He loved to eat buns.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The buns he made, he ate them, filling his stomach, this was also a way to save the common people.</p><p></p><p>He was also one of the common people.</p><p></p><p>Three days passed, and Jiang Yunxi had been working very hard.</p><p></p><p>During this time, she immersed herself wholeheartedly in the career of a kitchen maid.</p><p></p><p>Cutting vegetables every day, cutting vegetables, cutting vegetables, occasionally making some buns.</p><p></p><p>This kind of life was something she had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>At first, she was very tired, very bored, and even felt very irritated.</p><p></p><p>But gradually, she began to like this kind of life, and had a sense of righteous mission.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that even doing the work had its own meaning.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, born with a strong and healthy body, no need to suffer from hardship.</p><p></p><p>At night, she dragged her weary body back to her room.</p><p></p><p>The vegetable knife was placed on the dressing table.</p><p></p><p>She stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>"So tired and sleepy, I won't take a shower tonight, I'll do it in the morning."</p><p></p><p>"I need to write a diary."</p><p></p><p>"Today was another day of hard work, my knife skills have become more and more exquisite, I'm afraid that even if I encounter a master, he would not be as good as me at cutting vegetables.</p><p></p><p>Even though I'm tired and sleepy, I can't lose my grace. After returning to my room and bathing, I'll go to sleep, welcoming a beautiful tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi finished writing the diary, feeling satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice sounded in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, are you even fooling yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"Who?" Jiang Yunxi was startled, her face full of shock, scanning the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Don't bother looking, I'm that vegetable knife."</p><p></p><p>"The vegetable knife?" Jiang Yunxi looked at the vegetable knife as if she was looking at a ghost, with both awe and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>How could the vegetable knife be talking?</p><p></p><p>Even heavenly-grade artifacts could not speak.</p><p></p><p>"I originally could not speak, but your diligent vegetable cutting has awakened my intelligence."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>In order to truly play the role of a vegetable knife, since he started cutting vegetables, Qi Yuan had cut off his own five senses, just like a real vegetable knife, without any intelligence or thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Yunxi continued to cut vegetables, his vegetable knife acting ability also continued to improve, reaching over 60%.</p><p></p><p>This also gave him new abilities.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the vegetable knife gained new abilities.</p><p></p><p>The birth of intelligence, the five senses.</p><p></p><p>And the vegetable knife also became more solid and sharp.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was a hidden evaluation that with just this strength, it might even be comparable to that kind of hard heavenly-grade artifact.</p><p></p><p>Converted to, his physique is comparable to a heavenly-grade artifact.</p><p></p><p>This is actually quite terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the power of earth-grade puppet masters largely comes from artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Even if they cultivate, their physique is still very fragile, unable to withstand artifacts.</p><p></p><p>But now, Qi Yuan is different.</p><p></p><p>Originally he was a technique-type combat force, but now he can be a reckless fighter.</p><p></p><p>"You can actually talk?" Jiang Yunxi blinked her eyes, a tumultuous wave surging in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she really is the savior?</p><p></p><p>"Are you a man or a woman? No, no, according to the biographical novels, beings like you generally have no gender, you're deliberately using a male voice to please me as your master, your voice sounds quite nice, say more!" Jiang Yunxi was very excited, and the fatigue in her body disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you talking anymore? Ah... I understand, it was my will that went wrong, I shouldn't have said such ambiguous words.</p><p></p><p>What we need to do now is to abandon love and work hard to defeat the great villain!</p><p></p><p>Finally, I will hold your broken body in my arms, watching your intelligence disappear, feeling heartbroken, only then will I realize that my feelings for you are not just comradeship, but also love, which I have always ignored.</p><p></p><p>In the end, you will die in my arms, and I will retreat to the mountains alone, what a touching scene that will be!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Yunxi became a little excited.</p><p></p><p>Her words were just like some netizens, who hope that a certain chess player would defeat the AI and then die with his last move, becoming an eternal chess saint.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being card-blocked like the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"You're thinking a bit too much." Qi Yuan was also speechless.</p><p></p><p>This person, the last time he encountered someone this speechless was the last time.</p><p></p><p>"Now that you have cut vegetables enough, we should move on to the third step."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"The third step?" Jiang Yunxi looked expectant.</p><p></p><p>"A vegetable knife that has never seen blood is not a good vegetable knife.</p><p></p><p>A warrior who has not experienced killing cannot become a savior."</p><p></p><p>"Are we going to punish the evil and help the good, rob the rich and help the poor, kill the bandits, and slay the strange spirits tomorrow?" Jiang Yunxi looked full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>Rob the rich and help the poor? You should rob yourself first.</p><p></p><p>"No, tomorrow we will start to capture the ingredients ourselves, and kill the fish!"</p><p></p><p>"In the Yeshanhu Lake, the great villain has secretly polluted many fish, turning them into strange spirits, now you need to kill those fish!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he preached the "Transformation Dragon Technique" on the boat, and many fish followed him at the time.</p><p></p><p>These fish, many of them have entered the Yeshanhu Lake.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed Qi Yuan to have a better understanding of Yeshanhu Lake, and he also discovered some abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Because, some of the fish he preached, died mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>The culprit was some strange fish.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's eyesight, he immediately judged that those fish were similar to the corpses in the spirit-nurturing place, being nurtured as strange spirits.</p><p></p><p>Now, by playing the role of a vegetable knife, he can let Jiang Yunxi go catch the ingredients and slay the strange fish, which can also increase her experience, achieving three benefits at once.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At dawn, the chill of Yeshanhu Lake dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Yun Li and Yun Hu sat in the boat, following the small boat in front of them from afar.</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, that old man does have some ability, actually able to persuade the princess to be a laborer for a few days!" Yun Li mentioned this and wanted to laugh.</p><p></p><p>The princess made too many buns, and Chen Kang couldn't finish eating them all, so he set up a stall to sell them.</p><p></p><p>As the person responsible for protecting the princess's safety, she hadn't tasted the princess's handiwork yet, and quickly went to buy some to eat.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that they were quite delicious.</p><p></p><p>"The King knows about the situation here and is a little surprised, but he didn't object." Yun Hu said.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, the King also came to Yeshanhu Lake, and Yun Hu told him about what happened to the princess, and also brought some buns.</p><p></p><p>The King ate the buns and did not object.</p><p></p><p>As long as the daughter is not really in danger, experiencing more is always good.</p><p></p><p>"The princess has indeed been more diligent than before, and she seems to have even more drive today." Yun Li commented.</p><p></p><p>"You don't think that old man is really a high-level recluse, do you?" Yun Li thought of something and couldn't help but comment.</p><p></p><p>"How could that be, he's just eccentric and crazy, if he were really a high-level recluse, how could the princess be so foolish as to talk to fish?" Yun Hu said.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, their boat was not far from the princess's small boat, and they heard the princess hugging a fish, asking the strange fish where it was.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but she also asked the fish to lead the way, and went to kill the strange fish herself.</p><p></p><p>There were too many flaws that couldn't be ignored.</p><p></p><p>First, how could a fish be a strange fish? In Yeshanhu Lake, there was only the terrifying strange spirit, the Water Lord, it would not allow other strange spirits to enter its territory.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, even if there were strange fish, how would an ordinary fish understand human speech and lead the way? This is just ridiculous, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

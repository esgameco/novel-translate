        <h1>Chapter 541</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old woman Huansha heard this and her heart tightened, and she couldn't help but blurt out, "No!"</p><p></p><p>She thought Qi Yuan had agreed to Liuchun Dong's proposal and would sacrifice himself to allow the Divine Arrival to return.</p><p></p><p>This was something she did not want to see.</p><p></p><p>Her faith was in the Divine Arrival, whatever kind of Divine Arrival it was.</p><p></p><p>Liuchun Dong solemnly said, "Everyone has the right to choose for themselves. No matter what choice Big Brother Qi makes, I will support and understand it.</p><p></p><p>I know I shouldn't have said these words, but I had no other choice.</p><p></p><p>I didn't expect... Big Brother Qi would actually agree."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes, "Who said I'm going to extinguish my own consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he took out a light saber from his storage artifact and handed it to the old woman Huansha.</p><p></p><p>"I will leave the Luoshe, and I don't know when I will return. During this time, you will be in charge of the Luoshe, maintaining its stability.</p><p></p><p>If you encounter an unbeatable enemy, activate this artifact, and the Divine Arrival will appear."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Arrival that had drunk the poisonous rain was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>However, with the increase in the degree of performance, the Divine Arrival seemed to refresh like a boss.</p><p></p><p>So my Divine Arrival can also continue to be used.</p><p></p><p>"As for what you said... what the Divine Arrival expects..." Qi Yuan looked at Liuchun Dong, "Perhaps everything will be resolved when I return."</p><p></p><p>"You're leaving?" Liuchun Dong was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng was also amazed at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In his view, since the Divine Arrival now had divine consciousness, it was no longer a divine artifact, but a divine powerhouse, just like a human.</p><p></p><p>All humans have the seven emotions and six desires, and have their own pursuits.</p><p></p><p>The Luoshe Kingdom, which was once the number one power in the world, is now in decline, but it is still among the top three.</p><p></p><p>Wealth, resources, power, beauty... it has everything.</p><p></p><p>Even as a divine soldier, including him Liu Sheng, they could not calmly give up these things.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan actually wants to give up these things and leave the Luoshe Kingdom? </p><p></p><p>How could he not be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm going to leave the Luoshe Kingdom, I still have many important things to do," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Liuchun Dong was dumbfounded, and didn't expect Qi Yuan to leave.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng couldn't help but ask, "Why not rest for a few years before leaving?"</p><p></p><p>"No, time is precious, I have to leave soon," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao, who was eating a bun, raised his head, his face showing a joyful expression: "Okay, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The carriage came with a thunderous roar and left silently.</p><p></p><p>In the night, no one knew that the terrifying divine being who had slaughtered the gods and shaken the Luoshe during the day... had already left.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng looked at the back of the carriage, his heart full of a thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Not even staying one night? Staying in the palace at night and enjoying the pleasures? </p><p></p><p>Regarding Qi Yuan, he was even more admired.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he definitely wouldn't be able to leave just like that.</p><p></p><p>Even if he left, he would at least... stay one night, right? With so many charming women in the palace, they would offer themselves without being forced.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Liu Sheng only thought about this in a vulgar way.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi... is truly a sage," Liu Sheng couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready? I'm going to the Divine Wood Abyss."</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Token, Qi Yuan scanned the information on it and sent out a new message.</p><p></p><p>The NPC commentator was still online: "You're still alive, which is a bit beyond my expectations."</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuyun also logged on: "Big Brother Qi... you're not dead?"</p><p></p><p>She had just taken a shower, and her hair was wet.</p><p></p><p>"Don't curse me, you all died but I didn't," Qi Yuan said, "This Void Amusement Park, do I have to take on tasks frequently? If so, you'd better not recommend me to go, I'm used to being free and easy."</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member was slightly stunned: "This is indeed more in line with your usual style, but it's a pity."</p><p></p><p>It is indeed a pity.</p><p></p><p>Staying in this world, or even saying this embryonic universe, there is no future.</p><p></p><p>If he joins the Void Amusement Park and goes to the Zhou Universe, he can avoid the disaster.</p><p></p><p>"I'm done with my things, do you want to go to the Divine Wood Abyss and meet up?" Qi Yuan said, "And help you supervise the Thorn Blood, see if they have been diligently cultivating."</p><p></p><p>The time for him to play the role of a blind artifact maker is approaching, if he doesn't go to the Divine Wood Abyss soon, he will go blind.</p><p></p><p>After going blind, his eyes will not be able to see the information difference, nor can he communicate through the Divine Wood Token.</p><p></p><p>This will also affect his combat.</p><p></p><p>"The divine-level ones in Thorn Blood don't dare to touch you now," the Thorn Blood staff member said truthfully, "But compared to the task, I'm more interested in the Divine Wood Abyss, I heard even the Yang God is interested in the Divine Wood Abyss."</p><p></p><p>The Yang God Patriarch, in the Zhou Universe, is also a major figure.</p><p></p><p>He is someone that needs to be looked up to.</p><p></p><p>Through the ancestors, he knew that the Divine Wood Abyss is not as simple as it appears on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Although this embryonic universe is not even a hundredth the size of the Zhou Universe, it is still vast, and the Yin God powerhouses cannot explore it completely in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Among so many worlds, the worlds with the Divine Wood Abyss are relatively rare.</p><p></p><p>This time, he thought about it, and still decided to explore the Divine Wood Abyss with Qi Yuan and the others first, before considering whether to complete the task or not.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan... he is very strong.</p><p></p><p>But he is not weak either.</p><p></p><p>He stands at the peak of the Stepping Sky Three Steps, and also has some powerful tools from the Void Amusement Park, so even if Qi Yuan attacks, he is not afraid.</p><p></p><p>He is confident.</p><p></p><p>Except for the ancestral gods of this embryonic universe or the Yin God powerhouses who have reached the extreme, he has the confidence to escape from the rest.</p><p></p><p>"They're not coming?" Qi Yuan didn't really care.</p><p></p><p>There are divine trees in the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he obtained, the divine trees are the best material for artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>Many divine artifacts in this world are made from divine wood materials.</p><p></p><p>Since he plans to forge a brand new Divine Arrival, he naturally has to go to the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me the specific location of the Divine Wood Abyss, I'll go there now," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"It's in the westernmost part of the Luoshe Kingdom, the land of the setting sun."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the scattered stars, "Is there a more specific description?"</p><p></p><p>"It's under the Sunset Cliff."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Abyss is a secret place, and not everyone knows about it, but the Sunset Cliff is very famous.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, do you know the Sunset Cliff?" Qi Yuan casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"I know it," Chen Kang Bao quickly said, "I heard the story of Quark chasing the sun when I was young."</p><p></p><p>Chasing the sun? </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Once, he had told many stories to the Soundless Voice.</p><p></p><p>The modified kind.</p><p></p><p>Among them was the story of Quark chasing the sun.</p><p></p><p>"Quark had an older brother named Quafu, who was tall and huge, with his feet stepping on the earth and his head reaching the sky, chasing the sun. In the end, he died.</p><p></p><p>Although Quark was born short, even invisible to the human eye, he couldn't bear to see his brother perish, so he also imitated Quafu to chase the sun, and finally... the sun fell into the Sunset Cliff, and he jumped down."</p><p></p><p>"...A really touching story, the person who created this story must be very cultured," Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>"In the palace treasury, I found a map of the Blue Mountain Realm. Young master, are you going to the Sunset Cliff?" Chen Kang Bao said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Divine Wood Token, Jie Wuyun sent a message.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we meet up?" She was a little afraid to go to the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"If you're afraid, why don't you just give the Divine Wood Token to Brother Qi," the Thorn Blood staff member said.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuyun hesitated for a moment, and finally...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll go," he said.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate I'll arrive in about a month. I'll see you in a month, hoping there won't be any unexpected incidents this time."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I've raised another flag."</p><p></p><p>"But it's fine, with my good luck, it's unlikely that I'll run into any trouble."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Traveling under the stars and moon, rushing through the night. Braving the wind and rain, enduring the hardships of the road.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan traveled very quickly, arriving at Sunset Cliff in less than a month.</p><p></p><p>Sunset Cliff is located in the west of the heavens, the ground covered in jagged rocks and stones, with hardly any vegetation.</p><p></p><p>A setting sun sank, as if plunging into the cliff below.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, there is a stele here," Chen Kangbao said.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the words on the stele and recited, "In the past, there was a tree, standing solemnly in the primordial chaos. Now I think of you, longing for you like a tree awaiting spring. How subtle, how subtle, do not seek the lord."</p><p></p><p>His voice was distant, carrying a sense of desolation and melancholy.</p><p></p><p>The carriage curtain was lifted, and an upright figure descended from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they would find that his pupils were unfocused.</p><p></p><p>His clothes were somewhat thin, and although he had a fleshy face, his aura was somewhat reclusive and depressed.</p><p></p><p>Sunset Cliff was not a secret place, and there were even quite a few young men and women who came here to play.</p><p></p><p>Many noticed this pair of servants, and when they saw the handsome young master, their eyes revealed a look of regret and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>So handsome, but a pity that he is blind.</p><p></p><p>This young man was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, the May restriction had descended, and he could only play the role of a blind instrument maker.</p><p></p><p>And if he did not complete this role-playing, he would remain in this state.</p><p></p><p>The most prominent feature of a blind instrument maker is that he is blind.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he has a reclusive personality and the madness of a genius craftsman.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he has no wife, no friends, and his life is even worse than that of a useless son-in-law like Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he started playing the role of a blind instrument maker, Qi Yuan felt himself becoming more reclusive.</p><p></p><p>He had also gone blind.</p><p></p><p>In his field of vision, there was only darkness or a reddish glow.</p><p></p><p>"Is it in front? Let me feel it," Qi Yuan knew about this stele.</p><p></p><p>He had once inadvertently heard the whisper of "how subtle, how subtle, do not seek the lord."</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious about this stele.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, be careful, there are many stones on the ground," Chen Kangbao reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even though I'm blind, I won't be tripped by stones and fall into Sunset Cliff, will I?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan approached the stele.</p><p></p><p>From behind, a young woman's voice of warning came.</p><p></p><p>"Blind man, don't go forward, the path is not even, be careful of slipping in."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded without responding.</p><p></p><p>A blind instrument maker is usually reclusive and not fond of conversation, so he had to act the part.</p><p></p><p>"This guy has no appreciation for kindness," the young woman said, resentfully, "I hope he falls in..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish speaking, the young woman suddenly widened her eyes: "Quick, someone come, someone has fallen into Sunset Cliff!"</p><p></p><p>The one who had fallen into Sunset Cliff was indeed the blind young master.</p><p></p><p>Just as his hand touched the stele, for some unknown reason, he suddenly fell into Sunset Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The young woman angrily slapped herself, realizing she had spoken too rashly.</p><p></p><p>Although the blind young master was impolite, he did not deserve to die.</p><p></p><p>"This person has fallen into Sunset Cliff... It seems his bones will be gone without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"His servant doesn't seem worried at all, could it be... a plot?" muttered some conspiracy theorists.</p><p></p><p>Many people boldly looked down into Sunset Cliff, but all they saw was clouds and mist, unable to see anything.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is a divine being descended from the heavens, how could he die?" Chen Kangbao was not anxious, calmly waiting by the side.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"He actually fell down?" </p><p></p><p>The sound of the wind kept ringing in Qi Yuan's ears, but he did not resist it. His thoughts were somewhat reviving.</p><p></p><p>He had just touched the stele, but suddenly an irresistible force swept him, and he fell from Sunset Cliff.</p><p></p><p>In midair, with his strength, he could have easily stepped on his left foot with his right and flown up.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed to have detected a different kind of scent, so he decided to let himself fall.</p><p></p><p>"Leaves, grass, flowing water..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard these sounds.</p><p></p><p>He also smelled the lush vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Not good... my divine power..." Suddenly, Qi Yuan was a bit surprised, because his divine power was significantly weakened in this area.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the place of the Heavenly Earth Connection?"</p><p></p><p>"I won't die from the fall, will I?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite annoyed. If he died in this game, that would be embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>However, he still had a trace of divine power within him.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he suddenly surged upward, reducing the force of the fall.</p><p></p><p>"I hope... I fall into the river."</p><p></p><p>If he fell onto some rocks, he would really be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>A soft resistance force came, and Qi Yuan felt like he had hit a bunch of ropes or a net.</p><p></p><p>A powerful impact force came, and he felt like his heart had been heavily pounded, and a mouthful of blood mixed with debris spilled out.</p><p></p><p>He had not been injured in the battle with the Six Divine Generals, but now, falling from the cliff, he was injured, which Qi Yuan found quite annoying.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his injury was quite severe, and his whole body was entangled in ropes.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>He coughed again, his breath weak.</p><p></p><p>"The deeper into the valley, the stronger the restraint, and now I... am probably only a little stronger than an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>In this condition, it would be very serious for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He might even die here, which would be laughable.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a faint sound came, as if someone was stepping on the dry yellow leaves.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan struggled a bit and looked towards the direction of the sound.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, now that he was blind, he couldn't see anything clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Who? Are you alive?"</p><p></p><p>A clear, crisp voice came, with a hint of confusion and a faint sense of detachment and coldness.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough... Alive, fell down from above," Qi Yuan tried to speak.</p><p></p><p>He forcefully pushed the ropes off his body.</p><p></p><p>"Did you break my swing?" the voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Swing? Maybe it was..." Qi Yuan tried to speak, but his injury was quite severe, and he was getting weaker and weaker. He felt he might faint if he continued talking.</p><p></p><p>"You have to compensate me!" The clear, cold voice came, with an undeniable tone.</p><p></p><p>"Save me... I'll compensate you ten thousand times!" Qi Yuan said these words, and his head became dizzy, finally fainting.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Where are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you speaking?"</p><p></p><p>"You didn't die, did you?"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise... I'll bury you under the tree as fertilizer."</p><p></p><p>The woman approached stealthily, walking very carefully.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan could still see the light, he would find that the woman in front of him... was a blind woman.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the blind woman stopped in front of Qi Yuan, a complex expression in her sightless eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since anyone came here."</p><p></p><p>Her slender, delicate hands rested on Qi Yuan's chest, her expression serious.</p><p></p><p>"This injury... is so severe, he almost died."</p><p></p><p>Looking at this young man who could not see, she hesitated slightly, then bit her own white, tender arm.</p><p></p><p>The blood dripped and fell into Qi Yuan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Her face turned as pale as paper.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go out..."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

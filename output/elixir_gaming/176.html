        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But foster father, don't neglect this, because to become a true god, your strength, potential, and cultivation speed are all related to the people in your domain," Qi Qi earnestly advised.</p><p></p><p>She had grand ambitions to cultivate her foster father into an unparalleled true god.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm strong enough, won't that solve the problem?" Qi Yuan pondered thoughtfully. </p><p></p><p>If it were in the Flowing Wind Realm, he could quickly mass-produce powerful experts.</p><p>But in the Mortal Heart Realm, it was somewhat difficult.</p><p></p><p>"The realm of true gods is called the Seven Steps to Heaven.</p><p>The first three steps are Venerable Ones, the last four steps are Great Venerables.</p><p>To become a Great Venerable, there must be at least one true god citizen in your domain! The more true god citizens, the stronger the Great Venerable's cultivation!" Qi Qi painted a grand picture for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the realm of Great Venerable was unthinkable for now. She mentioned it just to give her foster father some motivation.</p><p>After all, according to the villagers of Qingshui Village, foster father had just been born recently, and many of his memories may not have awakened yet.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan slowly asked: "Is it the same for Yang Gods?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was stunned for a moment, then slowly said: "That... your daughter doesn't know."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the starry sky.</p><p>The brightest star now was clearly a Yang God.</p><p>As for the others, they may not all be Yang Gods, but at least they were Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>The Canglan Realm was about to face a great calamity.</p><p>According to the Old Man of No Heaven, twenty million years ago, a supreme expert had defeated the great calamity, but unfortunately countless immortals and gods descended, and that supreme expert ultimately perished.</p><p></p><p>Behind that great calamity were Yang Gods and countless immortals and gods.</p><p>If he had countless immortal and god subordinates, would he still fear that great calamity? At worst, both sides would summon their forces, and it would come down to who could summon more and stronger forces.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense," Qi Yuan agreed with Qi Qi's words. "I want to rename Qingshui Village to Pei County."</p><p></p><p>He needed to cultivate these villagers.</p><p>But the question was, how to cultivate them?</p><p>Should he hold feasts every day?</p><p>That wouldn't be enough.</p><p></p><p>"How about I go steal some treasures to enhance their cultivation?" Qi Yuan asked, discussing with Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi replied: "That's one aspect, but more importantly, it's about the God Observation Method. But this requires foster father to recover his past memories."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was a bit confused, what past memories?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Qi continued: "Every ancient god is a heroic spirit who died in the Great Flood War in the past.</p><p>In the Great Flood War, true gods were generals, Purple Palace cultivators were soldiers, and there may have been over ten thousand true gods participating.</p><p>All these true gods perished in the Great Flood War, unknown to others.</p><p>Foster father is an ancient heroic spirit who has seen many true gods.</p><p>If foster father recovers his past memories and describes the true gods from his memories, forming them into God Observation Methods to bestow upon his people,</p><p>Those people can then cultivate based on the God Observation Methods.</p><p>The stronger the god they observe, the faster their cultivation will grow, and the higher their upper limit will be."</p><p></p><p>So the higher an ancient god's cultivation was before death, the more true gods they would have encountered, and thus the more God Observation Methods they could form for observation.</p><p>While some heroic spirits with lower cultivation may have seen too few, so they could form fewer God Observation Methods.</p><p>The strength increase of their people would also be less.</p><p></p><p>"In the current Mortal Heart Realm, most cultivators observe the Lord of the Great Flood and his twelve Heavenly Generals.</p><p>Their strength is indeed powerful, but too many people are observing them, and the descriptions are unclear, so the enhancement for cultivators is actually not very great.</p><p>If foster father has ten true gods in his memory, and a few of them haven't been observed by other cultivators, then... the cultivation of Qingshui Village's people would increase very quickly." Qi Qi continued to explain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered and asked: "If they're not gods from the Mortal Heart Realm, can they be used for observation?"</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Yin Gods from the Canglan Realm.</p><p>Those Yin Gods should be true gods.</p><p>Qi Yuan had seen quite a few of them. If he described them for the people of Qingshui Village to observe, wouldn't that be useful?</p><p></p><p>"Have those gods received incense offerings?" Qi Qi asked.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"If they have never received incense offerings, never been the faith of the masses, it probably won't work," Qi Qi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The true gods of the Mortal Heart Realm had all received offerings from at least one city in the past.</p><p>Only such true gods could be formed into God Observation Methods.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately felt his previous idea wouldn't work.</p><p>Could he go back to the Canglan Realm, call those Yin Gods over, have them build temples, and receive the faith of tens of thousands? Thinking about it, this definitely wouldn't work.</p><p>Moreover, he hadn't encountered many Yin Gods in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Foster father doesn't need to worry, once your memories awaken, you'll be able to form God Observation Methods," Qi Qi consoled from the side.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to say, I have no memories to awaken.</p><p>He hadn't participated in the Great Flood War, hadn't seen true gods, and certainly couldn't form God Observation Methods.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had a thought: "These new gods also receive offerings from the masses. If I form them into God Observation Methods, would that work?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi felt foster father was really thinking outside the box, but considering foster father had just been born and his memories hadn't fully awakened, she understood.</p><p></p><p>"Observing these new gods would lead to terrifying consequences.</p><p>The people might even be assimilated by them, becoming divine abominations," Qi Qi explained.</p><p></p><p>This immediately dispelled Qi Yuan's idea.</p><p></p><p>"Foster father doesn't need to think too much about this now. Focus on slaying more evil gods and accumulating evil god spirit power.</p><p>To form God Observation Methods, you need to consume your own divine spirit power, but evil god spirit power can be used as a substitute."</p><p></p><p>"I have a tiny bit of evil god spirit power," Qi Yuan had indeed obtained some evil god spirit power after slaying two evil gods.</p><p>But he didn't know how to use it.</p><p>Now hearing Qi Qi say this, he finally found a use for the evil god spirit power.</p><p></p><p>"If I fabricate some true gods, can they be used to create God Observation Methods?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>He really hadn't seen any true gods from the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi smiled gently: "If foster father knows those gods well enough, you might actually be able to create them.</p><p>This records how to form God Observation Methods. Father will probably know these things once your memories recover in the future.</p><p>Daughter will show father the method for forming God Observation Methods now, so father can try it out."</p><p></p><p>Failing to try wouldn't consume evil god spirit power, it would just waste some time.</p><p>So Qi Qi felt at ease giving the God Observation Method to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Qi spoke for a while, she left the temple.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat alone in the temple, frowning: "Does this mean I'm only suited for fighting alone?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't know any true gods who received incense offerings, so he really couldn't form God Observation Methods.</p><p></p><p>"Would fabricated ones work?" Suddenly, Qi Yuan had a thought.</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, weren't there many gods? The Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, the Five Directions and Five Elders, the Six Departments and Seven Primordials.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Didn't these great beings receive incense offerings and the faith of the masses? It's just that... they seemed to be fictional.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then quickly opened the method for forming God Observation Methods that Qi Qi had given him.</p><p></p><p>It was a black cloth with white text written on it, recording the formation method.</p><p></p><p>"Before observing gods, one can enter a divine world to discuss God Observation Methods with other gods?" Seeing this, Qi Yuan was stunned, feeling somewhat expectant. "Could this be another chat group?"</p><p></p><p>He took the black cloth and began to circulate his divinity according to the method described.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared on the black cloth.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's consciousness entered it.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed a curious expression: "As expected, the cultivation world also has technology, just in a different form from the Blue Star."</p><p></p><p>Different paths lead to the same destination.</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm, Ning Tao wore black stockings. In the Mortal Heart Realm, the appearance of things like chat groups was also normal.</p><p></p><p>In</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>What appeared before Qi Yuan was something like a chat group.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the chat group-like interface, and a message immediately caught his eye:</p><p></p><p>"Is there a newcomer? Have you observed gods before? What level of true god did you observe?"</p><p></p><p>Three questions in one go.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the speaker, named Dong Jianghe, who appeared to be the group owner and seemed very enthusiastic and excited.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is my first time observing gods," Qi Yuan answered seriously. </p><p></p><p>These were all ancient god seniors in the group, so he had to be humble.</p><p></p><p>"A newcomer!" Dong Jianghe seemed even more excited. "I remember back in my day, the first time I observed gods, I observed a deity of the second step of heaven-treading. The gods here called me the Young Heavenly Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was filled with respect: "Impressive, boss!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want me to pass on some experience in god observation to you? It will definitely help you observe powerful deities!" Dong Jianghe said enthusiastically in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Young Heavenly Emperor? Just a fallen genius. </p><p>You failed in the last two god observations.</p><p>Hmph, I, Divine Cat Venerable, observed a Great Venerable!" Divine Cat Venerable mocked the group owner in the chat.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the two had some conflict before.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Venerable you observed has been observed by many others, it's nothing special!" Dong Jianghe said dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"It's still a Great Venerable, more than enough to suppress a fallen genius like you!" Divine Cat Venerable said arrogantly. </p><p></p><p>Immediately, many lurkers in the group emerged.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Heavenly Emperor will fall, Divine Cat Venerable shall rise!"</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Heavenly Emperor, who told you to criticize Divine Cat Venerable when he was about to observe, saying his observation wouldn't work?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe ignored these comments and asked Qi Yuan: "Newcomer, what are you planning to observe? Tell me and I'll give you some advice. </p><p>I rarely give advice to newcomers.</p><p>My advice can increase your success rate by at least 10%."</p><p></p><p>"I want to... observe a divine dog," Qi Yuan replied after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"A divine dog?" Dong Jianghe became anxious. "Newcomer, in the Mortal Heart Realm, there are almost no true god divine dogs, let alone ones receiving worship and offerings.</p><p>The more worship and offerings a true god receives, the higher the probability of successfully observing them.</p><p>This Heavenly Emperor advises you to choose another true god to observe, otherwise you'll just be wasting divine power in vain."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw Divine Cat Venerable say in the group: "Newcomer, you're set.</p><p>Last time when Dong Jianghe said here that my observation wouldn't work, I immediately observed a Great Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"Newcomer you're set, everything the Eastern Heavenly Emperor approves of ends up failing or with poor results.</p><p>Everything he disapproves of takes off immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Before each observation, we all come to the group to get the Eastern Heavenly Emperor's comments. If it's positive, we don't observe at all. If it's negative, we observe immediately."</p><p></p><p>People in the group chattered away.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also gradually understood some details about god observation.</p><p></p><p>The value of the observed god methods varied.</p><p></p><p>There were two criteria for judgment.</p><p></p><p>One was strength, taking a coefficient, say from 1 to 7, representing the first to seventh step of heaven-treading.</p><p></p><p>The second was the degree of observation, that is, whether anyone had observed it before, how many followers practiced this god method, also taking a coefficient. </p><p></p><p>The two coefficients multiplied together, the higher the product, the higher the value of this god method.</p><p></p><p>The values were divided into seven levels: Common, Elite, Rare, Legendary, Epic, Mythic, Divine.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit like game monster classifications, and each level was further divided into one to three stars.</p><p></p><p>Once, Dong Jianghe had observed a three-star Rare god method and was quite proud in the group.</p><p></p><p>While Divine Cat Venerable, whom he had criticized once, observed a one-star Legendary method.</p><p></p><p>A one-star Legendary god method, if not casually given to all followers to practice, was enough to create a true god, provided there were artifacts for ascending to true godhood.</p><p></p><p>So Divine Cat Venerable had the confidence to settle scores with Dong Jianghe.</p><p></p><p>"Newcomer, don't listen to their malicious slander against me. Trust me and choose another true god to observe.</p><p>With this one, you have a high probability of failure. Even if you barely succeed, it will only be a one-star Common method," Dong Jianghe said earnestly in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Actually I don't have high hopes for observing a divine dog either, but since the Eastern Heavenly Emperor is against it, I think you'll definitely succeed, newcomer. Be bold and observe, we're rooting for you," someone said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you all for your kindness, I'm going to observe now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left this mental space and came to the place of observation.</p><p></p><p>The place of observation was a mountain, a mountain in the mental world.</p><p></p><p>The observer needed to imagine the god they were observing and ultimately engrave it on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Then, a god observation method would appear.</p><p></p><p>For his first god observation attempt, Qi Yuan didn't choose one that was too powerful. Firstly, he was afraid of great karmic consequences, and secondly, he wanted to experiment first to see if he could actually practice it.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the mountain.</p><p></p><p>All the memories from Blue Star flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>With the innate divine ability of the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, he could completely recall and remember every glance from his past.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan was sick and living alone, he had flipped through many miscellaneous books out of boredom.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't remembered them at the time, but now he could recall everything.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's mind, a majestic divine dog appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Shaped like a white elephant with the might of a dragon, golden wings fluttering brilliantly in the sky.</p><p>One bark shakes the heavens and shatters divine courage, three howls cut through water and connect with ghost souls!"</p><p></p><p>Wearing a three-mountain hat, solemn in a red robe, with a sword inserted sideways at the waist - a terrifying three-eyed celestial god, riding clouds and summoning rain, with a terrifying divine dog by his side, emanating a horrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's mind, the image of a terrifying divine dog was condensing and appearing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a heavy voice sounded in Qi Yuan's heart from the mountain of observation.</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen this god!"</p><p></p><p>"Does this god truly exist!"</p><p></p><p>These two voices were majestic and terrifying. Upon hearing them, Qi Yuan instinctively wanted to answer truthfully, unable to lie.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked up at his golden core.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra took effect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze became determined.</p><p></p><p>"This god exists!"</p><p></p><p>"I once saw two celestial gods battling, fighting from the ninth heaven down to the eighteenth layer of hell.</p><p>This divine dog stood to the side, taking the opportunity to ambush!"</p><p></p><p>The mountain of observation fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's answer had already fallen into it.</p><p></p><p>About one breath of time passed, and the mountain of observation spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Without worship and offerings, this god observation method may fail. Do you still wish to condense it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Qi Yuan looked at the mountain of observation with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>He was also a bit nervous inside.</p><p></p><p>If the condensation succeeded... it was simply unimaginable!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 418</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To establish a foothold in the Sixth Heaven and create a holy land, you must have a powerhouse at the Great Ultimate Realm!" Red Jade continued explaining to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Fifth Heaven and below, as long as you had a Yang Spirit, you could create a holy land. </p><p></p><p>The Sixth Heaven was different - you had to have a powerhouse at the Great Ultimate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the number of holy land forces in the Sixth Heaven was actually the least among all the major heavens.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yang Spirits could not stay in the Sixth Heaven for long periods, unless they joined a holy land force that had a Yang Spirit at the Great Ultimate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Why do the Yang Spirits in the Sixth Heaven seem somewhat selfish? Why don't they let other Yang Spirits go up?" Qi Yuan asked in confusion. </p><p></p><p>It was like the first to get rich blocking the path for others.</p><p></p><p>"This junior doesn't know clearly, I've only heard... the Sixth Heaven doesn't actually exist, but was created by powerhouses at the Great Ultimate Realm, and cannot support too many Yang Spirits cultivating," Red Jade explained.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Spirits seem to lack prestige, they're like vagrants who get kicked out if they stay in the Sixth Heaven too long," Qi Yuan couldn't help commenting.</p><p></p><p>"So, to settle in the Sixth Heaven, you must join one of those holy lands. </p><p></p><p>But those holy lands with Great Ultimate Realm powerhouses don't accept just any Yang Spirit!</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Abyss only accepts Yang Spirits with their bloodline!</p><p></p><p>And the bloodline of the Black Demon Abyss actually comes from their miraculous treasure!</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Abyss beings are not native to the immortal realm, but emerged from a miraculous treasure!" Red Jade's expression turned solemn as she mentioned this.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Luo clan too?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Red Jade nodded, "The Demon Luo clan doesn't have anyone at the Great Ultimate Realm, but they also emerged from a miraculous treasure, so they barely count as part of the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But one day, the Demon Luo Well swallowed part of the Black Demon Ancestor Blood of the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Great Ultimate Realm Yang Spirits of the Black Demon Abyss were furious and almost overturned the Demon Luo Well! Unfortunately, they still couldn't get the Black Demon Ancestor Blood back, which led to... the Demon Luo clan being driven to the Fifth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Black Demon Abyss, the Demon Luo clan could no longer produce powerhouses at the Great Ultimate Realm, and even Ultimate Realm powerhouses were rare, so they were desperate to return to the Black Demon Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>Red Jade explained a lot.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Ancestor Blood was the common ancestral blood of all cultivators in the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that all living beings were born from the Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Ancestor Blood was also what the Black Demon Abyss relied on to produce Great Ultimate Realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>However, part of the Black Demon Ancestor Blood was swallowed, which meant the Black Demon Abyss had fewer slots for producing Great Ultimate Realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>How could the Great Ultimate Realm powerhouses of the Black Demon Abyss not be angry? The Demon Luo clan was driven to the Fifth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"This Demon Luo Well sounds a bit like the well at my home, they both like to steal food. Could it really be from my family?" Qi Yuan said, almost starting to believe it himself.</p><p></p><p>Red Jade was speechless and didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>"According to what you're saying, doesn't the Black Demon Abyss have many Great Ultimate Realm powerhouses? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Black Demon Abyss is the number one power in the Sixth Heaven?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Red Jade smiled, a proud look appearing on her face: "At the Great Ultimate Realm, numbers are no longer meaningful.</p><p></p><p>My Moon God Palace has only two Great Ultimate Realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>But the Moon God Sovereign alone can handle four, or even five Great Ultimate Realm powerhouses from the Black Demon Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What about Ji Buping?" The ugly old woman suddenly thought of something, her expression turning cold.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly remembered that a few days ago when she went to ask that Blood Robe fellow about Ji Buping, she was driven away by that purple-robed female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, those core members are too overbearing!"</p><p></p><p>She was a Mythical powerhouse after all, about to gather enough merits to qualify for Reflecting All Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Yet she was bullied by a core member.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but she was also constrained and couldn't do anything even to Blood Robe, an ordinary great venerable.</p><p></p><p>She was furious.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she calmed down, a profound look flashing in her eyes: "After the Flame Mountain erupted, I seemed to smell an aura going towards his location."</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman was a Mythical powerhouse after all. At that time, even though Red Jade had concealed her aura as she went towards Qi Yuan, she still sensed something.</p><p></p><p>"He directly drove away the Demon Luo clan's search party, it seems..." A murderous intent flashed in the ugly old woman's eyes, "You dare to collude with the Moon God Palace and harbor their criminals. Even if you're a guest elder of the Black Demon Abyss, you won't escape death!"</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman had a crazy idea.</p><p></p><p>Since she couldn't deal with Blood Robe herself, she would report him!</p><p></p><p>As long as the report was successful, the Demon Luo clan would definitely not spare Blood Robe! Blood Robe and that Moon God Palace cultivator would surely die.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, she felt everything was clear.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, she secretly glanced at Qi Yuan's tent, then her form turned into a stream of light and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>When she reappeared, she had arrived at the core area of the Demon Luo Sacred Tower.</p><p></p><p>She had already sent the report, and now she waited outside for someone to receive her.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, since she was from the Black Demon Abyss, she didn't even have to wait half an hour before someone came to lead her in.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, a thin old man in a gray robe looked quite amiable.</p><p></p><p>Since the Demon Luo clan aspired to the Black Demon Abyss, they mostly wore gray robes.</p><p></p><p>They didn't wear black, afraid of clashing.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Dream, it's been a long time, you look as radiant as ever!" The thin old man was a Mythical powerhouse who had Reflected All Heavens, definitely a high-level figure in this Demon Luo Sacred Tower.</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman was not good at socializing, so she said directly: "I've come this time because I discovered someone privately harboring a criminal from the Moon God Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The thin old man was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The matter of Red Jade's escape was under his responsibility.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a guest elder of the Black Demon Abyss?" the thin old man asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, a new guest elder named Blood Robe!" said the ugly old woman, "I saw with my own eyes that criminal from the Moon God Palace escape into his cave dwelling, and when Demon Luo clan cultivators came to search for the fugitive, he drove them away!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare he harbor a criminal, he deserves death!" The thin old man was angry, then he asked, "I've never heard of this Blood Robe, could he be a newly arrived guest elder?"</p><p></p><p>It was better to ask clearly about matters related to the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he... actually doesn't have the Black Demon Abyss bloodline, but was barely made a guest elder on the recommendation of a core member of the Black Demon Abyss!" the ugly old woman said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The thin old man's expression changed slightly: "Since it involves a core member of the Black Demon Abyss, I can't make the decision on this matter, I must report it to the Heavenly Venerable! Don't worry, Dream, even if he's a core member of the Black Demon Abyss, he will surely die for daring to hide a great enemy of the Demon Luo clan!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ugly old woman felt much better.</p><p></p><p>That disgusting Blood Robe would surely die this time.</p><p></p><p>"Dream, the Demon Luo Sacred Tower will hold the Thought Water Meeting in three years, don't forget to attend!" At this point, the thin old man also extended an invitation, maintaining good relations with Dream.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Dream was about to become a core member of the Black Demon Abyss, worth cultivating a relationship with.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The ugly old woman nodded, in a good mood. "Don't let slip that I came to see you today!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, the ugly old woman added one more sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this matter is known only to heaven and earth, you and me, and... that one!"</p><p></p><p>That one, of course, referred to the Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable presiding over the Demon Luo Sacred Tower.</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, she nodded and said, "Farewell."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the core area of the Demon Saint Tower, the ugly old woman headed to the Black Magic Abyss base. </p><p></p><p>She recalled the message from her friend - that purple-robed female cultivator had left quite a few good things for Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>Now that Blood Robe was about to be captured and executed, wouldn't it be a waste if she didn't go claim those good things?</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, the ugly old woman came out of the Black Magic Abyss base, her eyes filled with killing intent. "Hmph, these managers have no discernment, they actually didn't want to give them to me!"</p><p></p><p>However, she still managed to snatch the good things left by the purple-robed woman.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she opened her storage bag and her eyes revealed an envious look: "It's actually Sky-reaching Jade, what a treasure, it can save me 10,000 years!"</p><p></p><p>As for the purple-robed woman, she was only somewhat wary of her.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, she wouldn't bother a "core figure" like herself over a dead person.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Blood Robe was about to die, so that core figure probably wouldn't bother to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, no one knew it was her who leaked the secret.</p><p></p><p>"According to the timing, this matter should have already received the order from that Yang Spirit Venerable. I estimate it won't be long before the Demon clan people go to encircle and kill him. I should go watch the show."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the culprit always likes to return to the crime scene to admire their handiwork. This law holds true even in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman's figure disappeared at this moment, preparing to return to the Miluo Realm to watch the fun.</p><p></p><p>When she entered the Miluo Realm again, she saw that lazy reclining figure from afar.</p><p></p><p>A cruel smile appeared in the ugly old woman's eyes: "Enjoy your comfort for a while longer, you won't be able to smile soon!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan, who was lying down, seemed to sense something. He suddenly sat up: "Oh, you just went back to the Demon Saint Tower?"</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman nodded, her voice hoarse: "Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, if I had known you were going back to the base, I should have asked you to bring back the treasures Sister Ox Horn left for me. I'm quite lazy and homebody-ish, I rarely go out except to fish." Qi Yuan said, somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman narrowed her eyes without speaking and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>She was suppressing excitement and joy in her heart, just waiting for Blood Robe to be killed!</p><p></p><p>She came back early for one more reason - to prevent Blood Robe from running away.</p><p></p><p>It's better to watch in person.</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute. The ugly old woman stayed in her temporary cave dwelling, occasionally glancing towards Qi Yuan's location, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had extended the Golden Core chapter of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" a bit further.</p><p></p><p>He stretched lazily: "Sigh, sometimes being handsome is not good. That old lady keeps staring at me, making me feel embarrassed. I never thought I'd have the charm of that talented scholar who was sealed away one day, being liked by old ladies."</p><p></p><p>"That's because she hasn't heard you speak!" Jiang Lingsu covered her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Big Senior Brother is better off not talking.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with my voice? I actually feel my voice could be an ASMR broadcaster." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he have made little Ning Tao fall for him just by saying a few words through the game jade slip? So his voice must be very pleasant too.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan opened the game jade slip: "I should check if the new game has loaded."</p><p></p><p>He hadn't played games for a while and felt quite nostalgic.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he sent his consciousness into the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Inside the jade slip, the game icon was still loading.</p><p></p><p>It had loaded less than a third.</p><p></p><p>"Should I secretly listen to the game settings?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, closing his eyes and listening carefully to the game icon.</p><p></p><p>Before, he could hear Ning Tao's voice, so this time he might be able to hear some other sounds.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, the world silent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan was stunned: "Junior Sister, have you ever heard of soundless sound?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Lingsu was confused.</p><p></p><p>How can it be called sound if there's no sound?</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I heard a soundless sound." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, listening intently.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't hear any sound in the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>But he sensed a hint of deathly stillness mixed in this soundless sound.</p><p></p><p>"Can you speak?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan couldn't help using his new ability.</p><p></p><p>That is, he could converse with the sounds he heard.</p><p></p><p>Again, silence.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's eyes lit up as he sensed a bit of joy.</p><p></p><p>That kind of joy seemed natural and innocent.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, probably can't speak, can't even say 'ya ya ya'. I understand, you don't have a mouth, you must be a stone."</p><p></p><p>On the other end, there was soundless sound again, but Qi Yuan sensed a questioning emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I don't like talking to stones. What if a monkey jumps out?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan prepared to cut off the connection.</p><p></p><p>The soundless sound came again, with a hint of sadness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was about to say something when suddenly his expression changed: "Reporting dog?"</p><p></p><p>The inflatable doll told him someone had reported him! His face changed drastically. Without any hesitation, he put away the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the old lady in the distance, his eyes filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Love turns to hate, unable to have me, so you want to destroy me. How can the human heart be so treacherous!"</p><p></p><p>"To have such an admirer, I am ashamed!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan angrily headed towards the ugly old woman's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the ugly old woman was resting with her eyes closed when suddenly she sensed an unusual aura. Her mind suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>She was suddenly horrified to discover that a figure had appeared in her cave dwelling, which was protected by ten layers of formations.</p><p></p><p>This figure was actually Qi Yuan! The ugly old woman was a bit dazed and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Fel...fellow Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>"I hate reporting dogs the most in my life, yet you dare to report me!" Qi Yuan was very angry, the consequences would be severe.</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman's pupils dilated, her heart incredibly shocked.</p><p></p><p>How did he know?</p><p></p><p>She had just reported him, how did this person find the reporter? Does the reporter have no privacy? If it's like this, who would dare to report in the future?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you admire me, you look up to me, that's your business, I can't ask anything of you! But you've gone too far. Unable to obtain love, you became angry in your heart and actually went to report me, to ruin me!</p><p></p><p>If everyone was like you, destroying what they can't have, how would this immortal realm keep turning?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he was too angry, too pained and indignant, Qi Yuan even said the immortal realm was turning!</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman was shocked in her heart, along with inexplicable fear.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't understand or comprehend why reporting Blood Robe would be known by Blood Robe!</p><p></p><p>"Reporting dog, go to the underworld!"</p><p></p><p>"I won't be lenient with you just because you admire me!"</p><p></p><p>"I even killed my first love, what are you as my admirer!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't give the ugly old woman any chance to speak or resist. A powerful strike fell.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

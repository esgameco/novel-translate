        <h1>Chapter 185</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the wide streets of Feihang City.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi, wearing a straw raincoat, limped into a small alley. </p><p></p><p>Her speed suddenly increased, splashing water on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Behind her, a man in a black robe appeared, with a mocking smile in his eyes: "Remnant of the Jiang Kingdom, where are you running?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man struck out fiercely, wanting to capture Wang Wenqi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elderly man in Confucian robes intervened.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a bright light flashed in the alley, blocking the black-robed man's attack.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man stopped, with a look of surprise in his eyes: "Someone from the No Food Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly Confucian looked at the black-robed man, with a wistful expression: "You are from the royal family of Lin Kingdom, why are you working for the evil god?"</p><p></p><p>"A good bird chooses a tree to perch on. I simply made a better choice," the black-robed man said in a deep voice, no longer attacking.</p><p></p><p>"Cooperating with an evil god is no different from conspiring with a tiger for its skin. The evil god will gradually synchronize with you all, and you will merely become its true puppets!" the elderly Confucian said sternly.</p><p></p><p>In the northern lands today, many countries have long histories of being occupied by evil gods.</p><p></p><p>In such countries, most of the people are not truly citizens, but have become real puppets of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Followers of the No Food Sect have entered such cities and witnessed horrifying scenes.</p><p></p><p>Those people look no different from normal people, working during the day and resting at night.</p><p></p><p>But every person has the same expression, the same routine, and never speaks on their own initiative.</p><p></p><p>Children don't cry, dogs don't bark - it's extremely eerie.</p><p></p><p>Why do the elderly Confucian and other people resist the new gods so strongly?</p><p></p><p>A large part is because of this.</p><p></p><p>As for sacrificing children every month, for some powerful figures... it's not even an issue.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the black-robed man showed no joy or sorrow: "The divine lord has already promised that those of us who pledged allegiance to him first can maintain control of our own consciousness. Your strength is sufficient... why don't you come join us? The divine lord will accept you."</p><p></p><p>"You..." the elderly Confucian was furious, "Just because you can control your own consciousness, you don't care about others?"</p><p></p><p>"The others are not strong enough, they don't even qualify to serve the divine lord. They cannot control themselves simply because they are too weak." A smile squeezed onto the expressionless face of the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>"That's still no reason for you to aid evil!" The elderly Confucian attacked frantically.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man sensed something and his eyes narrowed: "Reinforcements are coming? I'll spare your lives for now."</p><p></p><p>With that, the black-robed man's form dissipated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>A few moments later, six or seven people arrived in this area.</p><p></p><p>Leading them were none other than Huang Mengying and Nangong Wuji.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi, who had been wearing the straw raincoat earlier, looked at Huang Mengying and the others with gratitude in her eyes: "Thank you for saving me, Sister Mengying."</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying looked at Wang Wenqi with a complex expression: "Don't go out for a while."</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi lowered her head and said through gritted teeth: "I never imagined the evil god's minions would find me here!"</p><p></p><p>At this, everyone present felt their hearts tighten.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the elderly Confucian had already sent a message that the one trying to kill Wang Wenqi was from the Lin Kingdom royal family.</p><p></p><p>"The defeat of the Jiang Kingdom and its capital being reduced to ruins... scared quite a few people," Huang Mengying said, her voice filled with deep helplessness.</p><p></p><p>An evil god at the peak of Three Steps to Heaven Realm descended upon the Jiang Kingdom capital.</p><p></p><p>The ancient god guarding Jiang Kingdom resisted that evil god to the death.</p><p></p><p>It's said this also angered that evil god.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the ancient god of Jiang Kingdom, that evil god wiped the Jiang Kingdom capital off the map.</p><p></p><p>All six million people in the Jiang Kingdom capital perished.</p><p></p><p>This terrified many people.</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons of Lin Kingdom were trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, tears welled up in Wang Wenqi's eyes, seemingly about to fall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huang Mengying quickly said: "I'm sorry, Sister Wenqi, I brought up painful memories."</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi was from Jiang Kingdom. Huang Mengying knew her parents and clan members all lived in the Jiang Kingdom capital and died at the hands of that evil god.</p><p></p><p>She only survived because she happened to be in Feihang City.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi covered her face with her sleeve, then asked in a resentful voice: "Did Origin Venerable really submit to the new god?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huang Mengying couldn't help but recall the young man she saw at the banquet that day.</p><p></p><p>That ancient god had a handsome face, unrestrained demeanor, and viewed evil gods as nothing.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he suddenly struck out and slew the gods of Gufeng Town, which truly shocked them.</p><p></p><p>After all, even Nangong Wuji couldn't do anything about the evil gods of the six towns.</p><p></p><p>And when Nangong Wuji took action, they learned the strength of the Jackal Demigod.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was still killed by Origin Venerable - how could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>But what happened afterwards was even more mind-blowing.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable actually wanted to cooperate with the new god and summon a true god.</p><p></p><p>They understood even less.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not very clear on this matter," Huang Mengying said. "Yesterday, the people we sent to Qingshui Village returned. Origin Venerable said... he is indeed cooperating with the new god. He wants to summon a true god to Qingshui Village."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Wenqi's eyes turned red: "To think my great-grandfather trusted him so much!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, Wang Wenqi was a descendant of Treasure Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Over ten days ago, she was entrusted by her great-grandfather to come to Feihang City in Lin Kingdom to find someone called Origin Venerable and give him some items.</p><p></p><p>Those items were all treasures that could help divine beings at the peak of Purple Palace Realm break through to the True God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Her great-grandfather valued that Origin Venerable so highly that he sent her on a thousand-mile journey to deliver the treasures.</p><p></p><p>But her great-grandfather died at the hands of the evil god, while that man... had submitted to the evil god! How could Wang Wenqi not be furious?</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wuji merely sighed: "You can know someone's face but not their heart. We don't know what he truly intends to do. But his desire to summon a true god must be real. We need to quickly awaken the Ancient God Circle, otherwise... when the true god descends, we won't have even a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the black-robed man who had been chasing Wang Wenqi entered a dilapidated courtyard. His entire body was shrouded in black robes, making it impossible to see his face.</p><p></p><p>Before him was an ugly-faced man.</p><p></p><p>"My lord." The ugly man was like a sewer rat who had just returned from a brothel, his body still carrying the scent of cheap rouge and powder.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man frowned: "How are the new god's forces in Feihang City now?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man had been ordered to capture Wang Wenqi but encountered people from the No Food Sect in Feihang City.</p><p></p><p>He was no match for them, so he came seeking help.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the question, the ugly man's expression became complicated: "I heard that the nearby new gods have all been killed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Who killed them?" The black-robed man's heart tightened. Could it have been people from the No Food Sect?</p><p></p><p>"There are many rumors outside. Some say it was the Five Great Families, some say the Ancient God Circle took action, some say it was Origin Venerable." The ugly man relayed the information he had heard in the brothel.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man raised an eyebrow, displeased: "Who is Origin Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard he's an ancient god, no, that's not right..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He's a new god," said the ugly man.</p><p></p><p>"Explain clearly," the man in black robes suppressed his anger.</p><p></p><p>"I remember now, he's an ancient god, but he defected to the new gods. I think he's responsible for bringing in the Plague Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure?" the man in black robes pressed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm certain!" the ugly man said excitedly, "He definitely defected to the new gods!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The man in black robes let out a cold snort and slammed his large hand down, smashing the ugly man's skull. "Useless trash!"</p><p></p><p>After killing the ugly man, the black-robed man's expression turned thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"So this Origin Lord is one of us."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man had also defected to the new gods, so he understood the psychology of ancient gods who defected better than anyone.</p><p></p><p>Such people had no bottom line and would stop at nothing to climb higher.</p><p></p><p>The one he had defected to was a new god who had reached the pinnacle of the Heaven-Treading realm.</p><p></p><p>Much more powerful than the Plague Lord.</p><p></p><p>He could use this point to his advantage, mobilizing the Origin Lord to help him capture Wang Wenqi in Flying Desolation City.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to capture Wang Wenqi and she was caught by others who came later, he would lose face.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't be able to hold his head up in front of the true gods, and would be looked down upon by others.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fierce Wind Town.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was enjoying his meal contentedly.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather... do you have any questions about that Plague Lord?" Qi Qi asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>She was extremely worried about the Plague Lord.</p><p></p><p>That was a true god after all.</p><p></p><p>"How's the Yin Birth Stone coming along?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi smiled radiantly, extending a pale white stone from her delicate white palm: "Daughter just finished preparing it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the Yin Birth Stone and examined it.</p><p></p><p>[Yin Birth Stone, of somewhat mysterious origin, can help living beings ascend to the realm of true gods.]</p><p></p><p>"Such a precious treasure, you're willing to give it to me?" Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>"As long as Godfather can ascend to the realm of true gods, why wouldn't I give it to you?" Qi Qi didn't mind at all.</p><p></p><p>The satisfaction of nurturing her godfather to success was incomparable to anything else.</p><p></p><p>"By the way Godfather, are you planning to use the Yin Birth Stone to ascend to the realm of true gods, and then confront the Plague Lord?</p><p></p><p>I heard the Plague Lord has three divine apertures, Godfather must be careful." Qi Qi said from the side.</p><p></p><p>In her view, her godfather bringing down the true god Plague Lord meant he had thoughts of slaying a god.</p><p></p><p>Her godfather was planning to use the Yin Birth Stone to break through to the realm of true gods.</p><p></p><p>Then, battle the Plague Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although her godfather had just broken through to the realm of true gods, with only one divine aperture.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, her godfather must have been extremely powerful in his past life, at least a Heaven-Treading Third Step being.</p><p></p><p>For such a being, once entering the realm of true gods, being able to fight across one or two divine apertures was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan shook his head: "I'm only at mid Purple Palace realm, not even at the peak. Even with the Yin Birth Stone, I can't break through to the realm of true gods."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Birth Stone was indeed a supreme treasure, but it still had to follow basic laws.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Hearing this, Qi Qi immediately became anxious, "Godfather, you're not at peak Purple Palace realm?"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't understand. How did her father kill the Serval Wolf then? Not being at peak Purple Palace realm also meant that even with the Yin Birth Stone, her godfather couldn't break through to true god realm.</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting was strong, at late Purple Palace realm, but to reach peak Purple Palace realm would still require half a month of consolidation.</p><p></p><p>What was her godfather thinking?</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm not, still far from it. But if I kill a lord-level god, I should reach peak Purple Palace realm," Qi Yuan said casually while eating pork head meat.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would he choose to cooperate with the new gods and summon the Plague Lord?</p><p></p><p>It was entirely because this Plague Lord perfectly matched his fantasy of a white moonlight in every aspect.</p><p></p><p>First condition, old age, definitely an old man.</p><p></p><p>Second condition, treasures all over the body. Killing him would not only yield massive experience, but also demonic god power.</p><p></p><p>The demonic god power of a true god was far more enticing than the Purple Palace demonic god power of those rotten fish and shrimp he currently had.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could also envision other stronger deities.</p><p></p><p>If it was something like the Three Pure Ones, Qi Yuan would directly want to lie flat.</p><p></p><p>Of course, just thinking about the Plague Lord as a white moonlight was still not enough, definitely unable to envision the Three Pure Ones.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel that this Plague Lord was really useless.</p><p></p><p>"After finishing the meal, I need to go back," Qi Yuan decided to return to Qingshui Village and go to Envisioning Mountain after the meal.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came: "Divine Lord, there's a guest here to see you."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What guest?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He looked over and saw a man in black robes walking over under Wei Ting's lead.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man glanced at Qi Yuan, his expression arrogant: "You're the god of Flying Desolation City?"</p><p></p><p>When dealing with those who defected to the new gods, the attitude must be arrogant and overbearing.</p><p></p><p>Because those spineless ones were afraid of his type.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man spoke and sat down unceremoniously in the empty seat next to Qi Yuan, looking very confident.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was stunned: "I don't think I invited you to sit next to me?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man seemed not to have heard Qi Yuan's words, and instead pointed at Qi Qi: "This woman is very beautiful, is she your plaything? Lend her to me to play with."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately became furious. He struck out directly, punching the black-robed man in the stomach: "You don't even have ghost fire, didn't even dye your hair yellow, yet you dare covet my daughter!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's punch was extremely powerful, containing primordial divine abilities, directly knocking down the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>He was very annoyed and angry.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, having a daughter who was too beautiful wasn't always good. Now even a ghost fire guy, no, a black-robed man without even ghost fire, had his eye on his daughter.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was shocked. He didn't expect Qi Yuan to strike out directly.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, weren't these spineless ones who defected to the new gods extremely cautious? How could he attack directly?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Lord, I am from the royal guard of Lin Kingdom, serving the true god Suihan!" The black-robed man felt he needed to bring out his identity now.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan became even more agitated: "Mere royal guard, do you have social insurance and housing fund? Do you have a car and house? Yet you dare covet my daughter?</p><p></p><p>Suihan true god, what's that? Has he retired? How much is his pension?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was dumbfounded. He suddenly felt he came here today somewhat unprepared.</p><p></p><p>This Origin Lord was different from the previous spineless ones. He seemed a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly said: "Misunderstanding, it's all a misunderstanding. I was just joking."</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had been knocked down by Qi Yuan and his whole body was restrained, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>"Shrimp head man making reckless jokes." Qi Yuan looked at the black-robed man and lectured, "Didn't your father tell you that only what others can accept is called a joke?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi beside him was completely bewildered. What just happened was too sudden, she hadn't even reacted yet.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

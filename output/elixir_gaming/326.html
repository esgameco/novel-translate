        <h1>Chapter 326</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the corpses scattered throughout Haishi Village, his eyes showing a pained expression.</p><p></p><p>"So many dead people, what a grand feast this would make. What a pity... we can't eat them!"</p><p></p><p>The notification that the mission was complete had already arrived. They were about to leave the mission world.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Haishi Village, now reduced to ruins, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"If there's a chance to come back in the future, we'll come back to eat."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, An Qiao walked over. She looked at Qi Yuan with a respectful expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, when we get back, I'll give you the captain's belongings."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, after completing their first mission successfully, new recruits would return to the base of the veteran who sent them on the mission.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, what's the place you're going back to called?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's eyes still seemed a bit dazed, but she still answered: "The World of Death Qi, but... we prefer to call it... the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>"In the Underworld, there lives a group of people who are already dead, or perhaps, people who are neither dead nor alive."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then let's call it the Underworld. I love my country and support domestic products," Qi Yuan blurted out.</p><p></p><p>This remark also confused An Qiao and the others.</p><p></p><p>"The mission is complete. We can't stay for more than half an hour. Now, silently think about returning, and we can go back to the base," An Qiao explained to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Xiao Mei in the distance and waved.</p><p></p><p>With her innate easy-to-marry constitution, who knows how many times she might be married the next time they meet.</p><p></p><p>"Return!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan silently recited in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he seemed to sense space and time turning upside down. His ears heard countless wails and murmurs.</p><p></p><p>This situation lasted for less than a breath before completely dissipating.</p><p></p><p>When his vision brightened, he was standing in a small stone room.</p><p></p><p>The room wasn't large, about 30 square meters.</p><p></p><p>In the southern part of the room, there was a stone table with a stone lamp on it. Inside the lampshade was a candle emitting a dim yellow light.</p><p></p><p>This was the only light source in the stone room.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... a free house?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned his surroundings, quite interested in everything before him.</p><p></p><p>This house seemed to be built from a single giant rock, with the stone table connected to the floor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pushed open the stone door and suddenly realized he was standing on a cliff face.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the entire stone room had been hollowed out and dug from the cliff face.</p><p></p><p>"If the apocalypse comes and zombies run rampant, I could stockpile some supplies and hide here. The zombies definitely wouldn't be able to find their way in."</p><p></p><p>When he was younger, Qi Yuan would have definitely loved this stone room and treated it as a secret base.</p><p></p><p>But now, as an adult, he was just slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>He scanned his surroundings and suddenly noticed many similar stone rooms on the cliff face.</p><p></p><p>Below the cliff was a valley filled with the fragrance of flowers. Taking a deep breath would make one feel a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan descended the cliff via a staircase.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, over here!" An Qiao waved to Qi Yuan from not far away.</p><p></p><p>The current An Qiao looked exactly the same as she did in the mission world, still wearing the black fitted uniform of the Demon Suppression Department.</p><p></p><p>However, in this base, Qi Yuan also saw quite a few men and women with a more realistic style.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a small old man approached and sniffed at Qi Yuan, his expression somewhat urgent: "New recruit? What's your mission reward? Is it a Blood Refining Pill? If so, do you want to make a deal with this old man?</p><p></p><p>See that bamboo building with the beautiful women and handsome men? If you give me the Blood Refining Pill, you can play with any of those three beauties or handsome guys!</p><p></p><p>Hmph, ordinary people don't even get the chance to play. I've taken a liking to your talent and want to befriend you, that's why I'm saying this."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the bamboo building in the distance, where three men and three women were seated.</p><p></p><p>The men were handsome, the women beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Their clothing styles varied.</p><p></p><p>The women wore ancient Qin dynasty style, modern qipao, and contemporary short skirts with stockings respectively.</p><p></p><p>The men were similar, each representing the style of a different era.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yeshan, stop trying to deceive people. Brother Qi is not the kind of newcomer you think he is!" An Qiao walked over, glaring angrily at Lin Yeshan.</p><p></p><p>"This is Lin Yeshan. He specializes in deceiving newcomers at the base.</p><p></p><p>Blood Refining Pills are very precious. They can significantly increase one's strength, and have almost no side effects.</p><p></p><p>Why would you need to use a Blood Refining Pill to play in the House of Ecstasy?"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao mercilessly exposed Lin Yeshan's scheme.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yeshan smiled awkwardly, his eyes also showing a hint of oddity.</p><p></p><p>This An Qiao was considered a decent martial artist, why was she calling this newcomer "Brother Qi"?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems this newcomer performed well on your mission," seeing he couldn't deceive Qi Yuan, Lin Yeshan said, "I know all the girls in the House of Ecstasy. If you're interested, I can arrange something for you."</p><p></p><p>An Qiao glared at Lin Yeshan again, seemingly displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, come on, I'll take you to the captain," An Qiao led Qi Yuan away.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yeshan was stunned for a moment, then asked, "What about Chen Fan?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yeshan knew Chen Fan was rather solitary and almost never let outsiders into his residence.</p><p></p><p>Why was An Qiao taking Qi Yuan to Chen Fan's place?</p><p></p><p>"The captain... is gone," An Qiao's voice sounded somewhat desolate.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this would be her future fate as well.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yeshan was shocked, then looked at Qi Yuan again with a complex gaze, not saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao led Qi Yuan through the valley towards another cliff face.</p><p></p><p>"Your people here are quite friendly. If I'm not mistaken, that man just now should be at the mid-stage of the Jade Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>You were so fierce with him, yet his temper was so good?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"He is... an old-style martial artist.</p><p></p><p>In the base, he has the strength of the Jade Blood Realm, but in mission worlds, he's only left with mid-stage Blood Qi Realm strength.</p><p></p><p>So..."</p><p></p><p>An Qiao didn't continue the rest of her sentence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>In future missions, they might go on tasks together.</p><p></p><p>In mission worlds, Lin Yeshan's strength would be somewhat weak.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, improving strength in the Jade Blood Realm was much more difficult than in the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, old-style martial artists like Lin Yeshan had a much lower status in the base.</p><p></p><p>After a while, under An Qiao's guidance, Qi Yuan arrived at Chen Fan's stone room.</p><p></p><p>"The safest place in the base is the stone rooms.</p><p></p><p>Without the owner's permission, others cannot enter.</p><p></p><p>Before the captain left, he gave me access rights.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, with the captain's fall, this stone room will become an ownerless room."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, An Qiao's eyes reddened a bit.</p><p></p><p>She entered the stone room, her gaze falling on a stone box.</p><p></p><p>"These are the captain's belongings. He told me to give them to you." An Qiao opened the stone box, which contained a bundle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the bundle without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This was the reward for his mission side quest. It would be a waste not to take it.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Calming Pills?"</p><p></p><p>"Golden Bell Shield?"</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Severing Whirlwind Blade?"</p><p></p><p>In the bundle, Qi Yuan saw several Blood Calming Pills and various martial arts manuals.</p><p></p><p>These manuals were not of a high level.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was quite interested in all of them.</p><p></p><p>These were new-style martial arts that could enhance his combat power.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a stone token caught Qi Yuan's attention.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>The token was engraved with the character for "Heaven".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes could only see the hidden information about the token's material and crafting method.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the entry credential for the Genius Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the Underworld, there are many bases, and naturally many factions.</p><p></p><p>The Genius Alliance is a major faction that specializes in recruiting geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The captain's talent was actually very, very high, otherwise he wouldn't have been noticed by the Genius Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, he always had some mental barriers, so he never went to the Genius Alliance on the East Coast."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, looks pretty good. I'll keep it," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>After taking the belongings, Qi Yuan bid farewell to An Qiao and left Chen Fan's room.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao stayed in Chen Fan's room, seemingly wanting to empty out everything in the room.</p><p></p><p>After all, these were the only things Chen Fan left in this world.</p><p></p><p>Returning to his own stone room, Qi Yuan took out the Blood Refining Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Equivalent to dozens of drops of demon blood... just a mosquito's worth of meat."</p><p></p><p>This reward would be considered quite good for others.</p><p></p><p>After all, they didn't have the Devouring Primal Body and couldn't freely absorb demon blood like Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even for Blood Refining Pills, there were limits to consumption.</p><p></p><p>"A mosquito's worth of meat is still meat. System, add some points for me!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan voiced himself again.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the Sea God, the amount of demon blood in Qi Yuan's body had reached 300 drops again.</p><p></p><p>He planned to use these 300 drops to master the three martial arts techniques he got from Chen Fan.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>You consumed fifty drops of demon blood and began cultivating the Golden Bell Shield.</p><p></p><p>The key to the Golden Bell Shield lies in concentration, hardness, and deflecting force.</p><p></p><p>Consuming some demon blood, you mastered the basics of the Golden Bell Shield.</p><p></p><p>Consuming more demon blood, you reached the second level of the Golden Bell Shield.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Golden Bell Shield was greatly accomplished, but demon blood was depleted and could no longer advance.</p><p></p><p>You had a sudden inspiration to apply celestial cultivation concepts to martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Consuming demon blood... Golden Bell Shield... perfected.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan perfected the Golden Bell Shield martial technique in one go.</p><p></p><p>During the time consuming demon blood, Qi Yuan also gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>All paths lead to the same destination.</p><p></p><p>The martial art Golden Bell Shield was actually similar to defensive celestial techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, this similarity had a big gap. Qi Yuan had a deep understanding of both paths.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan did not lack this understanding at all.</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see hidden information, and he had unique achievements in understanding the celestial way.</p><p></p><p>After perfecting the Golden Bell Shield, Qi Yuan consumed more demon blood and perfected the Thousand Severing Whirlwind Blade in one go.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also briefly practiced storage techniques similar to storage bags, creating a space inside his body to stockpile resources.</p><p></p><p>"This Solar Finger technique is not bad, should I practice it first?"</p><p></p><p>The Solar Finger was a martial technique provided by the Genius Alliance. Anyone who mastered it could directly enter the Genius Alliance with a token.</p><p></p><p>"You consumed one hundred drops of demon blood and began cultivating the Solar Finger.</p><p></p><p>Solar Finger small accomplishment... second level... great accomplishment."</p><p></p><p>"It's not enough?"</p><p></p><p>"You consumed another fifty drops of demon blood, Solar Finger... perfected."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan could easily defeat his former self with just his martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Martial techniques greatly enhanced combat power. Especially after perfecting the Golden Bell Shield, when fighting, the blood qi throughout his body would condense, making his skin as hard as iron.</p><p></p><p>Even if an ordinary demon slashed at Qi Yuan with a blade, he would be unharmed.</p><p></p><p>With this hard body technique, he was most suited for charging into battle.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's time to return to the real world and participate in the martial arts competition."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was different from other residents of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>He did not enter after death.</p><p></p><p>His situation was special.</p><p></p><p>So he was relatively freer and could stay outside anytime when there were no missions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, others were not as fortunate as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For example, Chen Fan had only appeared in the outside world a handful of times in the past few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, five days have passed?</p><p></p><p>It seems the time in the game world is about the same as reality."</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan closed himself off for a breakthrough, he specifically instructed the hotel not to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>So when he returned to reality, the room's layout was still the same as before.</p><p></p><p>Even if some ignorant people wanted to come, they could not damage the room's setup.</p><p></p><p>Before secluding himself, Qi Yuan had already set up an array formation.</p><p></p><p>"This place is still better, my game world self... is too weak."</p><p></p><p>Entering the mission world, his celestial cultivation was suppressed, dropping one realm in level.</p><p></p><p>This also led to him being extremely careful and cautious in the first mission, unable to sleep well at night for fear of encountering terrifying great demons.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan suffered in the game, and so did Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In this vast world, everyone has their own hardships.</p><p></p><p>For example, some people are born without parents and become orphans.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also unfortunate, he had no mother-in-law since childhood.</p><p></p><p>No one to love him, care for him or protect him. His strength dropped a realm, making him anxious in the game, fearing discovery by great demons.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with his caution and steadiness, he still completed the mission perfectly.</p><p></p><p>Back in reality, with Foundation Establishment realm power, he regained his confidence.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I need to form my Core."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the sun in the sky thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Soon, there would be another sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>When he forms his Core, he will slowly draw over the stellar Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>The first one to be drawn over will be the star where Ning Tao is, which is also Qi Yuan's first Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>"Begin... breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At a military camp, thousands of soldiers in uniforms were training, with loud shouts echoing continuously.</p><p></p><p>The sound of engines starting was like thunder.</p><p></p><p>Various artillery fired at will.</p><p></p><p>Inside the steel buildings, however, it was very quiet. The soundproofing was excellent, and no outside noise could penetrate.</p><p></p><p>A pot-bellied man in military uniform raised his teacup, took a small sip, and looked at the man in front of him. He spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Huan, this matter has already caught the attention of the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>His actions, sending a coffin to Duke Blue Sea, put us in a difficult position.</p><p></p><p>Although Duke Blue Sea's actions were somewhat excessive, after all... his starting point was for the country, for Qin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How about this, I'll have Duke Blue Sea personally go apologize to him, and we'll let this matter go?"</p><p></p><p>The uniformed man's words carried a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the destruction of the Guiran Military Camp caused a huge uproar.</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons of Qin Yuan country also turned their attention to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whether out of greed or under orders from certain bigwigs, Duke Blue Sea attempted to secretly infiltrate Qi Yuan's phone and computer to obtain more information.</p><p></p><p>Who knew their little actions would be discovered and intercepted by Zero One.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan arranged for Zero One to send a coffin to Duke Blue Sea.</p><p></p><p>This led to today's scene.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan didn't dare look directly at the uniformed man and lowered his head, saying: "Chief, I'm not qualified to interfere in Mr. Qi's affairs!"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter whether you're qualified or not, you must convey our words to him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he dares to send a coffin to Duke Blue Sea today, won't he dare to kill people from the Seven Martial Star families tomorrow? He may be very strong, but our Qin Yuan country's Sky Eye is not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>Under the Sky Eye, even gods cannot survive! However, we want to talk peace, not start conflicts unnecessarily.</p><p></p><p>As long as he shows goodwill and forgives Duke Blue Sea, everything can continue to be negotiated."</p><p></p><p>The uniformed man's expression carried a threat.</p><p></p><p>For unstable figures like Qi Yuan, there was much debate among those in power.</p><p></p><p>Some wanted to rope him in, others wanted to eliminate him.</p><p></p><p>Currently, those in favor of roping him in had the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>But even if they wanted to rope him in, they had to use the right methods. They needed to suppress him first, otherwise... he wouldn't know who was in charge.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Kuanghuan's expression was troubled.</p><p></p><p>At the Guiran Military Camp, he had witnessed Mr. Qi's power and viewed him as a celestial being.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how strong Mr. Qi was, could he compare to Qin Yuan country's national weapon, the Sky Eye?</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Canxing invaded, the reason Gongxing could remain independent and not be annexed was largely due to the Sky Eye.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kuanghuan couldn't help but worry for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He knew Qi Yuan's personality. Mr. Qi would never go back on what he had done.</p><p></p><p>If they spoke nicely it might be fine, but... such obvious suppression filled with worldly affairs, Mr. Qi would disdain even more.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Kuanghuan stammered, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the uniformed man roughly understood how things would go.</p><p></p><p>Although those in favor of roping him in currently had the upper hand, the pro-war faction was constantly making small moves in secret.</p><p></p><p>"Kuanghuan, your grandfather and I were comrades in arms. Since you don't want to talk to him, don't get involved in this matter." The uniformed man decided to personally have Duke Blue Sea meet with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan refused to apologize, then that would be another matter.</p><p></p><p>He said this to keep Kuanghuan out of it, to prevent him from being drawn into the vortex.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, Duke Blue Sea was in the wrong in this matter..." Kuanghuan wanted to say more.</p><p></p><p>But he heard the uniformed man say: "Xiao Huan, you're not young anymore. You should think about your family. After you go back, just pretend nothing happened, or... just stay here for a while."</p><p></p><p>His meaning was to put Kuanghuan under house arrest until the matter was resolved.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Kuanghuan struggled immensely, feeling powerless and angry.</p><p></p><p>He worried for Qi Yuan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>From what he knew, Qi Yuan would never compromise.</p><p></p><p>Once he decided on something, he would not change it.</p><p></p><p>What to do? His mind was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, he walked out of the steel building.</p><p></p><p>Two guards "taking care of him" followed by his side.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt the sun was especially glaring today.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly noticed that many soldiers seemed to be looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>He also looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>When he saw... the extra sun in the sky, his eyes widened, as if realizing something.</p><p></p><p>A curse involuntarily escaped his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Those damn Seven Martial Stars, they're not even worth dog shit!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

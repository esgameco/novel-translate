        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhi Hui bowed respectfully to Qi Yuan and continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, if you become an enemy of the Taihuang Palace, you must be careful. The strength of the Taihuang Palace is not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>He then took out a jade slip and handed it to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, if you encounter a crisis, you can crush this jade slip, and we of the Zhi Hui will secretly intervene once to help you."</p><p></p><p>Although the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Palace was unwilling to cooperate with the Zhi Hui.</p><p></p><p>But there's a saying that the enemy of your enemy is your friend.</p><p></p><p>Funding the enemy's enemy, adding some obstruction to the enemy, the Zhi Hui is delighted to see this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the jade slip, his gaze fluctuating: "Senior?"</p><p></p><p>He could sense the aura of a Senior.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhi Hui stood upright: "This jade slip was created by the Second Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sect Master of the Zhi Hui was a Senior.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've given me such a good thing, shouldn't I give you a return gift?" Qi Yuan stroked his chin and then said, "Today you've made a big profit. I have a mark here, do you want it? You can place it in your spiritual soul, so that even after you die, you can be revived as a ghost in my Purple Mansion."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not the type to take advantage of others.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Great Zhi Hui was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>A mark? Placed in the spiritual soul? That's impossible. At their level, casually letting others place a mark in their spiritual soul is courting death. Who knows what hidden doors there might be? "Thank you for the kind offer, but I'll have to decline." The Great Zhi Hui quickly refused.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan's later mention of reviving in the Purple Mansion, he just took it as a joke.</p><p></p><p>If the Celestial Venerable Yang truly died, there would be no trace left, how could he be revived? If he didn't perish completely, he naturally wouldn't need the Palace Emissary's mark to revive himself.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was somewhat disappointed: "Are you sure you don't want it? With this, you can practically walk through the Sixth Heaven, do whatever you want, as long as I don't die, you'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>After all, he had some difficulty being at peace with taking advantage of others.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhi Hui smiled and shook his head: "No need."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, since you don't want it, then forget it. In the future, don't say I owe the Zhi Hui anything." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhi Hui smiled awkwardly, he always felt that the Palace Emissant in front of him was a bit strange, seemingly not quite normal.</p><p></p><p>He said a few more words, bowed, and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The scene was left with only Qi Yuan and the White Dragon Abyss Master.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the woman beside him: "With just the two of us here, is it not quite appropriate?"</p><p></p><p>The meaning was clear, that Great Zhi Hui has left, so you should leave too.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master's body stiffened, her voice hoarse: "Sir, are you perhaps a woman?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, White Dragon Abyss Master, are you still pretending to be a man?" Qi Yuan directly exposed her, "Don't think that just by changing clothes I won't recognize you, no matter what clothes you wear, or even if you don't wear any, I can recognize you at a glance!"</p><p></p><p>The smile on the White Dragon Abyss Master's face froze, she didn't expect this Palace Emissant to see through her disguise.</p><p></p><p>"How... did you recognize me?" She was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a Senior, unless they used great magical power to break through her disguise, they would not be able to recognize her. And the step of breaking through the disguise, she would also sense and resist.</p><p></p><p>"From your eyes." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master was speechless, she stared at Qi Yuan: "Have we met before?"</p><p></p><p>"You could say that." Qi Yuan didn't hide it. "Alright, enough nonsense, just say what you need to say."</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he had gained a lot, and he still needed some time to fully integrate the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner into the Emperor's Banner, increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist... are you from outside the Immortal Realm?" The White Dragon Abyss Master blinked her eyes, very curious about the identity of the Palace Emissant.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that." Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>His home was in that place called the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"I see." The White Dragon Abyss Master took a deep breath. "It seems that Fellow Daoist is not a Great Zhi Hui of the Immortal Realm, without the Great Zhi Hui Attainment that fuses with the Immortal Dao will."</p><p></p><p>Without the Great Zhi Hui Attainment, if Fellow Daoist encounters a Senior, even with offensive spiritual treasures, he would still die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Seniors and Banner Masters like that are only one level apart, but... the terribleness of the Seniors...</p><p></p><p>Without the Great Zhi Hui Attainment, with the Immortal Dao will maintaining the balance, in the hands of a Senior, I wouldn't last a breath.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master's meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Emissant of the Emperor's Palace did not have the Great Zhi Hui Attainment, so even with offensive spiritual treasures, facing the one from the Taihuang Palace, his life and death would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's gaze was calm, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had also learned about the Great Zhi Hui Attainment.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the existence of the Great Zhi Hui Attainment that he did not use the Emperor's Banner, and even ordinary Great Zhi Hui could not harm him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he just stood there, the ordinary Great Zhi Hui could still injure him.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a problem.</p><p></p><p>"I have a secret technique here that can allow those from the Outer Realm to comprehend the Zhi Hui and Immortal Dao will fusion, forming the Great Zhi Hui Attainment." The White Dragon Abyss Master said, taking out a jade slip and handing it to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It can be done like this?" Qi Yuan scanned the jade slip, understanding in his heart, "Since you've helped me, I should reciprocate. Do you want me to leave a mark in your spiritual soul?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master paused slightly, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan noticed this, knowing that his words had been too blunt, lacking in social graces.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this mark of mine won't peep on you while you're bathing. Even if I accidentally see you bathing, I won't be disgusted by your big butt."</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master paused, then took a deep breath: "If you let me take a look, I'd be willing to let you leave that mark in my spiritual soul."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it!" Qi Yuan quickly refused.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to get pregnant.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Barrier.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to the White Dragon Abyss Master, he first went to the Heavenly Stable Extraordinary Land to fully integrate the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner into the Emperor's Banner, increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>Later, he returned to the Demon Barrier Dwelling and began to study the secret technique left by the White Dragon Abyss Master.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't study it, he wouldn't know, but once he started studying it, he was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Immortal Dao will have a phobia of handsome men? Why is it so resistant to me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He felt the Immortal Dao will's illness was not light.</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, could it be that I casually left some seeds, pulling people back to the Underworld, offending it?"</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's imagination,</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao will was muddled, with almost no self-awareness, relying entirely on its own instincts.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, it was a larger version of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"So... should I not try to attain it?" Qi Yuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the secret technique, he had also tried to contact the Immortal Dao will, not intending to directly fuse with it. If he ended up signing some kind of contract with the Immortal Dao will, like a marriage, that wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>What if he left the Immortal Realm and divorced the Immortal Dao will, having his cultivation divided away? As a result, Qi Yuan realized this was just his own wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao will was not interested in marrying him, it didn't even want to meet Qi Yuan, not even adding him on WeChat.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan concluded that this Immortal Dao will had a phobia of handsome men.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I have a super great plan."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the dwelling, a sound suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Senior Brother... are you there?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was playful and cute, with a hint of joy.</p><p></p><p>"Little Luo Luo, what's wrong?" Qi Yuan came out, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, the Violet Fate Little Luo tightened her clothes, relieved: "I thought Blood Robe Senior Brother... had encountered some danger."</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Monarch had opened a banquet, hunting the Palace Emissant of the Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Even going to the Heavenly Stable Extraordinary Land, this had made the Violet Fate Little Luo very anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, what kind of danger could I possibly encounter?" Qi Yuan said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>She blinked at Qi Yuan, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>She had many doubts and puzzles in her heart, but in the end, she didn't ask them.</p><p></p><p>Since Blood Robe Senior Brother didn't want to say, then it must be a secret.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although she kept her mouth shut, she was only a Yin Shen (Yin Spirit). If she knew some of the Blood Robe Senior Brother's secrets and was captured by the Yang Shen (Yang Spirit) Celestial Venerable to have her soul searched, Blood Robe Senior Brother's secrets would also be exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Senior Brother, I'm glad you're not in danger," Zi Yuan Xiao Lu said, "This is the Ancestral Blood Spirit Water I just collected."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, keep up the good work, and I'll provide you with food and accommodation!" Qi Yuan took the Ancestral Blood Spirit Water, saying happily.</p><p></p><p>For him, the progress of the "Ancestral Blood Technique" still needed the Ancestral Black Magic Blood to push forward.</p><p></p><p>His "Ancestral Blood Technique" had been stuck at the thirteenth layer for a long time, nearly one or two months!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother." Zi Yuan Xiao Lu felt very pleased in her heart, and after bidding farewell to Qi Yuan, she hurried away.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Demon Pass, those young geniuses were discussing animatedly, their expressions joyful.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "Good news doesn't leave the door, but bad news travels a thousand miles."</p><p></p><p>The news of the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor sweeping away the Gui Lord and seizing the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner had already spread throughout the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>This shocked the geniuses in the Demon Pass.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor was someone who could suppress the Gui Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Gui Celestial was severely injured, and the cultivators in the Demon Pass were also slowly retreating, withdrawing to their headquarters to prepare for defense.</p><p></p><p>These Demon Pass geniuses were thinking about when they could attack the Demon Pass and gain some achievements.</p><p></p><p>They might not have such an opportunity in the future.</p><p></p><p>But... what they didn't know was that they would soon lose this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The meeting of the Seven Ancestors of the Black Abyss and the Yang Shen Celestial Venerable had finally ended.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Master announced an important news.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zi Yuan Zu's figure descended and appeared in Qi Yuan's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, let's go to the Moon Goddess Palace and bring your partner here."</p><p></p><p>The originally cultivating Qi Yuan was slightly taken aback: "Old man, why the hurry?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu's expression was grave: "Just now, the Abyss Master announced that our Black Abyss... is sealed!"</p><p></p><p>The meaning of "sealed" was that the mountain was sealed, and all cultivators were not allowed to go out.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the Black Abyss, in a sense, had withdrawn from the Lingyun Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Can they do that?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean the other forces could do the same if they wanted to?</p><p></p><p>"The situation is too complicated." Zi Yuan Zu transmitted some information to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the news, Qi Yuan was somewhat speechless: "Rather than saying it's sealed, it's more like... becoming a vassal army of the Tai Huang Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss was sealed and no longer concerned with worldly affairs, but had to allocate several great Dao Masters to support the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"So, we have to take your partner back now, or else you won't have the chance to go out later." Zi Yuan Zu said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, don't keep frowning. In the future, I'll take care of you," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, do you think you've mastered the supreme Dao just because you're the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor?" Zi Yuan Zu said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged and didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was like molten silver, falling in all directions, making the entire world seem tranquil.</p><p></p><p>Yet, there was a hint of gloom in the tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Yue Shuang looked at the beautifully dressed Jinli and her gaze was somewhat inexplicable: "Although the Black Abyss is also a place of controversy, it's still much better than the Moon Goddess Palace... Going there would be better for you."</p><p></p><p>Since the news of the Tai Huang Palace taking charge of the Lingyun Realm had spread, the atmosphere in the Moon Goddess Palace had suddenly become tense.</p><p></p><p>Many outer disciples or those associated with the Moon Goddess Palace had begun to distance themselves from the palace.</p><p></p><p>Even the Yang Shen Celestial Venerable was worried and had secretly contacted other forces, seeking a way out.</p><p></p><p>The image in the bronze mirror was somewhat antique and faded, like an old photograph, with a touch of artistic charm that was difficult to describe.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's pure white face was adorned with a few white pearl beads, making her appear even more elegant.</p><p></p><p>She was carefully adorning herself.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the windowsill, Yue Shuang stretched out her legs and continued: "Actually, I'm quite curious, how did your man convince the Moon Flower Celestial Venerable to allow you to become a Moon Goddess and be his partner?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Shuang was very curious.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing had almost never happened before.</p><p></p><p>In the past, there had been Yang Shen Celestial Venerable who came to the Moon Goddess Palace, asking for a Moon Goddess, but they were firmly rejected by the Moon Goddess Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that they were treated without any courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... he is exceptional enough." At this moment, Jinli was as calm and cold as a chrysanthemum, like a banished immortal.</p><p></p><p>But only Qi Yuan knew that once her clothes were torn open, she would be as passionate as fire.</p><p></p><p>"Merely being exceptional is not enough. Could it be..." Yue Shuang thought of something and didn't continue.</p><p></p><p>After all, it would be impolite to say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>The only reason she could think of was an exchange of interests.</p><p></p><p>The two joining together represented an alliance between the two major forces.</p><p></p><p>But... the Black Abyss didn't seem to have such intentions? This was somewhat difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a majestic voice suddenly resounded throughout the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yuan Tian, the Zi Yuan Ancestor, accompanied by the Blood Robe, wishes to form a virtuous union with the Moon Goddess Palace."</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, countless rays of light began to gently fall from the sky in the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>Like heavenly maidens shedding flowers, or immortals exhaling mist.</p><p></p><p>The entire Moon Goddess Palace suddenly became resplendent, shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, countless spirit stones and immortal jade fell from the sky, like dumpling dough.</p><p></p><p>Many ordinary cultivators of the Moon Goddess Palace saw this scene, their eyes widening, and their faces filled with ecstatic joy.</p><p></p><p>They flew up to catch the spirit stones and immortal jade.</p><p></p><p>In the inner chamber, Jinli's heart suddenly raced.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the scene of immortal aura swirling around, and couldn't help but transmit a message: "Old man, this special effect must be quite expensive, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I have to give you some face, otherwise, it would be too shabby, wouldn't it?" the old man replied.</p><p></p><p>"But falling spirit stones and immortal jade from the sky doesn't seem very romantic. Isn't it a bit vulgar?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but question.</p><p></p><p>Having spirit stones and immortal jade falling from the sky made him seem like a nouveau riche.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators of the Moon Goddess Palace are delighted by this. What does it matter if you think it's vulgar?" the old man said.</p><p></p><p>"...Now I'm starting to believe that Zi Yuan Da Xue is your descendant," Qi Yuan didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a kind voice sounded within the Moon Goddess Palace: "The esteemed guest has arrived, please come in!"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was none other than the Moon Flower Celestial Venerable, who was one of the two great Dao Masters of the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Qi Yuan followed Zi Yuan Zu and entered the Moon Goddess Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess Hall seemed to be located in the Moon Palace. Upon entering, Qi Yuan felt a faint chill and caught a slight scent of cassia.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Flower Celestial Venerable sat in the main seat, with eighteen Dao Master Celestial Venerables seated beside her.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately spotted the Moon Goddess Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes, like cut water, also looked at him, but quickly lowered her head.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the eighteen Dao Master Celestial Venerables all looked at Qi Yuan, their eyes filled with curiosity and a hint of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>They were not very clear about Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>They also didn't know why the Moon Flower Celestial Venerable had allowed Jinli to become a Moon Goddess and be Qi Yuan's partner.</p><p></p><p>"I already know the purpose of your visit," the Moon Flower looked at Qi Yuan, her gaze gentle and amiable, "This day... I have been waiting for a long time."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Dao Master Celestial Venerables' expressions slightly changed, some puzzled, and some deep in thought, as if contemplating something.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, when our Moon Goddess Palace's daughters get married, it would be a grand occasion. But today..." The Moon Flower Celestial Venerable's gaze held a hint of worry, "The Lingyun Realm may start at any moment. We'll keep it simple. Blood Robe, Moon Goddess Jinli... I entrust her to you. If she suffers any grievances, the Moon Goddess Palace will come to reason with you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan cupped his hands in salute: "Venerable, rest assured, I will treat Jinli with true heart like the moon."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan appeared calm on the surface, but his mind was pondering many things.</p><p></p><p>His connection with Jinli started from the Lingyong Jade and the Wangxiang Continent.</p><p></p><p>He had finally seen her as he had promised.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I will escort Jinli to the Zi Yuan Heaven, so that some scoundrels won't interfere!" The Moon Flower Celestial Venerable said, waving her sleeve with the might of a great Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 574</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Did the Unique Palace come to see him?</p><p></p><p>What was he thinking?</p><p></p><p>The Unique Palace, without self-awareness, originates from the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary beings avoid it as much as possible, fearing to be assimilated by the Unique Palace into an alien entity.</p><p></p><p>Yet this person actually had the Unique Palace come to see him.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot do this either," the specter shook its head.</p><p></p><p>"Does this immortal palace have a deep connection with the Unique Palace?" Qi Yuan asked, "If I were to destroy this immortal palace, would the Unique Palace be willing to see me?"</p><p></p><p>The Unique Palace is an existence on the fourth layer of the Yang Divinity, without self-awareness, like the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>But since the Tai Huang Palace could connect with the Unique Palace and control the Linyu Molt,</p><p></p><p>It also means that perhaps within the Unique Palace, there exists an existence similar to the Black Heavens and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>The specter remained silent, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, he finally said, "The immortal palace is a rare treasure of the Realm Lord, ordinary people... cannot easily destroy it."</p><p></p><p>"How do you know if you don't try?" Qi Yuan smiled mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>The immortal palace is a rare treasure of the Realm Lord, but it is an ordinary rare treasure, far inferior to the Enlightenment forged by the primordial rules of the universe.</p><p></p><p>He extended a finger and pointed to the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Make me... pregnant!"</p><p></p><p>A chaotic aura spread.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's aura became inexplicable and sinister.</p><p></p><p>The specter stared wide-eyed, somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>This Supreme Lord of Ten Thousand Days, what was he doing? And pregnant? What did that mean? As a being attached to the immortal palace, the specter suddenly covered his abdomen.</p><p></p><p>"What did you do to me?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, a terrifying idea arising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly feel that destruction is not as good as creation, so... let's try to make the immortal palace pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Since the immortal palace is pregnant, the Unique Palace as its parent, should come out to take a look, right? After all, what dowry hasn't been given, what banquet hasn't been held." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The specter wanted to cry but had no tears: "You're crazy, you're crazy!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't quite understand, what did his pregnancy or not have to do with the Unique Palace seeing Qi Yuan? Of course, his way of thinking could not comprehend Qi Yuan's way of thinking, which was also normal.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be like that, I'm a big man... I don't want to get pregnant!"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with being pregnant? I have a friend who can lay eggs too!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that you are discriminating against him, and if you do, be careful that the egg he lays won't let you eat it!" </p><p></p><p>"No, it's just that... why would the Unique Palace want to see you!" The specter covered his abdomen, utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly looked up at the sky, his eyes filled with a smile: "It seems the Unique Palace still cares about you, that's why it's come."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice fell, the specter stiffened, a special aura descending upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Rules, all things, opening the heavens... this power is enough to awaken me, to see you."</p><p></p><p>The specter's strength was not strong, and he had not noticed Qi Yuan's previous move, which had displayed Opening Heaven Realm power.</p><p></p><p>But this move had awakened this person and descended upon the specter.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that after all these years, there would still be someone in this immortal world who could break through the limits and reach the Opening Heaven Realm." The new specter sighed.</p><p></p><p>Since the Sword Severed the Future, the limit of the immortal world has been the second layer of Yang Divinity.</p><p></p><p>To step into higher realms, one must open the seven heavens of the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, there will always be surprises.</p><p></p><p>He has seen many surprises.</p><p></p><p>But he has never seen anyone who has reached the Opening Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>And... the other party seems to be both in and not in the Opening Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>To reach the Opening Heaven Realm, one must fuse with the Immortal Dao will and master the myriad Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>But the other party's Dao does not seem to be the Immortal Dao will.</p><p></p><p>Only outsiders... can explain this.</p><p></p><p>An Opening Heaven expert from the outside world has suddenly stepped into the immortal world's cage, this makes him feel inexplicably moved.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The nameless sword guardian of the Unique Palace." The nameless one replied.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what's going on with your Unique Palace? Are you helping the Tai Huang Palace, targeting me?" Qi Yuan directly questioned.</p><p></p><p>The sword guardian's eyes were confused, and then a large amount of information flooded into his mind, and he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"That person from the Tai Huang Palace was just lucky, barely obtaining the Unique Token, that's why he could control the Linyu Molt." The nameless one replied.</p><p></p><p>He had been in a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>If he had not sensed Qi Yuan's aura, he would not have awakened.</p><p></p><p>After all, every being who breaks through the limits is worth his recruitment.</p><p></p><p>The nameless one said, and then added, "You and I are not enemies."</p><p></p><p>"Can the Linyu Molt be ended? After all, the cultivation world has never been good, and with the Linyu Molt, all the fighting and killing, it's not good." As a justice-filled lawful good person, Qi Yuan has always been concerned about the atmosphere in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"The beginning and end of the Linyu Molt... is not for me to decide, this is what my master has determined." The sword guardian said.</p><p></p><p>"You still have a master?" </p><p></p><p>"Yes... he is the Unique Palace." The sword guardian's voice was filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps you know another name of his." The sword guardian looked at Qi Yuan and slowly said, "Mingzun."</p><p></p><p>"Mingzun who severed the future?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>During the time at the Zhi Li Hall, Qi Yuan had asked for a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>According to the Zhi Li Hall, the original immortal world had nine heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, there appeared an astonishingly brilliant expert named Mingzun, who with a single sword, severed the future of the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan was quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>To be able to sever the future with a single sword, this was how powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even the current Qi Yuan would find it difficult to sever the future with a sword.</p><p></p><p>Mingzun severed the future, and from then on, the immortal world no longer had nine heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Why did Mingzun want to sever the future?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This was also a question.</p><p></p><p>Because in other universes, there are mostly futures.</p><p></p><p>According to Qi Yuan's knowledge, only the immortal world and the world where the Holy Mother of No Food once resided, have no future.</p><p></p><p>"The path of the fourth layer of Yang Divinity, you already know, the path of the fifth layer of Yang Divinity... do you know it?" The sword guardian asked.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth layer is the Dao Lord, the master of a Dao." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>The path of the fourth layer of Yang Divinity will lose the true spirit and become inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>Even if there is a one-in-a-million chance of revival, the revived will be a new being.</p><p></p><p>Because, the moment one steps into the fourth layer of Yang Divinity, it means the true spirit is extinguished.</p><p></p><p>This path, Qi Yuan did not want to walk.</p><p></p><p>Bypassing the fourth layer and directly stepping into the fifth layer, this path, Qi Yuan is currently exploring.</p><p></p><p>If it can be accomplished, he can modify and draw on it for his own Yang Divinity path.</p><p></p><p>"The endpoint of the Yang Divinity realm is the fifth layer of Yang Divinity, the Dao Lord."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the sword guardian had a look of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"When the universe is destroyed, the Dao Lord does not perish, with a single thought, the cycle of the universe's birth and destruction is all controlled by their hands, this is the Dao Lord."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>He also knew the power of the Dao Lord.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Dao Lord has already stood at the peak, the strongest in the present world.</p><p></p><p>They can collect timelines, and in the mother river of the formed universe, pull out the true spirits of those they want to revive.</p><p></p><p>Wherever there is a Dao, there can only be one Dao Lord.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao lineage, the Dao Lord is invincible, undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Lord is very strong, but do you know that the day the Dao Lord ascends is also called the Day of Cycle?" The sword guardian's voice was desolate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>The Day of Cycle?</p><p></p><p>This phrase is easy to evoke associations.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Lord has endless longevity, enough to control the life and death of the beings of a universe, or even multiple universes.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dao lineage, They are an invincible existence.</p><p></p><p>But..."</p><p></p><p>The sword guardian paused for a moment, his eyes bleak and sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Dao Lord ascends, the time within the Dao lineage will end with that day, and then... begin... an infinite cycle."</p><p></p><p>"The day of ascension is also the beginning of the cycle, everything in the world... is already set!"</p><p></p><p>The sword guardian's expression was somewhat ferocious.</p><p></p><p>This means that in the world where the Dao Lord has ascended, time has reached its end and will not move forward.</p><p></p><p>Time will start a cycle, from the origin to the day of the Dao Lord's ascension, repeating endlessly.</p><p></p><p>In this process, perhaps due to the Dao Lord's intervention, some differences and changes may occur.</p><p></p><p>But... everything has an end.</p><p></p><p>When time reaches the day of the Dao Lord's ascension, the next cycle will begin again.</p><p></p><p>If someone has made an appointment to meet before the Dao Lord's ascension day, perhaps in every cycle, they will make the appointment to meet, but will never be able to see each other.</p><p></p><p>"The endpoint of the cultivation path is actually like this, it's really laughable, laughable!" The sword guardian's face was filled with indignation.</p><p></p><p>Such a Dao Lord, indeed majestic, unmatched.</p><p></p><p>Even to the extent that the life and death of all beings are controlled in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps many cultivators are willing to become such a Dao Lord.</p><p></p><p>But there are also cultivators who are unwilling to be content with this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also silent: "This is actually the endpoint of the cultivation path."</p><p></p><p>He put himself in the shoes of the Dao Lord before they ascended.</p><p></p><p>If one does not become the Dao Lord, there will be no mother river of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The comrades who died in battle long ago, or the aging loved ones, cannot be revived.</p><p></p><p>Even seeing the aging and collapse of friends and family around him.</p><p></p><p>Lonely, lost.</p><p></p><p>If one becomes the Dao Lord, everything seems to be frozen.</p><p></p><p>The children who will never grow up, the trees that will never bloom, the rivers that will never reach the sea...</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it very desperate?" The sword guardian asked, his voice wistful.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... it's good for the Dao Lord, but for the rest, it's very desperate."</p><p></p><p>"The immortal world... has a Dao Lord." At this time, the sword guardian also revealed another horrifying reality.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal world has a Dao Lord?" Even Qi Yuan felt a sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>The immortal world has a Dao Lord.</p><p></p><p>Does this also mean that one day, time will reach the day of the Dao Lord's ascension, and then... an infinite cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, that Dao Lord... no longer exists." The sword guardian said.</p><p></p><p>This was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky.</p><p></p><p>As if saying that the invincible Dao Lord of the world has perished.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Dao Lord is no more, the world still moves forward towards the future, and then opens the next cycle.</p><p></p><p>My master Mingzun, wandered into the immortal world, unable to bear this.</p><p></p><p>So he chose to step into the fourth layer of Yang Divinity, and at the moment of stepping in, he reached the ultimate sublimation, severing the future of the immortal world."</p><p></p><p>The sword guardian mentioned this with an awe-filled expression.</p><p></p><p>"From then on, the immortal world no longer had a future, nor could it see the future, and all Yang Divinities could no longer have a future body."</p><p></p><p>"Mingzun is impressive." Qi Yuan truly admired him, "Coming from the outside world, yet willing to sacrifice his own true spirit to cut off the future of the immortal world."</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that Mingzun, at the Opening Heaven Realm, had already reached the limit.</p><p></p><p>Even to the point of having the opportunity to bypass the fourth layer of Yang Divinity and directly enter the fifth layer.</p><p></p><p>But he chose to step into the fourth layer of Yang Divinity, and at the moment of stepping in, he reached the ultimate sublimation, severing the future of the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>"The Linyu Molt... to rebuild the nine heavens of the immortal world, is to restore the future of the immortal world." The sword guardian said.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Alien Dao Fruit?" The sword guardian asked again.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard of it, but never seen it."</p><p></p><p>The Violet Origin Ancestor was injured by the Alien Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, 'when a whale falls, all things are born', the Alien Dao Fruit is the embodiment of the rules that the Dao Lord has comprehended."</p><p></p><p>"And how did this Dao Lord die?" Qi Yuan was very curious.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the Dao Lord has already reached the endpoint of the cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>This existence, no one can kill it.</p><p></p><p>The sword guardian shook his head: "I don't know either, perhaps... only my master knows."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the longevity of Yang Divinities is almost endless, but endless longevity does not mean they can live forever.</p><p></p><p>Even if the world is destroyed,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Yang Shen (Yang Spirits) are indestructible.</p><p></p><p>But if the end of an era arrives, all things wither, and the universe collapses, then perhaps, except for the Realm Lords who can hide within the universal laws, the rest of the Yang Shen will only be able to perish.</p><p></p><p>But even if one becomes a Realm Lord, transcending the universe, there is still a possibility that due to living too long, such as witnessing tens of billions of eras, the rules could collapse and they would perish.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is too difficult. Even if I'm now an Yin Shen (Yin Spirit) with endless lifespan, I might have witnessed the destruction of the universe tens of billions of times and still die.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the fourth layer of Yang Shen, one would die directly; the fifth layer, also hopeless.</p><p></p><p>I think I've contracted the 'Jade Jade Syndrome' from this immortal cultivation."</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was the truth.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Swordkeeper's words, he felt a bit "worrying about the future".</p><p></p><p>What to do in the future? Cultivating immortality is so difficult! The Swordkeeper fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, those who live long all have problems with their minds.</p><p></p><p>This Grand Saint of Ten Thousand Days, perhaps he is also an ancient monster who has witnessed the destruction of the universe thousands of times, with mental issues.</p><p></p><p>However, he eventually said slowly, "Since you have the strength of a Realm Lord, then this Bright Saint Token shall be given to you."</p><p></p><p>The Swordkeeper handed a Bright Saint Token to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"When the Master reaches the fourth layer of Yang Shen, he will transform into a unique Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing endless time and years, the Unique Pavilion is about to reach the final stage of the fourth layer of Yang Shen, becoming a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Master once said that if he becomes a rare treasure, it would not be bad to be wielded by a future person.</p><p></p><p>But I hope the future person can wield the Unique Pavilion and go to the Nine Heavens of the Immortal Realm, to seal the Dao Fruit of the Immortal Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once the Dao Fruit is completely leaked, there may be no more Immortal Dao in the world.</p><p></p><p>This Bright Saint Token, added to this one, I have sent out seven in total. I hope you will have the opportunity in the future to wield the Unique Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The Swordkeeper said a lot more.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the Bright Saint Token: "Coincidentally, my family is still lacking a house, the Unique Pavilion seems very suitable."</p><p></p><p>The Swordkeeper did not speak.</p><p></p><p>The other six who had the Bright Saint Token, to varying degrees, all had some mental problems.</p><p></p><p>"Oh... I have another question, why will one die immediately upon leaving the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the Ancestor of the Black Abyss and other rumors.</p><p></p><p>All living beings who leave the Immortal Realm will perish instantly.</p><p></p><p>The Swordkeeper shook his head: "This question, I cannot answer either."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Immortal Realm still has many unknowns that I don't know about. Sigh, cultivating immortality is too difficult," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qi Mountain Market.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen had a puzzled look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, for several days now, why have the Flow Lights not flown out again?"</p><p></p><p>He had promised to help Lian Mei gather the Flow Lights to reach the late Purple Palace stage.</p><p></p><p>But in this period, there have been no Flow Lights flying out at all.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... related to the changes in the Immortal Palace?" Lian Mei speculated.</p><p></p><p>A short while ago, she had just parted ways with Shen Wushen's good friend, but then a mysterious strong expert suddenly appeared and opened the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>Later, Yang Shen experts also flew out from the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Mountain Market had been bustling for a while.</p><p></p><p>However, those Yang Shen did not stay, but left one after another.</p><p></p><p>Qi Mountain Market then became quiet again.</p><p></p><p>But now, after so many days, the Flow Lights have not flown again, and their group in the Purple Palace are all disappointed and anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps," Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sorrowful voice came.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sorrow, there was also a touch of despair.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating immortality is so difficult! Shen Wushen, accompany me to drink ten catties of wine, I want to get drunk and dispel my worries!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, the handsome Qi Yuan appeared.</p><p></p><p>But now, his face was full of sorrow, and he did not look very happy.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen said, "Brother Qi, haven't you never drank wine before?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused: "Ah, I'm so sad that I even forgot. Alright, I'll use fruit juice as a substitute and drink with you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, and a bottle of fruit juice appeared in his hand, which he drank up in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Shen Wushen also fed himself some wine.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, why are you so grieved?" Lian Mei asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The previous Qi Yuan was a bit unconventional, different from the current Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is too difficult, there is despair everywhere.</p><p></p><p>And even if I cultivate to the fifth layer of Yang Shen, I will also face despair.</p><p></p><p>If I don't reach the fifth layer of Yang Shen, I might die, and even if my relatives reach the third layer of Yang Shen with my help, they may still perish one day when the rules collapse.</p><p></p><p>And those who don't work hard to cultivate immortality, maybe they will die even at the second layer of Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Worried and anxious, difficult, difficult, difficult!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>After talking with the Swordkeeper, the more he knew about the end of cultivation, the more Qi Yuan became desperate.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, look, I'm even worried that my hair has turned white."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, pulling out a white hair.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this white hair was actually just dyed by himself.</p><p></p><p>Just to match his current mood and express his painful worries.</p><p></p><p>Although he was very worried and concerned about the future, his appetite was still very good, he could eat several oxen in one meal, and his hair was still very black, so he could only dye one white hair.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lian Mei's smile froze when she heard Qi Yuan's words about the fifth layer of Yang Shen and the third layer of Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>What is he talking about? Yang Shen fifth layer? And what's this about the third layer of Yang Shen?</p><p></p><p>Is this what a person says? This guy... is he sick?</p><p></p><p>Now Lian Mei was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>This kind of speechlessness is like on the Blue Star, when you suddenly hear your Chinese classmate worrying about becoming the president of the United States and having many troublesome affairs.</p><p></p><p>If Lian Mei was more familiar with Qi Yuan, she would have slapped him across the face long ago.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was calm, furrowing his brows to comfort: "Brother Qi, there will be a way."</p><p></p><p>He knew Qi Yuan's strength was very strong.</p><p></p><p>The things Qi Yuan was worried about might involve some secrets.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he is now too weak to empathize.</p><p></p><p>"I hope so, sigh, Yang Shen is so difficult, how can one break through to Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>What kind of Yang Shen is the true Yang Shen?" Qi Yuan drank the slightly sweet fruit juice, his face full of worry.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lian Mei gave Qi Yuan a disdainful look. Just now he was talking about breaking through to the fifth layer of Yang Shen, and now he's asking how to break through to Yang Shen, so erratic and crazy.</p><p></p><p>"The difficulties of life are like that endless river, though having the will to flow to the great sea..." Qi Yuan began to plagiarize again.</p><p></p><p>Considering how sad he is, the original author should not blame him, right?</p><p></p><p>If he does blame me, then... is it okay for me to kill someone and cover it up when I'm sad?</p><p></p><p>"The difficulties in life, who doesn't have some, this is normal," Lian Mei said, not sure if she was comforting Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you're right, if I destroy the world and kill everyone, won't there be no more troubles?" Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei chuckled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Wushen's face tightened: "Brother Qi, don't think that way!"</p><p></p><p>He knew Qi Yuan's terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>If he really went astray and subverted the Immortal Realm, the Immortal Realm might face a true calamity.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an arrogant voice came.</p><p></p><p>"All troubles are because you have too little spirit stones and a poor background." A dissolute young master walked over, his expression haughty and arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei saw the newcomer and her expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>It's the Young Master Qi Tan! The strongest in Qi Mountain Market is the Qi Family.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Family has an old ancestor who is a Yang Shen in the Azure Void.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Qi Tan, backed by the Qi Family, is arrogant and licentious.</p><p></p><p>All the Purple Palace cultivators who come to Qi Mountain Market know to keep their distance from this dissolute young master.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Young Master Qi Tan, Lian Mei instinctively covered her chest, her face a bit pale.</p><p></p><p>Could this Young Master Qi Tan take a fancy to her?</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Young Master Qi Tan disdainfully looked at Lian Mei and sneered, "A trash like you, I won't even look at you."</p><p></p><p>He then walked towards Qi Yuan, his eyes shining: "This is a true beauty, with a touch of worry in his brows, a hint of drunkenness, making one pity him. Little beauty, you have so many troubles, come with Young Master Qi..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Tan said, about to touch Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused, a disgusted expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, what level are you, what level am I, yet you dare come and harass me?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but curse.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, he actually encountered a small fry looking for trouble.</p><p></p><p>But after saying that, Qi Yuan regretted it, secretly glancing around, fortunately Niu Jiao Sister wasn't here.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Niu Jiao Sister would definitely say, you're always saying everyone is equal, why are you still dividing people into levels?</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Qi Tan was also stunned, not expecting the other party to react so strongly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I didn't expect that in Qi Mountain Market, there would still be someone daring to speak to me this way!" Young Master Qi Tan oozed arrogance and self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Shen guards beside him also eyed Qi Yuan, as if they were ready to act if Qi Yuan made any move.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, showing off? Who doesn't know how to do that?" Qi Yuan said calmly, "In the future, this market should be renamed, called... the 'Young Master Qi Tan Slain by Qi Yuan Market'! This is also giving you a chance to be remembered for eternity!"</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, Qi Yuan had at least seen countless TV dramas, as well as some novels like "Dragon King's Son-in-law", "Security Emperor", "Tyrannical CEO Falls for the Menopausal Sister" and so on.</p><p></p><p>Showing off is his specialty.</p><p></p><p>Although it's said that showing off in front of small fries will lose points, but... everyone is equal.</p><p></p><p>And coincidentally, he is now troubled by the fifth layer of Yang Shen, killing a small fry can help uphold the spirit of cultivation in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You have a lot of guts!" Qi Tan raged.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lian Mei's face was worried, extremely concerned, thinking of a way to resolve the situation.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding onlookers also looked this way, with an air of watching a show.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>These bystanders were about to discuss privately, sighing that Qi Yuan was going to get into trouble.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly they found that they couldn't speak, nor could they transmit sound.</p><p></p><p>They were a bit dumbfounded, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>They naturally didn't know that Qi Yuan was too lazy to hear the mockery of the bystanders, so he simply silenced them.</p><p></p><p>All the people had a blank look, some with fear in their hearts, some just staring dumbly at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Look, who is this?" Qi Yuan casually grabbed something in the air.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an old man fell from the sky, his face full of fear and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>He was just in closed-door cultivation, when suddenly a hand grabbed and pulled him down.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Qi Tan's eyes widened, his face filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>This is... the Ancestor!

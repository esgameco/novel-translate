        <h1>Chapter 455</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The star projections of the two Yang Gods transformed into the character for "woman".</p><p></p><p>This was incredibly surprising and puzzling. </p><p></p><p>Even the powerful beings at the level of Great Ultimate Reason had no idea what was happening.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p></p><p>Countless Yang Gods murmured, their spirits trembling, seemingly afraid.</p><p></p><p>This event was too strange and abstract, even beyond their cognition and understanding.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the strange land.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two figures in front of him, his gaze complex.</p><p></p><p>"Expelled from male status, how did they become female?"</p><p></p><p>This wasn't good.</p><p></p><p>Although the Eastern Depot couldn't do it, the Western Depot could.</p><p></p><p>If male status was rejected, would female status be accepted? What about other genders? The Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable's face was terrified, his voice high-pitched and feminine: "What did you do to me?"</p><p></p><p>He, a mighty Yang God of the Ultimate Reason realm, capable of intimidating the Six Heavens, had never been so out of control before.</p><p></p><p>As for the Great Joy Heavenly Venerable, he had already turned into the Great Crying Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"You spread rumors about me, lowering humanity's average moral standard, so I expelled you from male status. Don't you understand?" Qi Yuan looked at the Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable thoughtfully, "Also, don't raise your voice at me. You're just a biological female now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt the ethics involved were very complex and difficult to untangle.</p><p></p><p>Biological males couldn't raise their voices at him either.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Divine Blood, no longer hesitating at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"You should... just die!"</p><p></p><p>Now, in this strange land, the Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable only had the combat power of a Great Celestial Rank.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's strength, even without using the Supreme Ultimate Reason, he could easily kill him just relying on the power of the Myriad Dao Martial God.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Myriad Dao Martial God present, this strange land was his home turf.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after cultivating the "Ancestral Blood Scripture", the Myriad Dao Martial God's power had been rapidly increasing. Qi Yuan was already far beyond comparison to his former self.</p><p></p><p>His mighty body moved forward, space trembled and collapsed, a domineering punch showed no mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Become fertilizer for my underworld!"</p><p></p><p>The punch struck.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's giant hand suddenly transformed into a futuristic grinding machine, its huge maw swallowing the Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable who was bound by chains.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>Giant millstones and blades continuously tore apart her body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Finally, with a thunderous roar, a pile of feed was produced.</p><p></p><p>The Great Joy Heavenly Venerable beside him saw this and swallowed hard, nearly scared witless.</p><p></p><p>Having lived for so many years, what hadn't he seen?</p><p></p><p>But this... he truly had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable who had turned into fertilizer, also somewhat stunned: "It seems this Supreme Ultimate Reason can't be used recklessly, especially during the wedding night."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>At present, the use of the Supreme Ultimate Reason exceeded his predictions.</p><p></p><p>If he were to use it when consummating a marriage, turning into something unnameable would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan also knew this was because he had just comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Reason and couldn't fully control it yet.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the realm of the Moon God Sovereign, he would be able to use it freely.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable and collecting the fertilizer into the underworld, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the Great Joy Heavenly Venerable: "You... kill yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Joy Heavenly Venerable held the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, his eyes bulging.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner shook, countless wronged souls emerged from it, grabbing the Great Joy Heavenly Venerable's arms with both hands.</p><p></p><p>He was already restrained by the trial team and judges, and affected by Qi Yuan's Supreme Ultimate Reason, completely unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>His body was dragged into the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, torn into countless pieces.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, the eyes of these ghost spirits glowed, chaotic and full of murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>These ghosts were the condensed souls of cultivators refined by the Ghost Dominating Sky cultivators as they destroyed realm after realm.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner was the epitome of murderous aura, its sins boundless.</p><p></p><p>A single Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner contained more innocent souls than there were people on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, swallowed by the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, unable to become fertilizer for the underworld."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, his hand suddenly reaching forward to grab it.</p><p></p><p>"Come back, my soul banner!"</p><p></p><p>This soul banner was an avatar of the true Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>Although its power wasn't even one-tenth of the original, it could barely be considered an offensive magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner kept shaking.</p><p></p><p>Black qi billowed out.</p><p></p><p>The ghost spirits with ferocious faces, as well as endless soul servants, looked at Qi Yuan, stretching out their eerie arms, like ten thousand ghosts wailing.</p><p></p><p>This sight was enough to scare even the bravest to death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan thought if he returned to Blue Star and used this Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner to open an escape room, it would definitely be interesting.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of these ghosts was particularly ferocious, much more terrifying than ghosts in TV dramas. They were twisted together, indescribable. Looking at them, it might be a pile of arms, or a pile of heads.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these soul servants, Qi Yuan remembered his plan.</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat and said softly: "Perhaps everyone fears you, is afraid of you, but I think your appearance is quite pretty."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began his brainwashing project, wanting to transform the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner into his dream banner.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to transform the soul servants and ghost spirits within it into ghosts of the people.</p><p></p><p>So, at first, Qi Yuan used the Great Forgetting Heart Scripture and Absolute Adaptation to correct the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>Although the ghosts in the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner had committed many evil deeds, their original selves were innocent and blameless.</p><p></p><p>So, Qi Yuan planned to brainwash and transform them all.</p><p></p><p>This transformation was reverse engineering.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner hunted living beings, extracted their souls, and refined them into vicious soul servants and ghost spirits.</p><p></p><p>This viciousness was pure, without intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan wanted to transform them into righteous soul servants and ghost spirits.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, hearing Qi Yuan's words, the ghosts in the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner were slightly stunned, somewhat confused. The roars and wails decreased by more than half.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan quickly continued: "Don't blame yourselves, don't be afraid, don't fear. No one is born evil. Actually, you are all very beautiful!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the terrifying ghosts piled together in front of him, forming a giant figure, and spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>He also slowly walked towards the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>"This world is full of evil and filth, it needs righteous people like you to save it, to restore clarity to the world.</p><p></p><p>You have all seen darkness, so you cherish light even more.</p><p></p><p>You can tell me any thoughts you have.</p><p></p><p>I will delete the bad ones."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to approach.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Scripture activated.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation activated.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form also began to distort.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of those ghosts, he looked like a twisted, shapeless blood-red shadow.</p><p></p><p>Like the king of ten thousand ghosts, the ancestor of ten thousand ghosts, enough to make these ghosts fear and submit.</p><p></p><p>But this distorted, indescribable blood shadow actually emitted holy light.</p><p></p><p>This made the black smoke-emitting ghosts somewhat fearful, and also somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Children, reach out your hands, let's build a beautiful world together!" Qi Yuan reached out his arm first, his expression kind, like a heavenly father.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, the endless ghosts saw this scene and all trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps infected by Qi Yuan, their black smoke slowly began to change at this moment, transforming towards holy light.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very experienced with these things.</p><p></p><p>The Glorious Sword that used to emit crazy bloodthirst was also changed by him into holy light.</p><p></p><p>Now, changing black smoke to white smoke... shouldn't be difficult, right?</p><p></p><p>At this time, inside the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, those terrifying ghosts were also nervous, seemingly infected by Qi Yuan, and they all reached out their eerie palms.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, ten thousand</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A pale, delicate arm reached out towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Main Spirit Controller was a terrifying monster, and it seemed to have even developed a trace of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Now, it lay dormant, with no expression on its face.</p><p></p><p>Wariness, fear, brutality, murderous rage.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the anxious creature also extended its hairy, sinister hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was kind as he looked at these hands.</p><p></p><p>"You're all good children..."</p><p></p><p>But just then, suddenly, the Main Spirit Controller's arm erupted in black smoke, violently smashing towards Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Smack! The hand struck the face of Qi Yuan's illusory form, making a loud sound.</p><p></p><p>That's right, an illusion.</p><p></p><p>It was an illusion created by absolute adaptation.</p><p></p><p>The loud slap echoed throughout the strange land.</p><p></p><p>All the ghosts were stunned, frozen in place. </p><p></p><p>The wailing and howling disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a kind yet secretly delighted voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, you touched my little cheek!"</p><p></p><p>The illusion smiled, seemingly with a hint of shyness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, all the ghosts seemed to calm down, or perhaps were influenced by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The black smoke on their bodies transformed, changing into white light.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan approached the Main Spirit Controller, his expression kind.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite nice, touching my little cheek. I have to touch you back."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the Main Spirit Controller sensed a terrifying aura and let out a horrifying roar.</p><p></p><p>"You're calling out so happily, are you welcoming me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was very gentle as he directly pinned the Main Spirit Controller to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Lie down nicely, I'll give you a massage!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, your spine is poisoned, let me remove it for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't call out so loudly in joy, I know you're very happy!"</p><p></p><p>"Come, let me touch your little cheek too, and give you a beautiful new face!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on top of the Main Spirit Controller and directly tore off its face.</p><p></p><p>Its spine, its bones, were all ground to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Your bones are too black, not suitable for a righteous emissary. Today I'll give you new white bones for free!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began a major renovation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he didn't forget to give a speech.</p><p></p><p>Those ghosts hid far away, peeking at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute, second by second.</p><p></p><p>Under the effect of the Great Forgetting Scripture, these ghosts changed from gloomy and terrifying to glowing white.</p><p></p><p>The original bones and skeletons were now dressed in festive red clothes.</p><p></p><p>The messy hands, legs, and kneecaps were pieced together into human forms.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Qi Yuan looked at the ghosts before him and said proudly: "Look, doesn't it look like the Human Emperor's Banner? There's not a single dry bone inside!"</p><p></p><p>Demon Eye Celestial Lord scanned with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He saw a skeleton covered in small red flowers, with a red scarf around its neck.</p><p></p><p>A trembling spirit, snow-white as jade, with eyes like laser beams, frantically emitting white light.</p><p></p><p>To describe it:</p><p></p><p>Previously, the ghosts in the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts had a Western horror style, with hideous ghost appearances and dense mouthparts.</p><p></p><p>Now, they were neatly dressed in clothes, looking like ordinary humans at first glance.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, their expressions were numb, their eyes dull, without sound.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was even more frightening, like ghosts from Chinese horror.</p><p></p><p>"Although they look human, for some reason, they seem creepy," Demon Eye Celestial Lord replied seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a look.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it did feel scary.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple, we'll just give them some big-eyed special effects!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly took action, exerting boundless magical power.</p><p></p><p>All these ghosts were given big-eyed cute special effects.</p><p></p><p>The originally gloomy ghosts immediately became cute and adorable.</p><p></p><p>"How about now, do they look like righteous spirits from the Human Emperor's Banner?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Demon Eye Celestial Lord blinked, staring at a cute female ghost and said: "Can I take her home as a wife?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan kicked Demon Eye Celestial Lord, very satisfied with his own modifications.</p><p></p><p>Now, even the original owner wouldn't recognize the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"Now, this is my Human Emperor's Banner.</p><p></p><p>When my divine skills are perfected, I'll take down Ghost Dominator, reverse the Celestial Array, swallow the main banner, and it will be a great success!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Human Emperor's Banner, very pleased.</p><p></p><p>This attack could be said to have yielded abundant rewards.</p><p></p><p>Especially this Human Emperor's Banner, which made Qi Yuan understand even more clearly the path ahead - to refine his own offensive magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>After all, he currently had no offensive magical treasures. To become invincible in the Six Heavens, he would need to cultivate in the Gate of Ultimate Principles for several decades or hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>This time was too long.</p><p></p><p>After all, with a million years, who would still cultivate? You could go to Blue Star and find a job in an electronics factory, earn 3000 a month, and make 36 billion instantly, achieving financial freedom and squeezing into the country's top 100 wealthy list!</p><p></p><p>So, to avoid wasting time becoming one of the top 100 wealthy, spending that time cultivating would be too much of a loss. It's better to create an offensive magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>A murderous aura permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's elegant white robe was stained with blood, the aura around him as deep as the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Dominator is outrageously bold, actually daring to attempt to assassinate Black Sword. He truly deserves death!" A Great Ultimate Principle cultivator spoke, his voice filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the Ancestor consumed his own essence to rescue Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Black Sword had encountered danger, entering a strange land. In the end, it was the Ancestor who used a magical treasure to deduce and personally help Black Sword escape the predicament.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's expression was elegant, making it impossible to tell what he was thinking: "For this matter, I thank the Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>He bowed distantly towards Black Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"If not for the Ancestor, with two Great Ultimate Principle cultivators attacking, my fate would likely have been very miserable."</p><p></p><p>Black Sword spoke lightly of being attacked by two Great Ultimate Principle cultivators, without a trace of fear in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he hadn't just experienced anything.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirits who weren't present all knew the danger involved.</p><p></p><p>They were at the Great Ultimate Principle realm, naturally knowing how vast the gap was between Great Ultimate Principle and ordinary Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Although Black Sword had comprehended the supreme principle, he had not yet stepped into the realm of principles. Facing a Great Ultimate Principle cultivator, being able to persist for one breath would be extremely difficult, let alone persisting for two breaths.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Blood Robe junior brother also suffered an attack from Ghost Dominator. How is Blood Robe junior brother?" Black Sword mentioned this, with some disappointment in his words.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he was not optimistic about Blood Robe's fate.</p><p></p><p>Although Blood Robe was strong, facing an attack from Ghost Dominator, it would be difficult to have a chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Ultimate Principle cultivators present changed their expressions slightly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Fifth Elder slowly said: "This matter... we are also very curious about it."</p><p></p><p>"Curious?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the information we received, those who attacked Blood Robe should have been Great Joy Celestial Lord and Divine Blood Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Divine Blood? Ultimate Principle?" Black Sword was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He became even less optimistic about Blood Robe's fate.</p><p></p><p>That was a Yang Spirit at the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>"Their star projections turned into... the character for 'woman', and then... exploded."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Black Sword blinked, confused in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Elder waved his hand, and in the vast starry realm, two star projections shone brightly, frantically transforming, then suddenly changing into the character for "woman".</p><p></p><p>Finally, they... exploded with a boom.</p><p></p><p>Each of these scenes made people feel bewildered and extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword stared at this scene, his expression complex: "Could it be that Blood Robe junior brother also has a Supreme Lord behind him?"</p><p></p><p>The other Great Ultimate Principle cultivators all fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>For something even they couldn't understand, it must be related to a Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

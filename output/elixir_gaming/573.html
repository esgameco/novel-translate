        <h1>Chapter 573</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>White Dragon Abyss Master looked at Zi Yuan Patriarch with an indescribable expression: "This time, if I go out of the Immortal Palace, I should find an opportunity to gather with the Venerable Wan Ri."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Patriarch gave her a sidelong glance: "Aren't you afraid of the Unique Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Wan Ri had destroyed the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Zi Yuan Tian would have been bustling with activity, crowded with people and vehicles.</p><p></p><p>But since Qi Yuan had destroyed the Tai Huang Palace, he had also offended the Unique Palace that had initiated the Ling Ya Molt.</p><p></p><p>So, no matter how powerful Qi Yuan was, there were not many Venerable Ones who were obviously on his side, but rather they kept their distance from him to avoid being targeted by the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Afraid? But I'm more afraid of not being able to get through the Root Demon Tribulation." White Dragon Abyss Master sighed, "Strength is a tribulation, and the time when I was an Yin Shen was the best, without worries, not having to worry about the Ling Ya Molt, nor having to worry about dying in the next Root Demon Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the White Dragon Abyss Master was just boasting a bit.</p><p></p><p>Now, she would never want to return to the Yin Shen realm even if she was beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>But... the Alchemical Sages of the Immortal Realm indeed have too many worries.</p><p></p><p>And these matters, if not handled carefully, even the Great Alchemical Sages could perish.</p><p></p><p>"Instead of thinking about returning to the Yin Shen, it's better to think about stepping into the third layer of the Yang Shen." Zi Yuan Patriarch said, "Maybe after this Ling Ya Molt is over and the construction of the Seven Heavens of the Immortal Realm is completed, we may have the opportunity to advance further."</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Heavens of the Immortal Realm... It's not that easy to complete the construction." White Dragon Abyss Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Zi Yuan Patriarch's gaze suddenly focused.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>In the distant horizon, endless Eternal Radiance gushed forth.</p><p></p><p>The scene was like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>But amidst all the Eternal Radiance, three emerald-green fruits seemed to fly out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing those three fruits, Zi Yuan Patriarch's eyes showed a moved expression.</p><p></p><p>White Dragon Abyss Master also widened her eyes, with a shocked expression: "There are actually fruits in the Eternal Radiance, these emerald-green fruits... must be Divine Fruits!"</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Radiance could even corrode the Alchemical Sages.</p><p></p><p>Yet, there were actually fruits bursting forth from the Eternal Radiance, they could not help but be amazed.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the two rushed towards the place where the three Divine Fruits were flying.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, one of them was flying towards their location.</p><p></p><p>Behind that Divine Fruit, there were several streams of light.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, other Yang Shen had also discovered this Divine Fruit and wanted to seize it.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Fruit was getting closer, and Zi Yuan Patriarch's face showed an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>"Let's join forces to seize the Divine Fruit, and then divide it later!" White Dragon Abyss Master transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Among those who came to chase this Divine Fruit, there were still a few notable strong ones.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Zi Yuan Patriarch agreed without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hold them off, you intercept the Divine Fruit!" White Dragon Abyss Master suggested.</p><p></p><p>Her figure also became tall and majestic at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A pure white dragon soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar resounded through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's claws and body spanned the sky.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying Alchemical Sage rules gushed forth, making the void tremble.</p><p></p><p>"White Dragon Abyss Master, how dare you!" An angry roar came.</p><p></p><p>This voice came from a Great Alchemical Sage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Divine Fruit about to fall into their hands, but someone was blocking them, how could he not be furious.</p><p></p><p>"This treasure is fated to be ours, flying towards us, surely you don't expect us not to take it, do you?" White Dragon Abyss Master smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zi Yuan Patriarch had gathered Alchemical Sage power, carefully reaching out to grab the Divine Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Shen who saw this all had a regretful expression in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>With two Great Alchemical Sages joining forces, except for that Venerable One, probably no one else could snatch this Divine Fruit.</p><p></p><p>That Great Alchemical Sage from the Bi Luo Tian also had a disappointed look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This Divine Fruit looked extraordinary, a peerless treasure.</p><p></p><p>He watched helplessly as Zi Yuan Patriarch snatched the Divine Fruit, but in the next moment, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>White Dragon Abyss Master's expression also suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Zi Yuan Patriarch, extremely worried in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zi Yuan Patriarch's Alchemical Sage power shattered the moment it touched the Divine Fruit, and a terrifying rule aura emanated and spread from within the Divine Fruit.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Zi Yuan Patriarch's Alchemical Sage power was shattered, and the aura on his body was dejected.</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes, with a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of fruit is this?"</p><p></p><p>Just by touching it, he was severely injured. How could he not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>If this were to be made into a weapon, specifically to deal with Great Alchemical Sages, he dared not imagine.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Venerable Ones could not easily injure him like this.</p><p></p><p>Yet, an ordinary fruit could do it, how could he not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, this fruit has endless fire aura, don't touch it!" Even though he was injured, Zi Yuan Patriarch transmitted a message to White Dragon Abyss Master.</p><p></p><p>White Dragon Abyss Master saw this and also became wary of the fruit, not daring to reach out again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that Divine Fruit... suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Shen saw this, some hesitated, while others did not hesitate at all and continued to chase after that Divine Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The one from the Bi Luo Tian also went after it.</p><p></p><p>"How are you?" White Dragon Abyss Master asked Zi Yuan Patriarch with concern.</p><p></p><p>"Not dead." Zi Yuan Patriarch said.</p><p></p><p>It's just that his current condition was not good.</p><p></p><p>The Alchemical Sage insights he had gained seemed to have been fused and shattered by that fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Your current situation is not good." White Dragon Abyss Master frowned, "What kind of fruit was that?"</p><p></p><p>A fruit that burst forth from the Eternal Radiance could actually injure a Great Alchemical Sage, how could she not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>"In that fruit, I felt endless fire aura, as if... no, that fire, is different from ordinary fire." Zi Yuan Patriarch frowned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Alchemical Sage from the Bi Luo Tian appeared, looking at Zi Yuan Patriarch with a wary expression: "Zi Yuan Patriarch, what exactly did you encounter after touching that fruit?"</p><p></p><p>That Divine Fruit was too fast, even he couldn't catch up.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I tell you? Immortal Treasure." Zi Yuan Patriarch did not answer.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if it weren't for you blocking me, that Divine Fruit would have long been in my possession, this account I have yet to settle with you!" Xian Zang said in an unfriendly tone, "Don't think that just because you have the backing of the Venerable Wan Ri, I'm afraid of you!"</p><p></p><p>Xian Zang was from the Bi Luo Tian.</p><p></p><p>In the Bi Luo Tian, besides him, there was another Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>So, facing Zi Yuan Patriarch, he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I have the backing of the Venerable Wan Ri, but what about you?" Zi Yuan Patriarch said lazily, with a smug expression.</p><p></p><p>"You... " Xian Zang was furious, "In the Immortal Palace, anything can happen, what if the Venerable Wan Ri offends the Ling Ya Molt and cannot get through it?"</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, Xian Zang still lacked confidence.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Zi Yuan Patriarch, his gaze fluctuating: "You'd better take a good look at your own injuries, don't die inside the Immortal Palace and become a strange spirit of the Unique Palace."</p><p></p><p>Xian Zang finished speaking and did not say anything else.</p><p></p><p>He came here also wanting to take the opportunity to ask about the Divine Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Since Zi Yuan Patriarch didn't say anything, he didn't bother asking further, and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"You, your mouth is still so stubborn, you should know that the Venerable Bi Luo is also in the Immortal Palace, if he gets angry because of this, your days won't be easy." White Dragon Abyss Master reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Zi Yuan Patriarch snorted coldly, "I won't tell anyone, not even the Bi Luo Tian."</p><p></p><p>The former Tai Huang Palace was once so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Gui Yu Tian submitted, and clashed with the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was even said that Gui Yu Tian later dared to attack the Black Sword because he had learned some information, and there was a Venerable One leaning towards the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Among the six heavens, the number of Venerable Ones was not more than two hands, just a few.</p><p></p><p>The one who leaned towards the Tai Huang Palace, the Venerable Bi Luo had a strong suspicion.</p><p></p><p>So, he didn't have a good attitude towards the Bi Luo Tian.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough... hot... burning..." Zi Yuan Patriarch said, blood flowing from the corners of his mouth, feeling as if his body was being burned by true fire.</p><p></p><p>White Dragon Abyss Master's eyes were filled with a worried expression: "Don't die inside the Immortal Palace."</p><p></p><p>She was truly worried.</p><p></p><p>First, the Immortal Palace was not safe, they had to constantly face the Eternal Radiance; second, the other Yang Shen could also be hidden enemies, after all, as long as enough Yang Shen died, the Ling Ya Molt would end; third, strange things were happening in the current Immortal Palace, not only was there the Eternal Radiance, but also the appearance of the Divine Fruit, who knows what else might happen next.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even if I die, there will be someone to see me off." Zi Yuan Patriarch coughed and said.</p><p></p><p>His injuries were very serious, but in terms of strength, he still had the power of a Great Alchemical Sage.</p><p></p><p>The probability of him surviving was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>The only concern was that this injury was too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a surprised voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, it's been a while, injured again?"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, a man in a blood-red robe appeared, stunningly handsome.</p><p></p><p>When Zi Yuan Patriarch saw this handsome man, he subconsciously rubbed his eyes like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>White Dragon Abyss Master was also shocked in her heart.</p><p></p><p>This... was the Venerable Wan Ri?</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here?" Zi Yuan Patriarch finally asked, still a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, White Dragon Abyss Master was extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>Because the Venerable Wan Ri suddenly appeared next to her, she hadn't sensed him in advance.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you were here, so I came to find you." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Immortal Palace!" Zi Yuan Patriarch was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Without the decree of the Unique Palace, the Immortal Palace could not be opened at will.</p><p></p><p>And just now, there was also no unusual phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>This meant that no new Yang Shen had been summoned into the Immortal Palace by the Ling Ya Molt.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is the Immortal Palace, so I came." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Patriarch didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>He could only guess that this time, the Ling Ya Molt had too many strange occurrences.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outsiders can all enter.</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't have come in, once you enter... you won't be able to get out." Ziyuan Zu felt grateful, but also a little wistful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had destroyed the Taihuang Palace, already offending the Unique Hall, yet he actually entered the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Unique Hall must be targeting him specifically. "Enough about that, old man, your injuries seem quite severe." Qi Yuan said, his hand falling on Ziyuan Zu's arm, a strange expression flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, three divine fruits were expelled from the Eternal Radiance... I intercepted one, but the result... I saw endless fire." Ziyuan Zu said with trepidation in his eyes as he recalled the event.</p><p></p><p>"Fire?" Qi Yuan felt something was a bit odd, "It's somewhat like the cosmic rules, but not quite."</p><p></p><p>Now, he was a Yin Deity, possessing the battle power of the Opening Heaven Realm and comprehending the cosmic rules.</p><p></p><p>Now, the injuries on Ziyuan Zu's body, the Profound Truths were shattered, being consumed by the flames.</p><p></p><p>That flame was just like the rule of the Primordial Flame in the cosmic rules.</p><p></p><p>But, it was completely different.</p><p></p><p>To make an inappropriate analogy, the Primordial Flame rule was real, while the flame on the divine fruit was illusory.</p><p></p><p>This was very strange.</p><p></p><p>Because, generally speaking, the Primordial Flame rule already represented all the flames in the world.</p><p></p><p>"This divine fruit is quite interesting." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, surging spiritual power swept over.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ziyuan Zu could only smile helplessly: "Don't waste your spiritual power on me."</p><p></p><p>This kind of Profound Truth shattering, even if the Venerable One intervened, it would be difficult to resolve.</p><p></p><p>But in the next breath, he widened his eyes, his eyes revealing an astonished expression: "The Profound Truth shattering has actually stopped?"</p><p></p><p>That flame had been continuously shattering his Profound Truths.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Qi Yuan's intervention, it actually made this burning stop, how could he not be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can only temporarily stop it from harming you, I'm still too weak!" Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Bai Long Yuanyuan Master really wanted to roll her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not weak." Ziyuan Zu couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"As a deity, I can't even achieve omniscience and omnipotence, how am I not weak?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"...Omniscience and omnipotence, are you trying to become the Dao Ancestor?" Ziyuan Zu couldn't help but give Qi Yuan a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>"You should go back to the Ziyuan Heavens to recuperate." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Go back to the Ziyuan Heavens?" Ziyuan Zu was also a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>How to go back? This Qi Yuan, with his eccentric personality, who knows when he'll change.</p><p></p><p>"You can go back anytime."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan said this, he drew a line in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an illusory Immortal Palace gate appeared.</p><p></p><p>And this gate opened at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Zu's eyes widened: "The Immortal Palace gate has actually opened?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Long Yuanyuan Master was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time she had encountered such a thing.</p><p></p><p>It was really beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>Next to them, Ziyuan Zu looked at Qi Yuan, really wanting to say to him.</p><p></p><p>Did you sell your ass to the Unique Hall? Of course, this sentence was what he originally wanted to say to the one in the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can leave anytime." Qi Yuan patted his hands, "I still have some things to do in this Immortal Palace, so I won't be leaving first."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a few streams of light flew from the sky above the Immortal Palace gate.</p><p></p><p>"Haha... the Immortal Palace gate has actually opened, I'm leaving!"</p><p></p><p>"It's too dangerous to stay in the Immortal Palace any longer!"</p><p></p><p>Many Yang Deities noticed the opening of the Immortal Palace gate.</p><p></p><p>They did not know that the Immortal Palace gate was opened by Qi Yuan, and seeing the Immortal Palace gate open, they hurriedly left this place of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Zu's lips moved, and he finally said, "I'll leave first, you be careful here, especially... the Eternal Radiance and the divine fruits, don't touch them at all."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, don't worry." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>More and more Yang Deities, with puzzlement and astonishment, all left the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the Immortal Palace, his eyes filled with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a rhombic crystal fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the source of the flowing light that Shen Wu and the others need?"</p><p></p><p>The flowing light outside had this rhombic crystal as its source, containing the aura of various primal divine arts.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing is very precious to the Zifeng cultivators, but almost useless to the Yang Deities.</p><p></p><p>"This Immortal Palace is indeed strange, the Eternal Radiance... is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>His hand touched the Eternal Radiance.</p><p></p><p>The pure and flawless radiance seemed to be dissolving the rules he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>[The Eternal Radiance, dissolving the rules, reshaping the rules.]</p><p></p><p>The information he saw with his eyes also represented what the Eternal Radiance was doing, which was to dissolve the rules of the world and reforge new rules.</p><p></p><p>"Even for a deity, one cannot achieve omniscience and omnipotence." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a low voice suddenly sounded: "Even for a deity, one cannot do as one pleases."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw a figure in the distance.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a phantom, with only a strand of inextinguishable true spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>That phantom should not be a being from the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"I am a disciple of the Five Mountain Wanderer, I rashly entered this strange world, thinking I could gain countless opportunities, but I didn't expect to perish here." The phantom said.</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Five Mountain Wanderer, he seemed quite proud.</p><p></p><p>"Five Mountain Wanderer?" Qi Yuan had never heard of this name before.</p><p></p><p>The phantom, even though he had already died, still had a look of pride on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Mountain Wanderer represents the five strongest mountains in the world.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm, He is the Mount Sumeru, the Dong Mountain, the Taiching Mountain, the Taihuang Mountain, and the Xulling Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In this Immortal Palace, He may be this mountain, and that one, as well as those few.</p><p></p><p>Of course... on the premise that my master has also entered this world."</p><p></p><p>The Five Mountain Wanderer, the so-called Five Mountains, did not specifically refer to certain five mountains.</p><p></p><p>But in different worlds, it represents the five "strongest" mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Your master seems quite formidable." Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>"If you can see my master, please tell him not to save me, not to come to this world!" The phantom said, then immediately smiled bitterly, "Forget it, you can't leave this world."</p><p></p><p>"Is this world very special?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm is indeed very special.</p><p></p><p>First, it is like a cage, and the Yang Deities cannot leave.</p><p></p><p>Second, the future of the Immortal Realm has been severed.</p><p></p><p>"Very special, after all... there are Heterodox Fruits here." Mentioning this, the phantom's eyes revealed a fanatical expression.</p><p></p><p>"In the world, there are Dao Fruits, and there are also Heterodox Fruits.</p><p></p><p>If the Heterodox Fruit is compatible with one's own, just one... can step into the Realm of Rules!"</p><p></p><p>Each Heterodox Fruit represents a cosmic rule.</p><p></p><p>If one's own Profound Truths match the rule carried by the Heterodox Fruit, by consuming it, it can make one step into the third layer of the Yang Deity.</p><p></p><p>This kind of shortcut method naturally attracts the envy of many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>The phantom man was tempted by the Heterodox Fruit, so he entered the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>But the result was that he fell into the fate of death.</p><p></p><p>"Heterodox Fruits?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>He remembered what Ziyuan Zu had said about the divine fruits.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that those were the Heterodox Fruits? The world actually has such fruits, which can be eaten to step into the Realm of Rules.</p><p></p><p>"How did the Heterodox Fruits appear?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The phantom shook his head: "I don't know either, perhaps... it's related to the Dao Lord of the fifth layer of the Yang Deities."</p><p></p><p>The phantom said, scanning the surroundings, his eyes filled with a desolate expression.</p><p></p><p>"Your world... is too special, really too special, I've never seen such a world before." The phantom mentioned this, his eyes filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>To these things, Qi Yuan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Was there an ordinary one among the worlds he was in? Each one was very special.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in fact, every world in this world is very special.</p><p></p><p>"If... you have a chance to go to the Five Mountain Alliance, see my master, please be sure to tell him, don't come to rescue me, and don't go to the Cosmic Mother River to fish me out." The phantom said.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he had been preserving a strand of true spirit that would not be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Once he was completely dead, his master, the Five Mountain Wanderer, might go to the Cosmic Mother River to fish out his true spirit and revive him.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that something terrifying would happen.</p><p></p><p>Now, by relying on the Immortal Palace, becoming an Immortal Palace spirit, he could barely cling to life.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, if I have the chance, I'll definitely convey it." Qi Yuan said, "But first you have to help me with something."</p><p></p><p>"Please say it."</p><p></p><p>"How much do you know about the Unique Hall and Linye?"</p><p></p><p>The phantom's eyes held a complex expression: "It is an unknowable thing."</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The implication behind the phantom's words was understood by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Unique Hall was the existence of the fourth layer of the Yang Deities.</p><p></p><p>"How much do you know about the fifth layer of the Yang Deities?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The phantom shook his head: "For this matter, it would be better for you to seek the answer from the Unique Hall."</p><p></p><p>"How do I find the Unique Hall?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the phantom spoke, his voice calm, with the aura of a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>"Defeat me, subdue me."</p><p></p><p>Slap! A slap landed on the phantom's face, and the phantom started spinning wildly. When Qi Yuan's foot stepped on him, the phantom finally stopped spinning.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can be considered to have subdued you, tell me... how do I enter the Unique Hall?" Qi Yuan asked, stepping on the phantom.</p><p></p><p>The phantom looked stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect this person, who looked refined and courteous, to be so abrupt and tyrannical in his actions.</p><p></p><p>Without any further ado, he just slapped him! "Non-Heterogeneous Spirit, non-contracted, cannot enter the Unique Hall." The phantom answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Can't see the Unique Hall? "Then make the Unique Hall come see me!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

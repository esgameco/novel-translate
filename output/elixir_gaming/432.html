        <h1>Chapter 432</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His entire form did not resemble a living being, but rather seemed to be the embodiment of some rule.</p><p></p><p>He stood outside the celestial curtain, his gaze deep and profound. </p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a figure in black robes appeared beside Ancestor Ziyuan.</p><p></p><p>This black-robed figure emanated a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a Zhili (one who has attained the Way).</p><p></p><p>Besides the ancestor, this person was the number one figure in Ziyuan Heaven, the only minor Zhili in Ziyuan Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Yang spirits are difficult to produce. In the Six Heavens, Zhilis are absolute powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>For clans like the Ziyuan, who originate from bloodlines, they are also constrained by bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>This branch had produced one great Zhili, but producing another Yang spirit would be very difficult. </p><p></p><p>In contrast, clans like the Moluo, who don't have great Zhilis, surpass Ziyuan Heaven in both the number of ordinary Yang spirits and Zhili Yang spirits.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, clans like the Ziyuan often seek out other bloodline branches to expand, incorporating those with talent.</p><p></p><p>Even gaining one more Yang spirit is hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor. Blood Robe has arrived in Ziyuan Heaven. May I ask if the Ancestor will grant an audience?" </p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan bowed respectfully, not daring to look directly at the Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, the Ancestor had no fixed form, but was rather an embodiment of the Way itself.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Ziyuan shook his head: "No."</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan was not surprised to hear this.</p><p></p><p>"What level of treatment shall he enjoy?" Ziyuan Tan inquired.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also trying to judge what level Blood Robe's bloodline talent was at.</p><p></p><p>"In Ziyuan Heaven... first below Yang spirit," Ancestor Ziyuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"As you command." Ziyuan Tan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>For the Ancestor to take notice, it must be at least a bloodline with Zhili potential.</p><p></p><p>Treatment higher than Ziyuan Daxue was to be expected.</p><p></p><p>"Here is a welcoming gift, pass it on to him."</p><p></p><p>With a flash of light, a black storage bag fell into Ziyuan Tan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan accepted the storage bag and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind. The current Ziyuan Heaven was somewhat lacking in succession, no wonder the Ancestor was so attentive.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ziyuan Heaven only had him as a Zhili, and not many Yang spirits.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other branches, it was quite lacking.</p><p></p><p>This also caused the Ancestor to lose face.</p><p></p><p>"Give him the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'. Tell him when he cultivates to the seventh level, he can come see me. I will grant him a small wish."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Ziyuan Tan nodded, not daring to speak loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, what level has Black Sword reached in the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Ancestor, the exact level is unknown, but according to recent rumors, at least... the ninth level."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ancestor Ziyuan's voice changed slightly: "The seventh level is too simple. Tell him to come see me when he reaches the ninth level!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p></p><p>This ancestor still liked to compare.</p><p></p><p>The ninth level of the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe might not be able to achieve it even after becoming a Yang spirit.</p><p></p><p>As for his daughter Ziyuan Daxue, she was approaching Yang spirit level but had only reached the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>The 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' was a very unique cultivation method. The speed of cultivation was only related to bloodline and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The correlation with bloodline was ninety-nine, and comprehension was one.</p><p></p><p>When Black Sword obtained the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture', he reached the third level within half a month, which was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>This was also the fastest record for cultivating the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'.</p><p></p><p>Even the Ancestor's master couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>His master, who was also Black Sword's master, was the... eldest of the Nine Elders of Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your Black Magic Abyss is black all over, gloomy and dull. It doesn't look like a place for orthodox cultivation," Qi Yuan said as he looked around.</p><p></p><p>Even the water flowing in the river was black.</p><p></p><p>The trees were also gray and dull, as if they were fake.</p><p></p><p>"How can you 'judge by appearances'? Aren't all people equal?" Ziyuan Daxue countered with Qi Yuan's own words.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, unable to retort.</p><p></p><p>Then he sighed and said, "I didn't expect the light of humanity to be in the Black Magic Abyss, in you.</p><p></p><p>This is true equality for all!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, there was a ripple in space, and a man in black robes appeared.</p><p></p><p>He also had a bull horn on his head, but it didn't make him look rough. Instead, he appeared quite scholarly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately tensed up.</p><p></p><p>There were many powerful figures in this Ziyuan Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had vaguely sensed two extremely powerful beings observing.</p><p></p><p>Now, another Zhili had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Ziyuan Daxue's face lit up with excitement: "Father, I've brought Blood Robe back!"</p><p></p><p>She waved her hand, as if seeking praise.</p><p></p><p>The roughness and free spirit of the horned sister disappeared, replaced by a little girl seeking approval.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan revealed a gentle smile: "What gift do you want this time?"</p><p></p><p>As a Zhili-level Yang spirit, how could he not see through his daughter's little tricks? He was simply willing to indulge her.</p><p></p><p>"I want a Black Cloud Blood Rider!" Ziyuan Daxue said excitedly. "Ever since I was little, I've always wanted my own Black Cloud Blood Rider to roam the realms. It's so cool!"</p><p></p><p>On the way here, Qi Yuan had heard Ziyuan Daxue mention the Black Cloud Blood Rider more than once.</p><p></p><p>It was a kind of... vehicle.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Translated to Blue Star terms, well, a motorcycle.</p><p></p><p>Very fitting for the horned sister's stereotype in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Black Cloud Blood Rider was not as simple as just a motorcycle. It also had some space-jumping functions.</p><p></p><p>Random ones.</p><p></p><p>Once activated, you wouldn't know where you'd end up.</p><p></p><p>So, it was extremely thrilling.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Six Heavens were vast and boundless. Even Yang spirits couldn't fully explore them.</p><p></p><p>"Your cousin died a few years ago when he rode a Black Cloud Blood Rider into a strange land."</p><p></p><p>"You still want a Black Cloud Blood Rider?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the horned sister's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>She felt some warmth in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I shouldn't be so willful."</p><p></p><p>"What willfulness? I think your cousin's Black Cloud Blood Rider was pretty good. Do you want it?"</p><p></p><p>The horned sister blinked: "..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, she took a deep breath: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"But remember the lesson from your cousin!" Ziyuan Tan added.</p><p></p><p>"I know, I won't ride recklessly!" </p><p></p><p>"No, I mean, don't carelessly bring people along.</p><p></p><p>Your cousin, that guy, took someone else's newlywed dao companion out to play, just the two of them.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the other person's dao companion contacted her through a communication jade slip. That woman was fierce, she swore to the heavens that if she was out playing with another man, she'd be struck dead by lightning.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, your cousin was taking her through a lightning domain. Lightning struck the Black Cloud Blood Rider, causing a malfunction, and they fell into a strange land... and died."</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue blinked, not expecting her cousin's death to be so dramatic.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I've learned the lesson. Don't worry, I won't mess around with married wild men on the Black Cloud Blood Rider."</p><p></p><p>"What I mean is, if you do bring someone, make sure to seal their mouth so they don't talk nonsense." Ziyuan Tan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, standing to the side, was speechless hearing this.</p><p></p><p>How did it seem like everyone in this Ziyuan clan was a bit crazy?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there was something wrong with their bloodline?</p><p></p><p>He speculated wildly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ziyuan Tan turned his gaze to Qi Yuan: "Blood Robe, are you intere-"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you interested in marrying into the Ziyuan clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Not interested!" Qi Yuan directly refused.</p><p></p><p>He had already determined that there was a big problem with the bloodline of this Ziyuan clan. Otherwise... why would someone ask about marrying in as soon as they met? Shouldn't they first ask if he had a car and house, or about his salary? Oh no, that's not right, for a son-in-law... they don't need to ask these things.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' that the Ancestor told me to give you. When you cultivate to the ninth level, you can go see the Ancestor and make a small request," Ziyuan Tan said simply and directly, handing the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture', somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>"Is this an immortal cultivation method?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes and no. This is a special technique unique to us bloodline cultivators," Ziyuan Tan knew Qi Yuan came from the Second Heaven and wasn't very familiar with the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He continued: "In our Black Magic Abyss, bloodlines are the most powerful. The stronger the bloodline, the stronger the talent, potential, and future achievements. The 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' can allow our bloodlines to evolve and leap forward, gaining various special abilities and reaching perfection. The 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' has fifteen levels in total. Whoever can practice to the highest level, even with the worst bloodline, can reach the Realm of Ultimate Principle just by sleeping without cultivating, given enough time."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ziyuan Tan's face was full of pride and arrogance. </p><p></p><p>However, such a case had never occurred in the Black Magic Abyss before. Generally, those with stronger bloodlines could cultivate the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' faster.</p><p></p><p>"How many years is this 'sleeping time'?" Qi Yuan asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean if he fully cultivates this and then finds a game world to lie down in, when he comes out, he'll be at the Realm of Ultimate Principle Yang Spirit?</p><p></p><p>"Only a hundred thousand years!" Ziyuan Tan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"...Isn't the word 'only' used a bit inappropriately here?" Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand years and they say 'only'.</p><p></p><p>With that much time, it would be better to stay in the Gate of Ultimate Principle and comprehend the ultimate principles well.</p><p></p><p>After a million years, when he came out, he would be invincible directly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to playing games, these seemed somewhat unworthy.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan was slightly stunned, then said earnestly: "Blood Robe, your bloodline is very strong, but don't aim too high. How could the Realm of Ultimate Principle be so easy to achieve? However... if you really cultivate the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' to completion, with your talent, you could probably enter the Yang Spirit realm in a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Ziyuan Tan seemed somewhat envious.</p><p></p><p>The creatures of the Black Magic Abyss were a race that emerged from a magical treasure of creation. Their cultivation system was somewhat different from that of the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the cultivators of the Sixth Heaven, the cultivators of the Black Magic Abyss becoming Yang Spirits could be considered... a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators needed to refine their spiritual power, strengthen their souls, and comprehend the Great Dao. Any one of these could take tens of thousands of years to gain even a slight comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline cultivators of the Black Magic Abyss were different, they just needed to strengthen their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Bloodline was everything.</p><p></p><p>Bloodline could bring everything.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe's bloodline was obviously much stronger than his, otherwise the Ancestor wouldn't have been moved.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan's bloodline was actually very ordinary, even inferior to his daughter Ziyuan Daxue's.</p><p></p><p>But he had high悟性 and was diligent enough to become the first Ultimate Principle cultivator under the Ancestor of Ziyuan Heaven.</p><p></p><p>He was quite envious of bloodline cultivators like Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It sounds like the cost-performance ratio is very low, but I have time to practice it," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>At the ninth level, he could make a request to the Ancestor of Ziyuan Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This was also a decent reward.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan's mouth twitched, not responding to Qi Yuan's words: "This is what the Ancestor told me to pass on to you. Try not to mention this matter... otherwise it may cause others to be jealous."</p><p></p><p>He handed the storage bag to Qi Yuan, not forgetting to instruct him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ancestor giving special treatment would attract the attention of some ill-intentioned people if word got out.</p><p></p><p>"Not being envied is mediocrity," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Anyway... it was just for fun.</p><p></p><p>As long as it didn't harm his own interests, he could do as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan smiled: "As you wish."</p><p></p><p>He was just mentioning it casually.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, in this situation, the Ancestor giving a meeting gift was not precious in itself, what was precious was the Ancestor's attitude.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't envious of what the Ancestor gave to Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>"Daxue, take Blood Robe to his cave dwelling to cultivate well."</p><p></p><p>After Ziyuan Tan finished speaking, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue looked at Qi Yuan enviously: "Sister has only received one gift from the Ancestor in her life, and you get one as soon as you arrive. Sigh, people comparing themselves to others..."</p><p></p><p>"For your information, you're not people," Qi Yuan pointed out Ziyuan Daxue's mistake.</p><p></p><p>With horns on her head, how dare she impersonate humans.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what meeting gift the Ancestor gave you?" Ziyuan Daxue was very curious, "I wonder how it compares in value to the Black Cloud Blood Cavalry?"</p><p></p><p>A gift from the Ancestor would certainly be valuable, otherwise wouldn't it be looked down upon? Of course, it wouldn't be too precious either.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Ziyuan Tan was given a mythical level pet beast.</p><p></p><p>This made her stand out when she was young.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to my cave dwelling first before talking about that. I did say the dwelling had to be nice, otherwise... I'm not willing," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"You... sigh, taking advantage and still acting smug. Do you know... the Ancestor has designated you as... the head of the young generation of Demon Children?" Ziyuan Daxue said enviously.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Child?" Qi Yuan didn't like this title very much.</p><p></p><p>He was clearly lawful good.</p><p></p><p>"Our Ziyuan Heaven originally had four Demon Children, with you it's five. You came and immediately became the head of the Demon Children, I guess the others won't be convinced," Ziyuan Daxue said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted and laughed as they came to a high mountain in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was desolate without any buildings, just rubble everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue looked ahead with her hands on her hips: "See that? That's your cave dwelling... isn't it cool!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over, his expression slightly stunned: "This cave dwelling... why is it so strange?"</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a huge iron sphere.</p><p></p><p>Why use the word huge to describe it? Because it really was huge, even bigger than the Great Shang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly the world of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But the sphere was made of iron, giving a sense of science fiction and cyberpunk.</p><p></p><p>"What's strange about it? This cave dwelling is called the Origin Star, built to emulate the stars that reflect all the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a crisp voice rang out, and two young women, one big and one small, appeared.</p><p></p><p>One of them had pink horns on her head tied with a butterfly knot, bangs, a cute appearance, wearing a sky-blue long dress, and was very petite.</p><p></p><p>The other had no horns, was tall and slender with a cold expression, wearing a fitted dark green dress with the chest area half hollow, exposing smooth white flesh that dazzled the eyes. She had a black silk ribbon tied around her smooth thigh. She was the one speaking.</p><p></p><p>"These are two Demon Children. The cute one is called Ziyuan Xiaolu, and the sexy one is called An Xunlu," Ziyuan Daxue introduced.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Xiaolu blinked, glanced at Qi Yuan, then lowered her head, looking rather shy.</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu scanned Qi Yuan, her gaze carrying a scrutinizing flavor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attention also fell on An Xunlu.</p><p></p><p>Not because of her revealing clothes, but because her name was wrong.</p><p></p><p>It should be An Xinku (meaning "safe underwear").</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 529</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But being loved by the world is not a good thing, it may bring about one's downfall."</p><p></p><p>"When one reaches the peak of divinity... they will all fall. It seems I am still not strong enough."</p><p></p><p>On the ship, Qi Yuan was basking in the sun, continuing to preach to the sea fish.</p><p></p><p>After achieving the unity of heaven and man, he became more in tune with this world, and could utilize the power of heaven and earth even more.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could truly be considered unrivaled beneath the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>He preached to the sea fish, sometimes contemplating his own self, and sometimes pondering the matter of forging artifacts.</p><p></p><p>The performance of the blind artifact master would be arriving in a few months.</p><p></p><p>He had to hurry and improve his artifact forging abilities, otherwise, after going blind, it would be difficult to make progress in artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>In this world, after going blind, one could not release their spiritual sense, and the world they see would be pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to improve the progress of artifact forging would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, the blind artifact master still became a heavenly-grade artifact master.</p><p></p><p>It just goes to show how extraordinary his talent was!</p><p></p><p>"It seems my bloodline entering this game has been doing quite well."</p><p></p><p>"Except for the useless son-in-law Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"No, he seems to be the only one who has a wife."</p><p></p><p>"According to some people's sayings, having a wife is also a kind of ability."</p><p></p><p>After all, when people curse others, they often like to say that you can't get a wife, no one wants you as a man.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, are you an artifact master?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a young girl with two braids, Zhong Ling Yuqiu, looked at Qi Yuan and blinked her big eyes.</p><p></p><p>The girl didn't seem tall, less than 1.6 meters, a petite little bomb, with a doll-like face, looking very young, as if she had not yet reached the age of maturity.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, judging from your age, I estimate I'm only about a year older than you, how can I be an uncle?" Qi Yuan looked at the girl and couldn't help but refute.</p><p></p><p>He was in the prime of his life, how could he be an uncle? Liu Chuchun smiled mischievously, her voice sweet and soft: "I'm only twelve years old."</p><p></p><p>Her face still had baby fat, making her look very young, with the unique youthful innocence of a young girl.</p><p></p><p>"You're clearly seventeen years old." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun's face flashed with a look of astonishment: "You know me?"</p><p></p><p>"Old woman, stop pretending to be young!" Qi Yuan was not at all polite.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party had called him an uncle, calling her an old woman shouldn't be a problem, right? "Hey, what did the old woman do wrong? Is there a problem with pretending to be young?" Liu Chuchun said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and paused, he felt like he was facing a stubborn sister.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, everyone is equal, I shouldn't have stigmatized old women!" Qi Yuan reflected on himself, his attitude very sincere.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun was stunned for a moment, not expecting the other party to kneel so quickly, and then a look of admiration appeared in her eyes: "You're a pretty good person."</p><p></p><p>She could see that Qi Yuan's apology was sincere, coming from the heart.</p><p></p><p>"I've always been law-abiding and kind." Qi Yuan said proudly, "When I see ants on the ground, I can't bear to step on them, and when I see fish, I can't bear to kill them."</p><p></p><p>"You..." Liu Chuchun believed him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words were just too sincere, and his expression couldn't be faked.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Chen Kang didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to say, young master, you may not step on ants, but you've killed plenty of mosquitoes and flies.</p><p></p><p>Not killing fish? That's because the meals are all made by the old servant.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun looked at Qi Yuan, and she couldn't help but say, "Kindness is a good quality, but being too kind is not good."</p><p></p><p>She felt that Qi Yuan's personality needed to be adjusted, otherwise being too kind would make him an easy target.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm just kind, not to the extent of being a saint." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"What is a saint?" Liu Chuchun didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"A saint is..." Qi Yuan explained the definition of a saint from the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun raised her eyebrows: "The saint should indeed die, but... how can you use the words 'saint' and 'mother' to describe it? This is a desecration of the 'saint'."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened, stunned: "Speaking of which, this is not my doing."</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to do whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, in his speech, there would always be restrictions everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's really not your fault, you're just... you look very upright, you're a good person, it's just that sometimes you're too good, which is not good in this world, the ones being bullied are the kind people." Liu Chuchun rambled on.</p><p></p><p>She could see that Qi Yuan had a good temperament, and felt that he was a material that could be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>This kind of person, she admired, and with a little guidance, they could become like-minded companions.</p><p></p><p>The ship sailed across the vast sea.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun and Qi Yuan chatted about everything, and it couldn't be denied that they had a sense of kindred spirits.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they chatted for an hour, and Liu Chuchun was still reluctant to part.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Qi Yuan, you're just too kind-hearted, sometimes you need to be a little tougher, otherwise people will take advantage of your kindness!" Liu Chuchun sighed.</p><p></p><p>In this world, perhaps due to Qi Yuan's bloodline entering, there would often appear some familiar phrases that Qi Yuan was familiar with, which was not unexpected.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, I'm just too kind, that's why I'm bullied everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, I've always obeyed the law, but the result is... endless oppression from my enemies!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect is so bullying! The Hall of Light has no sense of honor! The Tai Huang Palace is full of evil! "Could it be that I'm not obeying the law anymore?" Qi Yuan sighed and felt wronged.</p><p></p><p>He had a sense that the world owed him.</p><p></p><p>"Obeying the law... is the right thing to do." Liu Chuchun's gaze was complex, "It's just that in this world, the law... is decided by those officials, and even... these vermin openly say that talking about the royal law is laughable!" Liu Chuchun gritted her silver teeth, her face full of anger, "If only... if only..."</p><p></p><p>In the exchange between Qi Yuan and Liu Chuchun, Qi Yuan had already learned that Liu Chuchun could be considered an idealist, and also had a bit of a rebellious spirit.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun lowered her voice, and finally said the latter half of the sentence: "If only the God of Judgment was here, how could there be such unfair things in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Not mother?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan silently supplemented a sentence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As Liu Chuchun spoke, she kept a close eye on Qi Yuan's expression.</p><p></p><p>Because the ship they were on was heading towards the Rakshasa Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The God of Judgment in the Rakshasa Kingdom is a taboo.</p><p></p><p>The kind that gets you a big reward for reporting.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan's expression remained calm and not panicked, Liu Chuchun knew she had found the right person.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Qi Yuan, are you also dissatisfied with the state of the world?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "I wouldn't say I'm dissatisfied, it's just that the atmosphere is too bad, sigh, some people don't work hard enough, yet they occupy high positions, really..."</p><p></p><p>He was talking about the white moonlight, those who don't cultivate diligently, how could he give them experience points? Liu Chuchun's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>She heard that Qi Yuan was dissatisfied with the Rakshasa Kingdom, where all the court officials were mere figurehead, wearing official robes without any real ability.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Qi Yuan, do you want to change this kind of world?"</p><p></p><p>"I want, I want to make them work hard!" Qi Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>He wished he could take out a whip and whip those old men whose blood flows with thorns, making them cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun heard this, her gaze determined: "Big brother Qi Yuan, since you have this heart, it seems we are on the same path. Do you want to join us and change this world together... but, joining us, you may be hunted down, arrested, and face great danger, I have to tell you this in advance!"</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to miss out on such a kindred spirit.</p><p></p><p>"What are you?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"We believe in justice and..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>My divine lord, only the divine lord can dispel the darkness and restore a bit of clarity to this world. </p><p></p><p>"We originally wanted to call it 'Judgment', but that might attract too much attention from the imperial court, so we call it 'Inquisition'..."</p><p></p><p>Okay.</p><p></p><p>The organization's name is Inquisition, which still sounds quite conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Is this an organization founded by your own fans?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the damned imperial court has been oppressing us too much. Even if we call ourselves Inquisition, they still keep hunting us down everywhere!" Liu Chun-tung said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Adjudication Council?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>As a divine lord, Qi Yuan naturally knew that the Adjudication Council was his true fan club, the official one. </p><p></p><p>To play the role of the divine lord well, he must have contact with the Adjudication Council.</p><p></p><p>"I know..." Liu Chun-tung said longingly, "Our goal with Inquisition is to become an organization like the Adjudication Council, but... the Adjudication Council is riddled with problems, and many have secretly allied with the imperial house, so you must never trust anyone from the Adjudication Council."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chun-tung said this warily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan gained more understanding of the Adjudication Council.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not really care about these matters.</p><p></p><p>"Do you kill evil spirits?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This Liu Chun-tung seems idealistic, yet naive, and is living quite well.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the power of this Inquisition is also quite substantial, or Liu Chun-tung has strong backing.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, after knowing each other for just a couple of hours, she would not have revealed such life-threatening information, yet she is still living so well - it must be due to her background or good luck.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we specialize in killing evil people and malicious spirits!" Liu Chun-tung said earnestly, "Don't be fooled by our small size, our members may be average in strength, but... we have slain heavenly-level evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chun-tung said this with pride.</p><p></p><p>She looked around and lowered her voice, "I once saved an injured divine-level armored soldier, helping him evade his enemies. He has been grateful ever since and often helps me."</p><p></p><p>I see, so that's the reason.</p><p></p><p>So she has a divine-level armored soldier backing her up?</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's gaze was complex. "Is it really because you saved that person that he is helping you?"</p><p></p><p>"I can join your group, but I want to kill evil spirits, I want to... reduce the injustices and wrongs in this world!" Qi Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to play the role of the divine lord.</p><p></p><p>To improve his performance, he needed to "act righteously" and "stand up for justice".</p><p></p><p>And to uncover the hidden manipulators.</p><p></p><p>Improving his divine lord persona would greatly benefit Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Liu Chun-tung was excited, she had recruited another reliable person to join Inquisition.</p><p></p><p>That night, Liu Chun-tung returned to her room. </p><p></p><p>Her room was not large, and there was a faint breathing sound inside, along with a faint scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Qian-ran, I just met someone outside, he's a good person, and I've recruited him to join our Inquisition!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chun-tung's face was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the bed was a woman dressed as a Taoist priestess. </p><p></p><p>However, her injuries were severe, and she could not walk.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were there, he would have recognized this Taoist priestess-dressed woman, as he had seen her before at the Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qian-ran had a resigned expression on her face: "One cannot be too careful, I'm afraid you'll be tricked or seduced one day!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister Qian-ran, don't say such things, all the people in Inquisition are my friends!" Liu Chun-tung pouted, her eyes wide like an aggrieved little girl.</p><p></p><p>Qian-ran did not argue further.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll have to trouble you to take me to the Liu Mansion, my injuries are severe."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Red Cloud Stronghold, Qian-ran encountered a powerful evil spirit, and although she tried to cultivate herself, she was no match for that evil spirit and sustained heavy injuries, even damaging her innate magical artifact.</p><p></p><p>Now, to heal her injuries without leaving any hidden dangers, she needed... a divine-level armored soldier to intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Qian-ran, don't worry, I'll ask Grandpa to help!" Liu Chun-tung said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Although she and her grandfather had been on bad terms lately, when it came to Qian-ran's life-threatening situation, she was willing to swallow her pride and beg for help.</p><p></p><p>Qian-ran's face showed gratitude, and as she looked at this sister, she suddenly thought of the man she had encountered at the Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"Chun-tung, do you think... the Adjudication God is still alive?" Qian-ran asked.</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Liu Chun-tung's expression became downcast: "The Adjudication God's divine body has been completely destroyed, the statues all demolished, how could he still be alive?</p><p></p><p>If the Adjudication God were still around, how could the Luo Sha Kingdom be in such a chaotic state now? Facing the invading imperial army, they've been retreating and even had to cede land as compensation!"</p><p></p><p>Her sadness was mixed with resentment towards the Luo Sha royal house.</p><p></p><p>"What if he is alive?" Qian-ran asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"The Luo Sha Kingdom will see the light!" Liu Chun-tung said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Qian-ran thought of something, but did not continue the conversation.</p><p></p><p>If the Adjudication God has returned, is he still the same Adjudication God that Liu Chun-tung believes in and worships? </p><p></p><p>After all, the Adjudication God did not have its own consciousness, it represented absolute fairness and justice.</p><p></p><p>Ten days passed.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chun-tung came to chat with Qi Yuan every day, discussing topics like fairness, justice, kindness and harmony.</p><p></p><p>The more Liu Chun-tung looked at Qi Yuan, the more she liked him.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Qi, with you joining us, I'm sure Inquisition has a bright future ahead!" </p><p></p><p>Liu Chun-tung looked out at the vast sea, filled with hope for the future.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll definitely encourage those lazy people to work harder!" Qi Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to persuade those "white moonlights" to not waste their lives.</p><p></p><p>"If everyone was like Big Brother Qi, this world would be so wonderful." Liu Chun-tung mused, "After all, Big Brother Qi even refuses to step on ants, and after catching a fish, he would apologize to it."</p><p></p><p>In the past period of time interacting with Qi Yuan, she discovered that his kindness was not just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Seeing ants, he would truly avoid stepping on them or go around them.</p><p></p><p>After catching a fish, he would release it back into the water.</p><p></p><p>He never cooked fish, because he couldn't bear to see them die painfully.</p><p></p><p>Such a person, a truly great and kind person! Too kind!</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, we'll probably reach the shore, Big Brother Qi. I have some matters to attend to and can't accompany you to Inquisition this time. Someone will come to guide you to the Inquisition branch!" Liu Chun-tung said.</p><p></p><p>She needed to take Qian-ran back to the Liu Mansion to treat her injuries.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, she would have directly led Qi Yuan into Inquisition, and they would have gone on righteous adventures together.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, go take care of your own affairs." Qi Yuan was completely unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use the Inquisition's channels to find information about evil spirits, and better play the role of the divine lord.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Liu Chun-tung nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>She felt that when she returned to Inquisition, she should take Qi Yuan to experience some human wickedness.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, being too indecisive and kind-hearted was not good.</p><p></p><p>Too much kindness could lead to being taken advantage of.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention killing evil people, at the very least, she should kill some rats!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Piercing through the clouds, it shone brilliantly with the stars.</p><p></p><p>This scene was so strange, yet so dazzlingly brilliant, it could not help but attract the attention of all the cultivators in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless land, an old man sat on a turtle shell, his starlight-like aura so intense that it was difficult to look at directly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked at the location of Ziyuan Tian and his beard trembled: "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>In the Hall of Highest Principles, the Second Patriarch opened his eyes, his gaze seemingly penetrating through countless spaces. Even the eternally ice-cold face revealed an expression of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Four thousand Yang God Cultivations in one body? No, he has cultivated the Dao of four thousand Yang Gods? That's not right either!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shock, there was a strong sense of doubt.</p><p></p><p>In the Bixuo Heavens, the old woman's gourd on her head opened wide, devouring the endless starlight. Suddenly, her hand trembled: "Has the Immortal Dao will fallen asleep?"</p><p></p><p>The scene in the distant direction had exceeded her imagination and understanding.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihuang Palace, the True Origin Venerable's face revealed a perplexed expression.</p><p></p><p>"This... what is this?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Yang Gods were somewhat speechless. If not for their identities and cultivation, they would have surely said to the True Origin Venerable, "Didn't you just inspect the Myriad Heavens? Shouldn't you be the one asking us?"</p><p></p><p>"The position of Ziyuan Tian, it shouldn't be Ziyuan Ancestor. Could it be..." The Taiyang Venerable narrowed his eyes, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the True Origin Venerable shifted his gaze to the Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his eyes narrowed: "This is the Yang God of the Moruo Clan, and... the Shiri Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Gods in the Taihuang Palace heard this and their expressions immediately tensed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they roughly understood.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Shiri Venerable had secretly gone to the Moruo Clan and secretly brought them under his control? Wait a moment... Moye, could it be that...</p><p></p><p>These Yang Gods suddenly had a terrifying idea.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Moye was actually the Shiri Venerable in disguise?</p><p></p><p>"No, why are there more than four thousand Yang Gods? Except for the First Heaven and Sixth Heaven, this number of Yang Gods is greater than the other Heavens!" exclaimed a Yang God Venerable, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang God Venerables who heard this were also perplexed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Ziyuan Heavens, the eyes of countless Yang God Venerables pierced through the space and fell on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's black robe was now full of holes, and starlight kept leaking out, unable to be plugged.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Qi Yuan thought that as long as he used the black robe to cover it, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that every divine infant was emitting light, and not only that, the Moruo Clan in the Underworld was also emitting light.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bingdao looked at Qi Yuan with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Anhuolu, Ziyuan Daxue, and Ziyuan Xiaolu, among others, also opened their eyes at this moment. Just now, they had been like players in a game who had been thrown a flashbang, and now their gaze was drawn to the endless brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Shock, surprise, bewilderment, dumbfoundedness, confusion... various emotions appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>As for the faint starlight on Bingdao's body, it had long been merged into the vast sea of starlight.</p><p></p><p>"Why am I glowing? Am I a hidden Yang God?" Ziyuan Daxue said in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation was low, and she was not yet a Yang God, so she could not perceive that the source of this light was from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Anhuolu stared intently at Qi Yuan and gritted her teeth: "Didn't you hear Bingdao say that the black robe has thousands of light bulbs hidden inside?"</p><p></p><p>Light bulbs, a technological creation, were also present in the Heimoyu, but they were not common, mostly used by mortals or as some cultivators' trinkets.</p><p></p><p>"Light bulbs?"</p><p></p><p>The gazes of these young cultivators involuntarily fell on Qi Yuan, and they were momentarily dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, my clothes are leaking light, don't look, or I'll be exposed!" Qi Yuan quickly covered the holes in the black robe, but the light could not be contained and kept gushing out.</p><p></p><p>He was not actually exposed, but was leaking light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the young cultivators suddenly spoke up: "No, quickly look at the Diagram of the Myriad Heavens, this is... a Yang God Anomaly!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present all looked towards the Diagram of the Myriad Heavens, and their expressions immediately turned to shock.</p><p></p><p>Their gaze then shifted to Qi Yuan, their expressions varying, with the most common being shock, wariness, and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue rubbed her head, her expression twisted: "I feel like my brain is not enough. The Blood Robe... what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe, have you already stepped into the Yang God realm? No, Yang Gods only have one light, why do you have so many lights?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I seeing things, or am I not fully awake?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the gazes of many Yang Gods in the Ziyuan Heavens fell on Qi Yuan, filled with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor was also shocked and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Today's events had exceeded his expectations, or rather, his imagination.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yuehua Venerable suddenly spoke, her expression somewhat complex: "Qi Yuan, I never expected you to be hiding so deeply. Not only have you mastered two supreme Principles, but you also have so many stars on your body, truly strange."</p><p></p><p>After inspecting the Myriad Heavens, the identity of the Blood Robe would certainly be exposed.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace must have already known Qi Yuan's identity based on the starlight projection in the Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>So now, she no longer needed to hide for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What, two supreme Principles, is he... Moye?" The surrounding Yang God Venerables heard this and were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even Ziyuan Ancestor was stunned, but then his expression turned to joyous.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the one with the most joy on her face was Ziyuan Xiaolu. She looked at Anhuolu and excitedly said, "See, the Blood Robe Senior has mastered two supreme Principles, even more than Black Sword Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue looked at Qi Yuan, and the doubts in her heart were also resolved at this moment.</p><p></p><p>No wonder, that's why she received the Blood Robe from Moye Venerable back then; no wonder the Blood Robe was able to see Yuehua Venerable.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that Moye... was one of the identities the Blood Robe was disguising as.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her expression became a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Moye had mastered the supreme Principle at the Wall of Principles, she had mocked Moye's ugly appearance quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean the Blood Robe had heard it all?</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... I've only mastered two supreme Principles, it's nothing special, very ordinary." Qi Yuan humbly replied.</p><p></p><p>After all, having only mastered two out of four supreme Principles was not that impressive.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the cultivators and Yang Gods present were somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>If they were living on the Blue Star, they would surely say that the Blood Robe was being overly modest.</p><p></p><p>Only Ziyuan Xiaolu was excited and thrilled, looking at Anhuolu: "See, the Blood Robe Senior is amazing and humble, far surpassing Black Sword Senior, truly the number one young cultivator in the Heimoyu!"</p><p></p><p>The Yang Gods in the Ziyuan Heavens, their waves of emotions had not yet settled.</p><p></p><p>Truly, the news they received today was too explosive.</p><p></p><p>"However, the thousands of stars on your body... are truly strange. Could it be that you have thousands of Yang Gods hidden within you?" Yuehua Venerable hesitated.</p><p></p><p>This was also the bewilderment of all the Yang Gods and cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>If it was said that a Yang God had another Yang God hidden within their body, that would still be understandable.</p><p></p><p>But to have thousands of Yang Gods hidden, what kind of situation was that?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as they stared at Qi Yuan, they did not sense the presence of any other Yang Gods within him.</p><p></p><p>Even Ziyuan Ancestor and Yuehua Venerable, with their mastery of the Principles, could not perceive them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jinli gripped Qi Yuan's hand even tighter, her small hand a bit cold, as if she was worried about something.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jinli's beautiful countenance and gave her a reassuring gaze, then continued: "Sigh, I actually don't have any Yang Gods within me, if there are any, they would only be divine infants.</p><p></p><p>However, I do have quite a few divine infants, and they... can even cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Towards those who were good to him, Qi Yuan was naturally sincere.</p><p></p><p>Having a lot of divine infants was not a disease, there was no need to hide it.</p><p></p><p>"Divine infants?"</p><p></p><p>"They can cultivate by themselves?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they have cultivated to the Yang God realm?"</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The Yang God Venerables in the Ziyuan Heavens were puzzled, feeling like their brains were not enough.</p><p></p><p>Even Ziyuan Ancestor, who had always believed in Qi Yuan, also had a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>"You mean... the starlight on your body is emitted by your divine infants?" Ziyuan Ancestor asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>This made sense?</p><p></p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>With his words, all the starlight on his body dissipated at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The Ziyuan Heavens returned to its original state.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the inspection of the Myriad Heavens had ended.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes fell on Qi Yuan, and they were temporarily unable to accept his explanation.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was too outrageous, too unreasonable. Having one more divine infant was already unusual, but having thousands of them, and them being able to cultivate, where had such a thing happened?</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor looked at Qi Yuan and gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>After all, such a major event in the Ziyuan Heavens could affect the situation in the Heimoyu, and even influence the Lingyao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, Blood Robe, the information about you mastering two supreme Principles has certainly reached the Taihuang Palace. You have not yet fully grown, so you must be cautious!" Ziyuan Ancestor said with joy and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>He was joyful that the Blood Robe's growth had exceeded his expectations. Not only had he secretly entered the Yang God realm, but he also possessed two supreme Principles, not to mention those dazzling four thousand stars of light, any one of which could suppress... the First Heaven!</p><p></p><p>His trepidation was that the Blood Robe had revealed such extraordinary talent and potential, naturally attracting the attention of various major powers, especially the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Would the Taihuang Palace just watch him grow?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Old man, don't worry, I have a super great plan."</p><p></p><p>A flash of determination appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew that once his strength was exposed, he would face what was to come.</p><p></p><p>He had already made plans for it.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, hearing the word "plan", Ziyuan Xiaolu blinked her eyes, her face full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Bingdao sighed mournfully.</p><p></p><p>Originally, with so many young cultivators present, and coinciding with the inspection of the Myriad Heavens, this was the best opportunity for him to make a name for himself.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his starlight was too dim, completely overshadowed by the Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>Now, everyone's gaze was focused on the Blood Robe, and no one paid attention to him.</p><p></p><p>"Your Ziyuan Heavens has produced a true genius."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cheerful voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>A man in a gray robe appeared, staring intently at Qi Yuan, his gaze burning hot.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than the Third Elder of the Heimoyu.</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder appeared, and the other Heimoyu Elders also emerged, among them... Black Sword also appeared.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword looked at Qi Yuan with a calm expression, seemingly not too stirred.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these great Principle Venerables, Ziyuan Ancestor was in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Third Elder, didn't I tell you before that the Blood Robe's talent is not inferior to anyone's?" Ziyuan Ancestor said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder and the other great Principle Venerables looked at Qi Yuan with complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Yuehua Palace was willing to marry the Moon Maiden to the Blood Robe, with this kind of talent, even I would be willing to marry him!" an old woman said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the previously silent Black Sword spoke: "From today onwards, in the Heimoyu, the Blood Robe shall enjoy... the treatment of a great Principle Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Last time, during the battle between the Human Emperor's Palace Envoy and the Banner Master in the Heimoyu, many Yang Gods of the Heimoyu had a meeting, and several things were decided.</p><p></p><p>First, the Heimoyu would be closed; second, Black Sword would temporarily replace the Abyss Master and lead the Heimoyu.</p><p></p><p>Now that Black Sword had spoken these words, it was also a confirmation of the Blood Robe's strength, representing the attitude of the Heimoyu.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ziyuan Ancestor's gaze towards Black Sword carried a touch of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>If the current Abyss Master was still in charge of the Heimoyu, how could he so easily allow the Blood Robe to enjoy the treatment of a great Principle Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Now that Black Sword had spoken these words, at least in the Lingyao Realm, as long as the Blood Robe did not do anything unforgivable, the Heimoyu would shield him.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang God Venerables all looked at the Blood Robe with envious eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Lingyao Realm begins, why don't we hold the wedding ceremony?" Yuehua Venerable said cheerfully, her expression filled with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>She was also ready to seize the opportunity and bind the Blood Robe to her side.</p><p></p><p>The quiet Jinli stood behind Qi Yuan, and her beautiful countenance did not show any joy at Yuehua Venerable's words, but rather a dark cloud hovering over her.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor's face also carried joy: "This is called... a double celebration."</p><p></p><p>However, his smile soon froze.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a blazing great sun descended outside the Ziyuan Heavens.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators of the Ziyuan Heavens felt the scorching heat and aura.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor looked up at the sky, his expression not good, glaring at the sun-like apparition: "The Taihuang Palace has descended upon my Ziyuan Heavens, without even announcing their arrival first!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Shall I greet you? Are you not afraid that the treasures of my Dao will harm you?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two great Dao Sovereigns appeared in the void.</p><p></p><p>These two great Dao Sovereigns were from the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>One of them was the True Origin Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Celestial Venerable ignored Ziyuan Patriarch's words and looked at Qi Yuan, his voice cold and stern: "Qi Yuan, come back to the Taihuang Palace with me to atone for your crimes!"</p><p></p><p>His tone was domineering and undeniable.</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards Qi Yuan was like that of a judge examining a criminal.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, has the Taihuang Palace always been so tyrannical?" The Moon Splendor Celestial Venerable couldn't help but coldly sneer, "Just because you see a prodigy, you randomly assign a crime?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Patriarch was also furious: "Even if you Taihuang Palace presided over the Lingyao Molting, you cannot be so tyrannical. This Sixth Heaven... is not the exclusive domain of your Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The other elders of the Black Abyss also exuded a terrifying and profound aura, their fighting intent soaring.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that if Black Sword gave the order, they would attack these two great Dao Sovereigns of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Celestial Venerable narrowed his eyes, unafraid.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze around and said indifferently, "This is a personal grudge between the Palace Master and him, and has nothing to do with you. I advise you to cherish your lives and not make a mistake!"</p><p></p><p>These words were like a thunderclap that resounded in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>A personal grudge? Did the Blood Robe offend that Venerable? How could the Blood Robe, with his strength, offend him? And Ziyuan Daxue also covered her mouth, her expression one of utter bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>She remembered when she first met the Blood Robe, he had said that his greatest enemy was that one from the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>At first, she didn't take it seriously, as if an ant could provoke the stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seemed to be true.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Patriarch also glanced at Qi Yuan, his expression full of suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this guy had been secretly cursing that Venerable of the Taihuang Palace, and was discovered?</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Celestial Venerable looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze deep: "He is a criminal!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"A criminal?"</p><p></p><p>The Yang God Celestial Venerable present immediately thought of something, his expression one of utter bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>And the Moon Splendor Celestial Venerable couldn't help but coldly sneer: "I never thought the Taihuang Palace would be so shameless.</p><p></p><p>In the past, to refine a technique, they descended into the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>When the Dao Sovereigns went to the Taihuang Palace to demand an explanation, you Taihuang Palace said that those Three Thousand Realms... were all criminals! Today, I still say... you Taihuang Palace are the criminals!"</p><p></p><p>The so-called "criminals" was just a label they put on others.</p><p></p><p>"As a criminal, instead of sincerely atoning, you have secretly undermined the Three Thousand Realms. Qi Yuan... you know your crime!"</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Celestial Venerable's voice was as majestic as a divine being.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when he came to the Ziyuan Heavens, he learned that the person before him was actually that Qi Yuan who had undermined the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>And the other great Dao Sovereigns, upon hearing this, were all horrified.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with good information knows that in the Three Thousand Realms, there was a past body that the Venerable had discarded.</p><p></p><p>The Great Day Venerable did not cultivate the future or the past, only certifying the eternal Great Day.</p><p></p><p>He was too powerful, so he had to discard his past body and place it in the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>Now, looking at this explanation, the Three Thousand Yang Gods in the Three Thousand Realms were overthrown by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>All the great Dao Sovereigns took a deep breath, their expressions horrified.</p><p></p><p>This was an enmity that obstructed the Dao! If it were just an ordinary grudge, they might still say something, but...</p><p></p><p>This kind of life-and-death enmity was not much different from that between the Moon Goddess Sovereign and the Great Day Venerable.</p><p></p><p>However, the True Origin Celestial Venerable's next words made their shock even greater, to the point of numbness! "As a criminal, to overthrow the Three Thousand Realms, this is the first crime! To covet the position of the Great Day Venerable by borrowing the Ten Days, this is the second crime! Unforgivable crimes, deserving of death!"</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Celestial Venerable's voice was like thunderclaps, falling on everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Splendor Celestial Venerable's expression changed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan with disbelief: "You... are the Ten Days Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>She also didn't expect Qi Yuan to have so many identities, and that he was actually the Ten Days Venerable? If it were other enemies of the Taihuang Palace, the Moon Splendor Celestial Venerable would naturally be happy to see him grow.</p><p></p><p>But this person is... the Ten Days Venerable! The Ten Days Venerable, coveting the position of the Great Day Venerable.</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, he was also destined to be an enemy of the Moon Goddess Palace!</p><p></p><p>The other great Dao Sovereigns also looked at Qi Yuan with horror.</p><p></p><p>This guy... how many secrets does he have? He was the one who overthrew the Three Thousand Realms, daring to provoke the Taihuang Palace and attempt to seize the position of the Great Day Venerable!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked, and many of the prodigies secretly distanced themselves from Qi Yuan, their expressions fearful and terrified.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan remained calm, standing in his blood-red robe, holding Jinli's hand, and said indifferently, "Descending into the Three Thousand Realms, treating the masses as pigs and dogs, is this not the crime of the Taihuang Palace? Your Taihuang Palace's Venerable, his star projection trespassing into my home every day, this is not also a crime? Saying this, your Taihuang Palace is the one with heinous crimes, deserving of death?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was calm, but resounding.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Moon Splendor Celestial Venerable looked at Qi Yuan, her expression complex. She thought of something and suddenly said, "Jinli, come back to the Moon Goddess Palace with me. He... is not only the enemy of the Taihuang Palace, but also the enemy of our Moon Goddess Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Patriarch moved his lips but ultimately did not refute.</p><p></p><p>He understood the Moon Splendor Celestial Venerable's meaning.</p><p></p><p>And he also knew that now that Jinli was following Qi Yuan, it would be very dangerous, and it would be better for her to return to the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were involuntarily drawn to Jinli. The beautiful Lunar Goddess Jinli had a cold expression, her gaze resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, on the Wangue Continent, I could only watch him face the outer demonic forces alone, powerless to do anything."</p><p></p><p>When she was the Lunar Goddess, she had once carved the Lunar Goddess mark on Qi Yuan's arm.</p><p></p><p>Through the Lunar Goddess mark, she could feel his pain at all times.</p><p></p><p>And the pain that the owner of the Lunar Goddess mark, Qi Yuan, had to endure, how unimaginable must it have been?</p><p></p><p>Later, she waited alone under the ancient Qichu tree, but the one who had communicated with her in the past space-time, Qi Yuan, had gone alone to seal the land.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I see him again, no matter what... even if the stars fall, the star sea shatters, and the immortal realms collapse, I will stand by his side!"</p><p></p><p>Jinli's beautiful face was filled with unyielding determination.</p><p></p><p>Under countless gazes, she tightly grasped Qi Yuan's hand and boldly expressed her heart.</p><p></p><p>The words she had been unable to say in the past were now spoken.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Splendor Celestial Venerable heard this, her gaze complex: "Have you forgotten the grace of the Moon Goddess Palace over the years? If you follow him... you will die, and only by staying in the Moon Goddess Palace will you have a chance to live!"</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan had overthrown the Three Thousand Realms and was also the Ten Days Venerable, the Great Day Venerable would not let him go. Even if his talent was extraordinary and his potential great, no one would defend him against the wrath of the Great Day Venerable!</p><p></p><p>This was an enmity against the Dao! One side must be completely destroyed to erase it.</p><p></p><p>"My mind is made up, Venerable, please say no more!" Jinli said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice transmission reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly take Jinli and leave, I'll help you block those two great Dao Sovereigns of the Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The transmitter was none other than Ziyuan Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the grand plan was still in progress.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had to leave the Black Abyss, or else... it would implicate the Ziyuan Heavens.</p><p></p><p>As for the Taihuang Palace...</p><p></p><p>His gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>He would go there himself, not to apologize, but to question them.</p><p></p><p>However, he had to first pretend to be aggrieved according to the plan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise... that Venerable of the Taihuang Palace, how would he get involved?</p><p></p><p>He looked at the True Origin Celestial Venerable, his expression calm: "The day the Lingyao Molting begins, will be the day I flatten the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>As for presiding over the Lingyao Molting... let's see if you have the chance!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke harshly.</p><p></p><p>This was also a part of the grand plan.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>The two great Dao Sovereigns erupted in fury, their aura terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Black Abyss saw this and looked at each other, not daring to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Patriarch quickly stepped forward to confront the two great Dao Sovereigns of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>These two great Dao Sovereigns were actually from the second echelon of Dao Sovereigns, their aura horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Facing them alone, even though he was stronger, he would certainly be injured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the silent Black Sword suddenly acted, and a white light flashed, a terrifying sword intent sweeping to block these two great Dao Sovereigns for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's calm voice also reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the people of the Ziyuan Heavens one last time, tightly grasping Jinli's hand, and no longer lingered.</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A voice transmission also reached Ziyuan Patriarch's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, if you sense danger, come to the Tiankun Extraordinary Land, I'll protect you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had to leave.</p><p></p><p>Because he had already sensed a terrifying, vast, and scorching aura about to lock onto him.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, that Venerable of the Taihuang Palace... had already begun to brew, intending to annihilate him with thunderous might.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan and Jinli's figures disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A deafeningly loud sound rang out in the void.</p><p></p><p>Countless lava-like lights radiated in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Countless spatial layers shattered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the Venerable of the Taihuang Palace had acted, instantly severing all space and cutting off Qi Yuan's retreat.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he did not know that Qi Yuan had entered his own Purple Mansion.</p><p></p><p>About half a breath of time passed, and a slight sound of surprise rang out in the void, then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The great Dao Sovereigns outside the Ziyuan Heavens sky all felt a chill on their scalps, a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Because... they seemed to have seen the hand of a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>That power... was indescribable, as if a single palm could grind them to dust.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ziyuan Xiaolu and Ziyuan Daxue and the others had pale faces.</p><p></p><p>Because they didn't know if the Blood Robe had just escaped or not.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Patriarch's expression was grave. After stopping those two great Dao Sovereigns, he seemed to be pondering Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Could it be? </p><p></p><p>Just?</p><p></p><p>He was full of worry.</p><p></p><p>The Tiankun Extraordinary Land... could that tattered robe withstand the Venerable of the Taihuang Palace?</p><p></p><p>With the Patrol of the Heavens in effect, even if Qi Yuan hid in the Tiankun Extraordinary Land, his location would be immediately discovered by the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Patriarch's expression was full of worry. He thought of something, his face conflicted, but finally... his expression became resolute.</p><p></p><p>This incident shook the Ziyuan Heavens, causing turmoil in the Black Abyss, and even the Sixth Heaven was in an uproar, everyone shocked by the events that had just occurred.</p><p></p><p>But no one noticed that Ziyuan Patriarch had appeared alone at the foot of Black Magic Mountain.</p><p></p><p>His arrogance had disappeared at this moment, as if he were an old man in his twilight years.</p><p></p><p>The last time he came here to seek help from the Abyss Master, he didn't even get to see the Abyss Master's face.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had sworn that if he came to seek the Abyss Master again, he would be no better than a pig or dog.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe was hiding in the Tiankun Extraordinary Land, facing the pressure from the Taihuang Palace, how long could the Blood Robe hold out? At this moment, he didn't care about his pride.</p><p></p><p>He bowed deeply towards Black Magic Mountain: "The Blood Robe's talents are exceptional, mastering two supreme Dao, and he will lead the Black Abyss to revival. I beg the Venerable to protect the Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>The more strength he had, the greater the Blood Robe's chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>This arrogant old man was now hunched over terribly.</p><p></p><p>But Black Magic Mountain remained silent, no one responding to him.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Patriarch's expression changed repeatedly, and he finally gritted his teeth and said, "If the Venerable is willing to protect the Blood Robe, this time during the Lingyao Molting, I... am willing to lead the expedition to the Immortal Realm for the Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The choice to seal the Abyss was not without a price.</p><p></p><p>The price was... the death of some great Dao Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Leading the expedition to the Immortal Realm for the Taihuang Palace also meant... going to his death.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an extremely ancient voice sounded from within Black Magic Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Why bother with this?"</p><p></p><p>"The Black Abyss... has Black Sword, that is enough."</p><p></p><p>The voice was hesitant, yet resigned, and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ziyuan Patriarch's anger surged, but he remained hunched over.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, the Blood Robe... he is the source of the bloodline, I beseech you, Venerable, to protect the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>He solemnly bowed to this teacher he had always been dissatisfied with and disliked.</p><p></p><p>"What does being the source of the bloodline matter? Once you have come to this world, you have no future."</p><p></p><p>The ancient voice sighed from within Black Magic Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Go back, you cannot interfere in this matter."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

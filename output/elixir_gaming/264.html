        <h1>Chapter 264</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"These yin gods are all very shy and introverted. They didn't want me to send them off and just ran away directly," said Wu Jun Dazun.</p><p></p><p>He seemed not to have heard Qi Yuan's words, and gritted his teeth: "Short-sighted fools!"</p><p></p><p>These yin god lords viewed the Blood-Robed Sword God as if he were a plague god.</p><p></p><p>They kept talking about dealing with the great calamity, but as soon as the minions of the calamity arrived, they all ran away.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Seven Injuries Elder, his gaze complex: "You actually didn't leave with them?"</p><p></p><p>Except for the Seven Injuries Elder, all the yin gods had left, without exception.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is at death's door and has lived long enough. Seeing the minions of the great calamity before I die, I'll have no regrets," the Seven Injuries Elder coughed once and answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Wind Lord narrowed his eyes and looked at Qi Yuan: "With the Dark Sun descending, it would be better for the Blood-Robed Sword God to... leave this place."</p><p></p><p>He was considering the Blood-Robed Sword God's interests.</p><p></p><p>If the Lei Family Four Generals could even kill the Blazing Flame Dazun, the Blood-Robed Sword God would surely die unless he returned to the Moon-Gazing Continent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't answer Wind Lord's words, but instead asked the question he had asked before that no one had answered: "How many techniques does the Dark Sun have?"</p><p></p><p>He was concerned about the Dark Sun's techniques.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Dazun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He had never even heard of the Dark Sun before, so naturally he didn't know if they had many techniques or not.</p><p></p><p>"With many strong practitioners, they should have many techniques as well," Wu Jun Dazun reasoned.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Dark Sun's headquarters?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>These yin gods were so afraid of the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>And the Dark Sun was a minion of the great calamity, even able to make the head of the Divine Flower Association silence him.</p><p></p><p>There must be many strong practitioners in the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>And many techniques.</p><p></p><p>Why not take this opportunity to rob the Dark Sun?</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid only the people of Dark Sun would know that," the Seven Injuries Elder replied.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll have to wait for the Dark Sun people to arrive," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder also showed a suspicious expression: "Elder, aren't you returning to the Moon-Gazing Continent?"</p><p></p><p>He naturally also thought that upon hearing of the Dark Sun people's arrival, the Blood-Robed Sword God would return to the Moon-Gazing Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Moon-Gazing Continent was the Blood-Robed Sword God's home turf after all.</p><p></p><p>"Why would I return to the Moon-Gazing Continent? I'm originally from the Azure Waves Realm. </p><p></p><p>Now, I still need to wait for the Dark Sun people to come. They are my true love, second only to Jasmine Dazun in my heart."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun had mythical secret treasures, so she was his number one true love.</p><p></p><p>The Lei Family Four Generals of Dark Sun were temporarily ranked second.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Dazun also remained silent.</p><p></p><p>In the days that followed, the entire Light Rainbow City was extremely oppressive, as if a storm was brewing.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun of the Phoenix Palace also found an excuse to temporarily leave Light Rainbow City.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they were avoiding the Dark Sun and the Lei Family Four Generals, to avoid being implicated.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jasmine Dazun was lazily looking at the person in the mirror with a smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>"This time you guessed wrong, the Blood-Robed Sword God didn't return to the Moon-Gazing Continent."</p><p></p><p>A while ago, the person in the mirror had said that faced with the Lei Family Four Generals of Dark Sun, the Blood-Robed Sword God would flee back to the Moon-Gazing Continent.</p><p></p><p>The great battle would take place on the Moon-Gazing Continent.</p><p></p><p>However, contrary to everyone's expectations, the Blood-Robed Sword God actually stayed at the Dao-Seeking Palace, choosing to face the Lei Family Four Generals.</p><p></p><p>"He is indeed unpredictable," said the figure in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>"According to your logic, since he chose to stay at the Dao-Seeking Palace, does this mean he will win in his clash with the Lei Family Four Generals?" Jasmine Dazun asked with a smile in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not so," the person in the mirror spoke. "He will still be defeated.</p><p></p><p>The Lei Family Four Generals were once all mythical level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Now their foundations have been taken, leaving only their shells, but they have been tempering themselves day and night, and their strength has already reached the peak of the sixth step of Sky Treading.</p><p></p><p>Four practitioners at the peak of the sixth step of Sky Treading are enough to sweep through everything.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God... is not a mythical being.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why isn't his name on the Mythical Stele?"</p><p></p><p>The Mythical Stele was a supreme treasure of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>It stood in the Central Heavenly Domain, and recorded the names of every mythical powerhouse in the Azure Waves Realm on the Mythical Stele.</p><p></p><p>Whenever someone entered the mythical realm, they would be sensed by the Mythical Stele, and their name would be recorded.</p><p></p><p>The Mythical Stele was also known as the Death Stele.</p><p></p><p>Because any mythical powerhouse whose name was recorded on the Mythical Stele would not survive a great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Now, there were very few living mythical beings whose names were still on the Mythical Stele, and they rarely appeared in the mortal world, constantly concealing their auras, as if trying to avoid the great calamity hundreds of years later.</p><p></p><p>However, under the great calamity, ordinary Dazuns still had a chance to survive, but... mythical beings, well, none had ever been seen to survive.</p><p></p><p>Since the Blood-Robed Sword God's name had never been recorded on the Mythical Stele, he naturally was not a mythical being.</p><p></p><p>"Your name isn't on the Mythical Stele either, is it?" Jasmine Dazun's face showed a meaningful smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm different from the Blood-Robed Sword God," the man said with his back to Jasmine Dazun. "I am a mythical being, and also not a mythical being.</p><p></p><p>But he... is not a mythical being."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, why doesn't he flee?" Jasmine Dazun asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he really does have a problem with his head," the man muttered, sounding quite perplexed as he said these words.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the world is vast and full of wonders.</p><p></p><p>To think there would actually be a cultivator who had reached the Dazun realm yet was... so problematic in the head as the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I can't kill him personally. He has to die at the hands of Dark Sun," Jasmine Dazun sighed, somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Killing him would probably be beyond your abilities," the silhouette in the ancient mirror spoke, with a hint of mockery in his voice.</p><p></p><p>Although Jasmine Dazun had hidden her strength, she was still only at the fifth step of Sky Treading.</p><p></p><p>"But I have you, don't I?" Jasmine Dazun smiled, her breath like orchids.</p><p></p><p>"Unless something attracts my interest, I won't make a move," the man in the ancient mirror said, his voice indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God... indeed doesn't have anything worth you making a move for," Jasmine Dazun looked at the silhouette in the ancient mirror, her gaze burning hot. She licked her lips, "Master, do you have any fun tasks to assign to this slave next?"</p><p></p><p>"Just watch the show," said the silhouette in the ancient mirror.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was carefully creating his own technique, absorbing various kinds of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to the rumors outside, Qi Yuan was very calm and not trembling at all.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time had passed, a voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword God Elder, there's a Divine Embryo cultivator who calls himself Shen Wushen here with your token!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace cultivator said respectfully, quite curious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>How could a powerhouse like the Blood-Robed Sword God associate with so many weaklings? This Shen Wushen was just a Divine Embryo cultivator, and that Gao Xiaoyu who called himself sworn brothers with the Blood-Robed Sword God was only at the Yuan Dan stage. It was really outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"He's here?" Qi Yuan's face showed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>The real rich guy has arrived! The value of one mythical technique was worth more than a hundred heaven-grade secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Shen Wushen, Jasmine Dazun, his number one true love, wasn't even worth a fart.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly invite him over! No, I'll go greet him myself!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure moved, and he reappeared outside the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>He spotted Shen Wushen at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Purple Palace cultivators saw Qi Yuan and hurriedly bowed: "Greetings, Dazun!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Wushen was somewhat surprised: "Why do they address you as Dazun?"</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Because I defeated their leader, who was a Great Venerable. So naturally they assumed I was a Great Venerable too," Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Honesty is the ultimate weapon.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen swallowed hard upon hearing this: "You defeated... a Great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't comprehend it. Wasn't Qi Yuan at the same Divine Infant realm as him? Even for an unparalleled genius, being able to fight across realms would be normal.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen had heard that in the Sixth Heaven, there was an unparalleled genius who, having just entered the Divine Infant realm, could fight evenly against someone at the peak of Purple Palace realm without losing.</p><p></p><p>Such Divine Infant cultivators were rare even in the Upper Realms, appearing only once every million years.</p><p></p><p>But what did he just hear? A Divine Infant defeating a Great Venerable? Was this real?</p><p></p><p>"A Great Venerable is nothing. I didn't even need to make a move myself, just sending out a Divine Infant was enough," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was bewildered, finding it hard to understand Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>How could a Divine Infant be so strong?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan intently: "When I was at the Divine Infant realm, would I have had a chance to be as strong as you?"</p><p></p><p>"There's a chance," Qi Yuan replied, "Just have a good dream while sleeping."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Even now, he still found it hard to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Could Qi Yuan really defeat a Great Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"Being as strong as me is very, very difficult, but... with my help, killing a Purple Palace realm cultivator with a Divine Infant body would be a piece of cake," Qi Yuan said honestly.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Divine Infant and Purple Palace was the difference between divine abilities and origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>When in the Flowing Wind Realm, Qi Yuan knew the gap between origin divine abilities and ordinary divine abilities, thinking it was insurmountable.</p><p></p><p>But as his strength increased, he understood that it was insurmountable only because one's divine abilities weren't strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace..." Mentioning this, Shen Wushen fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He was very strong, able to contend with cultivators who had just entered the Purple Palace realm, but unable to kill them.</p><p></p><p>If he could easily kill Purple Palace cultivators, it would be a huge improvement for him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much about it now. How did the things I asked you to do go?" Qi Yuan asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>He had sent cultivation techniques to Jin Li, with his letter hidden inside.</p><p></p><p>"I did both things!" Shen Wushen said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan hesitated for a moment: "In that case, doesn't it make me seem a bit like a scumbag?"</p><p></p><p>On one hand, he had just sent a letter to Jin Li, and on the other, he was confessing to his master Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>But a great man doesn't get caught up in minor details, so Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to think about it further.</p><p></p><p>"Why think so much about something that's three years away?"</p><p></p><p>He had already learned through Shen Wushen that the time flow between the Upper Realms and the Cang Lan Realm was actually equivalent, at a 1:1 ratio.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't dwell on it further, instead looking at Shen Wushen expectantly: "You did well with those tasks, I'll give you some good guidance... So, where are the cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>The last sentence was Qi Yuan's true purpose.</p><p></p><p>"I'm penniless in the Upper Realms now, I only exchanged for some cultivation techniques," Shen Wushen answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>He had even borrowed money and divine techniques from Fairy Lian Mei to exchange for many cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had also taken on some missions, hoping Qi Yuan could really solve one or two of them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would be cultivating while in debt.</p><p></p><p>Heavily in debt.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, just borrow if you don't have money," Qi Yuan said. "For example, at the Divine Infant realm you can borrow 100,000 spirit stones. When you reach Purple Palace realm, you can easily earn 100,000 spirit stones and pay it back easily.</p><p></p><p>Then at Purple Palace realm, borrow 1 million, and pay it back when you reach Yin Immortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Wushen was stunned for a moment: "What you say makes a lot of sense."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he handed the jade slips to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This time there are two divine techniques, seventy heavenly techniques, the rest aren't counted.</p><p></p><p>Among them, one divine technique can be shared externally, the other can't," Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>Hiss! Usually it was others who drew in a sharp breath at Qi Yuan, but today it was Qi Yuan's turn to draw in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was the real rich guy.</p><p></p><p>So many cultivation techniques, more profitable than the celebration from two days ago!</p><p></p><p>"If you were a woman, I might really have to offer myself in return!" Qi Yuan excitedly accepted the techniques, "It's a pity I can't go to the Upper Realms... otherwise, with so many... Moonlight, my dream lover!"</p><p></p><p>His dream lovers were all in the Upper Realms, out of reach.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan uploaded the techniques to the jade slip of the Original God Sharing Association according to Shen Wushen's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Especially that one divine technique that could be made public, he uploaded it as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to attract attention, he made 1% of it available for people to view.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator who saw that 1% of the divine technique would probably be unable to resist wanting to see the rest.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan, seeing a divine technique for the first time, was moved by its profundity.</p><p></p><p>Divine techniques were created by Yang Immortals, representing the foundation of a Yang Immortal.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, no divine techniques had been circulated.</p><p></p><p>If it was revealed that the Original God Sharing Association had divine techniques, Original God would definitely become the brightest star in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, these are the missions I accepted, I'll have to trouble you with them," Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>He took out thirty-four jade slips, which contained the missions he had accepted.</p><p></p><p>Currently, his mission points in the sect were not high, so he could only accept these few missions.</p><p></p><p>He had only accepted these thirty-four.</p><p></p><p>But even so, if six or seven of these thirty-four could be solved, he wouldn't be at a big loss.</p><p></p><p>After all, these missions were all difficult tasks.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, let me take a look," Qi Yuan had long decided to help Shen Wushen with the sect missions.</p><p></p><p>Then Shen Wushen could exchange the mission rewards for cultivation techniques for him.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, in Qi Yuan's view, Shen Wushen was just a tool.</p><p></p><p>His tool in the Upper Realms.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the jade slips and casually picked one out.</p><p></p><p>He pondered: "Hua Du Great Venerable... Contract Heaven Marvelous Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Wushen hurriedly said: "This mission was posted by a Great Venerable at the sixth step of Treading Heaven. It probably requires at least a Mythical realm cultivator to solve. Why don't you look at the others first, friend?"</p><p></p><p>This mission was one of the few high-level missions he could accept.</p><p></p><p>"No need, his problem isn't difficult. Give me half an hour and I can solve it, it's a small matter," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>For him, it really was a small matter.</p><p></p><p>He had spent several days writing a letter to Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen paused, somewhat surprised: "Half an hour?"</p><p></p><p>This mission was very, very difficult.</p><p></p><p>His master was acquainted with Hua Du Great Venerable. His master had said that even if a Mythical realm cultivator of the same path came to solve this problem, it would take thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Even a Yang Immortal couldn't solve it in a short time.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan said... half an hour?</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Shen Wushen seemed not to believe him, Qi Yuan casually explained: "I have quite a few Divine Infants, so it's normal for me to be fast."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infants within Qi Yuan's body encompassed almost all the deities of the Heavenly Court, and even included ancient demon gods.</p><p></p><p>He had all kinds of systems and all kinds of paths.</p><p></p><p>He had contemplated the Three Pure Ones, and even more so the Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, and Three gives birth to all things.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he had walked every path.</p><p></p><p>The technique before him was similar to paths he had.</p><p></p><p>Plus, he had that pair of eyes that could see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>Such problems really weren't problems for him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

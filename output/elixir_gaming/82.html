        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you a prince?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>This person really fits the protagonist template.</p><p></p><p>Not only does he have a remnant soul within him, but he's also a prince with a jilted fiancée.</p><p></p><p>"In the struggle for the Dragon Throne, the Sect Master has promised that I can select two Foundation Establishment cultivators from the sect to assist me. </p><p></p><p>The first one I've chosen is Senior Brother Kong Fulu.</p><p></p><p>The second one, I wish to seek the help of Senior Brother Qi Yuan to participate in the struggle for the Dragon Throne. </p><p></p><p>If Senior Brother Qi Yuan assists me, I will definitely give you a generous reward.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether the matter succeeds or not, I will bestow upon you three Jade-grade secret techniques and three Foundation Establishment treasures.</p><p></p><p>If the matter succeeds, I will open the Imperial Palace's treasury for you to select from."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian spoke sincerely. </p><p></p><p>This is the most precious thing he can offer at the moment.</p><p></p><p>It is also his all.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Qi Yuan said indifferently, "The struggle for the Dragon Throne is in the capital of the Great Liang Kingdom, which is too far away. I don't want to go, I just like to stay at home."</p><p></p><p>Last time he went to destroy the Black Mountain Sect, Qi Yuan returned home overnight.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't like to wander around, especially staying outside.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Xian was stunned for a moment, thinking that this reason for refusal is too unreliable. "Since there's nothing else, I'll go back and cultivate."</p><p></p><p>This protagonist-like person, Qi Yuan can't get too close to him.</p><p></p><p>If he becomes the protagonist's helper, he may one day be killed off by the plot, then triggering the protagonist's awakening of their inner potential.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan is all too familiar with this kind of plot.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, I am willing to offer even higher conditions. If you are not satisfied, we can continue to negotiate." Dong Xian hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"It's too far, I don't want to go." Qi Yuan decisively refused and returned to his own room to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Outside the wooden house, a look of disappointment appeared on Dong Xian's face.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, are my conditions not enough?" Dong Xian was very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has nothing to do with your conditions. What Qi Yuan just said may be true, he really doesn't want to go out far." Elder Qi said helplessly, "Some geniuses have some peculiarities, especially this kind of reclusive cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Hearing this, Dong Xian clenched his fists, feeling very unwilling.</p><p></p><p>This time, he prepared to participate in the struggle for the Dragon Throne, and he had already informed his mother, the Empress.</p><p></p><p>His mother came from a small family, and the only Foundation Establishment cultivator in the family was his uncle.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, his uncle directly gave him the two Foundation Establishment treasures he had.</p><p></p><p>His mother also gave him all the spiritual herbs and treasures that the Emperor had bestowed upon her.</p><p></p><p>So, he was barely able to persuade Kong Fulu.</p><p></p><p>Now, if he cannot convince Qi Yuan, his chances of success in the struggle for the Dragon Throne will be very low.</p><p></p><p>He cannot let down the expectations of his mother and uncle.</p><p></p><p>He stood outside the wooden house, quietly waiting, like a pine tree standing in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Dong Xian's transmission jade slip vibrated.</p><p></p><p>It was from Senior Brother Kong Fulu.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the content inside and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, do you know what Senior Brother Kong Fulu just told me?"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Kong Fulu said that a secret realm has appeared in Rongcheng, and the location of the struggle for the Dragon Throne has been changed to Rongcheng."</p><p></p><p>"What?!!"</p><p></p><p>Rongcheng is very close to the Seven-Colored Peak. Even for a Qi Condensation cultivator, it would only take one or two hours to get there.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had just said that it was too far and he didn't want to go.</p><p></p><p>But the location of the struggle for the Dragon Throne has been changed to Rongcheng.</p><p></p><p>Is this the will of heaven assisting me? Dong Xian thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, Dong Xian requests an audience!" Dong Xian's face showed joy as he shouted towards the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan came out of the house: "You haven't left yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, the location of the struggle for the Dragon Throne has been changed to Rongcheng!" Dong Xian's tone was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "In Rongcheng?"</p><p></p><p>This is too close, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>How come it suddenly changed to Rongcheng.</p><p></p><p>"It's absolutely true, Senior Brother Kong Fulu told me." Dong Xian spoke, his breath forming white mist, "Can I now invite Senior Brother Qi Yuan to assist me in the struggle for the Dragon Throne?"</p><p></p><p>Standing there, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Is this the protagonist template?</p><p></p><p>Heaven is helping him solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>He felt that if he didn't appreciate this good fortune, Heaven might just deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Since Heaven is helping Dong Xian, shouldn't he be able to make some big demands? Qi Yuan hesitated for a moment, then slowly said, "I can help you, but I have a few conditions."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian's expression became excited: "Senior Brother, please feel free to state them."</p><p></p><p>"I want a treasure that can slay Transcendent Saints."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian was stunned: "...Senior Brother Qi Yuan, are you joking?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I want to attain the cultivation of Ascending to the Heavens during the day."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian fell silent.</p><p></p><p>If he could do those things, would he still come to seek Senior Brother Qi Yuan's help in the struggle for the Dragon Throne?</p><p></p><p>"Can't even do that?" Qi Yuan sighed helplessly, "Then give me the sun in the sky, I want to refine a Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Can't do that either?" Qi Yuan was extremely helpless, finally thinking of something, "Alright, then just give me a secret technique to enhance my spiritual sense."</p><p></p><p>This is already the lowest requirement.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the corner of Dong Xian's mouth couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous conditions Senior Brother Qi Yuan proposed, this one doesn't seem so outrageous.</p><p></p><p>But that's in comparison to the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>A secret technique to enhance spiritual sense? Such a technique probably doesn't even exist in the Great Liang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of spiritual sense is extremely important.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators at the Spirit Embryo realm, to break through to the Purple Palace realm, they need to overcome three calamities and three tribulations. </p><p></p><p>These three calamities and three tribulations are all attacks on the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>So, any Spirit Embryo cultivator who wants to break through to the Purple Palace realm must first strengthen their spiritual sense, otherwise, no matter how strong their Dao techniques or spiritual power, they will not be able to overcome the three calamities and three tribulations and will perish.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, secret techniques to strengthen the spiritual sense are rare, and even if they exist, they are in the hands of some ancient Spirit Embryo cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Techniques to strengthen the spiritual sense are more precious than even Mysterious-grade secret techniques, let alone Heaven-grade secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian had a troubled expression.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a technique to strengthen the spiritual sense, he doesn't even have any Mysterious-grade secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan..." Dong Xian originally wanted to say something.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Elder within him transmitted a message: "Accept his condition, I have a technique to strengthen the spiritual sense."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Xian was first surprised, then touched: "Elder, I..."</p><p></p><p>He choked up, then said to Qi Yuan, "Senior Brother, I can agree to this condition of yours."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Dong Xian to be able to produce a technique to strengthen the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and finally nodded: "Bring out the secret technique, and I will help you."</p><p></p><p>The technique to strengthen the spiritual sense is indeed not bad, and Qi Yuan also needs it very much.</p><p></p><p>He wants to open the second game, but he must first strengthen his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, please wait for two days, I will naturally deliver the secret technique to you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Dong Xian handed the secret technique jade slip to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, here is the secret technique to strengthen the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>However, Senior Brother needs to be careful, this secret technique cannot be cultivated too much.</p><p></p><p>During cultivation, it will be extremely painful, as if the spiritual sense is being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>If cultivated excessively, it may even lead to serious damage to the spiritual sense."  Dong Xian reminded him seriously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the secret technique jade slip and nodded: "Okay, I've noted it down."</p><p></p><p>He returned to his own wooden house and his spiritual sense entered the secret technique jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Hundred Refinements Spiritual Sense Technique?"</p><p></p><p>【This is an ordinary technique to enhance the spiritual sense. It has 250 flaws, and after modification, the cultivation effect will be tripled, but the pain will also be tripled.】</p><p></p><p>This secret technique is true to its name.</p><p></p><p>During cultivation, the spiritual sense will be refined into a hammer, constantly hammering other spiritual senses, like forging a hundred-fold steel, a thousand-fold steel.</p><p></p><p>When hammering one's own spiritual sense, the pain will naturally be excruciating.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it for a while, sat on a wooden stool, and began to perfect this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>This technique is very difficult, and even though Qi Yuan's eyes could see the prompts, it still took him ten days to modify the "Hundred Refinements Spiritual Sense Technique" completely.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I can start cultivating it. I hope it won't be too painful, I'm afraid of pain, I don't even dare to look when getting an injection."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began to cultivate the modified "Hundred Refinements Spiritual Sense Technique", and a huge hammer appeared, constantly pounding...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It struck his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, why doesn't it hurt?" Qi Yuan was a bit surprised. He had thought that constantly pounding his divine soul would be very painful.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, he couldn't feel anything at all, it was just like hitting a whack-a-mole, quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine soul was also constantly growing.</p><p></p><p>After some time, a somewhat familiar voice suddenly reached his ears again.</p><p></p><p>"I killed the last person in this world who had a blood relationship with me, although she struck first, but... hehe, I am the Demon Maiden."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and realized it was the voice of little friend Ning Lao. But her voice was no longer sweet, it was cold and no longer cute.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it for a while, then couldn't help but reply, "Killing is killing, your setting is that of a Demon Maiden, so it's quite normal for a Demon Maiden to kill people, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan didn't hear any more, and continued to cultivate the "Hundred Refinements Soul Cultivation Technique".</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The young girl was in the bloom of youth, her face covered by a black veil, but the exposed half of her face revealed her beauty. She wore a black dress and held a Scythe of Death in her hand.</p><p></p><p>Dripping blood stained the scythe.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the corpses on the ground with deep melancholy.</p><p></p><p>The ground was covered in blood and bodies.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a familiar voice reached her ears.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao's eyes first showed astonishment, then surprise: "Uncle, you've come?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no one answered her.</p><p></p><p>She stood in place, her small figure appearing quite lonely.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle? Have you left?"</p><p></p><p>Still no response.</p><p></p><p>She didn't leave, standing in place for two hours.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>Alone, she exuded an air of loneliness, yet also a bloody beauty.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the thing she was waiting for didn't come, but her enemies did.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Maiden is still here, quickly kill her!"</p><p>"Demon Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>A group of people rushed towards her, and a sweet smile flashed across Ning Lao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, it seems you support me too. I am the Demon Maiden, so I will overturn heaven and earth to kill them."</p><p></p><p>Wielding the Scythe of Death, her tall figure under the setting sun looked like a deadly rose.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter began again, then ended.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, I have to go now, another wave of enemies is coming. Your delicate little wife will die here, haha."</p><p></p><p>She deliberately laughed "haha".</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the divine soul has grown a lot, getting closer to that game icon."</p><p></p><p>But it's still very far away.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that at this rate, it would take about three months before he could enter that game.</p><p></p><p>"Too slow, so boring."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked out of the house and basked in the sun.</p><p></p><p>The melting snow days were colder than usual.</p><p></p><p>Now on the Seven-Colored Peak, the palace halls on the peak were still silver-clad, while the snow below had melted most of the way.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you want to come down and bask in the sun with me?" Qi Yuan shouted towards the peak.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>"Once I reach the Nascent Soul stage, I'll be able to go to the mountain top and see the Master.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, the Nascent Soul is too difficult."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul was indeed difficult.</p><p></p><p>His current Foundation Establishment cultivation technique hadn't progressed much.</p><p></p><p>He was still in the initial stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>He needed a cultivation method that could reach the Nascent Soul stage before he could step into the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Nascent Soul, the Master wouldn't even bother to see him.</p><p></p><p>When he called out to the Master to bask in the sun, he naturally didn't get a response.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Ling Su's slightly weak voice came: "Senior brother, I'll come keep you company in the sun."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su walked out of the house, her complexion not looking very good, pale and bloodless, as if she had just walked out of a freezer.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, what's wrong with you?" Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Ling Su and reached out his hand.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su hesitated for a moment, then her delicate hand fell onto Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Ice cold, very cold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt like he was touching a block of ice.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, just an old ailment." Jiang Ling Su lay down on the lounge chair next to Qi Yuan, she didn't withdraw her hand, she felt her senior brother's hand was very warm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes fell on Jiang Ling Su's pale face.</p><p></p><p>【This is an ordinary young girl, she is a bit cold now.】</p><p></p><p>The eye's prompt for intelligent beings was random, and Qi Yuan couldn't see anything special about his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, are you cold? Let me warm you up with my passion." Qi Yuan said, activating his Five Elements Fire to slowly transmit it to Jiang Ling Su.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su was a rich young lady and Qi Yuan's junior sister, she had even helped Qi Yuan shoulder a big black pot last time.</p><p></p><p>Of course he should be considerate of his own junior sister.</p><p></p><p>The warm energy spreading from the senior brother's hand, Jiang Ling Su felt warm, a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect her senior brother could also alleviate her pain.</p><p></p><p>She said, "This ailment of mine requires a Water Attribute Heavenly Spirit Root Violet Palace Realm cultivator to cure.</p><p></p><p>It's not as painful now, thank you senior brother."</p><p></p><p>"Violet Palace Realm?" Qi Yuan was surprised, "When I reach the Great Dao Immortal Realm, I'll definitely find a Violet Palace Realm cultivator to treat your injury."</p><p></p><p>"Pfft... Ugh..." Jiang Ling Su's face couldn't help but smile, then showed a painful expression, "Senior brother, don't talk anymore, it hurts my chest when I laugh."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and felt quite wronged.</p><p></p><p>He was being sincere, but ended up being seen as a joke.</p><p></p><p>"Should I help you massage remotely?" Remembering how he had been too forward with his junior sister last time, this time Qi Yuan felt his words were quite high in emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>The "remotely" word showed his gentlemanly manner, without being too presumptuous towards the lady.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Jiang Ling Su really wanted to sew up her senior brother's mouth with a needle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent at her words.</p><p></p><p>He didn't argue with the sick.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was reflecting on where exactly he had said something wrong, to make his junior sister so unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that "remotely", although graceful, seemed to lack sincerity?</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, thank you." Jiang Ling Su said softly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"I have good news to tell you, I helped you apply to join the Divine Flower Association, and the application has been approved."</p><p></p><p>"..." Qi Yuan nodded, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"This is the credential of the Divine Flower Association." Jiang Ling Su took a specially made jade slip out of her pocket with her left hand and said, "This jade slip is worth ten thousand spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Just this credential was worth ten thousand spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>It was comparable to a Nascent Soul Immortal Artifact.</p><p></p><p>This junior sister was really too rich! No wonder ordinary people couldn't join the Divine Flower Association, they couldn't even afford this credential.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't speak now, he really wanted to throw out the "Little Wealthy Wife" card to express his respect for the rich young lady.</p><p></p><p>"Here, from now on you are a member of the Divine Flower Association." Jiang Ling Su handed the jade slip to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the jade slip and heard Jiang Ling Su say, "Differentiate a wisp of divine soul into it, and the jade slip will recognize you as the owner.</p><p></p><p>The functions of this jade slip are not just a credential, you know.</p><p></p><p>Except for some special places, our Divine Flower Association members can communicate through this jade slip no matter where they are."</p><p></p><p>He followed Jiang Ling Su's instructions and differentiated a wisp of divine soul into it, and the jade slip immediately recognized him as the owner.</p><p></p><p>A flood of information rushed into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just like QQ plus a forum?</p><p></p><p>He found that this jade slip was like a mobile phone, with many modules.</p><p></p><p>One module was like QQ, an enhanced version of the ordinary communication jade slips, with more functions.</p><p></p><p>And there was also a place for Divine Flower Association members to communicate, just like a forum.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit surprised, even if the cultivators didn't activate the technology tree, many things were still the same.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su's eyes showed a proud smile: "Senior brother, is this the first time you've seen such a high-level jade slip? What do you think of it?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

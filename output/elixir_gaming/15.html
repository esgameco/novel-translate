        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>"What do you all think is the most precious foundation-building spiritual object in the world?"</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the disciples below, exuding an air of a highly accomplished cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Nine Heavens Divine Thunder Fruit?" a female disciple tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Renshan said, "The Nine Heavens Divine Thunder Fruit is rumored to only be born in the Nine Heavens Thunder Realm, an upper-grade foundation-building spiritual object that can be considered rare in the world, but it is still a bit distant from being the most precious."</p><p></p><p>"Star Tear?"</p><p></p><p>"Primal Chaos Origin Qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Bone?"</p><p></p><p>The many disciples on the scene all mentioned some extremely precious foundation-building spiritual objects.</p><p></p><p>These foundation-building spiritual objects were all just legendary precious ones.</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan looked at the constantly pondering Qi Yuan and asked, "Qi Yuan, what do you think it is?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan replied, "Since it is the Heavenly Dao foundation-building, shouldn't it be related to the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan praised, "You're right, Heavenly Dao foundation-building, the required foundation-building spiritual object should be..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly felt a great enlightenment, as if his mind had been opened.</p><p></p><p>He felt like his brain had grown! </p><p></p><p>He was about to comprehend it! His expression became excited and somewhat frenzied.</p><p></p><p>"I've comprehended it, the Heavenly Dao foundation-building, it's actually like this."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan solemnly paid his respects to Xu Renshan as a disciple, then took his leave.</p><p></p><p>The inspiration was fleeting, he had to hurry back to record it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan saw this scene and revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>He continued to explain to the rest of the Shenguang Sect disciples, "There is a rare object in the world called the Heavenly Vein Qi, rumored to be a wisp of qi that has overflowed from the descent of the Heavenly Dao, obtaining it can forge the Heavenly Dao foundation."</p><p></p><p>These were things Xu Renshan had seen in ancient texts.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Vein Qi is the most precious foundation-building spiritual object."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan sat blankly, his brain unusually rapidly processing.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao foundation-building..."</p><p></p><p>"So-called Heavenly Dao foundation-building is actually using the Heavenly Dao as the foundation-building spiritual object."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had comprehended it, his brain had grown. If his goal wasn't so grand, perhaps the Heavenly Dao of this world would directly bestow blessings, allowing him to gather the Five Flowers.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao loved him too much, not only the Three Flowers but also an additional two.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his head, looking at the sky, with a puzzled expression: "But... how do I refine the Heavenly Dao into my foundation-building spiritual object?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what the Heavenly Dao tastes like, is it delicious or not."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no one responded to him.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of the Heavenly Dao, I seemed to have obtained a fragment of the Heavenly Dao in the XuanYuan Forbidden Land, can that be used as a foundation-building spiritual object?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's spirit was stirred, discovering something extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>That game jade slip was not just a game to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But he was lazy, too lazy to think deeply about it.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since I played games, activate!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan entered the game again.</p><p></p><p>This time, as usual, Qi Yuan was buried in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Opening the chat interface, he saw a message from Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a smile at the corners of his mouth: "Didn't I tell you, the XuanYuan Forbidden Land is now in my shape, you can take whatever you want inside."</p><p></p><p>He was quite generous.</p><p></p><p>The most precious thing in the XuanYuan Forbidden Land, he had already taken.</p><p></p><p>As for those so-called spirit herbs, they were just snacks to him.</p><p></p><p>The ones that didn't taste good, he didn't want.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those spirit herbs were not as effective as killing a monster.</p><p></p><p>He replied again: "Those spirit herbs are of average value, the most valuable things are the fierce beasts, killing one can give a lot of experience, leveling up quickly."</p><p></p><p>However, after sending the message, Qi Yuan felt a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>That Jin Li was probably at a relatively low level, unable to defeat those monsters.</p><p></p><p>"If you have time, come to the Yiguan Forbidden Land, I'll take you to grind monsters, I have to say, there are really a lot of monsters here."</p><p></p><p>After sending the message, Qi Yuan left the pit.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now he has reached level 82.</p><p></p><p>But in the Yiguan Forbidden Area, one still needs to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>The minor monsters in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area fight individually, but those in the Yiguan Forbidden Area do not.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to grind the game again," </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured. The cultivation progress in the game will have a weak feedback effect on his real-world body.</p><p></p><p>So his continuous level grinding in the game.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there is another issue - after clearing a dungeon, he can obtain rewards.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Fragments are what he hopes to obtain the most now. </p><p></p><p>That is his foundation-building spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>With this mindset, he begins to diligently grind the monsters.</p><p></p><p>"The Yiguan Demonic Cultivators in the Yiguan Forbidden Area mostly appear together, I need to find the lone ones to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ponders.</p><p></p><p>If the Yiguan Demonic Cultivators unite together in large numbers, they can surround and kill him.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area, Qi Yuan was once carelessly injured, and his game character's condition was poor for several days, which also had some impact on his real self.</p><p></p><p>So he must be careful.</p><p></p><p>"Stealth!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan enters a stealth state.</p><p></p><p>At level 82, his combat power has been continuously rising, and he has also obtained many game skills. </p><p></p><p>Of course, if placed in the Immortal Cultivation world, they could be called divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>He has mainly obtained two major skills and eight minor skills.</p><p></p><p>Every 30 levels, he gains a major skill.</p><p>Every 10 levels, he gains a minor skill.</p><p></p><p>The two major skills Qi Yuan has obtained are "Heavenly Slash" and "Tyrannical Strength".</p><p></p><p>Stealth is a minor skill that allows him to conceal his form and move quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the Yiguan Forbidden Area, Qi Yuan passes through many forests and sees many strange Yiguan Demonic Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Especially in a certain forest, he faintly feels as if he has not entered a forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>In the dense forest, there are numerous trees. </p><p></p><p>On each tree hang colorful bras and panties, fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>This scene is extremely hilarious.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Qi Yuan also sees many pairs of underwear.</p><p></p><p>If certain perverts come here, they would definitely be overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>But if they dare to touch those bras, their end would be tragic.</p><p></p><p>None of these bras are below level 30.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly leaves this place.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Qi Yuan finally stops his steps.</p><p></p><p>"I finally found a place where 'clothes' are rarely seen!"</p><p></p><p>He sees more than ten Yiguan Demonic Cultivators of levels 30 to 50 washing clothes by the river.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouts loudly, "Demonic cultivators, behold my sword!"</p><p></p><p>The golden sword instantly grows to several zhang (Chinese unit of length) in size.</p><p></p><p>The huge sword sweeps out a gale, even overturning the water in the river.</p><p></p><p>As the sword falls on those Yiguan Demonic Cultivators, it smashes them into pieces with a cracking sound.</p><p></p><p>Experience +100.</p><p>Experience +300.</p><p>...</p><p>Experience +200.</p><p></p><p>At level 82, Qi Yuan can be said to be one-shotting these low-level Yiguan Demonic Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad." Qi Yuan pats his hands, "I can go find other Yiguan Demonic Cultivators now."</p><p></p><p>Before taking action, he activates a minor skill to conceal the commotion, so as not to attract the attention of other Yiguan Demonic Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, what Qi Yuan didn't expect was that as soon as he left, over a hundred Yiguan Demonic Cultivators came rushing towards this place.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also senses that many Yiguan Demonic Cultivators from all directions are also rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>He is stunned: "How did I expose myself?"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly starts running.</p><p></p><p>If he gets surrounded, the outcome will certainly be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

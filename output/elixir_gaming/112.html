        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"My lord..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she opened her eyes, her forehead covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the blood sphere in the distance, a trace of disappointment flashing in her eyes. </p><p></p><p>He had left.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, ripples appeared in the space.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red figure materialized, condensing into a man: "Ning Tao, how did you get mixed up with the Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>The man also had a black hood covering his head, concealing his face.</p><p></p><p>He and Ning Tao were both among the Thirteen Demons of the North, and his name was He Wu.</p><p></p><p>"He is not the Blood Demon," Ning Tao said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"All the supreme beings of the North have determined he is the Blood Demon, so he is the Blood Demon!" He Wu said.</p><p></p><p>As two of the Thirteen Demons of the North, they were different from other supreme beings and did not concern themselves with the Blood Demon's affairs.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Blood Demon's devastation of the world was something that would happen many hundreds of years in the future.</p><p></p><p>But the crisis they faced was imminent.</p><p></p><p>He Wu looked at Ning Tao: "In your current state, I'm afraid you won't last a hundred years before perishing. </p><p></p><p>When the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences reappears, how will you survive? If you can't maintain your peak strength, fighting for a hundred days will only lead to death."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao fell silent briefly. She didn't continue on that topic, but instead asked: "Have you found out who secretly spread the news that the Blood Demon was in the Heavenly Heart Palace? Which of my great enemies was it?"</p><p></p><p>The news that the Blood Demon was in the Heavenly Heart Palace had spread throughout the North, leading to Ning Tao being surrounded and attacked. There was someone behind this.</p><p></p><p>"It's suspected to be the Purple Daoist," He Wu replied.</p><p></p><p>"Him?" Ning Tao sneered, killing intent flashing in her eyes. "I have no grudge against him, why would he frame me?"</p><p></p><p>"Do we Thirteen Demons need to have a grudge with someone for them to hate us? Aren't we all despised by heaven and loathed by people?" He Wu laughed self-mockingly.</p><p></p><p>From birth, people like them with the character for "demon" carved on their faces were hated by everyone.</p><p></p><p>Did others need a reason to frame them?</p><p></p><p>This was original sin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City of No Return, Qi Yuan returned after slaying demon spawn. A fierce look flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than say the blood sphere is the Blood Demon, it would be more accurate to say that I... am the Blood Demon." Qi Yuan examined himself internally.</p><p></p><p>In his soul, the source of evil was accumulating more and more, growing from its initial grain-sized form to the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan wasn't exerting all his effort to control it, if he gave it free rein, he would surely become a terrifying demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a player, not some damn Blood Demon." Qi Yuan pushed aside his previous emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Big bro, you're back?" Just then, a frivolous voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan, dressed in white robes, leapt down from the city wall with a bright smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Chen Huan, Qi Yuan said helplessly: "I'm not becoming sworn brothers with you. I'm not that childish."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man before him had come to the City of No Return five years ago.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan's identity was also quite unusual - he was one of the White Emperor's three thousand disciples.</p><p></p><p>After coming to the City of No Return and hearing about Qi Yuan's exploits from Yuan Qi, as well as witnessing Qi Yuan in action a few times, Chen Huan had been insisting on becoming sworn brothers with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How could he, a noble player, become sworn brothers with an NPC? It would be utterly ridiculous if word got out.</p><p></p><p>"Big bro, look, I'm at the peak of the Earthly Immortal realm. Who knows, I might break through to the Supreme realm any day now.</p><p></p><p>Having a Supreme realm little brother would give you so much face, wouldn't it?" Chen Huan had an easygoing personality and was quite familiar.</p><p></p><p>"I... don't care about face." Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered with Chen Huan. His form flickered and he appeared on top of the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan followed him up to the wall. He gazed out at the vast desert: "Big bro has guarded the City of No Return alone for seventy years. It truly makes this little brother admire you.</p><p></p><p>But it's only because I haven't broken through to the Supreme realm yet. If I do break through, and you try to become sworn brothers with me then, who do you think you'd be to me?"</p><p></p><p>"You've been saying that for five years now. How come I haven't seen you break through to the Supreme realm?" Qi Yuan looked at Chen Huan with disdain. "Don't tell me someone can be stuck at the peak of Earthly Immortal for a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan had already been at the peak of Earthly Immortal a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan wasn't in a hurry: "Big bro, becoming Supreme isn't so easy.</p><p></p><p>To become Supreme, one must comprehend the origin.</p><p></p><p>First, one must comprehend the essence of human-demon power; second, one must find their own path within human-demon power and awaken an origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>These two things are incredibly difficult, like ascending to heaven!"</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, to become a Purple Mansion cultivator, one had to comprehend the essence of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm, it was comprehending human-demon power.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so difficult?" Qi Yuan felt Chen Huan still couldn't compare to the Four Emperors of the Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman and the Great Sun Flame Emperor, even the Rogue Immortal Venerable would probably be stronger than Chen Huan based on talent.</p><p></p><p>After all, to compare oneself to an Immortal Venerable, what kind of great power was that?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Rogue Immortal Venerable couldn't enter the game world. Otherwise, Qi Yuan would have put the Rogue Immortal Venerable in front of Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>Let the Rogue Immortal Venerable demonstrate to Chen Huan what a true genius was.</p><p></p><p>"It's difficult." A heavy expression appeared on Chen Huan's face.</p><p></p><p>Both conditions were very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Especially the first one, comprehending the essence of human-demon power.</p><p></p><p>If one could successfully comprehend the first condition, a cultivator without too great ambitions could easily step into the Supreme realm without pursuing a powerful origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan happened to be that type without ambition.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after squandering a hundred years, he still had not succeeded.</p><p></p><p>"I actually think human-demon power is quite simple. It's the later origin divine abilities that are somewhat difficult," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After observing the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, his human-demon dao had reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>What was the essence of human-demon power? Qi Yuan felt he understood it better than even the White Emperor and the Venerable.</p><p></p><p>As for origin divine abilities, that was more complicated.</p><p></p><p>During the time of ultimate destruction, Qi Yuan had faced nearly three thousand old men and witnessed all kinds of origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Each origin divine ability was a path walked out on the foundation of the origin.</p><p></p><p>Some origin divine abilities were weak, while others were strong.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Qi Yuan didn't want the origin divine ability he awakened at level 120 to be too weak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan would carefully consider the path of his origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>When returning from the game world, only part of his cultivation returned to his main body.</p><p></p><p>However, the skills remained with his main body.</p><p></p><p>Skills like Heaven-Cleaving Sword Draw, Death Radiance, and Domineering Force were actually divine abilities that could only be used at the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could use them at the Foundation Establishment stage and quickly kill Divine Embryo stage opponents, which had a lot to do with this.</p><p></p><p>If he entered above level 120 in the game world and gained his own origin divine ability,</p><p></p><p>Then even at Foundation Establishment stage, he could possess an origin divine ability equivalent to the Purple Mansion realm.</p><p></p><p>Without an origin divine ability, Qi Yuan could only passively endure attacks from Purple Mansion cultivators of the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>Because only origin divine abilities could harm Purple Mansion cultivators protected by origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, a powerful origin divine ability was very necessary.</p><p></p><p>Currently, even if Qi Yuan could dodge the origin divine ability attacks of Supreme beings, he still couldn't harm them when facing them.</p><p></p><p>When Ning Tao encountered danger, he could only move his lips.</p><p></p><p>Right now, Qi Yuan had not yet seen his future path and could not awaken an origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>As for the essence of human-demon power, it was the simplest thing for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Big bro, you sure can boast. Human-demon power is simple? If it was really that simple, I'm afraid Supreme beings in this world would be as common as dogs," Chen Huan looked at Qi Yuan with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored Chen Huan and narrowed his eyes to look ahead.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan also seemed to notice something. The smile disappeared from his face as he looked in the direction Qi Yuan was looking.</p><p></p><p>They saw a streak of light flash across the horizon. A terrifying aura spread out, pressuring the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The light stopped eight miles from the City of No Return. As the radiance dissipated, a woman in a water-blue long dress appeared.</p><p></p><p>With sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, she emanated a sharp sword intent.</p><p></p><p>She stood in the yellow sand. Qi Yuan seemed to see an unawakened sword.</p><p></p><p>[Huang Mengling, Level 119.]</p><p></p><p>"Guardian of the City of No Return, heed my command!" Huang Mengling stretched out her hand and a golden imperial edict appeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Looking for him? But... as a player, why should he take orders? Whose orders?</p><p></p><p>He didn't move.</p><p></p><p>The air was somewhat silent. Chen Huan called out at this time: "Senior Sister, why have you come to the Yu Province? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chen Huan's voice, Huang Mengling's expression remained cold.</p><p></p><p>"The situation in the battle between North and South has changed. The five great Supreme beings have ordered all guardians in Yu Province to abandon their guarded cities and go to the City of Great Sorrow!" Huang Mengling's voice rang out clearly. "Within a hundred days, you must reach the City of Great Sorrow to defend against the Northern Demon Controllers."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan's expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>Had the situation in Yu Province become so tense?</p><p></p><p>The Supreme beings had actually issued orders to abandon the cities of Yu Province and retreat together to the City of Great Sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, can you give us some inside information?" Chen Huan was thick-skinned.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling's expression remained unchanged: "On the Thousand Cities Battlefield, three new Supreme beings have come from the North. One of them is even a Great Supreme."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Chen Huan's expression changed upon hearing this. "A Great Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Great Supreme, refers to the peak of Supreme realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that, apart from the White Emperor and the Sovereign, Great Supremes are already the most powerful experts in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Why would a Great Supreme suddenly come to the Thousand Cities region?" Chen Huan was surprised. </p><p></p><p>In the battlefield of 108,000 cities, the Thousand Cities region was just an unremarkable area. Having a few Supreme realm experts stationed there was already quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>But now, a Great Supreme had arrived, which was very strange.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know about this matter either," Huang Mengling said coldly. "Please leave Wugui City quickly and head to Dabei City!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan anxiously looked at Qi Yuan: "Big brother, why don't we leave? If a Supreme descends, we won't be able to resist at all with our meager strength."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan showed an unconcerned expression: "I'm not leaving."</p><p></p><p>He had been stationed in Wugui City for so many years, and naturally wouldn't leave.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan hurriedly tried to persuade him: "You also know how critical the situation is now. With a Great Supreme descending, all thousand cities are retreating. If you alone stay here, you'll be extremely conspicuous."</p><p></p><p>"You can't convince me, so don't bother," Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>What Chen Huan said made a lot of sense. Anyone with a normal mind would leave Wugui City and go to Dabei City to concentrate all forces in one place.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although Qi Yuan's mind was very normal, he was playing a game, so how could he leave?</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan became a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Huang Mengling's eyes showed a surprised look, but she continued speaking: "Junior brother, if he doesn't want to go, then let him be. I still need to notify other cities, you should come with me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan's face showed a conflicted expression.</p><p></p><p>"You go ahead," Qi Yuan also said.</p><p></p><p>This Chen Huan talked too much, constantly chattering in his ear, disturbing the peace.</p><p></p><p>"No." Chen Huan made up his mind and shouted to Huang Mengling, "Senior sister, you go first, I'll wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling continued: "The Thousand Cities region is retreating and gathering at Dabei City. If you stay here, no one will support you. You will be an isolated force cut off from the rest. Even if you two luckily break through to the Supreme realm, you will still inevitably die."</p><p></p><p>These words were directed at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't discern Qi Yuan's strength, but roughly guessed it was similar to Chen Huan's.</p><p></p><p>Generally, peak Terrestrial Divine realm experts often take risks in order to break through to the next level.</p><p></p><p>She guessed that Qi Yuan staying in Wugui City was to accumulate power, cultivate his Origin Divine Ability, and break through to the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>But the chances of success this way were almost zero.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, with a Great Supreme descending, even if he broke through to Supreme, death would be the only outcome.</p><p></p><p>After finishing speaking, Huang Mengling's figure turned into a streak of light, disappearing into the vast desert.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched that streak of light and asked: "Is she also a disciple of the White Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, she's my senior sister!" Mentioning Huang Mengling, Chen Huan's eyes showed admiration. "She's not like me as a disciple. I've been in the White Emperor Palace for a thousand years but haven't even seen Master's face. Senior sister is different, she has met Master. Senior sister's comprehension of Origin is already seven or eight tenths complete. I'm afraid it won't be long before she enters the Supreme realm."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan thought of something and couldn't help asking, "Since your senior sister has comprehended Origin, why don't you ask her to tell you what Origin is? Wouldn't you then be able to enter the Supreme realm too?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan looked at Qi Yuan like he was an idiot: "Forget about whether senior sister would tell me or not, just talking about Origin... what others tell you is useless, you need to comprehend it yourself. To be honest, sometimes I wonder if there's something wrong with your head. You don't even know such basic things."</p><p></p><p>"What others tell is useless?" Qi Yuan was surprised. "Isn't it useful?"</p><p></p><p>When he was teaching at Mount Jiupan, he had also explained some things about Origin.</p><p></p><p>At that time, several cultivators who were already strong in cultivation comprehended some Origin.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan talked more about the "Demon Trapping Technique". If he had fully explained Origin powers like human and demon force, many people would likely have completely comprehended it on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"If Origin could be passed on by word of mouth, wouldn't there be Supreme experts everywhere in the world?" Chen Huan replied.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't speak anymore. He looked at Chen Huan, lost in thought about something.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Twenty days passed, and Chen Huan hurriedly came before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"All the cities in the Yu Province region have evacuated. Are you still not leaving?" Chen Huan's face looked a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat steadily in Wugui City like a turtle: "No rush. By the way, do you know which Great Supreme has come to the Thousand Cities region this time?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of Wu Tong.</p><p></p><p>When Wu Tong attacked before, he brought a Supreme realm Origin Divine Ability strike.</p><p></p><p>That incident was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if it had any connection to this Great Supreme coming here.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Daoist," Chen Huan said with a serious expression. "This expert is considered top-tier even among Great Supremes."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan thought of that purple water droplet.</p><p></p><p>Was it the person who had schemed against him? There was a good chance it was.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was or not, they were all enemies!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out a notebook from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?" Chen Huan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I'm writing him down in my little notebook."</p><p></p><p>When offended, Qi Yuan would definitely write it down.</p><p></p><p>After all, his memory would sometimes temporarily fail, and he couldn't forget his enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Chen Huan laughed. "You're not planning to make this notebook a family heirloom and have your descendants seek trouble with Purple Daoist, are you?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't think Qi Yuan would have a chance to kill Purple Daoist in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"When I level up to 120, killing him will be like slaughtering a dog!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he could exert power above level 120 by relying on Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>However, he still didn't have an Origin Divine Ability, so he couldn't defeat a Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"That's a Great Supreme. Even if you cultivate for thousands of years, you won't be a match!" Chen Huan said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered for a moment: "What you say makes some sense. I can't kill Purple Daoist for now."</p><p></p><p>"You really dare to imagine. I say we should run away quickly. After entering the Supreme realm, we can come back for revenge," Chen Huan urged again.</p><p></p><p>As for becoming a Supreme, he felt it was unthinkable within a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Even when the North-South battle ended, he might not have entered the Supreme realm yet.</p><p></p><p>In the grand scheme of things, he was merely like a grain of sand.</p><p></p><p>Even if he became a Supreme, he would just be a slightly larger grain of sand.</p><p></p><p>"Run away? Wrong! Now I need to formulate a meticulous hunting plan targeting Purple Daoist!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"...You really dare to imagine. That's a Great Supreme! The gap between Supreme and Terrestrial Divine is even bigger than the gap between us and ordinary people. As long as their Origin doesn't perish, we can't harm a Supreme at all!" Chen Huan said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you listen to my plan? After hearing it, you'll definitely be impressed by my wisdom and strongly approve of me." If Chen Huan wasn't a part of the plan, Qi Yuan wouldn't have revealed the plan to an NPC at all.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me about it." Chen Huan's face showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"A meticulous plan requires deep thinking from me. If I tell you directly, there might be flaws. I'd better write it down for you to see." Qi Yuan always felt he wasn't good at expressing himself verbally.</p><p></p><p>Important things should still be written down.</p><p></p><p>He took the pen and scribbled furiously in the notebook, writing frantically.</p><p></p><p>His expression was serious, sometimes pondering, sometimes frowning.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan stood to the side. It was the first time he had seen Qi Yuan so serious.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... a super invincible plan?</p><p></p><p>Using one thread to string together multiple Supremes, then using counter-espionage tactics and all sorts of messy things to plot to kill a Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!" Qi Yuan held the notebook, looking more and more pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>If he had written such a perfect plan on Blue Star, he would definitely be sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was a cultivator, naturally he wouldn't sweat.</p><p></p><p>But to create atmosphere, he still let small pearls of sweat drip down his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see." Chen Huan was full of anticipation as he took the notebook from Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>He held it with both hands, seriously looking at Qi Yuan's great plan.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>He was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"That's it?" Chen Huan was very speechless. "What a bullshit plan, and completely impractical. My great-great-great-granddaughter could write a better plan than this!"</p><p></p><p>[Days 1-10: Teach Chen Huan Origin, help Chen Huan break through to Supreme realm;</p><p></p><p>Days 11-20: Go out to find isolated Supremes, have Chen Huan hunt and kill them with Origin Divine Abilities while I give guidance from the side, and finally I personally collect the kills.</p><p></p><p>Days 21-100: Continue this for a long time, kill Supremes, accumulate experience, comprehend Origin, break through to Supreme realm, kill Purple Daoist.]</p><p></p><p>Receiving this comment, Qi Yuan immediately reflected on himself. After a long while, he suddenly realized: "I know, is it because I didn't mark the task difficulty? I'll mark it now!"</p><p></p><p>"..." Chen Huan sighed and said, "Your plan is too fantastical. Just look at the first step of the plan - teaching me Origin and helping me enter the Supreme realm. Is that even possible?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

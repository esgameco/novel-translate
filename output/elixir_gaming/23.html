        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Aunt Qin first tried doing push-ups.</p><p></p><p>She carried a ladder on her back and bent down.</p><p></p><p>Her palms touched the dirt, and she felt there was nothing mysterious about it.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... it's just nonsense?"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Aunt Qin began doing push-ups.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that a person wearing brocade and silk clothes doing push-ups felt quite incongruous.</p><p></p><p>In less than a single breath, Aunt Qin had already completed a push-up.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Qin originally had a resigned smile on her face, because during the process of doing the push-ups, she did not feel the circulation of her inner energy and true essence.</p><p></p><p>Without these, how could she become stronger?</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, as soon as she finished a push-up, a special change occurred instantly.</p><p></p><p>Jinli hurriedly asked, "How is it, Aunt Qin?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Aunt Qin was directly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This old body... this old body feels... as if it has become a little stronger."</p><p></p><p>"What?" The people present exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be that doing exercise can make one stronger?</p><p></p><p>"How much stronger is it?" Huaxian quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid that Aunt Qin, out of consideration for the Empress Jinli's face, would give an ambiguous answer.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Qin then seriously said, "Just one push-up is equivalent to half an hour of my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"What!" The people present were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>One push-up is equivalent to half an hour of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this too exaggerated? "Doesn't this mean that without a thousand push-ups, it can be compared to a year of cultivation?" Huaxian calculated and was suddenly greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"If this is true, then by cultivating here for a day, it can be equivalent to ten years of cultivation outside?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Doing push-ups can improve one's cultivation?</p><p></p><p>What is the principle behind this? Where has such a thing happened before?</p><p></p><p>It is simply incomprehensible! It's as if saying that by eating a meal, drinking some water, or passing gas, one can break through their cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Although the crowd was shocked and puzzled, they still began to do exercises one after another.</p><p></p><p>So these thirty trusted aides all started doing exercises, carrying ladders on their backs in the XuanYuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>They were all cultivators with strong abilities, and they did push-ups at an extremely fast pace, "push-ups" like flying.</p><p></p><p>This scene was extremely shocking.</p><p></p><p>If the people from Qi Yuan's previous world were to see this, they would definitely exclaim "Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it were a video, the comments would be "Nothing special," "I can do it too!" "I have a friend..."</p><p></p><p>After all, that is the comment section, where all kinds of extraordinary talents gather.</p><p></p><p>"I... broke through!"</p><p>"The bottleneck that has confined me for three years has finally been broken!"</p><p>"Doing push-ups is very beneficial for breaking through bottlenecks!"</p><p></p><p>The people present were all extremely surprised, quickly doing push-ups and sharing their feelings.</p><p></p><p>In just half an hour, more than thirty people present had three consecutive breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Two of them were breakthroughs in minor realms, and one was a breakthrough in a major realm.</p><p></p><p>"Go try other exercises as well."</p><p></p><p>These people naturally did not just do push-ups, but also tried other exercises.</p><p></p><p>Pull-ups, carrying ladders on their backs, were a bit difficult, but they could still do it.</p><p></p><p>And doing pull-ups could also improve their cultivation, with different focuses.</p><p></p><p>Some people chose pull-ups, while others chose push-ups.</p><p></p><p>"But what about sit-ups? How do we do them with the ladder on our backs?"</p><p></p><p>"Carrying the ladder on your back? You don't necessarily have to do it that way, you can also use your feet!"</p><p></p><p>"Stand the ladder up and hook your feet around it to do sit-ups!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd carefully tried it out.</p><p></p><p>The result was that it really worked, and they could also quickly increase their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Some people even placed the ladder horizontally in the air and hooked their feet around it to do sit-ups.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were all cultivators, and even poses that would be difficult for dance students, they could easily perform.</p><p></p><p>On the scene, the crowd kept doing exercises, push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups... with great enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at Qin Aunt and asked, "Qin Aunt, how are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qin Aunt's complexion was ruddy, and her cultivation had become even more profound.</p><p></p><p>She continued her exercises: "This old body feels... extraordinary! Perhaps even the supreme imperial masters may not have such techniques. His Majesty's good friend is truly an extraordinary person from the outside world."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Qi Yuan, Jinli's expression became somewhat complex, and a strong sense of inferiority overwhelmed her.</p><p></p><p>However, considering her current predicament, she had no time to think about other things.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Aunt, about how long do you think it will take for you to break through to the Imperial Realm here?" Jinli asked.</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching the Imperial Realm could they decisively win the upcoming battle in a few days.</p><p></p><p>"In just two days, I will be able to step into the Imperial Realm!" Qin Aunt said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she was already in the late King Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, the cultivation advancement was as easy as drinking water.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Imperial Realm was no big deal! That's the Imperial Realm, after all!</p><p></p><p>She was inwardly extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jinli felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the group and said softly, "There's something I forgot to tell you all.</p><p></p><p>While doing these exercises to improve your cultivation in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, there are certain side effects."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, the initial joy of the people present was somewhat dampened.</p><p></p><p>Ah, that makes sense.</p><p></p><p>If there were no side effects, being able to increase their cultivation so much would be unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to die for His Majesty!" they exclaimed in unison, as if they were ready to face death without regret.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, such a miraculous way of increasing cultivation must have terrifying side effects.</p><p></p><p>Qin Aunt also said solemnly, "To die for His Majesty, without any regrets!"</p><p></p><p>Jinli, seeing this, was both touched and somewhat amused: "The side effects are not that terrible, it won't make you all die."</p><p></p><p>The people present felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>The Forbidden Army Commander, Hua Xian, looked at Jinli and slowly asked, "May I ask what the side effect is?"</p><p></p><p>"Becoming stronger... may result in hair loss."</p><p></p><p>"Hair loss?"</p><p></p><p>"Just hair loss?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that it?"</p><p></p><p>The people were shocked.</p><p></p><p>What shocked them was... that's it? With such a massive increase in cultivation, the only side effect was just hair loss.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention hair loss, for the sake of improving their strength, some people in the Southern Qian Kingdom even self-castrated to cultivate evil techniques.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, losing some hair was nothing! At this time, a woman who had previously broken through a realm barrier said with a smile, "When I broke through the realm barrier before, I lost a dozen or so hairs, and I didn't know the reason behind it. I never expected it to be like this."</p><p></p><p>Not just a dozen hairs, even if they lost all their body hair during a major realm breakthrough, they would still be willing to do it.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, a female Forbidden Army soldier who was bald suddenly said, "I don't have any hair... what am I going to lose?"</p><p></p><p>The others looked at each other, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to hunt down the Yiguan Demons.</p><p></p><p>After his recent efforts, he had now reached level 88.</p><p></p><p>He slew a Yiguan Demon with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these Yiguan Demons could not speak or scream in agony.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"It hurts!" he cried out in anguish, his face contorted in pain as he clutched his abdomen. "My body is... about to be cut apart."</p><p></p><p>However, soon after, seeing the Yiguan Demon completely shattered, he revealed a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm such a good person."</p><p></p><p>"Seeing that you're mute and can't speak, I specially provided the voice-over for you."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll be a voice actor for a day."</p><p></p><p>He said, then raised his sword and charged towards the Yiguan Demons again.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Shattering Skull!"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Xiang River Sword Rain!"</p><p>"It hurts!"</p><p>"Divine Dragon Spin!"</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

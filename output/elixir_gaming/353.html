        <h1>Chapter 353</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao's expression was joyful, with a hint of vigor and confidence.</p><p></p><p>This trip to Tianyue had been quite fruitful. </p><p></p><p>Not only did he obtain the precious Tianfang demon blood, but he was also about to receive a major opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Let's drink to this!"</p><p></p><p>The three people present were all quite happy, and drained their cups in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a calm voice suddenly rang out in the private room.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, someone actually dares to plot to kill me."</p><p></p><p>The voice appeared abruptly, causing the expressions of the three people present to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>Their divine senses suddenly extended outwards, wanting to know the source of the voice. Their spiritual power burst forth in this moment, on high alert.</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, two figures appeared in the private room.</p><p></p><p>They saw a handsome man embracing a cold and beautiful woman in a black dress. The man's face clearly showed an angry expression, while the woman's demeanor was somewhat icy, seeming to carry a chill - at first glance, neither looked easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>But when her gaze fell on the man beside her, it was full of doting love and admiration.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two of them, Xiaoyao Sanren's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Because he was unable to detect the strength of these two people.</p><p></p><p>The demon race man was also like this, on extremely high alert.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt the two people before him gave him a vaguely familiar feeling.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao hurriedly bowed and said: "Seniors, have you perhaps misunderstood something? I am Jiang Qingjiao of the Fighting God Sect."</p><p></p><p>He brought up his sect's name in order to make these mysterious cultivators wary.</p><p></p><p>"What misunderstanding? My wife was just eating watermelon in the room when she suddenly heard someone say they wanted to kill me, so she brought me over here," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's eyes held a smile: "My husband speaks the truth. Just now this servant heard someone say they wanted to 'execute Qi Yuan'."</p><p></p><p>At this, a trace of killing intent appeared in Ning Tao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>When these words were spoken, the double-pupiled man from the Myriad Demons Realm seemed to realize something, and his expression changed drastically: "Divine sense hearing - you're a Yin God!"</p><p></p><p>All those who reach the realm of Yin God have the ability of divine sense hearing.</p><p></p><p>Within a certain range, if someone calls out a god's name or thinks about a god's name, the god will sense it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, ordinary cultivators don't dare to directly call out a god's name, nor would they speak ill of gods behind their backs.</p><p></p><p>Yet earlier they had casually mentioned Qi Yuan, and even used a sound-isolating formation in the private room, but it was still overheard.</p><p></p><p>If not divine sense hearing, what else could it be? Of course, there was also something strange about this.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't divine sense hearing only pick up mentions of one's own name?</p><p></p><p>How did this woman hear Qi Yuan's name?</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, what divine sense hearing picks up on is not about the person foremost in one's heart, and isn't the foremost person... oneself?</p><p></p><p>"God?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiaoyao Sanren and Jiang Qingjiao were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The woman beside Qi Yuan... was a Yin God?</p><p></p><p>"Divine One, please do not misunderstand, this is all a misunderstanding!" Jiang Qingjiao immediately knelt down.</p><p></p><p>If the other party was just a Divine Embryo, he might only be wary, not too fearful.</p><p></p><p>But the other party was a Yin God, at the same level as the founding ancestor of the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a powerful being, he could only kneel.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Sanren also did not hesitate, immediately kneeling: "It's all a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>"A misunderstanding? Are you saying my wife is hearing things?" Qi Yuan got angry.</p><p></p><p>He naturally had complete faith in Ning Tao's words.</p><p></p><p>"No..." Jiang Qingjiao's mind was in chaos, he really didn't know how to explain.</p><p></p><p>After all, they really did have killing intent towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But who knew Qi Yuan's wife was a Yin God venerable one.</p><p></p><p>Why would such a venerable one remain in the lower realm instead of ascending to the upper realm?</p><p></p><p>"Seniors, we..."</p><p></p><p>"He's already stated his background, now it's your turn," Qi Yuan looked at the double-pupiled man and Xiaoyao Sanren.</p><p></p><p>He had taken note of the Fighting God Sect's name.</p><p></p><p>This sect's name was chosen rather arrogantly, it needed to be taught a lesson.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see what backgrounds the other two had.</p><p></p><p>These three were so bold as to plot against him, he didn't believe there wasn't someone backing them.</p><p></p><p>"This junior is but a wandering cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"I'm... an independent cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"One truth, one lie, it doesn't matter," Qi Yuan shook his head, "In any case... you can all die now."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please spare us!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao begged desperately, but when he heard Qi Yuan's voice, his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"He must be putting on an act, what kind of Yin God is he!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Qingjiao burned with determination, unleashing his strongest technique.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xiaoyao Sanren also understood that at this point, going all out was their only hope.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power surged around the two of them, emitting intense light.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao had already reached the Elemental Core realm.</p><p></p><p>And Xiaoyao Sanren was a legendary Pseudo-Nascent Soul powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The power of their attacks was shocking, enough to easily destroy a street.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan yawned: "They look so cute when they're angry, just like my cat when its fur stands on end."</p><p></p><p>When one is too weak, anger and rage appear cute in the eyes of the strong.</p><p></p><p>"They're just adorably cute."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two attacking and raised his fist.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, brute force can break all techniques.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he wasn't using any techniques, only the power of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of both the martial and immortal paths to Qi Yuan's physical body had reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>No immortal techniques, no qi and blood power, just pure physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao and Xiaoyao Sanren were like metal attracted to a magnet, their bodies smashing into Qi Yuan's fist.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>Like watermelons hitting a hammer, their heads shattered before even touching Qi Yuan's fist.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were like rag dolls, red cotton bursting out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>That wasn't cotton, it wasn't even just blood. From an overall perspective, one could see that this punch had directly knocked Jiang Qingjiao and Xiaoyao Sanren's souls out of their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"They really are adorably cute."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan withdrew his hand, two corpses now on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The double-pupiled man trembled in fear, his body shaking.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a younger brother with Supreme Bone?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"N-no..." the double-pupiled man replied in confusion, but truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"No?" Qi Yuan let out a sigh of relief, "Then why aren't you adorably cute?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the double-pupiled man also perished in that moment.</p><p></p><p>A pair of eyeballs appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>His expression was rueful as he recalled a famous saying, and couldn't help but utter: "Double pupils were originally the path to invincibility, why borrow another's bones?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Fighting God Tower was located in a mountain range in Fenghai City.</p><p></p><p>This mountain was now renamed Fighting God Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The tower was a full forty stories tall, standing out in stark contrast to the surrounding mountains and trees.</p><p></p><p>The Fighting God Tower was originally the most prosperous building in downtown Fenghai City.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Fighting God Sect took a liking to this building and used his great power to forcibly uproot it and move it to Fighting God Mountain, making it the sect's base in Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>This feat was even livestreamed at the time, watched by countless netizens who exclaimed "666" in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the Fighting God Sect's fame in Qinyuan Country far surpassed that of other sects.</p><p></p><p>After all, no other sect had made such a high-profile move.</p><p></p><p>This grand gesture also led to an endless stream of people coming to the Fighting God Sect seeking to join.</p><p></p><p>On Fighting God Mountain, there was a continuous line of disciples coming to seek apprenticeship.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Yang stood inside the Fighting God Tower like a lowly henchman, wearing faded, washed-out clothes. Whenever someone approached, he would unconsciously bow his waist.</p><p></p><p>This was a habit formed from years of conditioning in society.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is mediocre, only considered low grade." The newcomer was a young man with an arrogant demeanor, carrying the haughtiness of an immortal cultivator. "You didn't pass the entrance test."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for informing me, Immortal Master." Shen Yang's face was bitter, his eyes showing disappointment.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had spent several hundred yuan to come to Fenghai City, and had queued on Doushen Mountain since midnight last night. The result... was this outcome, which made him feel quite upset.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he truly amounted to nothing. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't make money, and didn't even have talent for immortal cultivation. There was no hope for his life.</p><p></p><p>"However..." At this point, the young man changed his tone, "There's a senior disciple who has taken a liking to you. He thinks you're quite hardworking and is willing to give you a chance to follow him as a sword slave."</p><p></p><p>"Sword slave?" Shen Yang gritted his teeth, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>The term "sword slave" contained the word "slave", its status very obvious.</p><p></p><p>In the sect, their position was comparable to menial disciples. Even if killed by their master, no one would care.</p><p></p><p>"An opportunity like this won't come again if you miss it. Your talent is merely low grade. In other sects, you wouldn't even qualify as a menial disciple," the young man continued. "It's only because that senior disciple sees potential in you that he's giving you this chance."</p><p></p><p>In reality, most of what the young man said was false.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang's talent had actually met the entry requirements for the Doushen Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, that senior disciple had taken a liking to him, so he found an elder and arranged this scene.</p><p></p><p>This young man deliberately misreported Shen Yang's talent.</p><p></p><p>It was to force Shen Yang to become the senior disciple's menial disciple.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Yang thought of his elderly parents and his hopeless life: "I..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish speaking, the arrogant young man suddenly said: "Don't be in a rush to agree. Becoming the senior disciple's sword slave isn't so simple.</p><p></p><p>After all, your talent is very low.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... You only need to donate 1 million Qin yuan to become the senior disciple's sword slave.</p><p></p><p>Don't think 1 million Qin yuan is a lot. Once you become an immortal cultivator, you'll earn it back in a year.</p><p></p><p>Judging by your appearance, you probably don't have much money, but you must have a house in the city, right? Sell the house and invest in immortal cultivation. It's definitely a sure profit."</p><p></p><p>The young man seemed to have Shen Yang figured out, and directly brought up money.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had tried this routine several times before, and it never failed.</p><p></p><p>Rich people wouldn't miss 1 million, the middle class would grit their teeth and pay, and as for poor people, they would sell everything they had to give their children a chance to advance.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, when Shen Yang heard this, his expression became resolute: "I'm sorry, I don't have the money. Let's forget about this. It seems I have no fate with the immortal path."</p><p></p><p>Anything else would be fine, but asking for his money was absolutely not okay.</p><p></p><p>Let alone whether he had 1 million, the remaining money he had was for his parents' retirement.</p><p></p><p>The immortal path was full of dangers. If he took 1 million just for his own enjoyment and then died, what would happen to his parents? They wouldn't even have money for their old age.</p><p></p><p>So he flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young man's face froze. He hadn't expected this outcome: "Shen Yang, you better think this through carefully. You won't have an opportunity like this again.</p><p></p><p>You will be completely cut off from the immortal path."</p><p></p><p>"I've thought it through."</p><p></p><p>I don't have the money!</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang answered very directly.</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes flickered, a flash of killing intent passing through them.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, this Shen Yang shouldn't expect to leave Doushen Sect alive.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Shen Yang went to another sect to test his aptitude and exposed what happened here, it wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have no fate with our Doushen Sect," the young man sighed, his hand casually patting Shen Yang's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>A special scent from his hand was left on Shen Yang.</p><p></p><p>The young man had marked him, intending to personally eliminate Shen Yang after he left.</p><p></p><p>After all, Doushen Mountain was so big, surely a few deaths wouldn't matter?</p><p></p><p>Even if there was trouble, the sect would handle it.</p><p></p><p>Bidding farewell to the young man, Shen Yang walked out of the Doushen Building with a dejected expression.</p><p></p><p>The sun outside was particularly glaring. He took out his phone, preparing to book a return ticket. If he made it in time, he could still deliver food in the afternoon and evening.</p><p></p><p>He would earn whatever money he could.</p><p></p><p>However, when he turned on his phone, a message suddenly caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>He opened this video message, and his expression froze for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Do you lack love?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you lack care?"</p><p></p><p>"Has it been a long time since you've seen your grandfather or grandmother?"</p><p></p><p>The robotic voice in the video message was quite moving.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang also thought of his own grandparents.</p><p></p><p>However, they had passed away when he was very young.</p><p></p><p>"Today, you are no longer alone."</p><p></p><p>"[Grandpa Delivery Network] grand opening special offer. Anyone who participates in our [Grandpa Delivery] activity and meets the conditions can receive one or more grandfathers or grandmothers.</p><p></p><p>If you can't meet the conditions, [Grandpa Delivery Network] is also generous, willing to call you 'grandson' or 'granddaughter'..."</p><p></p><p>When he heard this, Shen Yang felt it was nonsensical, even feeling like someone was playing a prank. But when he heard that "grandson" "granddaughter", his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Because that voice was too familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this him!"</p><p></p><p>Nearly a year ago, Shen Yang had come across an account that seemed to belong to an immortal cultivator.</p><p></p><p>That immortal cultivator had posted a video, hmm, with three marriage certificates.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the video also had that man's voice, a very simple sentence.</p><p></p><p>"We're married."</p><p></p><p>At the time, Shen Yang had followed that account, even spent a huge sum to tip, and mustered the courage to leave a comment.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was no follow-up.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had watched that video no less than a hundred times. He knew that young man's voice better than anyone.</p><p></p><p>Now, this warm voice calling "grandson" "granddaughter" was that person.</p><p></p><p>His heart raced.</p><p></p><p>He quickly opened other apps, wanting to search for "Grandpa Delivery Network". He suddenly found that on various apps, platforms, and even game loading screens, there were notices saying "Grandpa Delivery Network is online".</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He saw that on various trending topics, there was also information about "Grandpa Delivery Network going online".</p><p></p><p>Those young people who wanted to join Doushen Sect had obviously also seen the information about [Grandpa Delivery Network] at this time, and there was a buzz of discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what's going on with this Grandpa Delivery Network, is it a hacker prank?"</p><p></p><p>"Delivering grandfathers, that's too much!"</p><p></p><p>"It's inexplicable, a bit ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>"Even Qin Yuan One TV is broadcasting it. Has the world finally gone crazy like I imagined?"</p><p></p><p>"Are they taking advantage of us?"</p><p></p><p>"What does delivering grandfathers and grandmothers mean?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem like a good thing. They even want us to send blood samples. Could it be some aliens trying to get our genes?"</p><p></p><p>"I think some old guy from the Seven Martial Star has health problems and needs a match, so they're collecting blood samples from the whole world for matching!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would this stingy country be willing to give us a 500 yuan subsidy?"</p><p></p><p>"The authorities have finally stopped pretending."</p><p></p><p>As soon as [Grandpa Delivery Network] went online, there was a flurry of discussion, with all kinds of speculation and doubts.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what this was all about.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Yang held his phone, his heart stirring.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that this was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After all, the person he had followed before was clearly not an ordinary person, but an immortal cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He had even existed before the descent of the three realms.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, from that person's few words, he felt that person... wasn't a great villain.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, after selling the cultivation method, he wouldn't have been considerate enough to say it was sold out.</p><p></p><p>"Should I give it a try?" Shen Yang had an idea.</p><p></p><p>After all, this didn't require 1 million yuan.</p><p></p><p>At most, it might cost him his life.</p><p></p><p>But there might be a chance... to step onto the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>This was better than spending 1 million to be a sword slave in Doushen Sect.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

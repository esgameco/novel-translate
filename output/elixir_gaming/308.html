        <h1>Chapter 308</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Mingwu Martial Arts School was decorated festively, as if there was a joyous event to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>It could indeed be considered a celebration. </p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua from the Mingwu Martial Arts School had made it into the top 10 of the city-level martial arts competition for the first time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Tiehua was quite proud and elated.</p><p></p><p>Although this top 10 ranking was insignificant for someone of his status,</p><p></p><p>It was enough to add some color.</p><p></p><p>Just like if a mayor won third place in a city-level calligraphy competition, it would still be worth boasting about.</p><p></p><p>The other two competitors stood behind Xu Tiehua, their eyes filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Senior Xu for making it into the top 10, it's truly worth celebrating," Lin Feng praised.</p><p></p><p>Yang Jiang also smiled and said, "Within ten years, Senior Xu has the potential to reach the peak of martial arts and win the national martial arts championship!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other students present also felt admiration in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Winning the national martial arts championship was quite an allure for them as well.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the champion could bring considerable benefits, even... hundreds of millions.</p><p></p><p>Various endorsements, fame, even becoming an honored guest of some nobles, and so on.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Tiehua, fame was even more important, as it would benefit his future career development.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years is too long," Xu Tiehua couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts circle was too small, and the prospects were not grand enough.</p><p></p><p>He did not intend to stay in the martial arts circle for ten years.</p><p></p><p>Using one or two years to win the title of a national top 100 martial artist would be enough.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts circle had limited benefits for him.</p><p></p><p>"If I had ten years to win the national martial arts championship, I would definitely be willing!" Lin Feng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your ten years are different from Senior Xu's ten years. Brother Xu is going into politics in the future, how could he waste another ten years in the martial arts circle?" Xing Yu couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The others nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Official promotions in Qin Yuan country did not rely much on seniority.</p><p></p><p>Nobles could cultivate their reputation for a period of time before entering officialdom.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua was currently in this stage of cultivating his reputation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Xu, will you go into politics or the military in the future?" Wang Shiqiao curiously asked at this point.</p><p></p><p>"The military!" Xu Tiehua said forcefully.</p><p></p><p>"You're actually going into the military? That's too dangerous. The world is not peaceful now, with the great war between Wu Gui and Yue Lang countries, who knows when the flames of war will spread to our country." Lin Feng mentioned this with worry in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his view, going into the military was not as safe as going into politics.</p><p></p><p>After all, bullets are merciless, and you never know when one might hit you.</p><p></p><p>Yang Jiang had a different opinion: "Fortune favors the bold. With the great war approaching, there will be many opportunities to achieve merit and establish oneself. </p><p></p><p>Who knows, the next time we see Senior Xu, we might have to address him as General!"</p><p></p><p>"The military is indeed fraught with danger. I heard through the grapevine that a few days ago, a military base in Wu Gui country with a regiment stationed there had all its personnel slaughtered." Mentioning this, Xing Yu's eyes held a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you don't mean that video of an army camp being destroyed by one sword strike, do you? I've seen that too, it's ridiculous. The special effects are clearly cheap, not realistic at all!" Wang Shiqiao said loudly.</p><p></p><p>She had always been hostile towards Wu Gui country, so it was normal for her to come across such videos.</p><p></p><p>"Your grapevine news is too unreliable. </p><p></p><p>How come I haven't heard any official reports about an entire regiment being wiped out?" Lin Feng clearly didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yue Lang was considered a military ally of Qin Yuan country. If Yue Lang had achieved such an exaggerated military feat, Qin Yuan's news reports would definitely be trumpeting it loudly.</p><p></p><p>But now, there were no related news reports at all.</p><p></p><p>Everything was just rumors.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed exaggerated. I've seen that video too, and I can say with certainty that our Qin Yuan country currently doesn't have any weapons with such effects," Xu Tiehua spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Since he was planning to join the military, he was very familiar with Qin Yuan's various advanced weapons.</p><p></p><p>No weapon could produce that kind of effect.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a giant blood-red sword and then smashing down.</p><p></p><p>Even the attack effect of the Eye in the Sky was not like that.</p><p></p><p>"I saw comments below saying that someone has really achieved immortal cultivation behind our backs!" Wang Shiqiao said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stays up late "cultivating immortality", but it turns out someone has really succeeded in immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The other students were puzzled, as they hadn't come across that video.</p><p></p><p>The group of students chatted idly for a while.</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng and Yang Jiang also didn't inappropriately mention Qi Yuan's desertion.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the martial arts school was harmonious and pleasant.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone called out to Wang Shiqiao.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Shiqiao, someone is looking for you."</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao turned around and saw the receptionist.</p><p></p><p>Before she could react, Xing Yu teased, "Is she here to harass you again?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao's face showed a helpless expression: "Probably, sigh, what a karmic entanglement!"</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu couldn't help laughing: "What karmic entanglement, it might be a good match!"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, my taste has always been normal, it has to be a handsome guy!"</p><p></p><p>"She's not handsome!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if she were handsome, she's still a woman!" Wang Shiqiao said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>A year ago, she was hanging out at a nightclub and saw a handsome guy. They had some drinks and things got heated.</p><p></p><p>But when they got to the hotel, it turned out the other person didn't have the equipment.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao definitely wasn't willing then.</p><p></p><p>She's straight.</p><p></p><p>She flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>She thought that was the end of it, but in the past few days, she ran into that "handsome guy" again.</p><p></p><p>That handsome guy has been pursuing her relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>She's fed up with it.</p><p></p><p>But she still has to meet the person.</p><p></p><p>After all, she just found out that person's parents are old family friends with her family.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao reluctantly walked out of the martial arts school, cursing under her breath: "These plastic surgery clinics nowadays have no conscience, actually turning a woman into a man's appearance, making me fall for such a big trick!"</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the school, the sky was clear and the sun particularly dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao looked at the crew-cut person not far away, her eyes showing a helpless expression: "Zhao Di, what do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>The Zhao Di in front of her was the handsome guy Wang Shiqiao had met at the nightclub.</p><p></p><p>She wore a blue robe, her chest flat, her face somewhat rugged, looking just like a man.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qiao, don't be so resistant to me, I just want to be friends with you." Zhao Di spoke, her voice quite androgynous.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao couldn't help but roll her eyes. She didn't believe a word of it.</p><p></p><p>Just friends? It was nothing but wanting to sleep with her.</p><p></p><p>She was all too familiar with this kind of talk.</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, Auntie's art exhibition will begin. Do you want to invite me to go support it together?</p><p></p><p>I know some wealthy businessmen who are quite interested in these artworks." Zhao Di said softly.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, Wang Shiqiao's mother would be holding an art exhibition. Zhao Di's meaning was that she would go to support it.</p><p></p><p>As the host, Wang Shiqiao would have to attend.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Shiqiao disliked it even more, anger rising for no reason.</p><p></p><p>She was used to being unrestrained and free, and what she hated most was this kind of subtle coercion.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to just come out and say it directly. "Sorry, I'm too lazy to go to my mom's art exhibition. I hope there are no visitors so she'll quickly give up on her artistic dreams and go home to play mahjong!" Wang Shiqiao said with some anger.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Di also realized what she said was inappropriate. She quickly said, "Xiao Qiao, it's my fault, don't be angry.</p><p></p><p>Look, I brought you a gift."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di said this as she took out a package. The leather bag was opened, revealing a broken sword inside.</p><p></p><p>"Last time I saw you liked this sword, so I helped you acquire it." Zhao Di said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Last time Wang Shiqiao was browsing an antique market, she took a liking to a broken sword.</p><p></p><p>But the sword had already been bought by someone else. She was willing to pay three times the price, but the other person wouldn't sell.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Wang Shiqiao was very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>This scene happened to be witnessed by Zhao Di.</p><p></p><p>So she used threats and inducements to get the sword from that person.</p><p></p><p>Now, she wanted to give it to Wang Shiqiao as a gift.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao looked at the broken sword, her eyes flashing with delight, then annoyance: "How did you get this sword?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, she disliked Zhao Di and was very resistant, not just because Zhao Di was a woman dressing as a man, but more because she felt she and Zhao Di were not in the same social circle.</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Shiqiao felt she herself was a bad person with no morals,</p><p></p><p>She would not use her family background to bully others or break the law.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di was clearly different from her. She had heard that when Zhao Di was jealous in a love rivalry, she directly had an ordinary man's leg broken.</p><p></p><p>In the end, she used her powerful family background to escape legal punishment.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao quite disliked this kind of behavior from Zhao Di.</p><p></p><p>This broken sword was very likely obtained by Zhao Di through threats and inducements as well.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Di's expression turned cold for a moment. At this point she was also a bit angry and impatient.</p><p></p><p>She grabbed Wang Shiqiao's hand, her face cold: "This sword..."</p><p></p><p>However, before she could finish speaking, suddenly a voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Shiqiao, what a coincidence to see you right away. Looks like my luck is good today."</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao turned her head to look, and saw a young man with a well-proportioned figure, carrying a gift box, walking over with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, Wang Shiqiao's eyes flashed with joy, then became conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Zhao Di was already angry with her.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Tiehua had come over at this moment, she could boldly have him come to her rescue.</p><p></p><p>But it was Qi Yuan who came, and she was afraid of causing unnecessary trouble for Qi Yuan. After all, Qi Yuan's background was ordinary, and if he incurred Zhao Di's resentment, it could be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"You're back?" Wang Shiqiao struggled a bit, but couldn't break free from Zhao Di's hand. She stopped struggling and continued, "Qi Yuan, Senior Xu Tiehua got into the top 10 in this martial arts competition. They're celebrating inside, you should go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Her thought was to not let Qi Yuan get involved in her troubles.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, he made the top 10? Looks like our Mingwu Martial Arts School is full of hidden talents.</p><p></p><p>But I came here today specifically to find you." Qi Yuan waved the beautifully packaged box in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It was specially packaged by Robot 01, using a pink style. The pink ribbon was even tied into a butterfly knot, looking quite girly and appealing to a young woman's tastes.</p><p></p><p>"This is a gift for you, worth 100,000 yuan!" Qi Yuan waved the gift box, his eyes smiling.</p><p></p><p>He had two things to do at the martial arts school: First was to find Wang Shiqiao and get 100,000 yuan; Second was to tell the school master that he would rarely come to train in the future.</p><p></p><p>"100,000 yuan?" Wang Shiqiao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Has this guy Qi Yuan finally figured things out?</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Did you give her a gift?"</p><p></p><p>If it was in the martial arts school, Wang Shiqiao's first reaction to receiving a gift from Qi Yuan would be suspicion of a plot, and her second reaction would be delight.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been honest, so there probably wasn't a plot. Maybe he had changed.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, it wasn't appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di also looked at Qi Yuan with interest, with hostility deep in her eyes: "Xiao Qiao, is this your suitor? He looks quite handsome?"</p><p></p><p>As adults, giving gifts usually meant either asking for a favor or pursuing someone. </p><p></p><p>Zhao Di naturally thought Qi Yuan was pursuing Wang Shiqiao.</p><p></p><p>"This gift worth one million, may I have the honor of seeing it?" Zhao Di said.</p><p></p><p>She could tell at a glance that Qi Yuan's clothes and appearance were very ordinary. The gift packaging looked exquisite, but it was cheap exquisiteness.</p><p></p><p>She didn't believe the contents of the package were worth one million.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao naturally heard that Zhao Di was trying to make things difficult for Qi Yuan. She couldn't help saying, "This is my gift. When I want to open it is my freedom."</p><p></p><p>She didn't give Zhao Di a chance to criticize Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan said, "Let's open it now. I need to wait for you to confirm, I'm in a hurry to go back.</p><p></p><p>I've been traveling for days and I'm exhausted. I need to go back and rest well."</p><p></p><p>Because after resting, he had to continue traveling to follow Yang Shan to participate in the martial arts competition test.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Wang Shiqiao was stunned, not knowing what Qi Yuan was up to. "Are you sure you want to open it now?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure. What are you afraid of? There's no one else here, and no surveillance cameras. It's fine," Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the three of them were in a corner of the martial arts school building where there was almost no one around.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao was a bit confused, feeling that Qi Yuan's words were strange.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di reached out her hand and took the package with the angry girl heart design: "Let me help you open it and see what gift is worth one million!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Zhao Di put her hand on the silk ribbon, not tearing it off roughly, but untying it.</p><p></p><p>Her face showed curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao was actually more curious than her.</p><p></p><p>It was already rare for Qi Yuan to give her a gift.</p><p></p><p>And one worth a million? As time passed second by second, Zhao Di opened the package. She smelled a faint exotic fragrance, along with a slight smell of blood and a hint of salt.</p><p></p><p>She fully opened the package.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a large head, dripping with blood, appeared before her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>She let out a scream, and the package fell from her hands.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan with utter terror on her face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was extremely frightened and without any hesitation, she turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>The broken sword in her hand fell to the ground, and she didn't even dare to pick it up.</p><p></p><p>That was a human head! A real human head! Giving a human head as a gift on the street, what kind of ferocious criminal was this? It was best to run away first!</p><p></p><p>As for Wang Shiqiao's fate, how could she care about that now?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Shiqiao's mind was also blank.</p><p></p><p>She stood there dumbfounded, her limbs numb, having lost the ability to move.</p><p></p><p>"You... you..." She looked at Qi Yuan, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>"You like this gift, don't you? Look how excited you are, you can't even speak," Qi Yuan said very considerately.</p><p></p><p>The other person's stammering must mean she was so moved by his gift that she was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Shiqiao's legs were numb and her heart was pounding. She hated that Zhao Di hadn't pulled her away when she left.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Yuan in front of her now seemed like a deranged serial killer.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've given you the head. Are you going to give me the one million now?" Qi Yuan held out his hand.</p><p></p><p>This was one million, enough to buy tens of thousands of bowls of beef noodles. It couldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>She even imagined that Qi Yuan was trying to extort money from her.</p><p></p><p>Using a human head to extort one million.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't understand, probably anyone who saw this head would pay up.</p><p></p><p>"I've sent my bank account number to your phone. Remember to transfer the money to me," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao looked at Qi Yuan's sincere eyes and could only nod.</p><p></p><p>At this point, if she didn't give the money, was she supposed to give him her head instead?</p><p></p><p>"Why do you look so reluctant? Do you know how much effort I put into getting this head? I traveled thousands of miles to Wugui country, searched through all their military bases, finally found the person who cursed at you for a month, and then... cut off his head.</p><p></p><p>Do you know how much risk I took? When going through security checks, my heart was in my throat. One million is nothing, right?" Seeing Wang Shiqiao's reluctant expression, Qi Yuan rambled on, describing how difficult it had been.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The one who cursed at her for a month? Could it be?</p><p></p><p>She forced herself to look directly at the bloody head, and when she saw the familiar features on the face.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao's eyes widened: "He is... he is..."</p><p></p><p>She recognized it. This head belonged to the Guiran officer who had cursed at her online for a month! His head... was now in Qi Yuan's box.</p><p></p><p>This unbelievable thing was hard for her to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she remembered that a few days ago when she contacted Qi Yuan, he had said he was in Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly recalled that a few months ago, she had joked with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan brought her the head of that Guiran officer, she would give him one million.</p><p></p><p>It all connected.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... Qi Yuan had brought the head.</p><p></p><p>Now Wang Shiqiao wanted to cry but had no tears, and felt very uneasy.</p><p></p><p>I was just joking, but you took it seriously? She was very grateful that the joke she made had been conservative.</p><p></p><p>If she had accidentally made a bigger joke, who knows what Qi Yuan would have done?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she was full of questions about how Qi Yuan had managed to do this. After all, the other person was a Guiran officer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other person's videos had revealed that he wasn't an ordinary officer, but had noble status.</p><p></p><p>How could someone like that, who was gaining experience in the military, be killed by Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wang Shiqiao not speaking, Qi Yuan quickly continued: "Although what I said was a bit exaggerated, it's pretty much true. One million is not too much."</p><p></p><p>This was Qi's inequality.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao looked at Qi Yuan and swallowed: "I'll transfer the one million to you right away."</p><p></p><p>One million wasn't too much for Wang Shiqiao. She could scrape it together if she tried.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had brought her the head. How could she not pay?</p><p></p><p>What if Qi Yuan cut off her head and put it in this gift box? That would be so unfair.</p><p></p><p>She decided that in the future... she would have to be more careful when talking to Qi Yuan. She couldn't speak carelessly anymore.</p><p></p><p>No, it would be best to stay away from Qi Yuan as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"You need to keep the head safe. There's no seven-day return policy, and no refunds!" Qi Yuan reminded her seriously once again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang Shiqiao could only nervously close the gift box and hold it with a look of despair: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there's a broken sword here. Whose is it? Who dropped it? Is it ownerless?" Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the broken sword on the ground as he bent down to pick it up. "Since it's ownerless, it's mine now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in a good mood, feeling that today his financial luck was good.</p><p></p><p>Not only had he earned one million, he had also gained a broken sword.</p><p></p><p>This broken sword was nothing to him as a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan the martial artist, it was somewhat important.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao listened to Qi Yuan's words and watched his performance, not daring to object: "Yes, ownerless things are yours now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the broken sword without guilt and then said: "Come on, let's go back to the martial arts school together."</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao held the gift box numbly and nodded.</p><p></p><p>She didn't dare refuse anything Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qi Yuan told her to strip naked and run around now, she would have to grit her teeth and agree.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao followed behind Qi Yuan, tightly hugging the gift box containing the head, her mind in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two entered the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu's gaze turned towards them, somewhat surprised. She passed over Qi Yuan and looked at Wang Shiqiao with a smile: "Oh, is this a gift from someone? </p><p></p><p>You look like you don't like this gift very much?</p><p></p><p>If you don't like it, just throw it away!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing her friend's words, Wang Shiqiao panicked: "I like it, I like it very much!"</p><p></p><p>"I gave it to her," Qi Yuan said calmly from the side.</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Xing Yu's eyes: "You blockhead... have opened your eyes and given a gift to Xiao Qiao? Xiao Qiao, quickly let me see what gift it is!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Xing Yu reached out to open the gift box.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao hurriedly stepped back: "Don't!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xing Yu also had the sense not to pry further, and instead smiled: "It's not the kind of gift that would move a girlfriend to tears, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao didn't answer, but in her heart she agreed. She was indeed moved to tears, and didn't dare to move!</p><p></p><p>After saying goodbye to Wang Shiqiao and the others, Qi Yuan went to see the second senior brother of the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>His purpose was simple.</p><p></p><p>He had now reached the limit of martial arts, and there was nothing more he could learn at the school.</p><p></p><p>So he came to inform the second senior brother that he would be coming less often in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, alright. You're a student, you've paid, whatever you say goes," the second senior brother chuckled, not refusing Qi Yuan's request. "By the way, you missed this martial arts competition. It's a pity. Xu Tiehua performed very well and got ninth place!"</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts school, others complimented Xu Tiehua by saying she was in the top ten, without mentioning the specific ranking, because Xu Tiehua had gotten ninth place.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, talents are emerging," Qi Yuan casually praised.</p><p></p><p>The second senior brother said with some regret: "It's a pity you didn't come. If you had participated, our school would have had four people, and we might have gotten a spot in the team competition."</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Qi Yuan shrugged: "My friend had an emergency, so I had to go abroad.</p><p></p><p>When you see Xu Tiehua later, please pass on my apologies."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still had some social skills.</p><p></p><p>Although he had a certificate of mental illness, he still had to play the role of a socially skilled mentally ill person.</p><p></p><p>He had stood up Xu Tiehua, so he should apologize.</p><p></p><p>However, he probably wouldn't come to the martial arts school in the future, so he asked the second senior brother to pass on the message.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it's all small matters, no big deal.</p><p></p><p>Looks like you'll have to wait until next year to participate in the martial arts competition and see the world," the second senior brother continued. "But by next year you'll probably be a martial artist, and might be able to get a good ranking."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "Why wait until next year? I still have to participate in this year's national martial arts competition..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha... you're going to win the championship, right!" the second senior brother laughed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's claim of winning the national martial arts competition had already spread throughout the school, but no one took it seriously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the laughter in the second senior brother's eyes, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to explain, and wouldn't explain anyway.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, no one suspects it was me!"</p><p></p><p>"The Lingtiange is so powerful, they leveled the entire Black Mountain Sect last night!"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which divine infant elder was behind that. Will anyone from our Divine Light Sect go?"</p><p></p><p>"As expected, most people's attention is now focused on the Purple Bamboo Body!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Black Chicken Demon comes out, he won't be able to find the culprit."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the game world again.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he did was chat with his online friend Jinli.</p><p></p><p>In the current Southern Qian Kingdom, Qin Aunt had displayed imperial-level strength on the day of the challenge, decisively defeating the Southern Feng Kingdom's national teacher.</p><p></p><p>The Prime Minister of the Southern Qian Kingdom, Sima Ting, had an extremely grim expression.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's short-term task was completed.</p><p></p><p>However, the crisis had not yet been averted.</p><p></p><p>"I have never been a qualified emperor."</p><p></p><p>"After the turmoil in the Southern Qian is settled, I... will leave the Southern Qian. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Through Linglongyu Xishi, Jinli sent these words to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She tightly gripped the Jade Xishi, feeling a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan's reply took over ten breaths to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Jinli quickly read it.</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of being an emperor? The task is done, just leave directly!</p><p>Why not come hunt monsters with me, that would be much more fun!"</p><p></p><p>When she saw the last sentence, a faint smile appeared on Jinli's lips.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go with you."</p><p></p><p>This unqualified female emperor would have another sleepless night, tossing and turning.</p><p></p><p>As for the instigator Qi Yuan, he was now holding his greatsword, ready to begin his hunt.</p><p></p><p>However, as he entered the Yiguan Forbidden Depths, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right."</p><p></p><p>He noticed that the Yiguan Forbidden Depths today were a bit different from usual.</p><p></p><p>On a crooked-necked tree, the branches were mostly broken, revealing jagged fractures, and a section of gray pants leg was hanging from it.</p><p></p><p>"This is not... what I injured."</p><p></p><p>"Is there someone else?"</p><p></p><p>The monsters Qi Yuan killed would always turn to ash, becoming his experience.</p><p></p><p>They would never be left in such a broken state.</p><p></p><p>His gaze became grave, and he became more cautious.</p><p></p><p>After all, this world still had figures like the treacherous Prime Minister Sima Ting, and there were likely other human NPCs as well.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there were such NPCs lurking in the Yiguan Forbidden Depths.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was extremely careful and observant.</p><p></p><p>However, he only found a few broken clothing monsters.</p><p>The rest of the clothing monsters were the same as usual.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hesitated: "Should I continue killing?"</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't figure out the situation, he would feel uneasy.</p><p>Unfortunately, after a night of stealth, he still couldn't find anything special.</p><p>The clothing monsters in the Yiguan Forbidden Depths were just as they had always been, hanging silently on the trees like ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I'm just scaring myself?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exited the depths of the Yiguan Forbidden Depths and decided to dig a hole.</p><p>After all, when feeling afraid, hiding in a blanket would make the fear dissipate.</p><p>According to the first principle of ghosts, ghosts cannot harm those who are hiding under a blanket.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to first hide in the hole.</p><p>The space in the hole was narrow, with no ventilation on all sides, just like some special spots in the battle royale games that could give a false sense of security.</p><p></p><p>The cold moonlight shone on the trees, and not far away, the half-length blue robe hung there, the torn clothes looking as if they had been ripped apart by animal claws. With the wind blowing, the half-length blue robe fluttered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly dug a hole with his greatsword.</p><p>He immediately crawled into the hole.</p><p>Looking at the surrounding walls of earth, with no other space, Qi Yuan's heart calmed down: "Indeed, I feel much better now, I just need to block the entrance."</p><p></p><p>He stood up, ready to block the entrance and bury himself underground.</p><p>However, as he looked up, he immediately met a pair of deep, hollow eyes!</p><p>At the entrance of the hole, there was a head, silently staring at Qi Yuan.</p><p>This head seemed to be wearing a mask, black and white in color, half black and half white. The white part looked like a cold corpse that had been carefully made up by an inexperienced mortician, still giving off an eerie feeling.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You motherfucker, you have no sense of justice!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was startled! Anyone who was about to go to sleep, if they suddenly looked up and saw a pair of eyes staring intently at them without saying a word, would have the same reaction as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical power!</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan saw this creature, his first reaction was to unleash his tyrannical power.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's strength surged crazily.</p><p></p><p>Doubled, tripled, quadrupled, quintupled! Tyrannical power, true tyrannical power.</p><p></p><p>He unleashed his tyrannical power and charged towards this unknown being.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The greatsword slashed down.</p><p></p><p>Under the mask, Qi Yuan saw a flash of red.</p><p></p><p>That unknown being was still staring at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a strange light appeared in the unknown being's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A red mist, like the chemical gas released from a gas canister, surged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally saw the full appearance of this unknown being.</p><p></p><p>A black and white masked face, a white and red wrapped cloth robe, and in one of the sleeves, a pale human arm with long, ink-black nails.</p><p></p><p>[The Fallen Forbidden Zone Lord, the Ugly Robe Monarch, Lv. 95.]</p><p></p><p>A boss?</p><p></p><p>Ah! Qi Yuan pushed his greatsword.</p><p></p><p>Empowered by his tyrannical power, this strike should be able to injure a Lv. 90 monster.</p><p></p><p>But this strike only made the unknown being retreat half a step.</p><p></p><p>And the red mist then merged into Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt his body stiffen.</p><p></p><p>The red mist seemed to turn into red threads, binding his internal organs, turning him into a marionette.</p><p></p><p>"Tough idea, run!"</p><p></p><p>Lv. 95!</p><p></p><p>He was only Lv. 88, 7 levels behind this Fallen Forbidden Zone Lord, with an even greater level gap.</p><p></p><p>He had to run quickly!</p><p></p><p>However, after knowing the opponent was the Fallen Forbidden Zone Lord, Qi Yuan felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>An NPC, with a visible health bar, he could kill it! Of course, for now he still had to run! Qi Yuan ran quickly, using his tyrannical power to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>The Ugly Robe Monarch just followed from a distance, seemingly not in a hurry to catch Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After running for an unknown duration, Qi Yuan's body felt depleted and too weak to continue.</p><p></p><p>He also noticed the Ugly Robe Monarch had stopped chasing him.</p><p></p><p>He heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He ran for a few more hundred miles.</p><p></p><p>"Can't go on, I have to dig a hole and take a nap, my body is drained, I can't take it anymore."</p><p></p><p>He quickly took out his greatsword, ready to dig a hole.</p><p></p><p>But he paused.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a graveyard?"</p><p></p><p>"A chaotic burial ground?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't matter, if I don't dig, I'll have to log out forcibly!"</p><p></p><p>"Dear sirs, please allow me to use your feng shui treasure land, we'll just be neighbors for the night."</p><p></p><p>In the burial ground, there was a thin mist, fallen gravestones, a tomb overgrown with mugwort, and underneath, a hole with densely packed small-footed white centipedes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan found a spot a bit further from the graves and dug a large hole.</p><p></p><p>He was relieved he didn't dig into his neighbor's home.</p><p></p><p>He quickly buried the hole and lay down in a comfortable position.</p><p></p><p>Just as he closed his eyes, he felt like he touched something slimy.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't touch an old person's skull, did I?"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Qi Yuan logged out.</p><p></p><p>And on the Seven-Colored Peak, he succumbed to slumber.</p><p></p><p>In the graveyard, half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>The sound of firecrackers and gongs suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>As if in a funeral procession, or a wedding.</p><p></p><p>A group of robe-clad creatures emerged from the thick mist, dancing and waving their limbs, setting their own clothes on fire.</p><p></p><p>The graveyard was lit up, the robe-clad creatures dancing.</p>

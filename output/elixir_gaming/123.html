        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>White Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>The man wore a white crane robe. He held a white chess piece in his hand and placed it on the board.</p><p></p><p>He murmured under his breath: "Born divine... Blood Lord... preaching... supreme..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, this matter is of utmost importance. Should we report it to Master?" The young woman with a baby face was the second disciple of White Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Crane shook his head: "A few days ago, Master fought with the Venerable One and was severely injured. He's in seclusion to recover and likely won't see anyone for a while."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the baby-faced woman looked worried: "Master was injured?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..." Cloud Crane's eyes also held dark clouds, "The Venerable One is pressing harder and harder. The North-South decision... is truly difficult!"</p><p></p><p>Once the North-South decision ends and the South loses, it's hard to imagine what the Flowing Wind Realm will become. </p><p></p><p>Evil will run rampant, and ordinary people will have no space to survive.</p><p></p><p>"If the Venerable One didn't have the Fate Stone Tablet, why would Master fear her!" The baby-faced woman said indignantly. </p><p></p><p>The White Emperor and the Venerable One had always been evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>But the change in the situation began with the Fate Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>The baby-faced woman remembered that only after the Venerable One obtained the Fate Stone Tablet did the North begin to completely overwhelm the South.</p><p></p><p>Before that, although the South was at a disadvantage, it wasn't so obvious.</p><p></p><p>"Fate Stone Tablet..." Hearing this, Cloud Crane suddenly had a realization, "Are you saying that Blood Lord... might also have a Fate Stone Tablet?"</p><p></p><p>There isn't just one Fate Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>The baby-faced woman also had a look of sudden understanding: "If it's a Fate Stone Tablet, then it's really possible... But, but... Master said the Fate Stone Tablet is an ominous object. If Blood Lord obtains a Fate Stone Tablet and mass-produces Supreme Beings, won't our South be... in an even more difficult situation?"</p><p></p><p>She had already placed the owner of the Fate Stone Tablet on the opposing side.</p><p></p><p>Although the Fate Stone Tablet cannot mass-produce Supreme Beings on a large scale, it's very possible to create several dozen or close to a hundred.</p><p></p><p>The South is already at a disadvantage. If the North gains another hundred Supreme Beings, their chances of victory in the North-South decision will be even greater.</p><p></p><p>The time of the decisive battle will also be pushed forward.</p><p></p><p>Master's preparations are not yet sufficient.</p><p></p><p>"No, I must go to No Return City immediately to meet that Blood Lord," Cloud Crane's eyes flashed with many complex emotions before he finally said, "If Master comes out of seclusion, tell him about the Blood Lord and the Fate Stone Tablet immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The baby-faced woman looked at Cloud Crane, "Senior Brother, be careful. If there's any danger, return to White Emperor Palace."</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat worried that this was a trap, a scheme targeting Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"I understand." Cloud Crane smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>He was most like the White Emperor, concerned for the world. How could he fear death?...</p><p></p><p>Six years later.</p><p></p><p>No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi had grown old and frail. When he first came to No Return City, he was a spirited young man. Now he had entered his twilight years.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, his cultivation had strengthened, but he still couldn't resist the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Now in the prosperous No Return City, he had become a gatekeeper.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bustling No Return City, a smile appeared in Yuan Qi's eyes: "Guardian Lord... finally no longer has to guard a city alone."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he coughed once.</p><p></p><p>In six years, No Return City had changed a lot.</p><p></p><p>The biggest change was that there were more people.</p><p></p><p>Now, No Return City had a population of 200,000.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the number of Supreme Beings had reached the terrifying number of 300.</p><p></p><p>If this number were to be announced, it would surely shock the world.</p><p></p><p>In just five short years, the growth rate of Blood Palace was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the North-South decision had turned the Ten Thousand Eight Hundred Cities into isolated fortresses. Many people still didn't know about this.</p><p></p><p>Even those who knew scoffed at it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also many Terrestrial Immortals who traveled thousands of miles to come to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, many also died on the way.</p><p></p><p>At this time, many Terrestrial Immortals had come to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>In half a month, it would be the legendary Preaching Assembly.</p><p></p><p>This Preaching Assembly had gathered a full thousand peak Terrestrial Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Of course, many Terrestrial Immortals who were still some distance from their peak would also come to listen and improve their strength.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Blood Lord would appear and preach to all the Terrestrial Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"It's too dark, need to close the city gates." Yuan Qi was old and frail. He didn't know if he would have the chance to see the day when the North-South decision ended.</p><p></p><p>But he believed that as long as Blood Lord existed, one day the North-South decision would end.</p><p></p><p>The victor... would be Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside No Return City.</p><p></p><p>In a newly built underground palace.</p><p></p><p>A smile curved Qi Yuan's lips: "It feels so good to have many subordinates."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he sat in the chair of state, his broken sword extended forward.</p><p></p><p>One demonic beast after another, like products on a conveyor belt, were cut and slaughtered by Qi Yuan, this machine.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to move. Every day, vast numbers of demonic beasts were captured by his subordinate Supreme Beings and brought for him to cut and kill.</p><p></p><p>After all, for every hundred Terrestrial Immortal level demonic beasts captured, one could gain a new chance to listen to the preaching.</p><p></p><p>How could those Supreme Beings not work hard? Day and night they went out to hunt and capture demonic beasts to bring to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The reason for doing this outside No Return City was that if demonic beasts entered No Return City, it would mean Qi Yuan had failed in his duty as guardian.</p><p></p><p>So he could only build a demonic beast factory outside No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Slaughtering demonic beasts every day.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly Qi Yuan paused: "Do I look like I'm tightening screws in a factory now?"</p><p></p><p>With countless experiences pouring in, Qi Yuan really felt like he was tightening screws in a factory.</p><p></p><p>These demonic beasts were like products.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that others might be standing or sitting on stools, while he was in a chair of state.</p><p></p><p>"Then aren't I... working for the Flowing Wind Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The more Qi Yuan thought about it, the more annoyed he became. He looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, if you don't give me some small benefits, I'll definitely refine you into a Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he crossed his legs and extended his sword straight out, allowing one demonic beast after another to pass by and turn into fragments.</p><p></p><p>The Source of Evil was also growing frantically.</p><p></p><p>The innate divine ability of the Void Ruler's Heart Demon Attraction, stored in frantic growth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that this innate divine ability was inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>As for... the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, it was the other extreme.</p><p></p><p>Against opponents of the same level, Qi Yuan couldn't bear to use it at all.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the bronze bell outside the door rang.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>The door opened and Chen Huan, dressed in a red robe, walked in.</p><p></p><p>Compared to five years ago, the aura on his body was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, a new batch of Supreme Beings has arrived in the Blood Fallen Thousand Cities territory. The number is quite large, and it seems they are planning something big."</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan had now become the grand steward of Blood Palace, overseeing many affairs.</p><p></p><p>"How many?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Over twenty, and among them, there are several mid-stage Supreme Beings," Chen Huan said.</p><p></p><p>Due to the presence of mid-stage Supreme Beings, they couldn't investigate too closely to avoid being discovered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "No Great Supreme Beings?"</p><p></p><p>Mid-stage Supreme Beings might be dangerous to others, but to Qi Yuan, they were nothing.</p><p></p><p>As long as they didn't have innate divine abilities protecting their bodies flawlessly, who could resist his Void Ruler's Heart Demon Attraction?</p><p></p><p>Of course, in reality, so many Supreme Beings, including mid-stage ones, were enough to surround and kill a Great Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Great Supreme Beings were strong in one-on-one combat.</p><p></p><p>But when simultaneously attacked by dozens of innate divine abilities, even they would find it hard to withstand.</p><p></p><p>However, to Qi Yuan, it was nothing.</p><p></p><p>What he feared were Great Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>They were troublesome to deal with and required verbal sparring.</p><p></p><p>And verbal sparring might not even work.</p><p></p><p>"No, Great Supreme Beings are very rare. Even Great Supreme Beings like Purple Daoist wouldn't easily come to the Blood Fallen Thousand Cities territory," Chen Huan replied. "Should I lead a hundred Supreme Beings to surround them?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan was eager to try.</p><p></p><p>Now Supreme Beings were as cheap as carrots in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan added at the end: "Yang Hun Supreme Being says they seem to be planning to finish some big event, and then come to destroy our No Return City."</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being was a Supreme Being sent from the Blood Fallen Thousand Cities territory later.</p><p></p><p>This Supreme Being was also funny. He came to the Blood Fallen Thousand Cities territory, and before Chen Huan and the others knew, he directly came to No Return City to surrender.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had become a chess piece buried by Blood Palace in the North.</p><p></p><p>Many locations of demon lairs were revealed by him to Blood Palace, allowing Blood Palace's Supreme Beings to capture so many.</p><p></p><p>"No Return City has always been well-behaved. How dare they want to destroy my No Return City? They're seeking death!" Killing intent flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes. "No need for you to lead the team. I'll personally lead the team to annihilate them. </p><p></p><p>Choose a hundred... Supreme Beings worth cultivating to go with me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't care about Supreme Beings betraying him.</p><p></p><p>But he also needed Supreme Beings who could truly work for him.</p><p></p><p>Taking these hundred Supreme Beings, Qi Yuan would demonstrate his strength, flex his muscles a bit, and increase their loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Human nature cannot be tested, and ordinary people fear power rather than virtue.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also needed to demonstrate his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Chen Huan nodded quickly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Blood Fallen Thousand Cities territory.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-three Supreme Beings gathered in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being, the host, was standing in the corner, not receiving much attention.</p><p></p><p>The five leading Supreme Beings were all mid-stage Supreme Beings, sitting in higher seats of honor.</p><p></p><p>Blue Charm Supreme Being wore a solemn expression: "In three days, a Great Supreme Being will pass through this area.</p><p></p><p>You don't need to know the identity of that Great Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>We have gathered here to detain her."</p><p></p><p>"A Great Supreme Being, that's quite difficult!" one Supreme Being said.</p><p></p><p>With so many Supreme Beings attacking together, they could detain a Great Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>But to say they could kill her would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the Great Supreme Being fiercely attacked a few of them, she could also kill quite a few.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to worry about this. That Great Supreme Being is already severely injured and not a concern. Moreover, I have a treasure jointly refined by two Great Supreme Beings that can unite us as one for defense," Blue Charm Supreme Being said.</p><p></p><p>Over twenty formation flags descended, falling into the hands of the various Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Beings caught them and all showed surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>This formation was even stronger than they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"With this treasure, we can rest easy about our lives," one Supreme Being smiled.</p><p></p><p>Although a Great Supreme Being is strong, a treasure refined by two Great Supreme Beings, used by over twenty Supreme Beings, is enough for both attack and defense against a Great Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, this was an injured Great Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>"During this time, we will refine the formation flags here. No one is allowed to leave," Blue Charm Supreme Being's expression turned gloomy. "To prevent information from leaking out."</p><p></p><p>At this time, one Supreme Being smiled and said: "What if information leaks out? Is there anyone who could save her?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily true. When I emerged from seclusion three years ago, I heard that Blood City had gained some kind of Blood Palace, and the so-called Blood Lord could apparently help people break through to become Supreme Beings. There seem to be several Supreme Beings in the Blood Palace already," said one Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm was vast, and the transmission of information could be distorted and delayed. </p><p></p><p>The news he had received was from several years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Helping people break through to become Supreme Beings? That's ridiculous. We spent countless years barely managing to become Supreme Beings ourselves. If someone could become a Supreme Being with others' help, it would be far too easy," another person laughed.</p><p></p><p>All those who became Supreme Beings were truly heaven's chosen ones. They had gone through countless hardships and trials to reach that level.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they didn't believe becoming a Supreme Being could be so simple.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being Yang Hun has been guarding this place all along and is most familiar with the situation here. Is that Blood City really so mysterious?" Blue Charm Supreme Being looked towards Yang Hun Supreme Being in the corner.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yang Hun Supreme Being's face showed a contemptuous expression: "It's all just rumors. That nonsense about helping people become Supreme Beings is all fake. Blood City only has six Supreme Beings stationed there, and they're all early-stage Supreme Beings, not worth mentioning. The leader is a disciple of the White Emperor, which is why they were able to gather so many Supreme Beings."</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being's words gained the approval of all the Supreme Beings present.</p><p></p><p>This explanation seemed reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"After we kill that Great Supreme Being, we'll take the opportunity to wipe out Blood City and earn some battle merits," Blue Charm Supreme Being said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He had said these things before.</p><p></p><p>Since they were here anyway, it would be a waste not to collect some battle merits.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Blue Charm Supreme Being," Yang Hun Supreme Being said with a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>At this point, another Supreme Being asked again: "If I remember correctly, there used to be several Supreme Beings stationed in this area, including a Great Supreme Being named Purple Daoist. Why don't we see them?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being's expression remained unchanged: "Purple Daoist came here for an important matter. After arriving, he took the other Supreme Beings with him to handle that matter. As for what it was, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>He lied without changing his expression.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others didn't ask any further questions.</p><p></p><p>They had been transferred here from other regions and weren't very familiar with the situation here.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and refine your powers. Kill the Great Supreme Being, then destroy Blood City!" Blue Charm Supreme Being said coldly.</p><p></p><p>What they were doing this time carried some risk, but the rewards would definitely be great.</p><p></p><p>It was worth doing.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Nine days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In a broken valley, Ning Tao wore a black dress, her skin as white as pear blossoms after rain, excessively pale.</p><p></p><p>She had always had very fair skin, as if she had never been exposed to sunlight. However, this realm indeed had no sun.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her face bore a gloomy expression: "You really are persistent!"</p><p></p><p>Behind her, five mid-stage Supreme Being cultivators were in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>By now, she was already severely injured and tried to avoid fighting if possible.</p><p></p><p>"Leave behind the Blood Demon, and we'll let you go," one of the pursuing mid-stage Supreme Beings said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the feeling of hunting down a Great Supreme Being was exhilarating.</p><p></p><p>Usually, when they encountered a Great Supreme Being, none of them would dare to even breathe loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Ning Tao didn't bother to respond.</p><p></p><p>Putting down that mass of flesh was impossible.</p><p></p><p>If she could have, she would have done so long ago.</p><p></p><p>It was the medium through which her husband could find her.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, her eyes were filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>From childhood to adulthood, she had experienced nearly a thousand years of being hunted.</p><p></p><p>The current scene was all too familiar.</p><p></p><p>The five Supreme Beings behind her were driving her towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>And that place was where she had intended to go.</p><p></p><p>She had tried to change her route several times but was blocked by the Supreme Beings behind her, forcing her to continue along this path.</p><p></p><p>She understood that she might soon find herself in a desperate situation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she had no way to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>Even if her husband came to help, he wouldn't be able to do much for her.</p><p></p><p>Her current situation was indeed precarious.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, half an hour later, Ning Tao, who had been moving as a streak of light, stopped in her tracks.</p><p></p><p>She stood in a desert, her face showing neither joy nor sorrow: "What an elaborate setup!"</p><p></p><p>Behind her, the five mid-stage Supreme Being cultivators' faces broke into smiles: "Demon woman, you've finally run out of places to escape."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, twenty-three new figures suddenly appeared in all directions around Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Each one was a Supreme Being, including five mid-stage Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>Ten mid-stage Supreme Beings, over ten early-stage Supreme Beings, plus array treasures refined by Great Supreme Beings - more than enough to kill a severely injured Great Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Blue Charm Supreme Being looked at Ning Tao with disgust in his eyes, then glanced at the flesh behind her with a complex expression: "Demon woman, this place will be your burial ground!"</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Beings also looked at Ning Tao with disgust in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, demon women were despised by heaven and hated by people. Even they couldn't avoid this influence and involuntarily despised Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao smiled faintly. She glanced at the blood sphere behind her, her gaze tender: "My husband is not a Blood Demon, and I... am not a demon woman. But none of that matters now."</p><p></p><p>She looked at the blood sphere, gripping the chain tightly, as if unwilling to part with it.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Ning Tao had already accepted her fate.</p><p></p><p>All along the way, she had experienced endless pursuit.</p><p></p><p>When she set out for the ends of the earth, she had a premonition that she wouldn't make it.</p><p></p><p>Human strength has its limits. She wasn't heaven's chosen one; more accurately, she was heaven's despised one.</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk. Kill her!"</p><p></p><p>At Blue Charm Supreme Being's command, all twenty-some Supreme Beings attacked simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The five Supreme Beings behind her also began to attack.</p><p></p><p>Powerful origin divine abilities swept out. Ning Tao's small face turned pale, but she showed no fear.</p><p></p><p>She was like a black butterfly dancing in the rain, dodging all the origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>These powerful origin divine abilities were avoided by her one by one.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a Great Supreme Being. Even injured, she's still so powerful! Everyone, join forces and wear her down!"</p><p></p><p>Blue Charm Supreme Being understood that a Great Supreme Being wasn't so easy to kill.</p><p></p><p>Facing an injured Great Supreme Being, they had to wear her down bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Supreme Being's origin was completely exhausted, flaws would appear in her flawless origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>At that point, she would be no different from a powerful mid-stage Supreme Being and could be destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being was among the crowd, constantly going through the motions without exerting any real effort.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was surrounded and attacked, constantly dodging origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>She gripped the chain tightly, unwilling to let the mass of flesh suffer even the slightest harm even as her own body became covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't hold back, lest we give her time to recover!" Blue Charm Supreme Being shouted.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Beings present attacked frantically again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, their attacks were still perfectly avoided by Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>However, these Supreme Beings remained calm and unhurried. Ning Tao was just a trapped beast struggling in vain.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a contemptuous voice rang out: "You won't kill anyone fighting like that. Let me show you how it's done!"</p><p></p><p>A man in a red robe appeared. He seemed to be wearing a mask, making his features unclear.</p><p></p><p>An extremely mysterious and terrifying aura emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>Blue Charm Supreme Being's expression changed slightly: "Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>He was only somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord of Blood City? We haven't even come looking for trouble with you yet, and you dare to interfere in our affairs. It seems you think your life is too long! Where are the Supreme Beings behind you? Have them all come out. Today, we'll not only kill this Great Supreme Being but also take down Blood City while we're at it!"</p><p></p><p>Blue Charm Supreme Being spoke confidently.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ning Tao, who was in the center of the battlefield, glanced at the blood-red robed figure. Her covered left eye twitched slightly, but her right eye showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Beings present looked at the blood-robed figure with wariness, but mostly with relief.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being had said that Blood City only had a few Supreme Beings, and they were just early-stage ones, not worth worrying about.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really want me to call them out? I'm afraid you'll be shocked if I do," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>He was observing the battle in front of him, studying everyone's origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>This way, his Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Attraction would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>After all, ten mid-stage Supreme Beings did pose some challenge.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Blood Lord!" Blue Charm Supreme Being snorted coldly, not bothering to pay attention to this upstart Blood Lord, only remaining on guard.</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Beings did the same.</p><p></p><p>A few Supreme Beings wouldn't change the outcome.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled faintly: "Since you want to see, I'll let you see. Come out... my enforcers."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice rang out, the void rippled.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, a hundred people wearing blood-red robes suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>These blood-robed figures had stern expressions and coldly looked down at everyone. The aura they emitted showed that they were all Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of so many Supreme Beings shocked everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"They're all Supreme Beings?"</p><p></p><p>"So many?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Beings surrounding Ning Tao were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Some sucked in cold breaths.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, their group of over twenty Supreme Beings gathered together was already quite numerous.</p><p></p><p>But now, a hundred Supreme Beings appeared, all in uniform, like common soldiers.</p><p></p><p>The visual impact was even greater.</p><p></p><p>Many Supreme Beings couldn't help but gasp.</p><p></p><p>Didn't Yang Hun Supreme Being say there were only a few? How did it become a hundred Supreme Beings?</p><p></p><p>This information was way off!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in front of the crowd, not putting these Supreme Beings in front of him for protection. He said calmly: "I shouldn't have let them come out. Look how shocked you all are, gasping like that. Global warming is all your fault."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke as he stepped forward again.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring their shock, he repeated to the people behind him what he had said earlier: "They can't kill anyone fighting like that. Watch me do it."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Beings behind him, including Wang Gai, showed surprise in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord... facing nearly thirty Supreme Beings alone? How dare he!</p><p></p><p>That Great Supreme Being was being surrounded and attacked by all these Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>But the orders they had received were to stand and watch here.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to move, as that would violate the Blood Lord's orders.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan moved forward, his blood-red robe becoming increasingly bewitching.</p><p></p><p>With Child, Same Robe!</p><p></p><p>He instantly transformed into a blood-colored armored giant nearly a hundred zhang tall, holding a blood-red broken sword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"This... is how you kill people!"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter ends)</p>

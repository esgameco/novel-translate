        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had once again entered the game.</p><p></p><p>This time, he woke up embracing his little wife.</p><p></p><p>A prompt appeared.</p><p></p><p>【The Five Elements Forbidden Realm has been cleared, and rewards have been obtained.】</p><p></p><p>【Reward 1: 10 Fragments of the Heavenly Dao.】</p><p>【Reward 2: The Heart of the Five Elements.】</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Fragments this time were not contaminated.</p><p>10 fragments, which was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>The Heart of the Five Elements... a gift from the Five Ancestors? According to the description, this Heart of the Five Elements could better assist Qi Yuan in the transformation of his Qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Qi of the Five Elements was extraordinary.</p><p>They were both mutually destructive and mutually generative.</p><p></p><p>Without the Heart of the Five Elements, Qi Yuan's transformation of his Qi into the Qi of the Five Elements would have been quite troublesome.</p><p>The first type might be quick, but the second, third, and so on would be very slow.</p><p></p><p>The Heart of the Five Elements shortened the time and also avoided a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Is there only one forbidden land and two absolute domains left?" Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Through Tang Yan, Qi Yuan had already learned that the so-called Demonic Beings from the Outer Realms were in the Absolute Domain.</p><p></p><p>So, Qi Yuan only needed to conquer the Yin-Yang Forbidden Realm and the Heavenly Absolute Domain, and then subdue the Demonic Beings from the Outer Realms, and he would be able to obtain all the Heavenly Dao Fragments.</p><p></p><p>But before that, he needed to go to the Coffin Gathering Place.</p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Five Elements Forbidden Realm still had a grand gift for him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>Qi Yuan stood beside Tang Yan, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that these powerful cultivators of the Five Elements Forbidden Realm would perform a Divine Impartation on him.</p><p>This meant that they would transfer all their insights into cultivation techniques, as well as all their life experiences, to him.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was quite extraordinary.</p><p>These NPCs in front of him made Qi Yuan develop a sense of admiration in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He himself could not do something like this, to completely give away all his possessions to someone else.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Clothing Faction, we shall perform a Divine Impartation on you.</p><p>Our cultivation insights and experiences will all be passed on to you.</p><p>This will accelerate your cultivation progress. </p><p>Do you agree?" Feather's voice was gentle.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of eyes in the coffin stared at Qi Yuan.</p><p>To be honest, if it was at night, this would be a bit creepy.</p><p>But he already had his Bride, so why would he be afraid of this?</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan did not refuse.</p><p>This Divine Impartation from these NPCs would be of great help to him.</p><p>The combat experience, spell casting, and other aspects should also be beneficial to his actual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Clothing Faction, before you accept the Divine Impartation, you must take the Demonic Heart Oath and swear to slay the Demonic Beings from the Outer Realms!" Dragon Judge, a man with a full beard, spoke up, his voice somewhat softened as he looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." He had already made the same promise to the Five Ancestors of the Five Elements, so agreeing to it with these people was also very normal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, and followed the instructions of these powerful cultivators of the Divine Realm to take the Demonic Heart Oath.</p><p>With the oath completed, it meant that Qi Yuan must go and slay the Demonic Beings from the Outer Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Since the oath is made, then the Divine Impartation... shall begin!" Feather spoke.</p><p></p><p>The fifty-three people present all looked towards Qi Yuan.</p><p>Most of these fifty-three were half-reclining in the coffins.</p><p>There were also Tang Yan, the red-robed man, and Little Green, who were the young geniuses of the new generation.</p><p></p><p>Being stared at by so many people, Qi Yuan remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Impartation!"</p><p></p><p>With Feather's loud shout, all the powerful cultivators of the Divine Realm chanted the words "Divine Impartation".</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan felt the images in his mind constantly flowing.</p><p>The memories, cultivation insights, and overwhelming experiences of the fifty-three top experts poured into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Calm your mind, empty your heart, do not try to comprehend, just be an observer!" Feather reminded from the side.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the Divine Impartation, the recipient would only see some deeply imprinted memories.</p><p>It was only after the Divine Impartation was completed that they would slowly accept and digest all the memories and insights.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan closed his eyes, and many scenes appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He saw a young man blushing, secretly glancing at the enthroned Bride Princess.</p><p>This handsome young man had extraordinary talent, but... was easily flustered, so he deliberately grew a full beard.</p><p>This young man was later the Dragon Judge.</p><p></p><p>He saw Feather's entire family being killed, and the man howling in the rainy night, completely different from his current calm and gentle demeanor.</p><p></p><p>He saw the burly man, who was carefree and liked to fight crickets in his youth, suddenly become diligent after reading a random book one day.</p><p></p><p>He saw a fishing line hanging down, the red-robed man's father perishing, the red-robed man hugging the human skin, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>He also saw Gold Ancestor taking Little Green back to the Five Elements Forbidden Realm, and saw Little Green feeding the golden chicken alone in the empty courtyard just yesterday.</p><p></p><p>He saw many things.</p><p>He also received the insights into many cultivation techniques and experiences.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Feather suddenly spoke.</p><p>"The Divine Impartation is complete."</p><p></p><p>The connection was severed, the images abruptly stopped.</p><p>But Qi Yuan understood that those memories and insights were now hidden deep in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p>"Phew, I've been holding it in for so long, I can finally spit it out."</p><p>"It seems I'll have to go into seclusion for ten years."</p><p></p><p>After the Divine Impartation, they all had a certain degree of weakness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the fifty-three people present, and slowly bowed deeply: "All of you who have passed on your techniques to me are my teachers! I will remember this kindness in my heart."</p><p></p><p>The fifty-three people present either smiled and responded, "We are all allies, as long as we slay the Demonic Beings from the Outer Realms."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Some of them said awkwardly, 'Master of the Clothing Department, please don't keep peeking into my memories.'"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the embarrassed man and gently said, "I'll be sure not to next time."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the divine imprint, the powerful cultivators of the Five Elements Forbidden Land closed the coffin lid and fell into a deep slumber. </p><p></p><p>After the divine imprint, they were somewhat weakened and needed to recover.</p><p></p><p>Yu looked at Qi Yuan and slowly said, "Don't forget about the Slaughter Demon Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, the dragon-bearded Long Pan spoke in a deep voice, "I've already informed the Yin-Yang Forbidden, you just need to defeat Zang Hua, and the Yin-Yang Forbidden will completely belong to you. They will also perform the divine imprint for you.</p><p></p><p>With the Princess of the Celestial Robe by your side, defeating Zang Hua will be no problem.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the divine imprint from the powerful cultivators of the Yin-Yang Forbidden, you can slowly digest it over the next three hundred years, digesting as much as you can."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for informing me." Qi Yuan prepared to take his leave and head to the final forbidden land, the Yin-Yang Forbidden.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he looked at Long Pan and said, "Actually, senior, you were quite cute when you were young."</p><p></p><p>Long Pan's expression changed drastically, and his face flushed red in an instant, even his thick beard could not conceal it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chuckled and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Yu glanced at Long Pan and gently said, "During the Slaughter Demon Assembly, you should shave your beard, otherwise everyone will think you're an ugly man."</p><p></p><p>"Scram!" Long Pan roared angrily, "I want to catch that kid and give him a good beating."</p><p></p><p>Yu's gaze was profound: "Now, you may not be his match. I wonder how far he will grow in three hundred years.</p><p>The demonic beings from the outside world will no longer be a problem for him."</p><p></p><p>"Time..." Yu grabbed a fallen feather from her clothes, "I hope he doesn't come to the Slaughter Demon Assembly three hundred years from now."</p><p></p><p>Long Pan chuckled without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard Yu say, "I divined, and the Slaughter Demon Assembly three hundred years from now will still be a life-or-death situation!"</p><p></p><p>Long Pan's expression did not change, and he finally said, "You're right, it's better if he doesn't go to the Slaughter Demon Assembly three hundred years from now.</p><p></p><p>This kid is actually quite smart. </p><p>When he made the Demonic Oath, he didn't explicitly state that he would participate in the Slaughter Demon Assembly, he only said he would slay the demonic beings from the outside world. Probably that was his plan.</p><p>These old fellows' minds are sharper than monkeys, they saw through his little trick, but no one pointed it out."</p><p></p><p>"Are monkeys really that smart?" the Master of the Clothing Department asked.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Little Wife, do you think I can be a match for the demonic beings from the outside world?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan embraced Little Wife as they traveled towards the Yin-Yang Forbidden.</p><p></p><p>Little Wife did not speak, but a wooden plaque slid out from her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Hand in sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Will you come and grind monsters with me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly, I feel like I've really let you NPCs down."</p><p></p><p>"But it's fine, no matter what, I have to defeat that big boss!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thoughts shifted quickly.</p><p></p><p>Just now he was talking about the demonic beings from the outside world, and now he had changed to the Yin-Yang Forbidden.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the fellows in the Yin-Yang Forbidden all speak in a yin-yang manner.</p><p>If I learn to speak like them, will they hit me?"</p><p></p><p>"If they perform the divine imprint for me and I learn their yin-yang way of speaking, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Little Wife for a while, Qi Yuan became spirited again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was very lucky.</p><p>After falling ill, he no longer had anyone to talk to.</p><p>Later, he met Jinli.</p><p>And now, he has also met Little Wife.</p><p></p><p>He thought, and he was ready to chat with Jinli again.</p><p>In the contact list, Jinli had sent him 99+ messages.</p><p></p><p>Jinli said that with the support of the Clothing Department's forbidden army, she had completely taken control of Nan Qian.</p><p>Now, the Clothing Department's vast army had surrounded the Holy Gate of the Heavenly Realm.</p><p>After dealing with the Holy Gate of the Heavenly Realm and the Demon Tribe, she would abdicate the position of the Queen of Nan Qian and come to see him at the Ancient Qi Chun Tree.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to speed up as well."</p><p>Qi Yuan thought this way.</p><p>"There is a girl who is willing to give up the throne just to meet me."</p><p>"Isn't this more exciting than intentionally answering exam questions wrong to get into the same school?"</p><p>More exciting than that.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Qi Yuan finally entered the Yin-Yang Forbidden.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Forbidden, one of the four great forbidden lands.</p><p>The most distinctive feature of this forbidden land was that half of it was night, and half of it was day, alternating.</p><p>This made Qi Yuan think of the Blue Star.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Yin-Yang Forbidden was not a sphere.</p><p>Even if Qi Yuan flew up to look, it was not a sphere.</p><p></p><p>"Defeating Zang Hua and obtaining the divine imprint, that's not a problem."</p><p>"But how should I control the Yin-Yang Forbidden?"</p><p>Qi Yuan did not want to be a killer of old men again.</p><p>And the Yin-Yang Forbidden did not have beings like the Golden Ancestor or the Water Ancestor.</p><p>Controlling the Yin-Yang Forbidden became more complicated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded from beside Qi Yuan.</p><p>"Master of the Clothing Department, you've arrived!"</p><p>The speaker was a woman with three thousand strands of blue hair. Her beauty was exquisite, her expression cold, with a kind of broken beauty.</p><p>"Zang Hua?" Qi Yuan realized that this would be his opponent in the Yin-Yang Forbidden.</p><p>"Defeat me, and the Yin-Yang Forbidden will be under your control!" Zang Hua said coldly.</p><p>She finished speaking, without any hesitation, and immediately attacked Qi Yuan.</p>

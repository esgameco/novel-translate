        <h1>Chapter 555</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems he is in the Yunxue City, so I can go visit him a few times," sighed the Master of the Academy.</p><p></p><p>In compiling the "Outline of the Realm History", he had seen all kinds of people, both ordinary mortals and heroes.</p><p></p><p>He wrote the songs of the common people, and also wrote biographies for the heroes.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, those who dare to draw their swords against the Mysterious Deity with Dark Pupils in the Kuijin Realm are the true heroes.</p><p></p><p>The young lady stood behind him, her eyes full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three thousand miles away, the Qihuan loomed in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was covered in white hair, with curved ram-like horns on its head, its aura extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>By its side, the tall Dark Pupil Deity was all in cold colors, gazing at his own corpse miles away, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Dark Pupil, you're a bit too useless, actually being slain by a human, and even having your corpse erected to scare us!" The Two-Headed Snake Deity said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the other Deities had all turned solemn. Their strengths were on par with Dark Pupil's.</p><p></p><p>The easy slaying of Dark Pupil also meant that the white-haired man could slay them as well.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the Lord Qihuan reviving you, you would have been standing in Yunxue City for eternity, becoming a famous... scenic spot," the Two-Headed Snake Deity spoke.</p><p></p><p>When mentioning Qihuan, the Two-Headed Snake Deity had respect and awe.</p><p></p><p>Unlike these Deities, Qihuan was a second-generation Deity, hailing from the Black Sky Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Dark Pupil was actually slain by a human, this is a disgrace to us Deities! I wish to go and slay that human, you all wait here, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>The Two-Headed Snake Deity spoke, wanting to show off in front of Lord Qihuan.</p><p></p><p>His strength was indeed very powerful, ranking among the top ten in the Kuijin Realm, a Great Saint-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Dark Pupil suffered this humiliation, but dared not refute, after all, the Two-Headed Snake's strength was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>"If the Snake Deity goes, won't it be an easy victory?"</p><p></p><p>"Daring to cause trouble in the Kuijin Realm, this is courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The Deities present spoke, their expressions calm, even fawning a bit towards the Two-Headed Snake Deity.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Two-Headed Snake Deity went, even if Qi Yuan was strong, he would probably not be a match.</p><p></p><p>The Two-Headed Snake Deity enjoyed the flattery, looking towards Lord Qihuan, waiting for his nod to head to Yunxue City and slay Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qihuan's mouth curved into a smile: "Interesting, is this the Mandate Holder, blessed by the Mandate?"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan's words were puzzling, and the surrounding Deities were somewhat confused, not understanding the meaning of Qihuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Then Qihuan said, "If I agree to let you go, without a doubt, your end will be no different from Dark Pupil's.</p><p></p><p>And then, it's likely that the one you don't get along with, Kaixi, will take the opportunity to go and continue to be slain!"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan spoke lazily, with a carefree smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Mandate Holder, blessed by the Mandate.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Kuijin Realm has been occupied by the Deities, the world is still part of the Divine Wood Universe, and the will would naturally favor the Mandate Holder.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, the enemies of the Mandate Holder would, for inexplicable reasons, encounter problems or lose their minds.</p><p></p><p>The Two-Headed Snake Deity's face stiffened, he was somewhat dissatisfied: "Although he slew Dark Pupil, he is not yet at the Great Saint realm, I can easily slay him!"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan smiled: "Who said he is only a Saint?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he is a Great Saint?" The other Deities' expressions became solemn.</p><p></p><p>If he was a Great Saint, the Two-Headed Snake Deity might indeed flip.</p><p></p><p>"He is not only a Great Saint, but an extraordinary Great Saint." Qihuan's eyes flashed with a greedy look, "He is a... Withered Mythical Deity."</p><p></p><p>"What... Mythical Deity?"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a Mythical Deity!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Deities present were terrified.</p><p></p><p>Mythical Deities and ordinary Yin Deities are completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that if a Mythical Deity acts, all 99 Deities in the Kuijin Realm would die.</p><p></p><p>Some of these Deities even wanted to leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years ago, one of my uncles wanted to step into the Yang Deity realm, and encountered this person... outside the Realm. The two collided."</p><p></p><p>Qihuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"The result, of course, was that my uncle failed, and after returning, he sat in seclusion for a millennium, and stepped into the Yang Deity realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qihuan mention his uncle, the Deities present were all filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan had quite a few uncles.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored... that there was even an uncle at the second layer of the Yang Deity realm, and it was said that this was not the strongest one.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan often mentioned his uncles, each one making these Deities revere him.</p><p></p><p>"As for him, the Withered Mythical Deity, he's probably just a bit stronger than the Stepping Heaven Six Steps, but much weaker than a true Mythical Deity," Qihuan said.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his uncle, he wouldn't have recognized Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, if we all join forces, even if we subdue him, the casualties would be severe. Please, Lord Qihuan, seek aid from the Black Sky Black Earth, only a Mythical Deity expert can slay this monster!" The Two-Headed Snake Deity said, his heart filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>If he went, he would really die.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan smiled: "You see, this is the Mandate Holder, blessed by the Mandate. If it weren't for my formidable uncles, perhaps the Kuijin Realm would be in peril today.</p><p></p><p>The Mandate may affect you, but it won't affect me."</p><p></p><p>Qihuan was very confident, his eyes flashing with a greedy look: "Why bother asking the Mythical Deity experts, we are enough to slay him!"</p><p></p><p>As a Stepping Heaven Six Steps Great Saint, Qihuan was very interested in Qi Yuan's physique.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Black Sky Black Earth was quite peculiar, and if he could obtain the physique of a powerful cultivator, he could greatly shorten his cultivation time.</p><p></p><p>If he slew Qi Yuan and obtained his corpse, he could leap into the peak of the Stepping Heaven Seven Steps.</p><p></p><p>This would save him tens of thousands of years of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So he did not want to ask the Mythical Deity to intervene.</p><p></p><p>With the Mythical Deity's help, Qi Yuan's corpse would be out of the question.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan chose to act himself.</p><p></p><p>"We... " Kaixi's expression was troubled, "Even if he is a Withered Mythical Deity, it would be difficult for us to slay him. Even if we do, it would require a huge price!"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat afraid.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan was unconcerned: "My uncle gave me Deific Source, why should I fear death? Even if we die, we will revive like Dark Pupil."</p><p></p><p>He had high-grade Deific Source.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Black Sky Black Earth were constantly replenishing it.</p><p></p><p>Yang Deities who die can be resurrected by consuming Deific Source.</p><p></p><p>Dark Pupil was also revived by Qihuan.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, we are unafraid of death, and together we can slay him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even if his strength is formidable, at worst we can all self-destruct, and wear him down!"</p><p></p><p>"But what if... he is not a Withered Mythical Deity?"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan's expression was calm: "Don't worry, my Deific Source is quite abundant."</p><p></p><p>It was not just a bit abundant, it was extremely abundant.</p><p></p><p>Enough to support the resurrection of a Realm Lord-level Yang Deity.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had quite a few uncles.</p><p></p><p>And he was also the only heir in their family.</p><p></p><p>The other Deities heard this and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>With abundant Deific Source, then it's not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Even if the opponent is a Perfect Mythical Deity, they can self-destruct a few times, and the opponent will probably die.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan was very confident. Even if there was a one-in-a-million chance that the opponent's mini-universe would explode, and he would be blessed by the Mandate and break through to the Ancestral Deity realm.</p><p></p><p>Without the Divine Wood's blessing, the Ancestral Deity is still just a larger Mythical Deity, they can continue to self-destruct and kill.</p><p></p><p>"The only problem is... what if he tries to escape, how will we stop him?" Kaixi Deity said.</p><p></p><p>With the Deific Source as a backup, they could slay Qi Yuan, but if Qi Yuan tried to escape, they would have difficulty stopping him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, since I've chosen to act, I naturally have the confidence to prevent him from escaping." Qihuan was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>He had a treasure that could create its own world.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, they would enter the treasure, and suck Qi Yuan in, Qi Yuan would not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before they slay Qi Yuan, they cannot leave the treasure either.</p><p></p><p>This is a minor matter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Finally, two days of peace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>The progress of his Becoming Mortal had finally increased by 1%.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had lived very leisurely.</p><p></p><p>On the rebel side, it seems they have guessed through the words "Becoming Mortal" that Qi Yuan was the one who slew the Dark Pupil Deity, and they did not dare to come disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Lian, she was still staying next door and had not left.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's strange, the Blood Tiger Gang hasn't come these past two days," Zhao Yan said, looking curiously at Qi Yuan sunbathing.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had been on tenterhooks, afraid that the Blood Tiger Gang would come looking for trouble, and he hadn't even gone out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Hong Mei's face broke into a radiant smile: "Perhaps it's because of my senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Her senior brother was also nearby, and she had told him about offending the Blood Tiger Gang. Given her senior brother's personality, he might have helped her deal with the Blood Tiger Gang.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Zhao Yan heard this and his face showed a grateful expression.</p><p></p><p>His affection for Hong Mei increased again.</p><p></p><p>"Master... shall we move our nest?" Zhao Yan asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>He had mentioned joining the Academy to his master more than once.</p><p></p><p>But the master was just an old stubborn, and he was unwilling to go.</p><p></p><p>"You move if you want to!" Qi Yuan glanced at Zhao Yan.</p><p></p><p>He was already deeply immersed in playing the role of the mundane Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after killing all those troublemakers, his mundane progress had become much faster.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>She didn't try to persuade him again, after all, she couldn't guarantee that she could get Qi Yuan to join the Academy.</p><p></p><p>After all, joining the Academy was very difficult, requiring the testing of knowledge, temperament, and talent, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhao Yan's expression was helpless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a rhythmic knocking sound came from the door.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang?</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei's face also showed a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Then, an old, refined voice came.</p><p></p><p>"May this old man have the opportunity to pay his respects to the master of the courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was so refined that just by listening to it, Zhao Yan felt as if he was bathing in a sea of books.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei's body trembled, and a look of disbelief appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>Because this voice... was so familiar.</p><p></p><p>He... how could he have come?</p><p></p><p>"No need to see him," Qi Yuan lying on the chaise longue directly refused.</p><p></p><p>Look at him, he's in the midst of cultivating his mundane state! Hong Mei was stunned, and she hurriedly said, "Senior, outside is... the Master of the Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan also froze when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Such a great figure as the Master of the Academy would actually come to visit the master here? "A special NPC?" Qi Yuan paused, "Does he know a lot of information?"</p><p></p><p>"No one in the Kui Jin Realm knows more than him!" Hong Mei said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Receive him!" Qi Yuan changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the white moonlight, he liked the most the kind of NPC who could explain things.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the background of the world and the plot would help him push the game forward.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan hadn't moved yet, but Hong Mei hurried to the front door and opened the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the hunchbacked old man, Hong Mei's face showed a deep sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked old man had white hair and beard, and looked only about one meter and sixty centimeters tall, no different from an ordinary old man.</p><p></p><p>But his long robe was neatly dressed, washed white, and meticulous.</p><p></p><p>One look and he had a scholarly air about him.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei was inwardly excited! This really was the Master of the Academy! Qi Yuan glanced at the hunchbacked old man, his face showing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Because the hidden information he saw with his eyes showed that this old man was not an ordinary NPC.</p><p></p><p>He was very special.</p><p></p><p>Even to the point of... he might not even be in a living state anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Old sir, are you writing a book?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that Xian Ling Ying Xiong had once said that he was helping an old gentleman collect some information.</p><p></p><p>Could it be him?</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy nodded: "Does the gentleman know me?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei, who saw this, was puzzled. Why did the Master of the Academy have such an attitude towards Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>And he called him "gentleman"?</p><p></p><p>Normally, they would call him "elder" or "young man".</p><p></p><p>The term "gentleman" was very rare.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qi Yuan had a special identity.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard a little about you. I'd like to ask you a few questions," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy's face broke into a smile: "Before the gentleman asks his questions, may this old man ask the gentleman a few questions?"</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei immediately perked up her ears and listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>"The gentleman resides in a humble abode, hiding in the common people, why did he suddenly slay the Ominous Deity with the Dark Pupils?" The Master of the Academy looked curiously at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Next to them, Red Mei and Zhao Yan were as shocked as if the sky had cracked open.</p><p></p><p>The Ominous Deity with the Dark Pupils was slain? </p><p></p><p>Slain by Qi Yuan!</p><p></p><p>"Because... I'm cultivating my mundane state," Qi Yuan answered truthfully. "I originally wanted to cultivate peacefully, but every day there were people coming to disturb me, making me irritated and unable to focus. I had no choice but to kill the strongest one in Cloud Blood City, the one with the Dark Pupils, so that I could have some peace and quiet without anyone disturbing me."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan: "???"</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei: "???"</p><p></p><p>To avoid being disturbed, he slew the Deity?</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy was also somewhat surprised, not expecting such an answer.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, but can the gentleman not have considered that after slaying the Deity, since this is a chaotic area, there will be a second Deity coming... I'm afraid the gentleman will have a hard time enjoying a moment of peace."</p><p></p><p>"Since he's come, I'll just kill them all, then I'm sure no one will disturb me anymore," Qi Yuan answered casually.</p><p></p><p>This was his simple and crude yet meticulous plan.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy paused, then slowly said, "The Deities are endless. Even if the gentleman kills all the Deities in the Kui Jin Realm, there may be even stronger Deities descending. The gentleman is alone here, I'm afraid he will be isolated and without any aid."</p><p></p><p>"Do I need to seek help? I clearly have the advantage!" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of strong opponents, he was just afraid they weren't strong enough.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy was stunned again, his curiosity even greater: "The gentleman is very interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you should have finished your questions, now it's my turn to ask you questions," Qi Yuan looked at the Master of the Academy. "The first question is... do you know what's inside the Divine Tree Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy furrowed his brow, not expecting someone to ask this question.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Tree Abyss, this old man has never been there, but I've heard some Mandate Holders say that it's empty inside, there's nothing there," the Master of the Academy answered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent for a moment, then continued to ask, "The second question, what are the Black Heavens, are they very strong?"</p><p></p><p>This was also what Qi Yuan was concerned about.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was practically a shareholder in this game, he couldn't let others take it over.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy fell even more silent, not expecting Qi Yuan to ask about this.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the Black Heavens, I'm afraid no one in this world knows their origins.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the entire Divine Wood Universe joined forces, and cooperated with a Void Traveler, to have that Void Traveler inquire the Mighty Void Realm Lord about the origins of the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord told the truth, but that Void Traveler couldn't remember any information about the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>So, regarding the Black Heavens, perhaps no one knows. Even if someone knows, if they don't have the strength to reach the level of the Void Realm Lord, they probably won't be able to remember it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>This Black Heavens... does seem to have some abilities.</p><p></p><p>"The third question, are the Black Heavens and Black Earth very strong, do they also have Realm Lords?"</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy was a bit puzzled, this Qi Yuan was a bit different from his imagination, but he still answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"There are only Realm Lords at the Rule Realm, the number unknown," the Master of the Academy told Qi Yuan the information he knew. "The Black Heavens and Black Earth are extremely strong, terrifyingly strong, making people feel hopeless, because their strength... is endless.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Black Heavens remain, even if the Black Earth die in battle, they can be revived."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, a trace of bitterness appeared on the old man's aged face.</p><p></p><p>Killed but revived, and even stronger than you, what kind of enemy is this... How many powerhouses of the Divine Wood Universe have died in battle, yet they have never truly killed a single Black Earth Yang God!</p><p></p><p>"Revived after death?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean it's an endless source of experience?</p><p></p><p>This is not a great enemy at all!</p><p></p><p>This is clearly... an ultimate, delicious white moonlight!</p><p></p><p>A white moonlight that constantly revives at the respawn point!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 510</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Liu Ping, the Princess of Changyang, is currently located at the Floating Cloud Tower in the capital of Ningguo..."</p><p></p><p>"Wang Xiaochuan, the richest man in Antan City, Jiangzhou, Ningguo, lives in Anle Garden..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Tu Jingshi, the third young master of the Tu family in Fengshan County, Jining Prefecture, Ningguo..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused for a moment: "Isn't this the guy who bought my sword?"</p><p></p><p>He had seen the Third Young Master Tu from two sides, and had seen a lot of hidden information about him, knowing his name.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he is indeed a rich guy."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't want to let the Antan City tycoon off either, he's the richest man!"</p><p></p><p>"It's too far away!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that he was just missing those with a lot of silver taels.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, I have not yet recovered, I can't go out casually."</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the old servant will go out in your place!" Chen Kangbao said opportunely.</p><p></p><p>"You're right." Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't go out now, but he could let someone else go in his place.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to refine some backup hidden energy sources!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, and began to forge again.</p><p></p><p>About a day passed, and Qi Yuan felt that everything was ready.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the 107 drones in front of him, and attached hidden energy sources to them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Mission accomplished, let them go get the money!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was startled when he saw this.</p><p></p><p>Was he going to lose his job?</p><p></p><p>Was he going to be replaced by these iron things? He hurriedly stepped forward, anxiously saying, "Young master, they don't know the way."</p><p></p><p>"I know that. Originally, I was thinking of refining a satellite and flying it into orbit.</p><p></p><p>But here... it's not a planet, and... no money, too troublesome."</p><p></p><p>When he was on the Blue Star, Qi Yuan's knowledge level was average.</p><p></p><p>But after going to the Sphere, Zero One had transmitted a huge amount of information to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The information of the Myriad Dao included information on various technological artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Even airships, sky eyes.</p><p></p><p>So making drones with super-strong endurance was not a problem for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the backup hidden energy sources not only have endurance, but also have smart chips, they can find their own way.</p><p></p><p>That's right, they are the latest smart drone robots!" Qi Yuan introduced seriously.</p><p></p><p>The creation of the smart chips, Qi Yuan imitated the original smart chips of Zero One.</p><p></p><p>The smart chips he made were a bit rougher than the old version of Zero One's.</p><p></p><p>But just for asking for money, it's still very simple.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao felt the crisis was getting more and more serious: "Young master, aren't they drones? How can they be robots?"</p><p></p><p>"..." Qi Yuan gave Chen Kangbao a blank look, "I need to give them a name."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, and then had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you are the Debt Collection Brigade, you are called Crow Brother, you go find Wang Xiaochuan; you are called Black Cat, you go find Huang Kan; you are called Chicken..."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan gave these drones special titles, he also used Thousand Changes and Myriad Transformations to turn them into various strange and wonderful forms according to their titles.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao saw this, and was extremely worried.</p><p></p><p>His competitors were quite a few.</p><p></p><p>What if the young master didn't want him anymore? But then he thought of something and breathed a sigh of relief: "Fortunately, I have a smart brain, I can be the young master's strategist, relying on my brain to make a living, I won't be eliminated, right?"</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you the one who eats with his nose?" Qi Yuan's words fell on Chen Kangbao's ears.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>He could even hear his inner thoughts? The young master is truly a god!</p><p></p><p>The young master is so handsome!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the ghost market, Uncle Tu and Zhan Lei had been lurking for several days, and both of them looked somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"After so many days, we still haven't seen those two mysterious people, it seems... that kind of superior person was just passing through this place."</p><p></p><p>"Such a superior person is hard to come by, who has the same good luck as Tu Jingshi?"</p><p></p><p>"His luck is indeed good, to get such a treasure for only ten thousand taels, it really makes one envious."</p><p></p><p>While the two were discussing Tu Jingshi's good luck, Tu Jingshi himself did not feel that way.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was trembling all over, looking at the terrifying figure in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It was like a green snake, and in the snake's eyes, one could vaguely see the emotions of a person.</p><p></p><p>Tu Jingshi's hand in his sleeve tightly grasped the sword, his mind in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>It's over, the sword is still in the cooling period! This must be the Thorn Blood, discovering that he had killed the two elders Black Crow and Winged Snake, coming to take his life!</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't have gone out to the brothel to listen to music tonight!</p><p></p><p>"The gods have lost their minds, the Thorn Blood is stained, I am the Green Snake of the Debt Collection Brigade." The green snake spoke, its voice somewhat mechanical.</p><p></p><p>This made Tu Jingshi's heart jump, but then he was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't it be coming to kill him? Why does it need to start reciting the secret language?</p><p></p><p>"The Third Young Master Tu pays respects to the Envoy!" He immediately knelt down, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"I need banknotes, all your banknotes, the more the better." The green snake spoke.</p><p></p><p>Banknotes?</p><p></p><p>Tu Jingshi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>It's not coming to kill him, but to ask for banknotes? This is too strange.</p><p></p><p>"The Envoy, please wait a moment, I'll go back and get the banknotes right away." He felt that he had been too unlucky lately.</p><p></p><p>Before Black Crow Elder left, he extorted him, and now another Thorn Blood Elder has come to ask for money?</p><p></p><p>Does his reputation for having money spread so widely that the Thorn Blood Elders know about it? Otherwise, how could there be people coming to ask him for money one after another?</p><p></p><p>The green snake looked at Tu Jingshi, its eyes seeming to have a spiritual nature.</p><p></p><p>"Undo your pants."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Tu Jingshi was stunned, but under the cold snake's gaze, he still undid his pants.</p><p></p><p>With a whoosh, the green snake turned into a phantom and darted into his pants.</p><p></p><p>Tu Jingshi immediately felt something hard in his pants.</p><p></p><p>He was terrified.</p><p></p><p>This Thorn Blood Elder is too uncivilized, he doesn't even care about face.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, I am loyal and have no other thoughts, I will get the money right away, you... don't bite randomly!"</p><p></p><p>He submitted, and didn't dare to do anything reckless, as it was related to his future happiness.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The green snake snorted coldly, without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back to the manor to get the money now!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in various parts of Ningguo, if one were to pay attention, one would find some strange creatures flying in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, there's a black cat flying in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"I think your eyes are playing tricks on you, our cat is afraid of even a fluttering moth, if it could fly..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not our cat!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly had an idea, if I install a storage talisman on these drones, wouldn't I be able to start an express delivery company, and even a food delivery service... how much money could I make?" In the Shen Manor, Qi Yuan suddenly had a bright idea.</p><p></p><p>In these days, the drones have gradually returned.</p><p></p><p>The banknotes on him have also become more and more.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Thorn Blood, each with a small heart, upon hearing the drones speak the secret language, hurriedly handed over the banknotes.</p><p></p><p>Due to the limited space of the drones, Qi Yuan only took the banknotes.</p><p></p><p>This made him feel very heartbroken, feeling that he had lost a hundred million.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan smiled and temporarily gave up this idea.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was not short of money.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Thorn Blood, except for a few who were poor, were mostly wealthy.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's not the poor who would join an alternative organization like the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Cleaver, I'm very curious, how many people are in your Debt Collection Brigade. Could it be that you are like my Thorn Blood, also undergoing transformation?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Experiment to create people?"</p><p></p><p>A message was sent by the staff of the Jingzhi Blood's department.</p><p></p><p>He gave the addresses of those people to Qi Yuan, naturally with malicious intent, wanting to grasp Qi Yuan's movements.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect that Qi Yuan would dispatch a drone to collect the debt, and transform the drone into an animal form.</p><p></p><p>Some of the Jingzhi Blood members who had mastered the secret passages reported this matter.</p><p></p><p>The staff member of the Jingzhi Blood was also surprised to receive the news.</p><p></p><p>"Our debt collection brothers and sisters are scattered throughout the myriad realms. As long as someone has money, no, as long as someone owes me money, they will come to find them on my behalf." Qi Yuan spoke nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Where is there any debt collection department, it's just a bunch of junk.</p><p></p><p>"The hiding place of the Caidao brothers is really deep. When the Shenmu Abyss opens, the debt collection brothers and sisters can all come over..."</p><p></p><p>"What, do you all in the Jingzhi Blood owe me money?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"If you bring the Shenmu Decree, what's the problem with the Jingzhi Blood owing you money?"</p><p></p><p>"You are really good people, I have earned over a million taels of silver!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but exclaim, "Do you want to give me the information of the Jingzhi Blood members in other countries outside of Ningguo, so that I can go and collect money from them?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Caidao's appetite is a bit big."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, why don't you tell Brother Caidao the address of your headquarters, so that he can go and collect the money?" Ji Wuyun spoke up at the right time.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>The headquarters of the Jingzhi Blood, of course, could not be exposed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed, half a month flashed by.</p><p></p><p>The drones gradually returned.</p><p></p><p>Only one drone, while flying in the air, collided with a strange spirit and was damaged, its whereabouts unknown, and it did not return.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also gradually received the bank notes, totaling two million taels.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that my strength has not fully recovered yet, this Shenlin cannot be used casually after I become a god."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt.</p><p></p><p>When he used Shenlin before, it was impressive, but the consumption on his body was too great.</p><p></p><p>It took him nearly twenty days to recover.</p><p></p><p>"However, it should be that I was too weak at the time. If it's the me with recovered strength using it now, it shouldn't consume this much."</p><p></p><p>Due to the ongoing recovery of his strength, Qi Yuan has been very low-key, hardly leaving the Shen Mansion.</p><p></p><p>To buy materials at the Ghost Market, he also sent the drones to go.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shen Lingfeng came over.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, are you going to Yeshanlake?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's words had a touch of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, to see Chen Shi's test. If it's suitable, I'll go to Yeshanlake to have a look, I should also see your sister." Qi Yuan replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the master craftsmen of the major families in Jining Prefecture have been gradually heading to Yeshanlake to participate in the Forging Conference.</p><p></p><p>In the Shen Mansion, those master craftsmen have also begun to select suitable talents to go to Yeshanlake.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the past, Qi Yuan might not have gone to Yeshanlake.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Forging Conference is about to open in Yeshanlake, and many master craftsmen will participate.</p><p></p><p>Around Yeshanlake, the largest Ghost Market will also open, as well as various trading auctions, for the master craftsmen to trade.</p><p></p><p>Holding two million in cash, how could he not go to buy more forging materials? Qi Yuan even thought about whether he should forge some Armored Warriors.</p><p></p><p>After all, shouldn't a god have some divine guards? To forge these, the materials from the Ofeng Prefecture Ghost Market would not suffice.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, brother-in-law, when you're not here, how am I going to deal with those dozens of women... I can't handle them." Shen Lingfeng expressed his purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, teach me one more trick in romance!" Shen Lingfeng looked up at Qi Yuan with eager anticipation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's expression suddenly turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Apologize!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Brother-in-law, what did I do wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Apologize!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Brother-in-law, I didn't do anything wrong, did I? Is it a misunderstanding?"</p><p></p><p>"I told you to apologize! Do you hear me?"</p><p></p><p>"I... brother-in-law, I didn't do anything wrong, right? Is it a misunderstanding?"</p><p></p><p>"Apologize first!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, brother-in-law, can you tell me what I did wrong now?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you have already mastered the biggest trick in romance, apologizing in all kinds of inexplicable situations." Qi Yuan expressed his opinion, "You can graduate now, but you must remember, as a young man, you must cherish yourself, and don't casually give your body to bad women."</p><p></p><p>"Ah..." Shen Lingfeng seemed to understand and not understand, "Brother-in-law, your words are so profound, but there's one thing I don't understand, why should I give my body to women? Are they going to eat it?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Shen Lingfeng meaningfully and nodded, "Putting it that way... it's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>"When does your mother take a bath?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Shen Lingfeng's expression was difficult, as if he still had some fear and terror.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of being hung on the beam last time was quite large.</p><p></p><p>"I'll teach you a trick, you go persuade your father and mother that you want a little sister, then they will definitely, hehe..." Qi Yuan felt he was too clever.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Shen Lingfeng still didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>"Do as I said!" Qi Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with people like Shen Lingfeng, you don't need to explain, just tell him what to do.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng saw this and quickly left.</p><p></p><p>Now, the role of the son-in-law has also stalled.</p><p></p><p>Staying at 56%, Qi Yuan felt that to break through, just like last time to obtain the Forging Heart, doing things like pouring bathwater for the mother-in-law and riding Shen Linxuan would have to be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, last time when he invited Shen Linxuan, she didn't agree.</p><p></p><p>"Should I sneak and ride her?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm an upright gentleman, not that kind of despicable person!"</p><p></p><p>"Mother-in-law, take a bath!"</p><p></p><p>The night was pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng quietly knocked on Qi Yuan's door.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, I did as you said, I told my mother that I want a little sister!" Shen Lingfeng was anxious.</p><p></p><p>"What was your mother's reaction?"</p><p></p><p>"She... seemed a little flushed, and then..." Shen Lingfeng tried to recall, "She glanced at my father, and my father showed a strange smile."</p><p></p><p>"It's done!" Qi Yuan slapped his thigh.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Shen Lingfeng was a bit confused, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Look at the night now... come, let's go to the kitchen and boil some water!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very eager.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he could pour bathwater for the mother-in-law.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, why do you want to pour bathwater for my mother... does it have any deep meaning?"</p><p></p><p>"In this world, how many things have meaning? Do you have to write an after-fart essay every time you fart?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Shen Lingfeng carried a large wooden bucket, the bucket filled with boiling hot water, with some flower petals in it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go find your mother."</p><p></p><p>The two headed towards the main courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, the maids and servants saw this and quickly said, "Young master, brother-in-law, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, don't come in!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you blocking me for, I'm carrying bathwater for my mother!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't block it, if the water spills and hurts the young master, what do we do!" Qi Yuan fanned the flames.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, these people didn't dare to obstruct, letting Qi Yuan and Shen Lingfeng enter the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan was very high-EQ, he only stopped at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Put the bucket down, just leave it here!" Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't ruin someone else's good thing, right?</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was very large, and it was far away from here, so the mother-in-law probably didn't know what was happening here yet. Shen Lingfeng quickly put down the bucket, sweating profusely, "My mother won't blame me, will she?"</p><p></p><p>"As such a thoughtful son, she loves you more than anything, how could she blame you?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

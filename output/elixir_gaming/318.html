        <h1>Chapter 318</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Luo family and Chen family residences were separated by just one street.</p><p></p><p>The Luo family residence was located in the southern part of Yunyan County. They were in the silk business, with operations not limited to just Yunyan County, but extending throughout the entire prefecture. </p><p></p><p>Old Master Luo was known for his generosity and charitable deeds, often repairing roads and distributing porridge to the poor. He had a very good reputation in Yunyan County.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Luo's greatest pride was having a son who was a martial arts prodigy. </p><p></p><p>This son, Luo Bufan, had an extremely high aptitude for martial arts. He even had the potential to be specially recruited by the Demon Suppression Bureau and become a Guardian.</p><p></p><p>However, half a month ago, Luo Bufan of the Luo family went missing. This caused an uproar in Yunyan County. Old Master Luo even offered a reward of 7,000 taels of silver to find his son Luo Bufan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the son was not found. A week ago, the entire Luo family was killed, shocking all of Yunyan County.</p><p></p><p>That night, not only was the Luo family massacred, but the Chen family also suffered the same fate, with all 76 members of their household killed.</p><p></p><p>Yunyan County was in turmoil. People from the Demon Suppression Bureau also came to Yunyan County to investigate the massacre.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat casually, sipping thin porridge, his thoughts wandering: "There's no glass or cannons here. If I were to make these things, wouldn't I make a fortune?"</p><p></p><p>This game was indeed suitable for farming and developing technology.</p><p></p><p>But after some thought, Qi Yuan didn't dwell on it further.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to complete the mission first. He was in a hurry to return and participate in the martial arts competition, and was also waiting to form his Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, what a pity. The young master of the Luo family and the young lady of the Chen family had just gotten engaged, only to meet with such a tragic fate."</p><p></p><p>Nearby, some commoners were discussing in hushed tones, their words tinged with regret.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood up, no longer listening to the discussions of these NPCs around him.</p><p></p><p>He had gathered most of the information he could obtain.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he headed towards the Luo family residence.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the Luo residence, the entire street became desolate, with even beggars rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>From over a hundred meters away, Qi Yuan could already smell the thick scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, constables from the magistrate's office had set up a cordon, prohibiting ordinary people from entering.</p><p></p><p>Was Qi Yuan an ordinary person? No.</p><p></p><p>He was a player.</p><p></p><p>So, he swaggered towards the Luo residence.</p><p></p><p>Ahead, several yamen runners and constables were chatting idly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing someone approach, the constables perked up. When they saw who it was, Li Shu adjusted his sword and glanced sideways at Qi Yuan: "Qi Er, why aren't you selling pork properly and coming here instead? I thought it was an expert from the Demon Suppression Bureau, gave your Master Li quite a scare."</p><p></p><p>Li Shu often bought pork from Qi Er, well... without paying. So, Li Shu knew Qi Er.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to complete a mission," Sincerity was the ultimate weapon.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that these NPCs also had the right to know this was a game world.</p><p></p><p>"So, hurry up and let me in to complete the mission. I'm in a rush to log off," Qi Yuan had always been rule-abiding and reasonable. If he wasn't afraid of being too conspicuous, he would have even carved the character for "reason" on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Qi Yuan's words made Li Shu pause: "You fool, did you go mad because Fourth Master Huang married your child bride?"</p><p></p><p>When Fourth Master Huang was going to marry Qi Er's child bride, Qi Er had even gone to Li Shu for help.</p><p></p><p>The result was predictable. Although Li Shu owed Qi Er money, he simply didn't repay it.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a man and woman dressed in black fitted clothes walked over.</p><p></p><p>The round-faced woman was tall, holding a leather whip in her left hand and leading a large black dog with her right: "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomers, Li Shu immediately changed his demeanor: "Honored sir and madam, this Qi Er is a butcher from the city. He seems to have gone mad and insists on entering the Luo residence.</p><p></p><p>I suspect he might be connected to the Luo family massacre. Should we arrest him and throw him in jail?"</p><p></p><p>His words were quite malicious.</p><p></p><p>In this world, being arrested and imprisoned meant you'd be lucky to survive with just your skin intact.</p><p></p><p>Li Shu's intentions were originally very sinister. He thought to take this opportunity to have Qi Er killed.</p><p></p><p>That way, he wouldn't have to repay the money he owed, and... the scheme he had set up back then would remain unknown.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan owing gambling debts and using his child bride to pay them off was Li Shu's scheme.</p><p></p><p>The round-faced woman glanced at Qi Yuan, her smile playful: "He's so handsome, he looks like a good person at first glance.</p><p></p><p>What a pity, being so handsome yet working as a butcher."</p><p></p><p>The round-faced woman's words left Li Shu stunned.</p><p></p><p>The man in black fitted clothes chuckled: "Don't let love cloud your judgment during a mission."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the round-faced woman didn't often behave this way.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the two of them with a curious expression: "Are you two also players, players in the game?"</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>This world was a large-scale game, yet there were players in the game world.</p><p></p><p>"Are you... a newbie?" the round-faced woman asked in surprise, her eyes suddenly burning with interest.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a newbie!" the man in black fitted clothes glanced at Qi Yuan, making his judgment.</p><p></p><p>The natives of this world couldn't utter the word "player".</p><p></p><p>"We're not players, we're from the Demon Suppression Bureau!" the round-faced woman spoke up, "After this mission is completed... if you're still alive, we might become colleagues in the future."</p><p></p><p>In this world, looks were justice.</p><p></p><p>Beauty alone was a sin, but combined with other qualities, in a modernized society, it would be lethal.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were ugly, she wouldn't have bothered to say so much.</p><p></p><p>The round-faced woman looked at Li Shu and smiled faintly: "He's one of us."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she patted Li Shu's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Li Shu hurriedly put on a fawning smile, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead: "It was my mistake for not recognizing him!"</p><p></p><p>How did this Qi Er get involved with the Demon Suppression Bureau?</p><p></p><p>This won't do, he needs to quickly report this to Fourth Master Huang.</p><p></p><p>With the Demon Suppression Bureau's intervention, Qi Yuan got his wish and entered the Luo family compound.</p><p></p><p>The round-faced woman looked around, holding the leash of the large black dog, and said with a bright smile: "You should thank me. That constable just now harbored ill intentions towards you, I helped you resolve that.</p><p></p><p>You're really lucky, encountering a beautiful woman like me on your first mission.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else, who knows how they might have tricked you."</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when she patted Li Shu's shoulder, it was to deal him a fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes: "He still hasn't paid back the money he owes me, and you've already killed him?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the man in black fitted clothes quickly said: "Let's not talk about these trivial matters now, our mission is urgent!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked at the round-faced woman and the large black dog she was leading.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Bai, go and sniff around, see if you can find any clues," the round-faced woman shook the leash, signaling the black dog to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"This is no ordinary dog, it's a tracking dog, very rare and valuable, captured by An Qiao.</p><p></p><p>This dog is similar to police dogs in reality, able to smell things that ordinary people can't, very helpful for our mission.</p><p></p><p>However, this dog's personality is a bit... tsk tsk." The man in black fitted clothes also enthusiastically explained to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked at the tracking dog. This dog, like the big black dog in Qi Yuan's Qingshui Village, had black fur, but compared to the energetic one in Qingshui Village, this dog seemed listless, its eyes carrying the clarity and foolishness of a college student.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Bai, hurry up and sniff around!" An Qiao urged the black dog.</p><p></p><p>The black dog lazily lay on the ground, not bothering to move at all.</p><p></p><p>The man in black fitted clothes nearby laughed: "Expecting the dog to work without feeding it well."</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog wagged its tail slightly, as if agreeing with the man's words.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao revealed a foxy smile: "Good thing I came prepared. I personally cooked a meal this morning."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, a basket appeared in her hand out of nowhere, filled with steaming hot food.</p><p></p><p>"Storage space?" Qi Yuan looked towards the man in black fitted clothes.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's eyes, this man in black fitted clothes served the role of an explanatory NPC, so Qi Yuan felt no pressure in asking directly.</p><p></p><p>Asking questions without shame.</p><p></p><p>The man in black fitted clothes also amiably played his role: "This isn't a storage space, it's a martial technique.</p><p></p><p>When you become a blood warrior, you can also exchange for skills and cultivate martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>The principle of this technique is to use blood energy to construct a space for storage."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, all paths lead to the same destination," Qi Yuan exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Blood warriors at the Blood Realm stage, comparable to cultivators at the Qi Condensation stage, could already have something similar to a cultivator's storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was quite good.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that to refine storage bags or storage rings, one needs to be at least an Yuan Dan cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, An Qiao brought out the food and placed it in front of the tracking dog.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the specially prepared meal and immediately lost his appetite. </p><p></p><p>The tracking dog sniffed expectantly, but then made a disgusted face.</p><p></p><p>The man in black fitted clothing also smiled.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the tracking dog stared at An Qiao and actually spoke human words: "How about... you eat it first and then poop it out for me to eat?"</p><p></p><p>This food was clearly not meant for humans, the smell was too pungent.</p><p></p><p>Even dogs wouldn't eat it.</p><p></p><p>It was so bad it made the dog speak human language.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's face immediately turned purple: "Fat dog, eat it or don't, hurry up and sniff for any clues!"</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog grumbled: "You want the dog to work but won't let it eat its fill, you're really doggone!"</p><p></p><p>But even as it said this, since An Qiao had already called it "fat dog", if it didn't get to work, An Qiao would really get angry.</p><p></p><p>It lowered its head, sniffing left and right.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others followed behind it, also scanning the Luo family compound.</p><p></p><p>The Luo family compound was empty, with some bloodstains on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Strangely though, there were no signs of a struggle.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, there are no signs of a fight, nor any traces of fire. Yet all their bodies have been turned to charcoal, we can't make out anything," said the man in black fitted clothing suspiciously. </p><p></p><p>Last night, when they examined the bodies, all of them had been reduced to charcoal. The stench was unbearable, making it nearly impossible to find any useful information.</p><p></p><p>"You're really stupid. Obviously they were burned after death, and clearly it was that County Magistrate who did it," An Qiao said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>The man in black fitted clothing became alert upon hearing this: "So it was him... It seems this matter runs very deep. But this mission was supposed to include a newcomer, so the difficulty should have been low. This Yunyan County not only has three major demon factions, but even the County Magistrate is... harboring evil intentions. Something's not right."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, for novice missions, the toughest enemy would at most be a demon of the Blood Qi realm. </p><p></p><p>This mission was labeled as an investigation. Investigation missions aren't difficult, but whatever killed the Luo family was clearly no ordinary demon.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that both the Luo and Chen families had Blood Warriors.</p><p></p><p>Investigating such demons, experienced members like themselves might have some self-preservation ability, but for a newcomer like Qi Yuan, it would be almost suicidal.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because I'm so special that my mission has a tiny bit more difficulty," Qi Yuan replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You're very lucky to have met us," the man in black fitted clothing sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the tracking dog also spoke up: "I smell two demonic scents here - one is weasel, and the other is... aquatic. There's also another scent that's familiar, as if I've smelled it somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>"It involves two major demon factions?" The round-faced woman's expression also turned grim.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, Chen Fan had mentioned that there were three demon factions in Yunyan County that couldn't be easily offended.</p><p></p><p>Two of those were the weasel and aquatic clans.</p><p></p><p>This case involving both of those factions naturally alarmed them.</p><p></p><p>"The strongest fighter in the weasel clan is at the peak of Blood Warrior realm. Among the four of us, only the captain is a match for him. As for the aquatic clan, it's rumored they have demons above the Blood Qi realm. This is difficult, very difficult!" The round-faced woman furrowed her brows.</p><p></p><p>This investigation suddenly provoked two major factions, leaving them in a precarious position.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the big black dog and asked: "The familiar scent, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>As for the weasel and aquatic clans, Qi Yuan was planning to seek them out anyway.</p><p></p><p>They were his mobile blood banks after all.</p><p></p><p>Right now, he was focused on investigating the true cause behind the destruction of the Luo and Chen families.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," the tracking dog shook its head.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had also seen a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>But for him, that information wasn't important.</p><p></p><p>For example, he saw that Old Man Huang had visited the Luo residence, and an aquatic demon had been here too.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the tracking dog sniffed and moved closer to Qi Yuan, taking a strong whiff: "Strange... you also have a scent similar to that aquatic demon, but... it's not quite the same."</p><p></p><p>"Have you encountered an aquatic demon?" asked the round-faced woman.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, lost in thought: "Aquatic demons... I don't think so?"</p><p></p><p>Since arriving in this world, his eyes had been constantly looking around, searching for useful information.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't encountered any aquatic demons.</p><p></p><p>As for his previous self? Even less likely.</p><p></p><p>He had descended into this world in his original form.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Er, he was long gone.</p><p></p><p>"How odd," the man in black fitted clothing frowned.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan asked: "Do you have any martial techniques or cultivation methods here? Can you give me some? I'd like to learn, especially that storage technique from earlier, I'm quite interested."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was being a freeloader again.</p><p></p><p>After all, the others were NPCs.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to trade, he'd trade.</p><p></p><p>"Our martial techniques... can't be traded," the man in black fitted clothing shook his head. "You can only exchange for them after joining the Demon Suppression Bureau."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to find some martial arts manuals around here," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>His strength wasn't enough yet, he needed to learn some techniques and master cultivation methods to improve his abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Don't learn any martial arts from here!" the round-faced woman quickly warned. "The martial arts here are... old arts. Once you learn old arts, it's very difficult to change your path."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The setting is so complex, there's even a distinction between old and new arts? Which is stronger, old or new?"</p><p></p><p>"Those of us in the Demon Suppression Bureau all practice new arts," An Qiao said at this point. "Although in this world, old and new arts may seem similar with comparable power, there's one clear difference between them - old arts only work in this world. In a new world, practitioners of old arts... will drop a full level in strength. New arts practitioners don't have this problem, they can maintain their strength in any world. In our Demon Suppression Bureau, there are many senior members who unfortunately didn't understand this at first and chose old arts. What a pity."</p><p></p><p>The round-faced woman looked regretful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Many worlds? Many games?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, each of our missions is actually in a different... parallel world," the round-faced woman replied. "Only new arts are universally applicable across all worlds."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes: "This setting... how is it related to the Great Ultimate Principle realm from Yang Shen?"</p><p></p><p>"Yang Shen? Great Ultimate Principle realm? What are those?" An Qiao asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>I recommend my friend's book "Fairy, I've Come to Help You Cultivate". It's a multi-female lead story, and it's really not the author's alt account, so please don't pressure him. His harem writing is very spicy, much better than the author's writing skills.</p><p></p><p>There's a link below, you can bookmark it.</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: Possessing the Teaching Return System, anyone Qi Yuan instructs who develops positive emotions towards him becomes bound as a return target.</p><p></p><p>Sword techniques, cultivation methods, divine abilities, skills... all 100% returned.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan is thus dedicated to imparting knowledge and solving doubts.</p><p></p><p>He teaches unreservedly to fellow disciples and friends.</p><p></p><p>Even enemies must be turned into friends.</p><p></p><p>There's the cold and aloof junior sister focused solely on the sword and cultivation, the widowed mother of the child of destiny, the inherently alluring medicine valley heir who longs to heal the world...</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Qi Yuan has guided and helped countless geniuses, seemingly on the verge of becoming invincible.</p><p></p><p>But these people have turned into emotional debts, coming to find him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan calmly explains: "Romance between men and women hinders cultivation. When your cultivation is complete, we can grow old together without parting... Hm? You ask why the Charm Demoness is allowed? Her techniques are special, being with me actually promotes faster cultivation progress."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

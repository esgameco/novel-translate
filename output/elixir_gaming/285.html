        <h1>Chapter 285</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You're quite unexpected too," Qi Yuan glanced at the woman in the tight-fitting outfit.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the tight outfit was slightly stunned, a complex look flashing in her beautiful eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You're not pretending to be sick, are you?" There was surprise in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She had seen Qi Yuan's diagnosis and had also spoken with that female doctor. Qi Yuan's diagnosis was not in question.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know I'm just pretending to be sick? Having a certificate of mental illness makes it easier to do things," Qi Yuan said seriously. </p><p></p><p>He had always kept this mental illness certificate. Right now, he was playing the role of someone with a mental illness.</p><p></p><p>"Really?" The woman in the tight outfit looked curious, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"It's the real deal. Do I look like someone with a mental illness to you?" Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the set meal they ordered was served. Qi Yuan and the woman began to share the food.</p><p></p><p>They chatted as they ate.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Cui Fan? Where is he? I need to find him urgently," Qi Yuan asked while eating a chicken leg.</p><p></p><p>Finding Cui Fan was of course to borrow high-interest loans. He might be able to borrow hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the tight outfit smiled coyly, "He's been arrested and is in prison."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was stunned. "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Such bad luck! He was chatting with Cui Fan just two days ago, planning to borrow some high-interest loans to spend, and now he's in prison?</p><p></p><p>"He was suspected of illegal high-interest loan operations, violent debt collection, and so on, so he was arrested. By the way, Tiangyue City has been cracking down hard these past few days. Most high-interest lenders have been arrested," the woman in the tight outfit said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Are you short on money?" the woman in the tight outfit asked Qi Yuan casually.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I was planning to borrow some from high-interest lenders," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Based on what Xiao Mei said, it seemed borrowing from high-interest lenders was out of the question for now.</p><p></p><p>"High-interest lenders have backgrounds that are not to be trifled with. They're either involved with organized crime or... If you're short on money, it's best not to borrow from high-interest lenders," the woman named Xiao Mei said softly.</p><p></p><p>In Tiangyue City, the relationships of high-interest lenders were complex. Those arrested were merely sacrificial pawns.</p><p></p><p>"But... I need money," Qi Yuan said helplessly. "These police are working too efficiently. Couldn't they wait until after I borrowed the money to make arrests? That way, I wouldn't even have to pay it back."</p><p></p><p>"What do you need so much money for? How much do you need?" the woman in the tight outfit asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"I want to practice martial arts, boxing!" Qi Yuan's expression became serious. This was also his current main quest.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts..." The woman in the tight outfit was slightly stunned, as if remembering something. A complex look flashed in her eyes. "There's no future in martial arts. Even if you become the best in Qinyuan country, at most you'd just become an internet celebrity."</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't a mentally ill person like me make a lot of money as an internet celebrity? Are you saying practicing martial arts has less of a future than working in a factory tightening screws?" Qi Yuan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the tight outfit was speechless.</p><p></p><p>She had been looking at it from too high a perspective.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, for Qi Yuan, practicing martial arts was indeed a... way out.</p><p></p><p>"If you need money, I can lend you some. How about 100,000?" the woman in the tight outfit asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt disappointed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to borrow money that he wouldn't have to pay back.</p><p></p><p>With someone like Xiao Mei, it was obvious he would have to repay it.</p><p></p><p>"I'll borrow, but can I borrow more?" Qi Yuan urgently needed money.</p><p></p><p>Besides what he needed for martial arts training, he also needed to buy various materials for cultivating immortality.</p><p></p><p>So, he needed to get more money.</p><p></p><p>"How about 90 million?" Qi Yuan looked at Xiao Mei expectantly. She seemed very capable.</p><p></p><p>So he might as well ask for more. What if it worked?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Mei was speechless. She looked at Qi Yuan and finally said, "At most 300,000."</p><p></p><p>She had calculated the price well.</p><p></p><p>300,000 was enough for Qi Yuan to dabble in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, 300,000 it is," Qi Yuan was easily satisfied.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he gave his bank account number to Xiao Mei.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Mei squinted at Qi Yuan, "It's our first time meeting, and it's a blind date. I'm willing to lend you 300,000. Aren't you afraid... there might be some scheme?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if it were anyone else, today's events would not have happened.</p><p></p><p>"I have a mental illness certificate. I'm not afraid of schemes," Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"Now I'm really suspecting you're just pretending," the woman in the tight outfit said.</p><p></p><p>"I've been pretending all along."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, check your account. I've transferred the money to you. Goodbye," the woman said decisively as she stood up. Her black tight-fitting outfit clung to her long legs, making them appear more fleshy.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, don't go. We haven't paid for the meal yet!" Qi Yuan called out to the woman in the tight outfit.</p><p></p><p>The woman was stunned, "I'm paying?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen a mentally ill person pay for their own meal?"</p><p></p><p>The woman's face froze. She gritted her teeth and looked at Qi Yuan, "Fine, I'll pay!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lowered his head and continued eating his Qin Deji.</p><p></p><p>After paying, the woman in the tight outfit left the restaurant and got into a black car parked on the street.</p><p></p><p>There were two people already in the car.</p><p></p><p>A male driver and a muscular woman.</p><p></p><p>Both were sitting in the front, while the woman in the tight outfit sat in the back.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, is it done?" the muscular woman spoke, her voice gruff.</p><p></p><p>"Mm..." The woman in the tight outfit had a deep look in her eyes. "I've seen Master's son... Judging by his condition, his body seems fine. It looks like the information we received before was incorrect."</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, the woman in the tight outfit had received news that Master's son was seriously ill. She hurried back, intending to see Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But upon meeting him today, although Qi Yuan looked a bit weak, he could still eat. Moreover, her military-grade detection device didn't find any major problems with Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>So, the weight on her mind was lifted.</p><p></p><p>"That's good news," the muscular woman squeezed out a smile. "It's a blessing that he could grow up safe and sound."</p><p></p><p>"He wants to practice martial arts," the woman in the tight outfit said pensively, fingering a small knife in her slender hands, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts?" The muscular woman's pupils constricted. "Could it be... he knows about Master's death... and wants revenge? But... how could martial arts be enough..."</p><p></p><p>The woman in the tight outfit smiled gracefully, "You're overthinking it. From what I saw, his interest in martial arts is merely for physical fitness. As for Master's affairs, we'll handle that ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"You're right," the muscular woman nodded. "Sigh, I don't know what's going on lately, but we've been getting more and more missions. It seems like something strange is happening."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it seems like there are more missions to explore ancient tombs and relics," the woman in the tight outfit frowned.</p><p></p><p>Such missions used to be occasional, but rare.</p><p></p><p>Recently, however, they've been popping up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling something big is about to happen," the muscular woman murmured.</p><p></p><p>The driver in front laughed, "No matter how big it is, could it possibly affect small fry like us?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mingwu Martial Arts Gym.</p><p></p><p>Located in Tianshan Building, it occupied three floors: the second, third, and fourth.</p><p></p><p>Mingwu Martial Arts Gym's strength ranked among the top eight of all martial arts gyms in Tiangyue City.</p><p></p><p>Every year, many children would come here to practice martial arts and build up their bodies.</p><p></p><p>At this moment in Mingwu Martial Arts Gym, a group of children dressed in training clothes were practicing martial arts in the main hall, punching and kicking, looking quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan leaned on the railing, watching below</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The performance below: "These are all just for show. I could easily take on ten of them. Is there any real martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>The people from the nearby martial arts school couldn't hold back anymore, and awkward smiles appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The group of martial arts practitioners below were at most 8 or 9 years old.</p><p></p><p>You're an adult, saying you could take on ten of them - aren't you embarrassed to mention that?</p><p></p><p>"If you want to learn real martial arts, the registration fee is a bit more expensive, 120,000 yuan. But there will be additional costs later..." said the martial arts school staff.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, sign me up quickly," said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He didn't look at the techniques of those children below anymore, as those martial arts moves were too basic. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to see what the martial arts of this world were like, and how they differed from the martial arts of the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan was led by the martial arts school staff member to the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Second Senior Brother's office. To learn formal martial arts, you need to pass a test here."</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't I be able to learn just by paying? Doing business still requires a test? What if I don't pass the test?"</p><p></p><p>"Learning true martial arts is definitely different." The staff member's gaze towards Qi Yuan also changed.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the poor study books, the rich learn martial arts. </p><p></p><p>Those who can truly learn martial arts must have some money in their family.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they simply can't afford to learn.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the staff member knocked on the door.</p><p></p><p>From inside the room, a deep voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Come in!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the staff member into the spacious training room.</p><p></p><p>The staff member hurriedly said, "Second Senior Brother, this person is here to learn real martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked at the man before him, his gaze slightly focused.</p><p></p><p>The man had a crew cut and a square face, with a tall and strong build that looked very powerful at first glance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan noticed that his nostrils were quite large, especially the left nostril, which was noticeably larger than the right.</p><p></p><p>His gaze immediately fell on one of the crew-cut man's fingers.</p><p></p><p>"You're here to learn martial arts?" The Second Senior Brother looked at Qi Yuan with a strange gaze. "Your body seems to have some issues."</p><p></p><p>"Just some minor ailments, not worth mentioning. How do we do the test?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>He was wondering, if it involved feeling his bones, how he should refuse.</p><p></p><p>The Second Senior Brother in front of him clearly often picked his nose.</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple."</p><p></p><p>The Second Senior Brother opened a drawer and took out a wooden token.</p><p></p><p>The token was pitch black and looked quite old.</p><p></p><p>"Drop a drop of blood on it." The Second Senior Brother placed the token in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Drop blood? How is this like cultivating immortality?" Qi Yuan had a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was the first time he had seen blood-dropping required for martial arts training.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan bit his finger, and a drop of blood fell onto the wooden tablet.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched the tablet, wanting to see what would happen.</p><p></p><p>After about a few breaths of time, several white lines appeared on the black wooden tablet, continuously spreading.</p><p></p><p>"Three lines, hmm... basically satisfactory, lower-middle aptitude, can practice martial arts." The Second Senior Brother gave his judgment.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he put the wooden tablet back in his drawer.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's finger lightly tapped, and the blood that had rolled into the wooden tablet silently returned to his body.</p><p></p><p>This scene was not noticed by others.</p><p></p><p>"Do these lines indicate aptitude?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the martial arts of this world were indeed different from those of the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Mm!" The Second Senior Brother nodded vigorously. The power of martial arts largely depends on one's aptitude.</p><p></p><p>"Generally speaking, people in our Qin Yuan country all have some martial arts aptitude.</p><p></p><p>The higher the aptitude, the more suitable for practicing martial arts, and the greater achievements one can attain.</p><p></p><p>When I was tested, I had five lines!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Senior Brother straightened his shoulders as he said this.</p><p></p><p>Although in the outside world, martial arts weren't worth mentioning - after all, decades of practice might not be as effective as someone getting an injection - within the internal martial arts circles, there was still a hierarchy.</p><p></p><p>"What's the maximum number of lines?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard my master say the maximum is twelve lines.</p><p></p><p>Such geniuses might be able to leap ten meters in just a few months of practice!" The Second Senior Brother's face showed a look of longing as he said this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite speechless upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He could already leap ten meters now.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the martial arts masters of this world were still quite weak.</p><p></p><p>"How strong is the champion of the martial arts competition? How many meters can they step?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This was what he was most concerned about.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a man destined to become the Human Dao Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Wouldn't that be over ten meters in one step?" The Second Senior Brother looked at Qi Yuan. "Don't aim too high, not everyone can participate in the martial arts competition!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan as if he had seen through his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He had seen many washed-up idols come to learn martial arts and participate in martial arts competitions, just to try to regain their celebrity status.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's looks were very good, so even if he couldn't get a good ranking in the martial arts competition, he could still gain some attention.</p><p></p><p>He might even become an internet celebrity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite speechless upon hearing the Second Senior Brother's words.</p><p></p><p>Leaping over ten meters?</p><p></p><p>The champion of the martial arts competition? This was too weak, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of this mission seemed too low.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, am I considered enrolled now? I'll transfer the money to you right away. When do we start learning martial arts?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of this world, and the martial arts of the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to see exactly what differences there were in the martial arts of this world.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'll give you a martial arts manual." </p><p></p><p>The Second Senior Brother took out a thin booklet from the drawer.</p><p></p><p>On the booklet were written five large, ancient-looking characters: "Ming Wu Resonance Fist".</p><p></p><p>"This martial art is our Ming Wu Martial Arts School's ultimate technique, with twelve levels in total.</p><p></p><p>These are the first three levels, I'm giving them to you.</p><p></p><p>Remember, this martial art technique must not be leaked outside, understand?" The Second Senior Brother admonished.</p><p></p><p>"What about the subsequent levels?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The subsequent levels... will cost extra.</p><p></p><p>Young man, these first three levels are enough for you to practice for a year." The Second Senior Brother answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>When he had practiced this martial art, it had taken him seven months to perfect the third level.</p><p></p><p>Given that Qi Yuan's talent was lower than his, taking a year would be normal.</p><p></p><p>"How much?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... a total of 3 million?" The Second Senior Brother answered truthfully. "Come, let me explain our school's ultimate technique, the Ming Wu Resonance Fist. It emphasizes the unity of the five internal organs and six bowels with the muscles, achieving a kind of resonance, and thereby exerting powerful strength...</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by how grand it sounds, it's actually very difficult to execute.</p><p></p><p>After all, how many ordinary people can control the vibrations of their five internal organs and six bowels?</p><p></p><p>This requires long-term experience... and..."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan had already finished reading the three levels of the technique.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out a fist and suddenly punched forward.</p><p></p><p>His entire body, his five internal organs and six bowels, were extraordinarily unified at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the blood in his body seemed to converge on his fist.</p><p></p><p>Bang! A powerful punch was executed, seeming to release a thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>The Second Senior Brother was stunned for a moment, his left nostril twitching upwards.</p><p></p><p>"Are you... my master's illegitimate child?"</p><p></p><p>PS: I'm still feeling unwell, with coughing and vomiting. I apologize for the recent updates, I will make up for them later! (End of chapter)</p>

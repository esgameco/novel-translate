        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the Fasting Goddess, he continued: "Fasting, you don't look well. Do you need this old man to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, standing nearby, whispered in the Fasting Goddess's ear: "You said you could eat seven fish in one sitting, that your body is very healthy!"</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan was thinking now was to quickly feed the Fasting Goddess and get her body back in good shape. </p><p></p><p>That way, once the Heavenly Pillar was repaired, he could continue his visualization.</p><p></p><p>"I can eat seven fish at once. My body is fine. No need to trouble everyone. Please go back," said the woman in the red dress in a stiff voice, sending the guests away.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Fanheart's face took on a strange expression. </p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt the Fasting Goddess was acting oddly today.</p><p></p><p>"For the battle at the Dragon Rising Arena, I hope the Fasting Goddess will not be absent. This concerns the destiny of the Mortal Heart Realm!" Old Man Fanheart emphasized once again.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." After the Fasting Goddess finished speaking, her form vanished, entering the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Only a group of ancient gods with surprised expressions remained.</p><p></p><p>"Is that really the Fasting Goddess?"</p><p></p><p>"Strange, it seemed like she was constantly communicating with someone just now."</p><p></p><p>"You felt that too?"</p><p></p><p>The venerable ones discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fanheart also frowned: "This old man had the same feeling, but... didn't detect anyone."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fanheart was a mythical being. In the Mortal Heart Realm, no one could hide from his sight.</p><p></p><p>He had two more "woods" than ordinary mortals, showing the extent of his abilities.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Great Venerable Spirit Bell seemed to think of something and was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>He felt worried, sensing that things were not so simple.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan followed the Fasting Goddess back to the bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed: "Alas, my lifetime reputation is ruined. To think I became a thief for a day. If only the stolen goods were higher class, like some immortal elixir, fairy undergarments, or divine armor - that would have more prestige. But instead I stole pots and pans!"</p><p></p><p>He and the Fasting Goddess came to the nearby area, where all the shops were tightly closed and not open for business.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this situation, the Fasting Goddess directly entered and took the pots and pans.</p><p></p><p>Very domineering.</p><p></p><p>"They believe in me, I protect them. Consider these as offerings," the Fasting Goddess rarely argued with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, none of that matters. Let's make braised fish!" Qi Yuan said somewhat urgently. </p><p></p><p>Once the Fasting Goddess's body was better, he could continue his visualization.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was also curious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Why did eating something improve the Heavenly Pillar?</p><p></p><p>Why didn't she eat normally?</p><p></p><p>Now he could see what was really going on.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Finally I can be a fountain commander!" Qi Yuan was also quite looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under Qi Yuan's guidance, the Fasting Goddess caught seven fish.</p><p></p><p>First she gutted them, removing the innards, then scraped off the scales.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat to the side, enthusiastically directing: "The kitchen knife was bought for nothing, probably just going to collect dust."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, scrape more carefully, there's still half a scale left."</p><p></p><p>"Cooking requires color, aroma and taste. Your fish pieces are cut unevenly, your knife skills are lacking."</p><p></p><p>"Too little chili, add some more."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you're the student with the worst cooking talent I've ever taught."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan transformed into a commander, frantically giving instructions.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Goddess was now like an ordinary mortal woman, struggling to complete a plate of braised fish under Qi Yuan's command.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, for a first attempt this is already very good," Qi Yuan couldn't help praising as he looked at the overcooked fish.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had criticized before, now it was time to praise.</p><p></p><p>Criticism and praise combined is the kingly way.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and eat some, see if your body improves," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was also very curious.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pillar would recover when the Fasting Goddess ate food - what principle was this based on?</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Goddess frowned, hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"Don't judge by appearances, it tastes quite good," Qi Yuan continued to persuade.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators, no matter how bad the fish tasted, they could still eat it.</p><p></p><p>This fish was made under his guidance after all, so it couldn't be that bad.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Goddess looked at the plate of fish. Her slender fingers grasped the chopsticks as she picked up a piece of fish and brought it near her lips. Her brows were tightly furrowed, her eyes full of resistance.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's not poisonous. Eating it won't make you sick," Qi Yuan encouraged.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Goddess gave Qi Yuan a deep look, then forcefully stuffed the fish into her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Her face suddenly turned pale, as if she had been gravely injured.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Her reaction was so strong? "Is it that bad? You don't have to eat it. It must be the pot. Let's change pots and cook another batch," Qi Yuan said anxiously, wanting to reach out and pat the Fasting Goddess on the back.</p><p></p><p>But his hand passed through her, unable to touch the Fasting Goddess.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were separated by time and space, unable to touch each other.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine." The Fasting Goddess's body trembled slightly, her brows furrowed frighteningly. She parted her red lips and forcefully swallowed the fish meat.</p><p></p><p>Her actions were as if she was swallowing poison, even more difficult than swallowing poison.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He believed it now - the Fasting Goddess had an eating disorder, and not just an ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>Just eating some fish... and she became like this?</p><p></p><p>He was very puzzled, staring at the Fasting Goddess, asking with concern: "Are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Fasting Goddess's form was swaying unsteadily. She in her red dress lay down on the bamboo mat, eyes tightly shut, beads of sweat forming on her forehead.</p><p></p><p>But she seemed very cold, her body occasionally trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change left Qi Yuan unable to understand.</p><p></p><p>This was a mythical being.</p><p></p><p>Just from eating a piece of fish?</p><p></p><p>She ended up like this? Back when the Fasting Goddess fought the avatar of the Yang God, she was covered in wounds but didn't tremble.</p><p></p><p>When the Great Flood battle began, he had seen the Fasting Goddess eat fish before.</p><p></p><p>That time, the Fasting Goddess was very calm.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>"Are you alright... Use your divine arts to spit out the fish!" Qi Yuan looked at the Fasting Goddess lying on the ground, but unfortunately his eyes could not obtain any useful information about her condition.</p><p></p><p>Separated by time and space, he also could not help the Fasting Goddess.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Fasting Goddess was like she had fallen asleep, not responding to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths later, the Fasting Goddess's voice came, as faint as a mosquito: "It's fine. Perhaps if I sleep for a while, everything will be alright, and the Heavenly Pillar will be fully repaired."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Fasting Goddess, his heart anxious but helpless.</p><p></p><p>"What's really going on? Did you react like this before when eating? Why did you still eat this time?" Qi Yuan asked, utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths passed before the Fasting Goddess's weak voice came: "I don't know. Wait until tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan didn't speak further, so the Fasting Goddess wouldn't have to respond.</p><p></p><p>He stood quietly by her side, scenes constantly replaying in his mind as he pondered something.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Goddess's Way was that all things were impure, harmful if eaten.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that her constitution was special, unable to eat anything?</p><p></p><p>But no matter how special, one still needed to eat something.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... innate? Suddenly, Qi Yuan recalled Qi Qi once saying the Fasting Goddess was suspected to have an innately pure constitution.</p><p></p><p>This type of constitution was pure and flawless, like crystal. Eating mortal food would taint such a constitution.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Goddess's reaction was even stronger than imagined.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>... Mother of No Food had a similar constitution, with an even stronger reaction than the Innate Purity Body?</p><p></p><p>How should this problem be solved? Solving the issue with Mother of No Food and the issue with the Heavenly Pillar was crucial.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time passed, a weak voice came: "You're still here?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Fish... I want to drink... no..."</p><p></p><p>"Big sister, don't eat anymore!" Qi Yuan hurriedly said, "This fish doesn't even have soup, you're already delirious when speaking." He was afraid Mother of No Food would die in front of him if she ate more.</p><p></p><p>Mother of No Food didn't speak again, lying quietly on the ground without struggling to get up and continue eating fish.</p><p></p><p>The room was silent, without even the sound of Mother of No Food's breathing.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, Qi Yuan's eyes fell on the plate of fish.</p><p></p><p>[Ordinary braised fish, seemingly tainted by worldly filth.]</p><p></p><p>"Filth?"</p><p></p><p>A thousand thoughts raced through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of this filth?"</p><p></p><p>He quickly shifted his gaze away, looking at other objects.</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see information differences.</p><p></p><p>But for the same fish, he could only look once a day, with the information updating the next day when he looked again.</p><p></p><p>So his gaze immediately went to look at other things.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he was also pondering the two words "filth".</p><p></p><p>This was something he had discovered before - when looking at an object, looking with a specific intention might more easily yield the desired result.</p><p></p><p>[Mother of No Food's red dress, made from ten-thousand-year weak silk, untainted by a speck of dust.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary bamboo mat, also tainted by worldly filth.]</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary fish, weighing three pounds and two ounces.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan kept scanning all the objects, especially the thousands of fish in the lake.</p><p></p><p>He looked at each fish, wanting to find useful information.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's gaze halted.</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary fish, tainted by worldly filth. To remove the filth requires purification by flawless glazed blood.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Flawless glazed blood?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he... the Flawless Glazed Golden Body? In the Flowing Wind Realm, Baize had given Qi Yuan the Great Sun Golden Lotus, and he had used it to form the Flawless Glazed Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>This was how he was able to devour stars and form a golden core.</p><p></p><p>The Flawless Glazed Golden Body played a crucial role.</p><p></p><p>This golden body also greatly enhanced his power.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Star Golden Core, it was far inferior.</p><p></p><p>So when showing off to others, he mostly boasted about the golden core, rarely mentioning the Flawless Glazed Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the blood of the Flawless Glazed Golden Body... would have such a use.</p><p></p><p>Within Qi Yuan's body, there was the blood of the Flawless Glazed Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>However, there wasn't much of this blood.</p><p></p><p>Dripping it out would also harm Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he relied on the strength of the Flawless Glazed Golden Body to devour stars and form the golden core.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have burst immediately.</p><p></p><p>Now, if he were to extract the flawless glazed blood... he would have to endure...</p><p></p><p>"Playing a damn game, and now you want to draw my blood?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but complain.</p><p></p><p>"But... my blood can't fall into the past either!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't extract blood even if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, there was no other option but to try.</p><p></p><p>Mother of No Food was still half-asleep.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pillar had not yet been repaired.</p><p></p><p>So many deities had not been fully summoned.</p><p></p><p>The game had not been cleared.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, playing a game not only consumes my energy, but also wastes my blood. If the clearance reward is too poor, I won't let this go!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was like a knife as he looked at his finger.</p><p></p><p>As he stared, his finger became transparent, crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>A few drops of pure, transparent blood squeezed out from his finger, dripping down.</p><p></p><p>His body felt a moment of dizziness, and his face turned somewhat pale.</p><p></p><p>Above the Star Golden Core, terrifying flames burned.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness also briefly blurred, endless flames seeming to scorch his body.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't asking for my blood, it's asking for my life!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but complain.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were fixed on the dripping blood and the fish on the plate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked extremely tense.</p><p></p><p>If it couldn't purify, this blood would have to be recovered.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a look of surprise flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because... the transparent blood seemed to cross space, dripping onto the fish pieces, finally dissolving and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The fish still looked the same, but the blood was gone.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Mother of No Food seemed to smell something, her jade-like nose twitching: "So hungry..."</p><p></p><p>She opened her eyes, her pale face actually looking much better, with a rosy tint. In her eyes, Qi Yuan saw suppressed desire.</p><p></p><p>"This fish... do you want to eat some more?" Qi Yuan asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Right now, Mother of No Food was the big boss.</p><p></p><p>Her body had to recover for the Heavenly Pillar to thrive.</p><p></p><p>Then he could visualize more powerful deities!</p><p></p><p>A look of confusion appeared in Mother of No Food's eyes. She picked up her chopsticks and picked up another piece of fish.</p><p></p><p>She put it in her mouth, chewing slowly.</p><p></p><p>Her eating speed became faster and faster, without any ladylike manners.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>As long as she could eat, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid it wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>"Eat slowly. If you're hungry, we can cook more fish," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Mother of No Food, who was eating fish, stopped her chopsticks. She looked towards where Qi Yuan was, her gaze deep, with a hint of desire: "How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a secret," Qi Yuan chuckled, not revealing the truth.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when he looked at Mother of No Food, he felt a creepy sensation.</p><p></p><p>It was like the look of an animal eyeing its prey.</p><p></p><p>Mother of No Food looked at where Qi Yuan was, wanting to look into his eyes to find the answer.</p><p></p><p>But she couldn't see anything, nor could she hear anything.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid of me?" Mother of No Food asked inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>"No," Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The earlier heart palpitation was just for a moment, coming quickly and going just as fast.</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't I be the one afraid of you, Qi Yuan?" Mother of No Food said leisurely as she ate the fish. "I can't see you or sense you, yet I can hear your voice.</p><p></p><p>If I were an ordinary person, I might think there was a ghost beside me.</p><p></p><p>Now, I am a myth, standing at the pinnacle of this world, yet I still can't sense you.</p><p></p><p>Isn't that quite... terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>Mother of No Food smiled brightly, her smile radiant but also somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Now that you mention it, it is quite terrifying," Qi Yuan thought. If he were in Mother of No Food's position, he would definitely be very wary of someone he couldn't sense.</p><p></p><p>Mother of No Food didn't speak again, slowly chewing and eating the fish.</p><p></p><p>The night was clear with sparse stars, a cool breeze blowing. Inside the Heavenly Pillar, the night was a bit cold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat to the side, looking at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, two of those stars in the sky will be mine."</p><p></p><p>He was showing off again.</p><p></p><p>Then he changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of constitution do you have? Why... can't you eat?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

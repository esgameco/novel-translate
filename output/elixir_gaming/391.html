        <h1>Chapter 391</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The painter said, drawing an expression of helplessness on her face.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the painter with amazement. If Little Jia could master this skill, it would be wonderful. He would be able to know more about Little Jia's emotions.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity cannot be resisted," the painter drew a desperate expression. "The Jade Maiden once said that there are 3,000 worlds similar to the Cang Lan realm. Among them, some worlds are ten or a hundred times stronger and vaster than Cang Lan. But over so many years, not a single realm has successfully resisted. Our Cang Lan realm has the most hope, with just one additional Yang Spirit. And in one of the worlds, there were even three Yang Spirits gathered together, but they still failed to defeat the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>The painter drew another desperate expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"So whenever I hear of someone wanting to challenge the great calamity, I feel desolate. Your fate... will not be better than that Yang Spirit's."</p><p></p><p>"You're just a painter, what do you know about the great calamity!" Qi Yuan couldn't help saying. "No one understands the great calamity better than me. I've already formulated a thorough and meticulous plan, 'Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity'. In less than half a year, the great calamity will surely be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>If he was still at the Divine Infant stage, he might not have been 100% confident facing the great calamity. But now that he had entered the Purple Palace realm, he was 90% certain about defeating the great calamity. </p><p></p><p>The only thing he was wary of was the mark of the great calamity. If he destroyed the great calamity, that being in the Supreme Radiance Palace could extinguish all the cultivators in the Cang Lan realm with a single thought. Including his junior sister Jiang Lingsu. Even he would not be able to protect them.</p><p></p><p>This time the strange painter didn't draw anything: "You may not know that all cultivators in the Cang Lan realm have been marked. With just a thought from the one behind the great calamity, all living beings will die. This includes your junior sister, as well as your family and friends."</p><p></p><p>Her tone was full of despair. </p><p></p><p>"Sometimes living in a muddle-headed state without thinking about heavenly matters is also a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"You know about the mark?" Qi Yuan looked at the strange painter. "Did the Jade Maiden tell you?"</p><p></p><p>This mark could not be discovered without reaching the Yang Spirit realm. The strange painter couldn't possibly have discovered this mark. So it must have been that Jade Maiden.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Maiden's identity is mysterious, suspected to be from the upper realms," said the strange painter.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, does she know more information about this mark?" Qi Yuan was very concerned about this.</p><p></p><p>He had been examining the marks on all cultivators every day, trying to find a way to break them. So far, he hadn't found any proper method to break them, though he did have some unorthodox ideas.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter's body trembled slightly: "This is related to a supreme treasure. The Jade Maiden once said that even Yang Spirit powerhouses in the upper realms deeply covet supreme treasures. It's even said that if a Yang Spirit from the lower three heavens obtains a supreme treasure, they can bring their entire sect directly up to the middle three heavens. If our Cang Lan realm had a supreme treasure, we might truly be able to escape the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>The strange painter suppressed her voice, but one could still sense the fervor and anticipation in her words. This was the only solution she had found to resolve the great calamity after "giving up" for so many years.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned in thought, then looked at the strange painter and said seriously: "Do I look like a supreme treasure to you?"</p><p></p><p>The strange painter: "..."</p><p></p><p>"Your expression makes it hard for me to keep a straight face. You're not going to draw a watermelon head on yourself later, record a video, and say 'Fellow Daoists, today I encountered a major speechless event...' are you?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan maliciously speculated. </p><p></p><p>This strange painter had no face, but her expressions were too lifelike.</p><p></p><p>"I don't quite understand your meaning, but it's simple for powerful beings to have some quirks," said the strange painter.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, if the mark is related to a supreme treasure, doesn't that mean... if I had another supreme treasure, I could solve the mark issue?" Qi Yuan pondered aloud.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter shook her head: "I'm not clear on these matters either. Supreme treasures can bring fatal disaster even to Yang Spirits. How would a small fry like me know about them? However, supreme treasures have mysterious and unfathomable functions, so perhaps they really could block out the mark. Of course, the greatest use of supreme treasures is far beyond just blocking marks..."</p><p></p><p>The strange painter didn't know much about supreme treasures, not even their specific names. But she had heard the Jade Maiden say that the fate of the Cang Lan realm and the other 3,000 realms was all due to one supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we've learned about the game settings, now let's move on to the mission plot," Qi Yuan said. Then he added, "Sorry, I've been playing too many games and it's gotten to my head. This isn't a game, and what you said isn't just settings. I came to find you because I want you to help me with something - paint a picture for me."</p><p></p><p>The strange painter glanced at Qi Yuan: "I rarely paint for others, and I have some requirements for painting. I don't paint unless it's a difficult subject."</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, what I want painted is quite difficult," Qi Yuan said happily. "Don't worry, I won't shortchange you. If you paint it well, hmm, I'll leave you a... one square meter space in the painting!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously, being quite generous this time by offering one square meter of space.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, paint what?" The strange painter directly ignored the latter half of Qi Yuan's statement.</p><p></p><p>"Paint... the underworld!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter's face showed a surprised expression: "The netherworld? That's just a legend, there's nothing much to paint about it."</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan realm, there were also legends of the netherworld, and even rumors of reincarnation. But most cultivators didn't take them seriously. </p><p></p><p>When cultivators kill people, they destroy even their souls!</p><p></p><p>Where would there be a netherworld? How could one fall into reincarnation?</p><p></p><p>"The underworld I want painted is different from what you imagine. Moreover, I'll provide you with a brush. You can use this brush to paint," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm usually only accustomed to using my own brushes for painting. The brushes in this world, including yours, are all too ordin-"</p><p></p><p>However, halfway through her sentence, her body froze.</p><p></p><p>Two laser-like beams flashed from her eyes, piercing through the paper covering her face.</p><p></p><p>She stared blankly at the Mountains and Rivers Brush that Qi Yuan took out, breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"This brush... this brush... how could there be such a brush in this world? What kind of brush is this? Is it a magical treasure? No! A supreme treasure? Not that either!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Mountains and Rivers Brush appeared, her attention was completely drawn to it. Her eyes saw nothing but that brush.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't imagine how such a brush could exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Mountains and Rivers Brush and asked, "My brush is too ordin- what?"</p><p></p><p>The strange painter was stunned for a moment, her face heating up, wishing she could take back her words: "Too ordin... ordinarily amazing?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, she finally came up with a word related to "ordin-" that could barely pass as praise.</p><p></p><p>Ordinarily amazing?</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit impolite to praise a brush like that," Qi Yuan smiled, not minding.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter's eyes remained fixed on the brush, her gaze constantly shifting: "What exactly is this? Could it be a supreme treasure? No, supreme treasures are just legends, even Yang Spirits rarely encounter them, how could one appear here?"</p><p></p><p>The strange painter's heart was unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this Mountains and Rivers Brush, the brush in her hand seemed extremely shabby.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme treasure?" Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment. "I don't know, but this brush is quite powerful."</p><p></p><p>In the past, the East Lord had used this brush to turn the virtual into reality, creating the Mountains and Seas Scroll.</p><p></p><p>Based on the description, it could indeed be called a supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan wasn't clear about what level of treasure the one in the Supreme Radiance Palace, or the supreme treasure behind the mark, were.</p><p></p><p>"The brush is ready, now it's your turn to tell me about the underworld."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he raised his hand...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He waved, and seven PowerPoint presentations appeared.</p><p></p><p>Something occurred to him, and his expression suddenly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Emperor and Earth Goddess, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, Ten Kings of Hell, Five Ghost Emperors, appear immediately!" Qi Yuan spoke, his voice like the decree of the Heavenly Emperor.</p><p></p><p>How to explain PowerPoint without a presenter?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already discussed the structure of the underworld with these deities in charge of the underworld and formulated a very comprehensive plan.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice rang out, suddenly the entire painting studio seemed to be filled with a gust of chilly wind. More than a dozen men and women with mysterious auras and solemn, awe-inspiring presences appeared.</p><p></p><p>Each of them carried a vast and unfathomable aura, mysterious and inscrutable.</p><p></p><p>The Strange Painter's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because the strongest being she had ever seen was the Jade Maiden.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the Jade Maiden was a mythical powerhouse that reflected all the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But these dozen or so people each had an aura more mysterious and unfathomable than the Jade Maiden's, as deep as the sea.</p><p></p><p>She would believe it if they were called Yang Immortals.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, something even more shocking happened.</p><p></p><p>These dozen or so mysterious powerhouses bowed their heads to the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The Strange Painter was shaken. These people actually addressed the Blood-Robed Sword Saint as "lord".</p><p></p><p>Could it be... could it be that the Blood-Robed Sword Saint really was... a supreme treasure?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Qi's gaze fell on Jiang Lingsu, and her eyes revealed a happy smile: "Godfather, is this my godmother? She's truly a natural beauty, very well-matched with you, godfather!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was visualizing Houtu, one of the Six Deities.</p><p></p><p>She was also the overall commander for the establishment of the underworld this time.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's face suddenly turned red, and she looked at Qi Qi, somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... don't talk nonsense, this is my junior sister." Qi Yuan coughed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's eyes revealed a smile: "Such a beautiful junior sister, it would be such a waste if she married someone else."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Qi Qi, don't arbitrarily define women. Why must girls necessarily get married?" Qi Yuan said, "I'm giving you all a task - introduce the underworld to her, and then when I find the land, help her draw out the underworld for me!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, godfather. Qi Qi will complete this task well!" Qi Qi said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the Strange Painter: "Help me draw out the underworld, and I'll give you one square meter.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, if it's convenient, organize all the information about the Jade Maiden and the great calamity you mentioned, as well as the supreme treasure and all the information about the Tahuang Palace. I need to use it.</p><p></p><p>The great plan of 'Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity' needs to be more comprehensive and perfect.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, this is definitely the greatest plan in the history of the Canglang Realm, worthy of being recorded in history books and adapted by future generations!</p><p></p><p>I hope the actor who plays me can be handsome, otherwise he won't be able to portray my aura."</p><p></p><p>The Strange Painter was somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>She could understand the first part of Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>But the latter part felt very strange.</p><p></p><p>However, she still nodded seriously: "Alright, I will organize it for you immediately."</p><p></p><p>Her form of address for Qi Yuan had changed to an honorific.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when the Blood-Robed Sword Saint claimed he would eliminate the great calamity, she only saw a lone warrior knowingly attempting the impossible.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the Mountains and Rivers Brush, and then seeing those dozen or so mysterious powerhouses appear beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a glimmer of hope arose in her dormant heart.</p><p></p><p>Could he really do it? Her heart trembled, and she quickly suppressed this bit of worry.</p><p></p><p>She had already decided to immediately write a letter to the hidden organization where the Wine Master was, telling them not to cause trouble for the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise... it would be suicide!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The rain drizzled, and Qi Yuan sat in the pavilion, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>Every day he observed the cultivators of the world, not limited to just the Helan State.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were very few gains.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't obtain much information about the mark.</p><p></p><p>The Strange Painter also provided very little.</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps were heard.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qi, long time no see. I heard you broke through to the Purple Palace realm, congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over, and his calm face revealed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wisdom True Lord, my good friend, you've finally come!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Great Wisdom True Lord before him, and his mind settled considerably.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he encountered difficult problems, the Great Wisdom True Lord could always use his clever mind to give Qi Yuan some ideas.</p><p></p><p>"I received your message and rushed over without stopping." The Great Wisdom True Lord said, "I'm exhausted and a bit hungry. Let me eat something first."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he lifted the bone hanging around his neck, put it in his mouth to chew, and licked it a few times.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "What kind of treasure is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord saw this and became a bit flustered, pulling the bone back: "Ahem, remember last time we met, someone tried to trick you with a sick bird, wanting you to get sick.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the bird was overcooked, and being a particular person, I didn't eat it.</p><p></p><p>You ate the bird meat and were preparing to give me the bones..."</p><p></p><p>"I remember that because the bird was sick, I threw away the bones." Qi Yuan remembered clearly.</p><p></p><p>Back then, a cultivator from Destiny Mountain had tried to trick him using a sick bird. Later, he killed the person who tried to trick him and used a curse to destroy Destiny Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I saw that you didn't seem to get sick, doesn't that mean the bird wasn't poisonous?</p><p></p><p>I saw that these bones weren't overcooked, so I picked them up to try.</p><p></p><p>It's just that these bones are too tough, I can't bite through them." The Great Wisdom True Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Wisdom True Lord said: "Regarding the mark you mentioned, I have some ideas."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord was indeed worthy of his name, having insights as soon as he arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember the book I once saw in a dream?" The Great Wisdom True Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you saw a method to remove the mark in that book?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's understanding of the Yang Immortal realm came from that book in the Great Wisdom True Lord's dream.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord said: "Sort of, but not really."</p><p></p><p>"Great Wisdom True Lord, don't play riddles and act like a sage. Don't I know your abilities, brother?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Where did that sick bird come from originally?" The Great Wisdom True Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"This door!" Qi Yuan waved his hand, and a small wooden door appeared.</p><p></p><p>This wooden door came from the Destiny Mage who had tried to trick him back then.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of this door was related to the Door of Myriad Differences that Qi Yuan had seen in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this door looks very similar to the legendary Door of Ultimate Principles!</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ultimate Principles is a supreme treasure, the foremost among extraordinary treasures!</p><p></p><p>It is said that all the Ultimate Principle realm powerhouses in the immortal realm, when they break through to Ultimate Principle, will leave a mark of the ultimate principle they comprehend on the Door of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>This door, protected by the rules of ultimate principles, must be able to isolate all marks and karma in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Because he remembered that when he was in the Flowing Wind Realm, when he comprehended the origin divine ability, the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, he had also left a mark in the Door of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>Am I at the Ultimate Principle level?</p><p></p><p>How come I don't know? At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the Great Wisdom True Lord with suspicion: "You know so much. If reality were a game, you must have a good relationship with the developers."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan increasingly felt that there was something very mysterious about the Great Wisdom True Lord, shrouded in mist.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this mist had a name, called the Halo of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

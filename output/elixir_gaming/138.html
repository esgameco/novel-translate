        <h1>Chapter 138</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The starry sky was brilliant, with the Milky Way stretching across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The universe was vast and profound, desolate yet boundless.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, countless stars filled the view.</p><p></p><p>A single star burned with endless fire, radiating infinite heat, seemingly within arm's reach of Qi Yuan, close enough to touch.</p><p></p><p>The scorching heat caused fine beads of sweat to form on Ning Tao's delicate white face. Her black long dress clung tightly to her petite figure, accentuating her graceful curves. Even as a supreme being, she felt the heat at this moment.</p><p></p><p>She gazed at this universe with a look of wonder, tinged with a hint of fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>The stars were all said to be connected to legendary deities.</p><p></p><p>And this universe contained so many stars...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Ning Tao in his arms. His body was burning hot, even hotter than Ning Tao's delicate form. His voice trembled as he spoke: "This is a brand new universe..."</p><p></p><p>In terms of cosmic concepts, the Cang Lan Realm, Wangyue Continent, and Liu Feng Realm were all actually in the same universe.</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, they shared the same stars, the same divine projections, or reflections.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the situation in the Liu Feng Realm may have been somewhat special.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had come to a brand new universe through the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>This universe was completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not sense any living beings.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps there were living beings, but he could not detect them.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the sun, moon and stars here were real celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>Not reflections of deities, not false projections.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Ning Tao as the Great Sun Golden Lotus burned everything within him. His consciousness began to grow hazy.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Liu Feng Realm, he seemed to have exited the game, and did not need to immediately return to the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>But his current physical condition needed to be addressed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus continued to burn.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ning Tao, a flicker of emotion crossing his face: "I should go now."</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Great Sun Golden Lotus would harm Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood in the vast emptiness of space, gazing at the familiar figure before her. Her eyes were determined as she tightly grasped Qi Yuan's sleeve. Her long, silk-stockinged legs also wrapped firmly around his waist, as if terrified he would suddenly disappear again like he had before.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the timid Ning Tao, a faint smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Don't worry, I'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke as he looked at the nearby star that appeared small despite being so close.</p><p></p><p>He said: "You see that little sun? It's about to become my golden core."</p><p></p><p>A look of confusion flashed in Ning Tao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand, but listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going there to swallow it," Qi Yuan said, his eyes showing a resolute expression.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about me. I... with my Heavenly Dao Foundation, swallowing a star is nothing! I once heard of a powerful being who swallowed the entire universe in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Swallowing a star is no big deal for me."</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl... you're not allowed to lie to me!" Tears welled up in Ning Tao's starry eyes.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid Qi Yuan was deceiving her.</p><p></p><p>That he planned to leave her here alone while he went to face the all-consuming Great Sun Golden Lotus by himself.</p><p></p><p>"When have I ever lied to you?" Qi Yuan's thoughts were complex as he held Ning Tao's delicate hand, his expression gentle.</p><p></p><p>The bond between them was very deep.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the burning of the Great Sun Golden Lotus grew even more terrifying, instantly incinerating Ning Tao's clothes. She seemed to deliberately not resist this burning.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand rested on Ning Tao's smooth pink back, her jade-like body fully exposed to his view.</p><p></p><p>Her small frame twisted slightly, her soft curves brushing against his arm. Qi Yuan suppressed the greedy desire in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao leaned close to Qi Yuan's ear, her voice soft but tone imperious: "Blood Pearl, you've seen this young lady's naked body. No matter how ugly I am, you can't dislike me!</p><p></p><p>If you leave without saying goodbye, I... will lock you by my side for all lifetimes to come!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Qi Yuan couldn't tell if the alluring young woman in his arms was the Golden Canary or Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that her eyes were exceptionally captivating.</p><p></p><p>"I won't," Qi Yuan looked at the young woman, his gaze firm but voice tinged with concern, "It's just... after I refine the star into my golden core, I may... I may also leave this place. I'm afraid only the golden core will remain here.</p><p></p><p>If a golden core forms, don't keep staring at it, or you may lose your memory."</p><p></p><p>Part of him would remain here.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao seemed to half-understand. She tilted her head, her moist red lips approaching Qi Yuan's. Her teeth lightly bit down as a smug smile appeared on her face: "I've left my mark. Husband, from now on you belong to me."</p><p></p><p>But her smile quickly faded, replaced by a timid expression: "Blood Pearl, you should bite this young lady too. This young lady... wants to be yours!"</p><p></p><p>The bold and alluring one was Ning Tao, the shy and proud one was the Golden Canary.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lowered his head and leaned in. A faint fragrance wafted over as he said: "Our combined mental age is still smaller than someone else's shoe size.</p><p></p><p>Little Ning Tao, I have to go now."</p><p></p><p>This childish, simple, and pure interaction dispersed the worries in Qi Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao hugged Qi Yuan's head, her snow-white face flushed. A black dress once again appeared on her body, with black stockings wrapping her slender white legs.</p><p></p><p>At their level of cultivation, condensing a piece of clothing from cosmic dust was trivial. Of course, they could also use spiritual energy to form clothes.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her voice carrying a hint of willfulness: "You know."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded. He gazed deeply at Ning Tao one last time, then looked out at the countless stars in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his gaze settled on the closest and smallest sun.</p><p></p><p>He charged towards it without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao watched from afar, separated by the immense expanse of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to freeze in that moment.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period, a brilliant flash of light suddenly appeared on that star.</p><p></p><p>The light flared, then faded again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless thoughts flashed through Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had already entered the interior of this star.</p><p></p><p>Infinite pressure and heat crushed and burned his body.</p><p></p><p>Within his body, the Great Sun Golden Lotus also incinerated everything.</p><p></p><p>The two forces burned continuously, reaching a delicate balance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body endured pain far beyond anything he had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Great Sun Golden Lotus - its terrifying ability to burn away everything made his body nearly unbearable.</p><p></p><p>Death's Radiant Light! The great skill was continuously activated, causing Qi Yuan's power to rapidly increase.</p><p></p><p>Resisting the Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus was the relic left after the Great Sun Radiant Buddha's nirvana, incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>After being tainted, it sought to burn away everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Forget!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan activated his innate divine ability, the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Now, only the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra could change the situation.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he unleashed the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra to its fullest extent.</p><p></p><p>This innate divine ability, powerful enough to leave a mark on the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, now displayed its true might.</p><p></p><p>In the Liu Feng Realm, Qi Yuan had rarely used the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The previous Qi Yuan seldom activated the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, because using it too much would affect himself as well.</p><p></p><p>So even when he did use it, he exercised great restraint.</p><p></p><p>The innate divine ability was his own Dao.</p><p></p><p>As a player, how could he allow his own path to affect himself? Even if he forgot, it should be because he wanted to forget, not because he was influenced by the innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>When condensing the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra to break through the predicament of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons transforming into a great demon, he had already made plans.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had inscribed the innate divine ability of the Void Realm Lord's Heart Demon Seal onto the divine soul tool formed from a drop of his blood.</p><p></p><p>His plan was to inscribe the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra onto his golden core.</p><p></p><p>That's why he now used the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra without restraint.</p><p></p><p>"Forgetting is the truth."</p><p></p><p>"Forgetting is the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"You are the Great Sun Golden Lotus, you have not been tainted."</p><p></p><p>"I am the Great Sun Radiant Buddha, you are part of my body!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra influenced everything.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body was scorching hot and blood-red, with flames constantly burning.</p><p></p><p>Yet his body also emanated a pervasive Buddhist nature.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus seemed to possess sentience, truly slowing its burning. However, when it sensed the auras of greed, arrogance, lust and other emotions from the blood-colored sword, it began to burn again, even more fiercely than before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the long sword and immediately threw it away in disgust.</p><p></p><p>"It is my three corpses, already severed!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Great Sun Radiant Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the relic in my belly!"</p><p></p><p>"You have not been tainted!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continuously activated his innate divine ability, soothing the Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>Lotus flowers spilled from his mouth as he spoke in an enchanting voice.</p><p></p><p>Inside the star, the burning of the Great Sun Golden Lotus finally subsided.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a sigh of relief: "Two great treasures, I've finally placated one. Still have one more to go."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus had been soothed, but this star had not yet been appeased.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Bai Ze, otherwise it wouldn't have been so easy," Qi Yuan mused.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving the Liu Feng Realm, Bai Ze had helped Qi Yuan absorb all the heart demons in the world into the Heart Demon Seal sword.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ze had also bestowed countless Buddhist teachings and some gifts from the Great Sun Radiant Buddha upon Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That's why Qi Yuan was better able to use the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra to soothe the Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sun Golden Lotus, forge my supreme flawless golden body of glazed crystal!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a mighty shout.</p><p></p><p>Glazed...</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flawless golden body of crystal must be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>He needed to forge the world's toughest stomach, otherwise how could he swallow the golden elixir?</p><p></p><p>With his loud shout, the great sun golden lotus burned once again. </p><p></p><p>But this time, the burning was not to incinerate everything, but to burn Qi Yuan's soul and body.</p><p></p><p>The powerful energy of the great sun golden lotus continuously seared Qi Yuan's body, inch by inch, bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>This kind of pain was unbearable. But Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with ambition: "Only by enduring the bitterest suffering can one become the best of men. I, Qi Yuan, will definitely dominate high school cultivation in the future!"</p><p></p><p>As the great sun golden lotus burned incessantly, his body was constantly remolded.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qi Yuan opened his eyes. It felt as if he had experienced endless years. His entire body's skin was translucent white, emitting a faint luster, like fine porcelain.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at it made one feel a sense of divinity, wanting to prostrate in worship.</p><p></p><p>"The flawless golden body of crystal... it's finally complete."</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful golden body, swallowing a star shouldn't be a problem, right? His eyes finally turned towards the star he was in.</p><p></p><p>He passed through this star and saw the twinkling of countless other stars.</p><p></p><p>The other stars were all bigger than this one.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan's appetite surge.</p><p></p><p>But he was easily satisfied, looking at the small sun he was in: "Small is cute too."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the magical power in his entire body radiated out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator to advance from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core, first they need to have perfect magical power, second they need to find a suitable vessel to carry the golden core, and third they need to condense their magical power into a solid form, assimilate the vessel, and refine it into their own golden core.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know exactly how much magical power he had.</p><p></p><p>Just that it was a lot, a whole lot.</p><p></p><p>"Even ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators can form celestial-grade golden cores!"</p><p></p><p>"With my Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment and perfect Purple Palace magical power, forming a stellar golden core shouldn't be a problem, right?!"</p><p></p><p>Powerful magical power continuously spread out.</p><p></p><p>After just a few dozen breaths, a dejected look appeared on Qi Yuan's face: "I was wrong, you're not small at all, and not cute at all."</p><p></p><p>This star was already the smallest one Qi Yuan could see.</p><p></p><p>But its volume was estimated to be thousands or tens of thousands of times larger than the blue planet from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>His magical power simply couldn't condense into enough solid matter, and couldn't envelop this star to refine it into his golden core.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this small sun and used the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra again.</p><p></p><p>"You're not the sun, you're a chocolate ball."</p><p></p><p>The small sun had absolutely no reaction.</p><p></p><p>"You're not a star, and you're not the sun, you're the golden core I left here!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, this time his Great Forgetting Mind Sutra exerted itself to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he wanted to inscribe the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra onto this star.</p><p></p><p>His innate divine ability was finally about to reach the legendary realm of inscription.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he let out a great shout: "Great Sun Golden Lotus, explode for me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grabbed with both hands.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, he strived to inscribe the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra onto the star.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, he directly shattered his flawless crystal golden body, spreading his entire body throughout the star, enveloping it to refine it into his golden core.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had shattered into countless particles.</p><p></p><p>He barely maintained his final consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"This is not my physical body, this is my magical power."</p><p></p><p>"You are my golden core!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme innate divine ability, the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra, continuously inscribed itself onto the star.</p><p></p><p>The originally seemingly "dormant" star exploded violently.</p><p></p><p>The shattered flesh and blood of the flawless crystal golden body floated above the star.</p><p></p><p>"All worlds in the mortal realm have the Heavenly Dao to be complete! You have no Heavenly Dao above you, we are a perfect match!"</p><p></p><p>"You are a chocolate ball!"</p><p></p><p>"You are an egg!"</p><p></p><p>"You are a stone!"</p><p></p><p>"You are my golden core!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continuously inscribed.</p><p></p><p>The potential of the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra clearly far surpassed the Demon Lure of the Void Realm Overlord.</p><p></p><p>This powerful innate ability kept inscribing, and there was no Heavenly Dao on this star, so no one could stop Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As long as Qi Yuan's appetite was big enough, he could swallow this star in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>This star was falling step by step.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra kept inscribing, this star slowly took on Qi Yuan's shape.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan no longer had a physical body. His flawless crystal golden body had transformed into solid magical power, lightly enveloping the star.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this envelopment was more like a light touch than true envelopment.</p><p></p><p>It was just a tiny bit here and there in various places.</p><p></p><p>It was too big! The star was simply too big!</p><p></p><p>It really wasn't a small cutie at all!</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Mind Sutra kept inscribing without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>The "Daydream Technique" that the Great Sun couldn't achieve was now realized by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This universe didn't just have this one star! There were endless galaxies, countless stars and planets.</p><p></p><p>No Heavenly Dao, no other living beings.</p><p></p><p>This universe was completely uncultivated land.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ate what was in his bowl while eyeing what was in the pot.</p><p></p><p>"Inscribe the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra!"</p><p></p><p>"Golden Core... formation begins!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a great shout.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Mind Sutra was finally inscribed onto this star.</p><p></p><p>This star finally took on Qi Yuan's shape.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura swept out. The star suddenly burst forth with intense light at this moment, forming a golden core. Finally, the intense light dissipated and the star returned to its original appearance.</p><p></p><p>No matter who came to this realm, they would probably mistake this star for an ordinary star, not realizing it was a cultivator's golden core.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Forgetting Realm emanated from the stellar golden core, suspended in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Swallow a golden core and only today do I know who I am!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had finally formed his golden core, becoming a Golden Core True Person! In the Divine Light Sect, apart from a few peak masters, this was an extremely rare achievement! Qi Yuan's consciousness was slowly returning.</p><p></p><p>His eyes looked towards a black silhouette deep in the universe, with a hint of reluctance in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>The light of the star transformed into a Milky Way at this moment, breathtakingly beautiful, like auspicious clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way streaked across the endless universe, landing before Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>As a Great Supreme, when Ning Tao saw this scene, there was both surprise and confusion in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura emanating from the front surpassed everything.</p><p></p><p>Even the Venerable One, even the White Emperor, were as small as infants before this terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>"Blood bead..." Ning Tao's lips trembled.</p><p></p><p>She peered through the Milky Way but didn't see the figure she was most familiar with.</p><p></p><p>That star also issued its final voice at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Where it is, I am."</p><p></p><p>The white Milky Way swept over, and Ning Tao's body received baptism at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this golden core of Qi Yuan's had infinite power.</p><p></p><p>The star was him, and the Heavenly Dao was also him.</p><p></p><p>This golden core now was comparable to a deity, or even... more terrifying than a deity.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could an ordinary Yin god contend with a star? Ning Tao stepped onto the Milky Way formed of starlight. She looked up at the star that seemed so close yet so far, a smile curling her lips: "This is so much better than being at opposite ends of the earth."</p><p></p><p>In the lonely universe, the young woman accompanied the star.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Pain!"</p><p></p><p>"So painful!"</p><p></p><p>"So bloated?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the wooden cabin, Qi Yuan clutched his stomach in agony.</p><p></p><p>"Am I pregnant?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at his belly, which seemed no different than usual.</p><p></p><p>But he not only felt very bloated, he also felt completely empty, extremely conflicting sensations.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the wooden cat puppet on the bedside table.</p><p></p><p>A helpless look flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I have too little spiritual power now. When I have enough, I wonder if I can summon the phantom of the stellar golden core to see... her."</p><p></p><p>The time difference in that universe was very, very large.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra, would the canary's memories... remain from before he left?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be certain.</p><p></p><p>"Where is my golden core?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked inward at his dantian, only to see it completely empty, with nothing there at all.</p><p></p><p>"Is my golden core still in... that universe?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan sensed something and walked out of his wooden cabin.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the starry sky. Even in broad daylight, twinkling stars could be faintly seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately saw that next to the brilliant sun, there was an extra... small sun.</p><p></p><p>The small sun wasn't as dazzling as the great sun, but it was still a sun emitting light.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>[The projection of the stellar golden core is up there, with a woman always accompanying you.</p><p></p><p>Where the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra is, her memories may remain from before you left, or she may comprehend some powerful things.]</p><p></p><p>"When I grow a bit bigger, I should be able to swallow more stars, right..."</p><p></p><p>(PS1: Before Qi Yuan left, he blessed Ning Tao, enhancing her strength.</p><p></p><p>PS2: Ning Tao is in a special state on the stellar golden core. This will be mentioned when she appears later, and is related to Ning Tao's future path.</p><p></p><p>So... this really isn't cruelty for the sake of cruelty. Or rather, it's not actually cruel, since the canary isn't Qi Yuan and can't casually follow the protagonist back to the Canglan Realm.)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

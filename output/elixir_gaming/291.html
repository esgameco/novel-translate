        <h1>Chapter 291</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The little cutie was fished up.</p><p></p><p>It was quickly sent to be deep-fried.</p><p></p><p>The mercenary carefully put away the tissue paper that Qi Yuan had given him.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan looked at Qi Yuan and carefully asked, "Does Mr. Qi need sea monsters?"</p><p></p><p>Sea monsters were precious, but for nobles like Kuanghuan, it was still quite simple to obtain them.</p><p></p><p>"I probably need the kind we just caught, ordinary ones... I can take a look at those too," Qi Yuan answered honestly. </p><p></p><p>What he needed might be mutated sea monsters, and not just any mutated sea monster would do.</p><p></p><p>For example, during the fishing just now, he had been watching the sea and had already spotted more than one sea monster.</p><p></p><p>But none of those sea monsters gave him the same feeling as this little cutie.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few sea monsters on the Haixingya. I'll collect some for you right away," Kuanghuan said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to study these sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>These sea monsters seemed to have some... connection to martial arts to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Qi Yuan's martial arts cultivation was too weak at the moment, and he had not yet discovered exactly what the connection was.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the deep-fried mutated sea monster was served.</p><p></p><p>You could tell the chef had put in a lot of effort, but the fried mutated sea monster still looked very ugly and unappetizing.</p><p></p><p>The female celebrities present all covered their mouths and frowned, seemingly quite disgusted.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Kuanghuan couldn't help saying, "Sea monster meat like this is very hard to come by at ordinary banquets. </p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by the small amount of meat, this is worth millions."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Kuanghuan's words, the frowns on the faces of the female celebrities finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's eyes also widened: "It's so expensive?"</p><p></p><p>She who originally had no appetite also started salivating, wanting to try a bite.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was so expensive... it would be a waste not to eat it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan took out a chopstick and lightly tapped the head of the mutated sea monster.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a drop of extremely bewitching blood appeared.</p><p></p><p>The female celebrities present were all amazed by this sight.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this drop of blood, his expression indescribable.</p><p></p><p>He felt his body tremble slightly, his blood starting to boil.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly suspect that this mutated sea monster and I may share the same ancestor," Qi Yuan said, his eyes filled with amusement.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" The female celebrities present immediately laughed, "These sea monsters are all fish mutated by radiation, how could they possibly share the same ancestor as us humans?"</p><p></p><p>"Right!" The others also didn't understand, all thinking Qi Yuan was joking.</p><p></p><p>After extracting that drop of blood, Qi Yuan said softly, "Let's all eat together, mm... it's very nourishing."</p><p></p><p>For him, the most precious part of this mutated sea monster was its blood.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the soccer ball-sized mutated sea monster was divided into more than ten portions, with everyone present getting a share.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi held her plate, her eyes revealing a self-satisfied look. The only regret was that she didn't bring her phone, otherwise she would have definitely taken a picture to post in her girlfriends' group chat.</p><p></p><p>After all, just the meat on her plate was worth over a hundred thousand, more expensive than gold.</p><p></p><p>How could a celebrity of her level afford to eat something so expensive?</p><p></p><p>She carefully took a bite, and immediately felt a crispy texture, with a meaty fragrance permeating.</p><p></p><p>"Delicious, it tastes great!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Qi licked her lips and said with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Something so expensive would naturally taste good from the start.</p><p></p><p>The others felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>To them, the meat of this mutated sea monster was like an unparalleled delicacy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't eat the meat, but swallowed that drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he felt his body undergo a subtle change.</p><p></p><p>His blood heated up at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, observing his inner self.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths later, Qi Yuan opened his eyes, a strange look appearing in them.</p><p></p><p>"My martial arts talent... has actually increased."</p><p></p><p>That's right, his martial arts talent had increased.</p><p></p><p>If he went to test at the Mingwu Martial Arts Hall, he would find that the lines representing his martial arts talent had increased by several.</p><p></p><p>"Are sea monsters really related to martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Or rather... related to bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had vaguely sensed it.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of this world should be related to bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the bloodline, the stronger the martial arts talent, and the faster one could cultivate.</p><p></p><p>However... perhaps due to the bloodlines being too distant, the martial arts bloodlines became increasingly diluted, causing these martial artists to become weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>Even being able to jump twenty meters could be considered a peerless expert.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan guessed this was related to the dilution of bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... what's wrong?" Seeming to notice Qi Yuan spacing out, Kuanghuan couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just thought of some interesting things." Qi Yuan looked at Kuanghuan and asked, "In ancient times, were the records of martial arts experts very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm... very powerful, there were even records of one person charging into thousands of troops, but... this is mostly exaggeration in historical records.</p><p></p><p>Current scientific research shows that martial arts have limits, with being able to fight a hundred people already being the limit." Kuanghuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>The limit of martial arts was being able to fight a hundred people, while advanced gene drugs could easily break through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Kuanghuan couldn't help asking in a low voice: "Could the limit of immortal arts... be fighting ten thousand people?"</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few records about immortal arts and mythological legends on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps because the people on Gongxing lacked imagination and weren't good at boasting, even the most impressive records of these mythological figures only mentioned flying through the sky and crossing seas.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even compare to a single hair of a certain populous country on the Blue Star in terms of exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Being able to fight ten thousand people already seemed extremely exaggerated to Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate to the peak of immortal arts and become someone who could fight ten thousand, he would definitely have a place among the great families of the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>"You're really underestimating immortal arts." Qi Yuan smiled lazily, "I'm very weak right now... but killing ten thousand or so people... would still be a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kuanghuan's heart skipped a beat, his eyes filled with awe as he looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he still had doubts about Qi Yuan's words, as they were too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were speaking very softly and were some distance from the others, so the others didn't hear.</p><p></p><p>"As for martial arts, they may have declined now, but in ancient times... they were perhaps very powerful too," Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>The blood extracted from the sea monster made Qi Yuan understand that martial arts were not so simple.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the martial arts blood in modern people's bodies was too diluted, so they couldn't bring out the true power of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately... according to my guess, martial arts do have a limit, and that limit is... the ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The limit of martial arts was the bloodline source, that original ancestor.</p><p></p><p>So for martial arts, descendants could never surpass their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Because almost everything the descendants had came from their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>But martial arts also had an advantage, which was that if the ancestor made another breakthrough, it might cause all descendants' bloodlines to leap and improve, thereby increasing their strength.</p><p></p><p>But looking at Gongxing's thousands of years of history, there were almost no such records.</p><p></p><p>This showed that those few ancestral sources of martial arts bloodlines had either died, or... never made any more breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>So no more bloodline leaps had occurred.</p><p></p><p>However, this raised another question. Once Qi Yuan's strength surpassed that of the ancestors, would the ancestors' bloodlines also leap when he increased his strength?</p><p></p><p>If so, the potential of the ancestors would also increase a notch.</p><p></p><p>What if the ancestors were dead, wouldn't even a bone start boiling with bloodline energy? Thinking of such things, Qi Yuan found it quite amusing.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, couldn't he just lie back, have a bunch of children, and wait for the children to break through the bloodline limits, causing his bloodline to leap in return and increase his strength?</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just idle speculation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the cruise ship.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu looked at the burly man in front of him, his expression not very pleased.</p><p></p><p>This time, they had come to the Haixingya to take away the sea monsters and complete their mission.</p><p></p><p>On the Haixingya</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The person in charge was also very responsible and allocated some sea monsters to them.</p><p></p><p>But now, with one phone call from the leadership above, these sea monsters had to be handed over to this group of powerful elites.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had made a wasted trip and busied himself for nothing all day, so naturally he felt resentful.</p><p></p><p>However, facing this group of suited men carrying guns, Wang Xu still unconsciously bent his back and said: "All the sea monsters are here, not a single one is missing."</p><p></p><p>"Good, check them," said the suited man.</p><p></p><p>The other suited men opened the boxes and inspected the sea monsters inside.</p><p></p><p>"No problems."</p><p></p><p>"Good." Seeing the sea monsters were fine, the suited man looked at Wang Xu and said, "Thank you for your trouble, we'll be taking these things now."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the suited men left carrying the boxes containing the sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>Watching their retreating figures, Wang Xu sighed and said: "We minor officials can't even compare to the servants of those powerful elites."</p><p></p><p>The man beside him nodded in agreement. </p><p></p><p>Those family private soldiers would have been household slaves in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"We can only strive to become powerful elites ourselves in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Don't even think about it. In today's society, what qualifications do we lowly workers have to become elites? Those few big families of the Seven Martial Stars have held their positions for hundreds of years. Where is there room for people like us?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I guess only if the world undergoes great changes would we have a chance."</p><p></p><p>"Let's not hope for world-changing events. I just hope to live peacefully and steadily," Wang Xu said softly. "If the world changes drastically, people like us would be the first to die."</p><p></p><p>He was already very content with his current life. At least compared to Li Yan and Qi Yuan's group of old classmates, he was doing quite well.</p><p></p><p>"These powerful elites are really too idle. Taking these disgusting sea monsters back to eat... aren't they afraid of getting sick?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, and night gradually fell.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi looked at the crowd in the distance, disappointment showing in her eyes. </p><p></p><p>Today she had tried her best, but unfortunately failed to successfully offer herself.</p><p></p><p>This left her quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan in front of her, and at Kuanghuan, her eyes revealing admiration.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the agent walked over. She looked at Wu Qi, her eyes teasing: "What? Failed?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's admiring gaze held a hint of disappointment: "Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Those big shots, what kind of beauties haven't they seen? Women who have undergone genetic modifications are even more beyond comparison for people like us. We may look glamorous, but in the eyes of those big shots, we're nothing more than some seasoning," the agent said with feeling. Her words also carried a sense of world-weariness, as if she had experienced a lot.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Qi's eyes suddenly became determined again: "No, I don't want to live like this!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan looked at the suited man in front of him and said softly: "You've been drinking. If you drive me now, wouldn't that be drunk driving? If we get caught by traffic police, we'd end up in jail."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, careless driving leads to tears for loved ones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't do such illegal things.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, we have special permits. Drunk driving only applies to ordinary people," the black-suited men said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Kuanghuan glared angrily at the black-suited man, then humbly walked over to Qi Yuan: "I'll drive!"</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was angry at this subordinate for being so tactless. Why argue with Mr. Qi? If Mr. Qi wants someone who hasn't been drinking, then someone who hasn't been drinking it is.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't been drinking, so he'll be the driver.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, alright," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan personally acted as driver, driving the car to take Qi Yuan home.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, four other cars followed.</p><p></p><p>These four cars were loaded with various medicinal herbs, as well as the sea monsters collected from the Haixingya.</p><p></p><p>As he drove, Kuanghuan thought of something and slowly said: "These herbs and sea monsters take up quite a bit of space, and... they're not clean, plus they smell. </p><p></p><p>As it happens, I have a friend who owns a property in Mr. Qi's neighborhood. Why don't we give it to Mr. Qi? Otherwise the smell of these sea monsters is terribly unpleasant, I'm afraid it would pollute Mr. Qi's house."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Kuanghuan started offering to give away a house.</p><p></p><p>After a day of conversation, he increasingly felt Qi Yuan's mysteriousness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Kuanghuan at this time: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>He accepted these benefits with a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kuanghuan was delighted inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes giving gifts can also be a joyful thing.</p><p></p><p>There was a red light ahead, and the car came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly spoke: "Is this car bulletproof?"</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was stunned for a moment, then answered without thinking: "This is the city center, it's very safe. Not bulletproof."</p><p></p><p>"Very safe?" Qi Yuan smiled at this point. "Then why is someone aiming a sniper rifle at me?"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Kuanghuan's heart suddenly jolted.</p><p></p><p>And just at that moment, a sharp gunshot suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>As an arms dealer, Kuanghuan instantly recognized this as the sound of a Tiger-1 sniper rifle.</p><p></p><p>This type of sniper rifle was known as the king of snipers.</p><p></p><p>This rifle could even penetrate two centimeters of steel plate from a thousand meters away.</p><p></p><p>Even a soldier who had taken the latest genetic enhancement drugs would die instantly if hit by this gun.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be shocked that someone was using this gun to snipe at Qi Yuan? In fact, he could already imagine the scene of Qi Yuan's head being blown off.</p><p></p><p>However, when he turned his head to look at Qi Yuan, he saw Qi Yuan sitting calmly in place, unharmed.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he was holding a rather large sniper rifle bullet.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Kuanghuan was stunned for a moment, in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Is this... something a human can do? It's worth noting that the speed of this type of sniper bullet can reach three times the speed of sound! Suddenly, he remembered Qi Yuan's claim of being able to fight ten thousand men. At this moment, he understood that Qi Yuan wasn't boasting, but telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan held the bullet, a calm smile appearing in his eyes: "Fortunately I made some breakthroughs on the cruise ship today, otherwise this shot would have been quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, I didn't expect there to be so many villains in this game. I've already been keeping a low profile, treating it as a casual game to play, but there are still bad guys trying to harm me! Do they really want to turn this into a war game?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many thoughts flashed through Kuanghuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Today's events were completely beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Someone actually used a sniper rifle against his guest right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He felt angry, and even more shocked and chilled.</p><p></p><p>This meant the other party didn't take him seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>In Tianyue City, there weren't many people who wouldn't take him, a hereditary viscount, seriously.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that there were deep waters behind this.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Qi Yuan say: "Wait a moment, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan calmed down at this point. He looked at Qi Yuan and said in a deep voice: "Be careful, Mr. Qi. If things go south, I'll bring my brothers to escort you away, leave Tianyue City for Xinyang City. That's my stronghold!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave a calm smile: "In this world, the ones who should be fleeing should be my enemies."</p><p></p><p>[The rest of the text appears to be author's notes thanking various supporters and donors, which I have not translated.]</p>

        <h1>Chapter 239</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods received this method in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This method imitated the assimilation technique of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>By cultivating this method, they would be assimilated and become part of the Origin Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Like puppets.</p><p></p><p>Everything they had would become the foundation for the Origin Celestial Venerable, enhancing Qi Yuan's strength and helping him step into the realm of Yang Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving this method, some ancient gods hesitated, some felt melancholy.</p><p></p><p>But not a single one wavered.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Celestial Venerable made us. Today, we repay the Celestial Venerable!" Twilight Great Venerable spoke, his face full of determination.</p><p></p><p>Following Twilight Great Venerable's words, those who had visualized the water god Gong Gong exploded at this moment, turning into a drop of water and merging into Qi Yuan's divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu used the assimilation method, a calm smile appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This old man can no longer help the Celestial Venerable guard the netherworld!"</p><p></p><p>His body also exploded at this moment, unhesitatingly assimilated to become part of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The spring wind pities me. It turns out that the youth I, East River, was meant to become is actually the Celestial Venerable!" East River could no longer hold on, using his last divine power to perform the assimilation method.</p><p></p><p>"Willing to die for the Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Willing to die for the Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Voices roared out one after another, as ancient gods chose to sacrifice themselves at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they knew that even if they sacrificed themselves, the Origin Celestial Venerable still could not cross the chasm to become a Yang Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But they still unhesitatingly chose to go to their deaths! In the Celestial Stars Formation, stars dimmed one by one.</p><p></p><p>The night sky that was once dotted with stars also lost all its light at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Great Venerable let out a great roar: "Qi Yuan, after I die, I give you the name of Old Deng that you so revered!"</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Great Venerable also chose to assimilate, his body exploding with a boom.</p><p></p><p>The blood of the gods who had died in battle before, scattered in the Celestial Stars Formation, was also assimilated at this moment, becoming part of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The former subjects, all the ancient gods, Qi Qi, Stone Mountain, Shen Tu, Divine Cat Venerable, Pear Mountain Great Venerable...</p><p></p><p>One by one, familiar figures behind Qi Yuan chose to assimilate, passing away one after another.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a familiar figure appeared near Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This figure wore a red robe, ethereal like a fairy.</p><p></p><p>It was the Holy Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>After these ancient gods who had used supreme treasures to become Venerables fell, the phantom of the Holy Mother of No Food appeared.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her gaze as complex as before.</p><p></p><p>She smiled brightly: "I've finally seen you."</p><p></p><p>This peerlessly beautiful woman's figure exploded with a boom.</p><p></p><p>She also chose to use the assimilation method, becoming part of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's strength increased crazily.</p><p></p><p>In his divine realm, floods raged, thunder rolled, the earth overturned...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was more than ten times, a hundred times stronger than before! The divine power of all the Great Venerables, including their divine visualization methods, poured into his mind all at once.</p><p></p><p>It was as if hundreds of thousands of celestial gods were hidden in his body.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in Blood Sun Great Saint's eyes: "What a moving sacrifice, but alas... it is all in vain!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Qi Yuan raised his sword with both hands.</p><p></p><p>His enormous body leapt suddenly, descending from the sea of stars!</p><p></p><p>The fragile celestial bodies in the starry sea were shattered into dust by the shockwave of this peerless strike, scattering like dandruff.</p><p></p><p>This giant sword strike represented all the fallen ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>This strike was more than ten times, a hundred times stronger than the previous one! This shocking strike directly split Blood Sun Great Saint's body in two.</p><p></p><p>The giant body was severed, and a trace of blood appeared on Blood Sun Great Saint's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, to be able to wound my dharma body is quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, her body as vast as a celestial body healed again.</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Saint seemed to be completely uninjured.</p><p></p><p>The smile in her eyes grew: "Unfortunately, without becoming a Yang Immortal, you cannot harm my origin at all!"</p><p></p><p>This kind of injury meant nothing to her.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Yang Immortals and Yin Immortals was too great, too vast. They were not even beings of the same level of life.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong Qi Yuan's sword was, it could not truly harm Her.</p><p></p><p>It was like a brute could crush gold, but could not erase the element of gold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his sword silently.</p><p></p><p>Now he was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>He even had the feeling that given enough time, he could completely split a star in two.</p><p></p><p>But his powerful sword strike could not truly harm a Yang Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"You are very strong now, stronger than all myths.</p><p></p><p>The divine power in your body even surpasses mine.</p><p></p><p>But so what? The gap between Yang Immortals and Yin Immortals is not in divine power at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Not enough?" Qi Yuan's gaze was deep.</p><p></p><p>Was the divine power in his body not enough?</p><p></p><p>"What use is more divine power?" Blood Sun Great Saint spoke, "Without becoming a Yang Immortal, it's just a fleeting firework. How can it compare to the eternity of stars?"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, my divine power is not enough!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>He swung his sword again, also silently digesting the divine power of those ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>"What use is more divine power?</p><p></p><p>They sacrificed themselves, assimilating to become part of you!</p><p></p><p>But assimilation is still assimilation, their divine power is still not truly yours! If divine power cannot be unified, how can you fight me!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Saint looked at Qi Yuan, her face full of greed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine realm was in chaos, and so was his divine power.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when she was a myth, Qi Yuan's divine realm was more than a hundred times stronger.</p><p></p><p>But so what! If divine power could not be unified, it was chaotic. How could it condense a past self?</p><p></p><p>Even if he condensed a past self, so what? Without entering the great realm, he could not break through to become a Yang Immortal and condense a present self! So the Origin Celestial Venerable before her posed no threat to her at all.</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Saint opened her bloody maw, her eyes greedy, with a hint of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"Is this as far as you can go?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this your limit?"</p><p></p><p>"Too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Saint's face was mocking, but more greedy.</p><p></p><p>To her, Qi Yuan was thousands of times more delicious than the Dao of the primordial world.</p><p></p><p>As long as she devoured all of Qi Yuan's accumulations, she believed that one day, in the upper realm, she, Blood Sun Great Saint, would dominate heaven and earth! She looked at Qi Yuan, a hint of reluctance flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Eat you, achieve me!"</p><p></p><p>She used her origin that she had not used before.</p><p></p><p>Her huge bloody maw opened again, like her past self in the mortal heart realm, swallowing Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>And this time, Qi Yuan did not split her past self with just the phantom of the Three Pure Ones like in the mortal heart realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was in endless darkness, or rather... endless emptiness.</p><p></p><p>There was no light before his eyes, no color, not even black.</p><p></p><p>"Become part of me!" A vast voice sounded in Qi Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the emptiness.</p><p></p><p>A hint of profundity flashed in his huge eyes.</p><p></p><p>Memories were being stripped away, everything seemed to be leaving Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood quietly, without any resistance, terrifyingly silent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like an instant, yet also like eons passing.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly smiled: "Blood Sun Great Sage, you were originally me, so why do you want to devour me?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Sage was stunned for a moment, completely ignoring Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She thought this was Qi Yuan trying to stall for time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the corners of Qi Yuan's eyes were filled with smiles.</p><p></p><p>He muttered softly:</p><p></p><p>"Divine power as one?"</p><p></p><p>"The vanishing one?"</p><p></p><p>"One begets two, two begets three, three begets all things!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Qi Yuan recalled his past conversation with Thunder God Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had asked Thunder God Supreme if there was a possibility that Thunder God Supreme was him, the stars in the sky were also him, all living beings were him.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Thunder God Supreme thought he was crazy. Qi Yuan felt it was because his own understanding was insufficient.</p><p></p><p>Just like a cat in front of a mirror, not knowing the reflection is itself.</p><p></p><p>Now, having obtained the Devouring Primal Body, he had made up for his lack of understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Lord has awakened!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Thunder God Supreme is me, I am Thunder God Supreme!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Qi is me, I am Houtu!"</p><p></p><p>"Shi Zhongshan is me, I am Erlang Shengjun!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the young Heavenly Emperor Dong Jianghe!"</p><p></p><p>On Qi Yuan's face, countless faces appeared.</p><p></p><p>These faces included the long-dead Tianbao Venerable, the beautiful Qi Qi, the weathered Yulü, and the majestic Lingbao Tianzun.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out, all of this is me!"</p><p></p><p>All beings are him! Everything in the world is him!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had awakened.</p><p></p><p>The divine power within him underwent a tremendous change at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The originally chaotic divine realm became even more chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The divine power within his body became unified as one.</p><p></p><p>However, this one then became two, two became three, and three became all things.</p><p></p><p>"All beings are me!"</p><p></p><p>"I am all beings!"</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand the Dao De Jing!"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao begets one, one begets two, two begets three, three begets all things!"</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out, Laozi is me, I wrote the Dao De Jing!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan understood that plagiarism was not plagiarism.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star did not need to be erased, because all creators were himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally understood the One, and also understood the Dao.</p><p></p><p>He also understood that Thunder God Supreme was him.</p><p></p><p>The Three Pure Ones and Six Honored Ones he had visualized were actually all him.</p><p></p><p>Divine power as one can become the past self.</p><p></p><p>Divine power as one, after being refined by the great realm, becomes the ultimate one divine power, achieving the present self, achieving the Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>And now, one is all things, his divine power was truly unified as one, truly the ultimate one.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out, I am also a Yang Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan seemed to have a great awakening.</p><p></p><p>His body shrank at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His entire body's aura became internalized at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Blood Sun Great Sage now had a puzzled expression on her face, along with intense fear.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly... happened to you?"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, facing the Origin Venerable, she felt an inexplicable fear in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"I want to say, you've taken the wrong path."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, his voice resounding.</p><p></p><p>"The path of the Yang Spirit, how could it be unification?</p><p></p><p>It should be... transformation into me! I, Qi Yuan, am the only one in all heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"You all did not originally exist, you are one of the myriad things I transformed into."</p><p></p><p>"You're insane!" Blood Sun Great Sage felt an intense sense of threat, she truly felt Qi Yuan had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he say such things.</p><p></p><p>In the past, she had seen a Yang Spirit like Qi Yuan, that Yang Spirit's path was very similar to Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she no longer hesitated and attacked directly.</p><p></p><p>A cold light appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "You are the me that I dislike, kill!"</p><p></p><p>He struck out, lightly swinging his blood-red longsword.</p><p></p><p>A crack immediately appeared on Blood Sun Great Sage's celestial body-sized form.</p><p></p><p>Such a crack, if it had happened before, Blood Sun Great Sage would not have cared at all.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, her whole body broke out in goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>Because her true form was rapidly dissolving and being assimilated at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>This was something she had never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but tremble: "What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"I am... reclaiming myself!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's blood-colored longsword seemed to have gained the Devouring Primal Body, chewing on Blood Sun Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>The distant Blood God Great Sage finally lost his composure, launching a terrifying attack at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was extremely calm.</p><p></p><p>"The primordial world represents infinite possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"So this is the primordial... Yang Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he swung the longsword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, over a million celestial soldiers and generals appeared behind him, all playing suona horns together.</p><p></p><p>As the desolate sound of suona horns rang out, Qi Yuan's sword lightly fell on Blood God Great Sage's body.</p><p></p><p>"We were originally one, why torment oneself?"</p><p></p><p>He sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was unprecedentedly powerful.</p><p></p><p>A look of shock appeared in Blood God Great Sage's eyes: "What... exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>The two Yang Spirits, like those alien demons in the Absolute Ground, looked at Qi Yuan with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because their understanding simply could not comprehend Qi Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>"I am... you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>The two terrifying Yang Spirits felt their bodies go cold.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to flee, but their bodies simply wouldn't listen.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it were other Yang Spirits facing Qi Yuan's strike at this moment, if they couldn't block it, they could still escape.</p><p></p><p>But... these two Yang Spirits could not.</p><p></p><p>Because their bodies had long been contaminated with the primordial qi of the primordial world.</p><p></p><p>The primordial world represents infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the God Observation Method can create gods.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the God Observation Method that Qi Yuan imagined out of thin air can also be recreated.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Qi Yuan can say that he is Thunder God, he is Qi Qi, he is the Holy Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>Because they have all been influenced by the primordial world.</p><p></p><p>Because Qi Yuan has the Devouring Primal Body.</p><p></p><p>Because Qi Yuan has the Qi Yuan Scripture.</p><p></p><p>These three things are indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Only when gathered together can they create the Qi Yuan where all beings are him! Otherwise, even if Thunder God Supreme and all the gods chose to assimilate into Qi Yuan, Qi Yuan still could not truly become them.</p><p></p><p>"Contaminated with primordial qi... you are me!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze became profound.</p><p></p><p>The two Yang Spirits were now completely unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Sage's delicate face was now rapidly changing, slowly becoming Qi Yuan's appearance, her headlights larger than planets directly shrinking.</p><p></p><p>Blood God Great Sage's face turned into the shape of a star.</p><p></p><p>The two Yang Spirits, at this moment... became Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>An angry expression appeared on Qi Yuan's face at this time.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you impersonate me, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, unleashing his powerful sword strike.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he entered the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, and stars were extinguished.</p><p></p><p>The two enormous bodies dissipated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the infinite starry sky, two blood-red celestial bodies suddenly exploded, turning into endless fragments.</p><p></p><p>The myriad heavens shook.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 333</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The broadcast announcement surprised the martial artists who had come to participate in the martial arts tournament, leaving them at a loss.</p><p></p><p>In previous years, the martial arts tournament had very low viewership ratings.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the organizers added a pre-match trash-talking segment. </p><p></p><p>The competing fighters had a three-minute session on stage to verbally attack each other.</p><p></p><p>This trash-talking segment was the most popular and had the highest ratings.</p><p></p><p>Many of the exciting verbal battles were even edited and posted online.</p><p></p><p>Especially those who talked the most trash but ended up getting badly beaten - when edited together, it created dramatic and entertaining clips.</p><p></p><p>Now... "Be civilized, establish new customs" - trash-talking is prohibited.</p><p></p><p>Are they not concerned about ratings anymore?</p><p></p><p>Which leader got their head stuck in a door to come up with these random ideas?</p><p></p><p>"Ah? The world has gotten too bizarre lately," Xing Yu couldn't help but complain.</p><p></p><p>Recently in this Qin Yuan country, all sorts of strange things have been happening.</p><p></p><p>Rumors of spiritual energy returning, a sword immortal destroying an army camp with one sword strike, plus the voting incident - anyway, things are getting more and more chaotic.</p><p></p><p>This "Be civilized, establish new customs" doesn't seem so outlandish in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Since these are the rules, we can only follow them. Who are we to have the power to break the rules?" Wang Shiqiao, who had been silent until now, spoke up, secretly glancing at Qi Yuan not far away.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also said at this time: "I actually think this official requirement is quite humane. If everyone was civilized, how many conflicts would be reduced in this world? The world would welcome love and peace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speaking from his heart. </p><p></p><p>If everyone was civilized, would there still be a need for him to wipe out entire families to promote world peace?</p><p></p><p>"We can't fathom the intentions of those above, we just need to follow the rules. Anyway... aren't we just here to gain experience?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua spoke very seriously this time.</p><p></p><p>He could achieve good results in city-level competitions. </p><p></p><p>At the national level, there's no need to even think about it - those who achieve great results are all at the peak of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>His strength was still quite far from the peak of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Right, everything according to the rules. I'm also a law-abiding good citizen," Qi Yuan chimed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao, who was not far away, heard this and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Chopping off people's heads and giving them as gifts - is that also called law-abiding? </p><p></p><p>What kind of good person chops off heads?</p><p></p><p>"However, I'm quite ambitious. I came here to win the championship!" Qi Yuan said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had reached the Jade Blood realm, participating in the martial arts tournament was like an adult beating children.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi will definitely win the championship!" Just then, Han Xianyun of the Northern Crane school approached, his face full of respect.</p><p></p><p>Recently, there were changes in the capital, with the Mu family of the Seven Martial Star families being wiped out.</p><p></p><p>His elder brother was transferred to the provincial cabinet, and he also obtained an honorary earl title.</p><p></p><p>It could be said he was riding high on success.</p><p></p><p>He knew that he was able to obtain all of this entirely due to Qi Yuan's grace.</p><p></p><p>Towards Mr. Qi, as well as that Ning Tao, his heart held both respect and awe.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you used to think I couldn't win the championship?" Qi Yuan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"That was then, this is now," Han Xianyun said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"You have good insight. If there's a chance in the future, I'll definitely introduce you to an amazing wife," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Han Xianyun couldn't enter the world of death energy, or the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Old Man Huang from last time, and the Sea God, could all be introduced to Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Xianyun's mind became complex.</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak, a slightly mocking voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Han Xianyun, the championship of the martial arts tournament isn't something any Tom, Dick or Harry can get." The speaker was a burly man with a tattoo on his face, looking quite intimidating. "To win the championship, it would have to be a strong fighter like Zhang Yang the Southern Lion!"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of Zhang Yang, there was a look of awe in the tattooed man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Xianyun couldn't help but laugh: "If you said you would win the championship, I might think more highly of you. But you're pinning your hopes on someone who has beaten you before - you're really something."</p><p></p><p>Before participating in the martial arts tournament, the tattooed man had fought against Zhang Yang the Southern Lion and was defeated in three moves.</p><p></p><p>Since then, his fighting spirit had diminished.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you don't know how high the sky is or how deep the earth is. You have no idea that even at the peak of martial arts... there are differences. If Zhang Yang is given time, he will definitely break through the limits of martial arts. It's a pity..." </p><p></p><p>The tattooed man's expression became somewhat dejected as he said this.</p><p></p><p>He had also received news that after winning the championship in this martial arts tournament, Zhang Yang would be retiring from the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>This time was also Zhang Yang's farewell battle.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he would not have the chance to see someone break through the limits of martial arts again.</p><p></p><p>The tattooed man finished speaking and left with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Tiehua's eyes widened: "You're Han Xianyun of the Northern Crane? Peak of martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>As a martial artist, he had naturally heard of the Southern Lion and Northern Crane.</p><p></p><p>This young man, who addressed Qi Yuan as Mr. Qi, was actually Han Xianyun of the Northern Crane?</p><p></p><p>Then Qi Yuan...</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards Qi Yuan changed once again.</p><p></p><p>The people from the martial arts school behind Xu Tiehua also looked at Qi Yuan differently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had only been at Mingwu Martial Arts School for a few months.</p><p></p><p>From Han Xianyun's description, he was at least at the peak of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he really was a supreme genius?</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun smiled: "That's right, it's me."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan scanned all the participating martial artists and couldn't help saying: "Too weak. How lonely it is to be invincible."</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu couldn't help but roll her eyes at Qi Yuan: "Qi Yuan, even if you're a supreme genius, you shouldn't underestimate others."</p><p></p><p>She also understood in her heart that Qi Yuan was definitely a genius who had broken through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, with strange things happening frequently, this didn't seem so unusual.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not underestimating them. I also hope they'll put in more effort. But unfortunately... they're too weak. If it wasn't for wanting to win the championship, I wouldn't even have the desire to participate," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary hugged Qi Yuan's arm, her voice cheerful: "Do you want me to injure them all, beat them until they withdraw from the competition? This way... you'll directly win the championship."</p><p></p><p>"Is that... not very good?" Qi Yuan thought for a moment and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the building.</p><p></p><p>A woman's face showed an anxious expression: "Sir, just now, the participating contestant Wang Fusheng verbally provoked the target individual."</p><p></p><p>"What?" The man in military uniform who heard this changed his expression drastically. "How dare he!"</p><p></p><p>The target individual was someone they all had to treat carefully, yet someone dared to verbally provoke him.</p><p></p><p>Did they not want to live anymore?</p><p></p><p>"Wang Fusheng, is it? Quickly find someone to arrest him. He actually verbally provoked and threatened his opponent before the competition. Cancel his qualification for the competition, and also... for the crime of endangering national security... arrest him immediately!"</p><p></p><p>This man in military uniform was truly angry.</p><p></p><p>They were so careful when dealing with Qi Yuan, afraid of offending him.</p><p></p><p>Yet there were still ignorant people who dared to offend him. Were they seeking death?</p><p></p><p>What if Qi Yuan got offended and knocked down a few more Eyes in the Sky?</p><p></p><p>Who would take responsibility for that? Who would bear the consequences?</p><p></p><p>"Quickly arrange for staff to conduct pre-competition training for every participating contestant. Prohibit them from using any form of... foul language or provocation towards opponents, understand?" The man in military uniform said sternly.</p><p></p><p>This matter must be handled well.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, forget about promotion and salary increase, they might not even be able to keep their lives.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the second day, the martial arts tournament officially began.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts tournament had ten arenas in total, with matches happening simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>After several rounds, the strongest twenty-odd contestants were selected to continue competing.</p><p></p><p>The competition was generally divided into two days. </p><p></p><p>The first day was essentially a free-for-all, without many highlights.</p><p></p><p>In the spectator stands, there were very few audience members.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why isn't there a pre-match trash talking session? This is so boring."</p><p></p><p>"Without insults and getting heated up, this fighting is less interesting than street thugs brawling."</p><p></p><p>"How dull, I shouldn't have come if I'd known."</p><p></p><p>The spectators watched the martial arts fights with little enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't very interested either, watching the matches on the field: "Human Realm Martial Lord... can be obtained in just 100 years. </p><p>Spirit Realm Martial Lord, still no clues at all."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary, however, found it quite interesting: "Even small people fighting can be fun, it's like watching cartoons."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you're the small one," Qi Yuan glanced at the golden canary.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary had a petite and delicate figure, with a black dress covering her entire body, tiny in size.</p><p>She could even hang her whole body on Qi Yuan without any weight.</p><p></p><p>"Where am I small? This young lady is not small at all!" The golden canary proudly puffed out her chest.</p><p></p><p>Although, she had secretly bought a push-up bra.</p><p></p><p>But she was originally between A and B cup, leaning towards B. Even so, it didn't look exaggerated, like an inverted jade bowl.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed not small. If you want to get bigger, with one spell... you could instantly become as big as... a mountain."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" The golden canary rarely cursed.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't use foul language, it's forbidden to curse here."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The golden canary turned her head away from Qi Yuan. If Blood Bead didn't apologize, she wouldn't initiate conversation with him today.</p><p></p><p>"See that person? Zhang Yang of the Southern Lion. He's my biggest enemy in this martial arts tournament.</p><p>Unfortunately... he's only slightly stronger than an ant."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the arena, Zhang Yang swung a powerful punch, visible strong winds could be seen, blood energy boiling.</p><p></p><p>This scene drew cheers and applause from many spectators.</p><p></p><p>Because... it was another instant kill.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary was originally still angry and didn't want to talk to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But then she thought, this was Qi Yuan talking to her.</p><p></p><p>Responding wouldn't count as initiating conversation with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at Zhang Yang, a thoughtful look in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead, don't you feel that the people in this world... all look somewhat familiar?"</p><p></p><p>"Familiar?" Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he hadn't noticed anything familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Their bloodlines... seem to have some degree of common origin with the demons of the Myriad Beasts Realm."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary said seriously.</p><p></p><p>As she was at the Yin Spirit realm, she naturally saw much more than Qi Yuan now.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary was most familiar with the Myriad Beasts Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm, one of their biggest enemies was the demons from the Myriad Beasts Realm.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings of the Myriad Beasts Realm, led by Shang Yanran, invaded the Flowing Wind Realm through the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>As a great supreme being, Ning Tao had dealt with the supreme beings of the Myriad Beasts Realm many times and was familiar with their aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was different. He entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences later and steamrolled through.</p><p></p><p>He had almost no interaction with demon supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Flowing Wind Realm, Qi Yuan held the golden canary's cold little hand: "Is it related to the Myriad Beasts Realm?</p><p>Doesn't this mean we might have a chance to... return to Nine Coils Mountain in the future?</p><p>If possible, we could have another wedding ceremony at your parents' home."</p><p></p><p>"This young lady has no parents' home. If I did... it would be on your golden core." The golden canary said proudly, her voice filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, she had no relatives in her life.</p><p></p><p>Blood Bead, who suddenly entered her world, was almost her everything.</p><p></p><p>Most of her life had been spent in long waiting.</p><p></p><p>Only now could it be considered that her suffering had turned to sweetness.</p><p></p><p>"If I bully you in the future, wouldn't there be no one to back you up?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"You dare!" The golden canary glared at Qi Yuan angrily, "Then I'll just transform into Ning Tao and step on you.</p><p>Oh no, I regret it now. When you were trapped in the Heavenly Heart Palace back then, this young lady should have stepped on you a few times!"</p><p></p><p>Back then, Qi Yuan couldn't enter the game.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao used the Soul Locking Jade to summon Qi Yuan over.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan was Ning Tao's prisoner.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was even thinking of completely controlling Qi Yuan in her palm, imprisoning him in the dungeon of the Heavenly Heart Palace, preventing him from leaving her sight, making his entire world revolve around her.</p><p></p><p>"No, this young lady can step on you now. Hehe, Blood Bead, you're no match for this young lady now." The golden canary looked smug.</p><p></p><p>In the private box, the golden canary's slender leg raised up. Perhaps unwilling to step with her shoe, the golden canary's shoe had slipped off at some point, revealing a small foot wrapped in black stockings, like tender white lotus root.</p><p></p><p>Five jade toes pressed together or curled, like the world's most perfect work of art, small enough to be held in one hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan suddenly thought of many things: "Are the stockings from the Flowing Wind Realm better quality than those from Gongxing?</p><p>If we could go to the Flowing Wind Realm, couldn't we engage in trade between the two realms, selling stockings?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" This time the golden canary didn't hold back, directly stepping on Qi Yuan's foot.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps she spoiled Qi Yuan too much, this step wasn't forceful, and the speed was very slow, allowing Qi Yuan to grab her foot.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I was just saying. We're too short on money." Qi Yuan wanted to buy Gongxing, but unfortunately lacked funds.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." A trace of blush crept up the golden canary's ears. She looked at Qi Yuan, saying dissatisfied, "Is money more important than me?"</p><p></p><p>Back on Nine Coils Mountain, she had also said, "Blood Bead, is the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences more beautiful than me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "For many people, money is very important.</p><p>But I... am lawful good, an idealist.</p><p>You... are important."</p><p></p><p>"What if you weren't lawful good, weren't an idealist?"</p><p></p><p>"Still you." Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The golden canary snorted coldly again, but this time with more joyful meaning.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly thought of a very serious question." At this moment, Qi Yuan seemed to think of something, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"What question?" The golden canary's long legs stiffened, not withdrawing her jade feet, as if she greatly enjoyed the intimacy with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, after too much long waiting in the past, she had a strong sense of insecurity in her heart, worried about being abandoned at any time.</p><p></p><p>Only by sticking close to Qi Yuan did she have a bit of security.</p><p></p><p>So after coming to this world, she had been clinging to Qi Yuan almost constantly.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze, her peripheral vision, had never left Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>If she could be close to Qi Yuan, she would never refuse.</p><p></p><p>"We haven't discussed how much the bride price should be." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"This young lady doesn't want a bride price." The golden canary blurted out.</p><p></p><p>"Too love-brained." Qi Yuan smiled, "If we put our conversation online, there would definitely be many people cursing at you."</p><p></p><p>"If they curse at me, wouldn't you curse back at them for me, Blood Bead?" The golden canary smiled coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... not curse back, just kill them instead." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't bear to let the golden canary suffer even a tiny bit of grievance again.</p><p></p><p>He had already made her suffer far too much.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

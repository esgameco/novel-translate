        <h1>Chapter 557</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the ninety-nine demonic gods were revived once again.</p><p></p><p>Unlike three years ago, these ninety-nine demonic gods were now numb.</p><p></p><p>From the initial loud commotion to the current silent stillness.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, they... had died enough.</p><p></p><p>In the initial battle, after constantly self-destructing to death, Qihuang finally discovered the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan had opened the blood lock!</p><p></p><p>This was the only explanation!</p><p></p><p>But Qihuang was not afraid, he had many uncles, and the demonic source was also quite abundant.</p><p></p><p>Foolish people, money plentiful.</p><p></p><p>So they continued to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Then... the problem became serious, they dared not self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>But who would have known, the power Qiyuan displayed was far stronger than that of an ordinary peak mythological being.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Constant instant kills.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that at some point, the human before them had actually broken through to the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable, incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>An exhausted mythological being, suddenly breaking through to the Yang God realm in the midst of battle.</p><p></p><p>It was as if, an ordinary person on the Blue Star, after eating a watermelon and defecating in the wild, grew a watermelon vine, and in the end, this vine became the Heavenly Vine! After Qiyuan became a Yang God, the battles also became utterly certain.</p><p></p><p>Qihuang began... to threaten, plead, and tempt, using the Realm Lord uncles to scare Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Alas, it was useless, Qiyuan simply couldn't be bothered to listen to them, and directly... instant killed.</p><p></p><p>The instant kills after becoming a Yang God were much faster than the instant kills during the mythological era.</p><p></p><p>Almost as soon as they were revived by the demonic source, they were instantly slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The once boastful Qihuang also became numb.</p><p></p><p>In these three years, they would die as soon as they were revived, how many times had they died? Probably over a hundred million times? Even a person... no, even a god would be unable to endure such suffering.</p><p></p><p>Now, those numb demonic gods, if they were still thinking, must be thinking... Lord Qihuang, don't you have too many demonic sources? True death is now the only liberation.</p><p></p><p>This constant revival is truly torturous.</p><p></p><p>Qihuang had the same feeling, this was the first time he felt pain over having too many demonic sources.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were numb, and Qiyuan was also somewhat numb.</p><p></p><p>"Now, how am I any different from the 9,996 people screwing bolts in the factory? No, I'm not as tired as them, but my work hours are longer than theirs, working all year round, and most importantly... I don't get paid?"</p><p></p><p>Who stole his wages? Looking at the ninety-nine demonic gods reviving again, Qiyuan casually blew a breath.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, these ninety-nine demonic gods fell once more.</p><p></p><p>The feeble experience points flowed in, and Qiyuan was already unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just a mosquito's leg, but with trillions of tons, it adds up."</p><p></p><p>This was Qiyuan's current mindset.</p><p></p><p>If you dared to think it, he would just casually blow them away and kill the demonic gods, and now... his combat power had already reached the level of... the peak of the Immortal Realm's Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Or even stronger.</p><p></p><p>As for game levels and such, they had been solidified into realms.</p><p></p><p>If Qiyuan had a data panel, it would show him as being in the Yang God Third Layer, the Rule Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, his Rule Realm was different from the other Yang God Third Layers, after all, like the Realm Lord of the Zhou Universe, one needed to fuse with the universal rules to truly become a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Wood Universe was different, the universal rules were scattered among the Mandate Bearers, unless all the Mandate Bearers were slain and sacrificed to the Universal Essence, could someone fuse with the universal rules and step into the Realm Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>"Something is strange."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan casually slaughtered these demonic gods, a trace of puzzlement flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Through slaying enemies and gaining experience, the cultivation obtained was naturally more stable than the step-by-step cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When the experience was sufficient, and he stepped into the Yang God Third Layer at the peak of the Yang God Second Layer, Qiyuan's mind inexplicably derived a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>This was normal, when stepping into the Yin God realm, the Yin Gods would also gain knowledge of many future paths.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the path of the Yang God Third Layer, one needed to fuse with the universal rules to truly ascend, transforming the ultimate truth into universal rules, with words becoming law.</p><p></p><p>"Strange... it seems I haven't fused with the universal rules, yet my ultimate truth has somehow condensed... into rules, or can be considered rules."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the supreme ultimate truth Qiyuan had condensed, with the ability to do as he pleased and absolute adaptability, could only display its full power in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>When coming to other universes or lineages, its power would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>But this time, not only did it not decrease, but it was even evolving.</p><p></p><p>Normally, for the ultimate truth to evolve into universal rules, one needed to actively fuse with the universal rules.</p><p></p><p>But Qiyuan...</p><p></p><p>He hadn't fused with the universal rules, yet he had inexplicably formed universal rules.</p><p></p><p>This was a very strange thing.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I haven't fused with the rules of the Shen Wood Universe, yet it doesn't resist me?"</p><p></p><p>Normally, other Realm Lords rashly going to other universes would be targeted by the will of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The strange occurrences were not just one.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I'm a shareholder of the Shen Wood Universe, the universal rules... aren't they my money? Why do I need to fuse?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qiyuan felt that everything was easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Wood Universe was a company, and he was a shareholder.</p><p></p><p>Why bother fusing?</p><p></p><p>It was already his.</p><p></p><p>Resist him? Dreaming.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... you all revive too slowly."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qiyuan slew countless of them again.</p><p></p><p>Now he could easily leave this world, but a mosquito's meat is still meat.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to comprehend a time rule, to make them revive faster and die faster."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Qiyuan casually waved his hand, shattering this world.</p><p></p><p>He and the ninety-nine demonic gods appeared in the sky above the Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>Now, he sat in the heavens, his form invisible, continuously slaying these demonic gods.</p><p></p><p>Due to the demonic gods' revival and death speed being too fast, even exceeding human visual perception, even cultivators would not see them reviving and then being instantly slain.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, three months went by.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan picked up a communication talisman and said to Xianling Yingjun, "Ah, cultivation is so difficult..."</p><p></p><p>The distant Xianling Yingjun, seeing this, revealed a smug expression: "Cultivation is indeed difficult, three years have passed, and I've just stepped into the Great Venerable realm."</p><p></p><p>He was also showing off a bit.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had always been suppressed by Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qiyuan, what difficulty have you encountered this time?" Xianling Yingjun asked.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Qiyuan contacted him, it was to ask questions, and he had already gotten used to it.</p><p></p><p>A mature NPC guide would proactively ask the player what they needed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I recently discovered that killing is too slow, so I'm preparing to comprehend a time rule, but three months have passed... and I still have no clue."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan was also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, in comprehending other rules, he was usually able to make quick progress.</p><p></p><p>The time rule, which should not be the most difficult among the One-ÂìÅ Universal Rules, yet he still could not make any headway.</p><p></p><p>"Killing too slow... wait a minute, a time rule, you, an Yin God, comprehending a universal rule? Aren't you just creating trouble for yourself?" Xianling Yingjun replied helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Even with a genius like Feng Ti, they could only comprehend the rudiments of a rule.</p><p></p><p>Directly comprehending a universal rule was something a Realm Lord should do.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alas, after three years of arduous cultivation, I finally broke through to the Realm of the Domain Lord, thinking I could come and play around with the time rules, but..." Qi Yuan sighed, his hair almost turning white, "I thought I was a genius and that it would only take me three months to comprehend the time rules, but... I got nothing."</p><p></p><p>In another world, the handsome Immortal Spirit was a bit doubtful of his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with the transmission talisman I gave you? Why does it show that you've become a Domain Lord?" The handsome Immortal Spirit couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not broken. I have indeed become a Domain Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Brother... don't lie to me, you know I'll believe anything you say!" Even though the Immortal Spirit was an Yin Deity, his heart was now racing frantically, thumping loudly.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was just too frightening.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was incomprehensible, unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he fell into a time rift and traversed an entire era? "I'm not lying to you, I've already become a Domain Lord. Do you have any introductory techniques for the time rules?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right!" The Immortal Spirit suddenly had a realization, "You're not a Domain Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>He's not a Domain Lord? "All Domain Lords automatically comprehend the time rules upon entering the Realm of the Domain Lord. They don't need to cultivate it." The Immortal Spirit discovered something and felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>He almost got fooled.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan has even started lying!</p><p></p><p>"Why is that so? Don't you have to cultivate the rules?" Qi Yuan was curious and surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Upon reaching the Realm of the Yang Deity, one can sever the past body, shape the present body, and welcome the future body... the past, present, and future all reside within. Upon entering the third layer of the Yang Deity Realm, one will automatically comprehend the time rules." The Immortal Spirit explained.</p><p></p><p>This was no secret, anyone whose ancestors had produced a great figure should know this.</p><p></p><p>It's like someone who has never seen an emperor, but knows the dragon robe is usually yellow.</p><p></p><p>"This... I don't seem to have a past body or a future body." Qi Yuan felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"That's normal, you should be a Great Venerable, not a Yang Deity!" The Immortal Spirit became more and more excited and animated.</p><p></p><p>At least Qi Yuan was a Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If he really was a Domain Lord...</p><p></p><p>Well, he didn't wish his brother any suffering, but he was afraid his brother would open a can of worms.</p><p></p><p>"You... have a point. In the game, I'm a Domain Lord, but in reality, I'm just a small Purple Mansion, not even an Yin Deity." Qi Yuan sighed, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating so hard for so many years, he was only a Purple Mansion.</p><p></p><p>If he had fans, those fans would surely be on the verge of tears, saying, "Brother has worked so hard, but he's only a Purple Mansion, it's not fair!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Immortal Spirit suddenly slapped his thigh after looking at the dim gray display.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I forgot to remind Brother Qi Yuan, Wu Dong is coming to trouble him!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Where is he hiding?"</p><p></p><p>In the Quejin Realm, the blue-robed man had been searching for months, but couldn't find a trace of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the Devilish Gods, this place was also a fallen area, so he didn't dare to be too overt.</p><p></p><p>However, over these few months, his patience had been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"I need to act quickly and decisively, kill him, and then... swiftly return to the Radiant Universe!" Thinking about this, Wu Dong no longer hesitated.</p><p></p><p>A special talisman appeared, and he flew into the sky, his entire body emanating scorching golden light.</p><p></p><p>Like a blazing sun rising.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that there is a person named Qi Yuan in this realm, who has comprehended the rules and is an Extreme Yin Deity. I admire him. Today, with the clear sky and bright moon, I cross the realms to take his head!"</p><p></p><p>Under the empowerment of this talisman, Wu Dong was like an eternal blazing sun, hovering in the sky.</p><p></p><p>All the creatures in the Quejin Realm saw him, and heard his voice.</p><p></p><p>He hovered in the sky, his blue robe shimmering with golden light.</p><p>That dazzling golden color made people feel awe, as if they were seeing a deity.</p><p></p><p>Invincible, unmatched! Wu Dong fully unleashed his spiritual essence and displayed his immense strength.</p><p></p><p>In the Quejin Realm, countless creatures looked up at Wu Dong, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"This person is so powerful... ordinary Devilish Gods might not be his match!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this Qi Yuan that he has come to challenge across the realms?"</p><p></p><p>Some were confused and worried, afraid that they would be implicated.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, near the Cloud Blood City, Wu Xiang's eyes were filled with a shocked expression: "So he has come to challenge... Mr. Qi. But is Mr. Qi... safe?"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>The Devilish God Qi had appeared, and Mr. Qi's whereabouts were unknown. He didn't know if he was still safe.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had this thought, he seemed to hear a familiar and lazy voice.</p><p></p><p>"You keep obstructing my path to become mortal, do you think I'm just made of mud!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was calm, like a breeze blowing across the silent dead sea.</p><p>The wind suddenly became fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui!"</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone had lightly spat, just like a common sound on the roadside.</p><p></p><p>The eternal blazing sun that was Wu Dong was engulfed.</p><p>All his brilliance vanished without a trace.</p><p>As if he had never existed.</p><p></p><p>Wu Dong's true spirit also perished in that moment.</p><p>He didn't even have time to react.</p><p>He didn't even get a chance to fight back... and died without a burial place.</p><p></p><p>All the creatures in the Quejin Realm were dumbfounded, their expressions perplexed.</p><p>The eternal blazing sun in the sky had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>As if it had never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was puzzled and astonished.</p><p>Could it be... an illusion?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Radiant Universe, the Three Wood Domain Lord opened his eyes, a look of astonishment on his face: "Wu Dong is dead?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, then recalled that Wu Dong had gone to the Divine Wood Universe to challenge that person who had defeated the Phoenix Cry.</p><p></p><p>"The Causal Extraordinary Treasure has also been shattered?"</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Domain Lord was utterly perplexed.</p><p>He had once given this disciple a Causal Extraordinary Treasure, the lowest grade, but it was still a Causal Extraordinary Treasure.</p><p>Unless a Domain Lord intervened, no one could destroy a Causal Extraordinary Treasure.</p><p>The Divine Wood Universe did not have a Domain Lord, this was a well-known fact.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to trouble the Time Domain Lord to fish Wu Dong's true spirit out of the Cosmic Mother River and find out what exactly happened."</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Domain Lord vaguely felt that something must have happened in the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>About ten thousand breaths later, the Three Wood Domain Lord was respectfully waiting in a grand hall.</p><p>The master of this hall was the Time Domain Lord, an existence at the Myriad Things Realm.</p><p>It was rumored that this Domain Lord had cultivated in the mortal realm for three eras, and had already reached the perfect Myriad Things Realm, one step away from the legendary Opening Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Domain Lord had once helped the Time Domain Lord's mortal cultivation body, so the two had a certain relationship.</p><p>Otherwise, although they were both Domain Lords, with only a small realm difference, the Three Wood Domain Lord normally had no opportunity or qualifications to communicate with the Time Domain Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Three Wood, Wu Dong's true spirit is not in the Cosmic Mother River."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an ancient voice like an old tree came.</p><p>Hearing this, the Three Wood Domain Lord's face showed a shocked expression: "His true spirit is not in the Cosmic Mother River? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... he has been devoured by the Black Heaven." The Time Domain Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

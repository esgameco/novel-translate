        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After repairing the knife, Qi Yuan swept through the Black Mountain Sect like a gale, ransacking it completely.</p><p></p><p>Of course, due to time constraints, he focused primarily on looting the library.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, cultivation techniques were the most important.</p><p></p><p>The boundless cultivation techniques, combined with the vast knowledge he had accumulated and his ability to see hidden information, would allow him to continue perfecting the "Qi Yuan Sutra" and forge a path of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan estimated the time and swiftly departed from the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou, dressed in a simple and neat knee-length dress, was currently seated on a cloud rabbit carriage.</p><p></p><p>The cloud rabbit had three heads and eight feet, able to traverse both land and sky, and was extremely stable, so the rabbit's fate was quite good, being an excellent land and air transport animal, without the worry of its head being eaten.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, in this negotiation with the Black Mountain Sect, we must stand together and not back down. Handing over two-tenths of the blood crystals to the Black Mountain Sect is already our limit, we cannot increase it further!" said a burly man.</p><p></p><p>On this cloud rabbit carriage, there were more than ten people, all of them being the mine owners of the major blood crystal mines in the Bloodless City.</p><p></p><p>Just recently, the Black Mountain Sect had demanded that the mine owners increase the amount of blood crystals they had to hand over, from two-tenths to three-tenths.</p><p></p><p>This had enraged the mine owners.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodless City was not under the jurisdiction of the Black Mountain Sect, and the previous two-tenths was already unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Now, directly increasing it to three-tenths was simply tyrannical.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Old Wang, even if we unite, what can we do? The Black Mountain Sect has the backing of the Black Chicken Demon, and even the three major immortal sects have to show them respect. We scattered cultivators, how can we contend with the Black Mountain Sect? I'm afraid that if we don't increase the share, we won't even be able to return to the Bloodless City."</p><p></p><p>An elderly Qi Condensation cultivator spoke up, his voice filled with resignation.</p><p></p><p>The people present all had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect was capable of such actions.</p><p></p><p>Which of the sect's elders was not a ruthless character? Even that seemingly delicate and pitiful Yuling Long had cultivated her dao through killing before being taken as the Black Chicken Demon's concubine.</p><p></p><p>As for the Black Mountain Sect's disciples, most of them were former bandits, so one could imagine how vicious their personalities were.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, if only a sword immortal would come and destroy the Black Mountain Sect one day, that would be wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the three major sects can't do anything about the Black Mountain Sect, where would a sword immortal come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Wang, keep your voice down, don't let the Black Mountain Sect's people hear you."</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou sat in the cloud rabbit carriage, her heart also filled with melancholy.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, the speed of the cloud rabbit carriage slowed down.</p><p></p><p>The people in the carriage tensed up, thinking they had encountered someone from the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>The curtain was pulled open, and the group saw a handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou was somewhat surprised, as this young man was the one who had been conversing amiably with her mother earlier that day.</p><p></p><p>How was he in the territory of the Black Mountain Sect? And so close to the sect's headquarters? Could it be that he was a disciple of the Black Mountain Sect?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Duan Qianrou felt a sense of disgust. It wasn't her personal bias, but simply because the Black Mountain Sect had no good people!</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, everyone." The newcomer was none other than the just-orphaned Qi Yuan, who looked at the group and slowly said, "May I ask where the Lingxian Pavilion is located nearby?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing that he was just asking for directions, the group let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They had feared he was a disciple of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingxian Pavilion is in Sky Cloud Town." Duan Qianrou replied.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, everyone!" Qi Yuan bowed politely, and inwardly marveled that there were still good people in this world.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou thought of something and couldn't help but ask, "How did you come to be in the Black Mountain Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The others understood that Duan Qianrou and this young man were acquainted, so the matter was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>"I came here... to look at the stars." Qi Yuan's eyes darted, as he was not good at lying, and simply said the first thing that came to mind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter One.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou let out a light chuckle, "I was too abrupt. By the way, the Black Mountain Sect is very dangerous, if it's not necessary, please don't come here."</p><p></p><p>"You're right, this place is too dangerous, I'd better get out of here quickly!" Qi Yuan said, then quickly ran off.</p><p></p><p>Watching Qi Yuan hurry away, the people present all felt somewhat puzzled. "Does the Sect Master Duan know this young man?" Old Wang asked, "His personality is rather interesting."</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't know him," Duan Qianrou denied.</p><p></p><p>The others didn't say anything, just thinking that this woman Duan Qianrou was kind-hearted.</p><p></p><p>This was just a small incident.</p><p></p><p>The people didn't dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>The cloud rabbit carriage sped away.</p><p></p><p>The group soon arrived at the gates of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, the White Bone Bridge is broken?"</p><p></p><p>The people were surprised.</p><p></p><p>To reach the Black Mountain Sect, one must cross the White Bone Bridge.</p><p></p><p>But now, the White Bone Bridge was gone.</p><p></p><p>"Look, what's that?"</p><p></p><p>The people immediately used their Dao techniques to look inside the gates of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the gates of the Black Mountain Sect had collapsed, and inside, there were bodies everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"That's Elder Yuandan..." someone said, their teeth chattering.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mountain Sect has been wiped out!" </p><p></p><p>The people were shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>That was the Black Mountain Sect, the tyrannical Black Mountain Sect! To wipe out the Black Mountain Sect, it must have been at least a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, right?</p><p></p><p>Aren't they afraid of offending the Black Chicken Demon?</p><p></p><p>All eyes suddenly turned to Old Wang, who had just said the Sword Immortal had wiped out the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Old Wang hurriedly waved his hands, "It wasn't me, I didn't do it!"</p><p></p><p>As for Duan Qianrou, she narrowed her eyes, thinking of the young man they had encountered earlier on the road.</p><p></p><p>Did he... see something? The people present all had different thoughts, but they all understood that the Great Liang Kingdom was about to be in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Tian Yun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's pace was faster than usual.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Black Mountain Sect, he suddenly realized that he had not handled the matter properly.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already destroyed the Jade Ling Long, what if there was more than one Violet Bamboo Body in the Black Mountain Sect?</p><p></p><p>What if the Sect Master of the Black Mountain Sect, the Black Wind Daoist, was also a Violet Bamboo Body? The Black Chicken Demon was making another big move, Jade Ling Long was just the openly known Violet Bamboo Body, his adopted son Black Wind Daoist, and even other members of the Black Mountain Sect could be the hidden Violet Bamboo Bodies.</p><p></p><p>He dared not go back to the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>So after much thought, he found a way.</p><p></p><p>That is to spread the news that there are Violet Bamboo Bodies in the Black Mountain Sect! That way, when the Black Chicken Demon comes out of seclusion and arrives at the Black Mountain Sect, he will definitely find nothing but corpses.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of realm breakthrough, even to the Nascent Soul or Purple Palace realm, cultivators can be so crazy, Qi Yuan could hardly imagine.</p><p></p><p>So, he asked along the way for the location of the Ling Tian Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Ling Tian Pavilion is a special existence in the Great Liang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that 80% of the game jade slips, 90% of the projection jade slips, and 50% of the communication jade slips in the Great Liang Kingdom come from the Ling Tian Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>According to Qi Yuan's understanding, this is the equivalent of the "penguin" from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>His purpose in coming to the Ling Tian Pavilion is to use the various jade slip channels of the Ling Tian Pavilion to let the cultivators in the Great Liang Kingdom know that there are Violet Bamboo Bodies in the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>In this way, there will definitely be countless cultivators who will take the risk and go to the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>When the Black Chicken Demon comes out of seclusion and arrives at the Black Mountain Sect to investigate who destroyed the Black Mountain Sect? Investigate what? </p><p></p><p>They are all people! The corpses of the Black Mountain Sect disciples will be scattered all over the country!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

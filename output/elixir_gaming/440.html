        <h1>Chapter 440</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dark Magic Sky, unknown realm, the laws of the great Dao circulate.</p><p></p><p>Eight Great Principles sat in the clouds, their forms invisible. </p><p></p><p>Black flames burned, crackling and popping.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, there seemed to be the sound of thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, six Great Principles gathered together to refine a pill for Blood Shaping and Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>This pill could greatly enhance Black Sword's cultivation progress and shorten his growth time.</p><p></p><p>By order of the supreme elder of the Black Magic Abyss, the Third Elder took the lead, and six Great Principles who could spare themselves consumed their essence to refine it.</p><p></p><p>"Set!" the Third Elder spoke.</p><p></p><p>The black flames danced, burning the surrounding space into collapse, then rapidly reforming.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other five elders all cast out their immortal qi, pouring it into the flames.</p><p></p><p>Under their invisible forms, their expressions all turned pale for a moment, then quickly returned to normal. </p><p></p><p>Even for beings like them, refining the Blood Shaping and Enlightenment pill would damage their essence.</p><p></p><p>The roaring flames burned, and five-colored liquid condensed in the space, then coalesced into a pill under the action of the powerful immortal qi.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, all the Great Principles withdrew their immortal qi.</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder took a deep breath and bowed to the Great Principles concealing their forms in the void: "Thank you all for your efforts!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Principles present nodded slightly, their forms slowly fading away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Third Elder was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a voice called out to stop him: "Third Elder, what about my share?"</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Purple Origin extended his palm, smiling faintly, looking to be in quite a good mood.</p><p></p><p>If this Blood Shaping and Enlightenment pill was given to Blood Robe to consume, that kid's talent would increase another level.</p><p></p><p>His progress in cultivating the "Ancestral Blood Scripture" would also speed up.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that in less than a hundred years, he could surpass Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ancestor Purple Origin was smug, praising himself for his foresight.</p><p></p><p>A troubled expression appeared on the Third Elder's face: "Sixth Elder, the Blood Shaping and Enlightenment pill... I can't give it to you."</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Elder's expression suddenly froze, his gaze turning sharp, and the surrounding space became unstable, as if it could be annihilated at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" </p><p></p><p>The Sixth Elder asked in a deep voice, his expression not very good.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the refinement failed?"</p><p></p><p>"No." The Third Elder shook his head, his expression bitter, "It's Master... He sent down an edict.</p><p></p><p>He knows your temperament quite well, so he deduced that you would definitely ask me for this Blood Shaping and Enlightenment pill.</p><p></p><p>So, the old man transmitted an edict in advance."</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Purple Origin's face darkened, looking very displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Elder, the Ancestor himself issued the order, I have no choice.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, he also said that with the Lin Ya Molt approaching, more resources should be used on Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Our Black Magic Abyss is small, and cannot afford to support two Great Principles who grasp the supreme principles."</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder shook his head, his expression desolate.</p><p></p><p>What the Ancestor said made some sense.</p><p></p><p>According to the current situation in the Six Realms Heaven, the Lin Ya Molt could begin at any time.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the entire Six Realms Heaven would be in turmoil, and the Black Magic Abyss could not stay out of it.</p><p></p><p>They needed to quickly cultivate Black Sword, allowing him to rapidly advance to become a Great Principle grasping the supreme principles.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way would the Black Magic Abyss possibly become a player in the future, gaining some say.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Abyss had limited resources, and if they were dispersed, it would likely slow Black Sword's progress to reaching Great Principle.</p><p></p><p>"I contributed effort to refining this pill!" Ancestor Purple Origin was very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>"Master's edict cannot be violated." The Third Elder sighed.</p><p></p><p>His meaning was very clear - you'll have to take this up with Master.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Purple Origin snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Go to Master? He certainly would not.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, given his temperament, if the two met, it would inevitably lead to a battle.</p><p></p><p>This would be especially disadvantageous for the Purple Origin Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Bring Black Sword here, have him limit his cultivation to Blood Robe's level, let the two compete, and the winner... will receive our Black Magic Abyss's resource support!" Ancestor Purple Origin said loudly.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, Blood Robe far surpassed Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that involved secrets that could not be revealed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Blood Robe would not live past a day.</p><p></p><p>But having Blood Robe defeat Black Sword fair and square to obtain the resources, Ancestor Purple Origin felt there was a slight possibility.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Third Elder's face showed a troubled expression: "Sixth Elder, not to mention that Black Sword's talent is number one in the Black Magic Abyss, Blood Robe simply cannot defeat him.</p><p></p><p>Even if he did win... would Master change his mind? Black Sword shares the same blood as the Black Magic Ancestor, this alone destines him to be our Black Magic Abyss's only... leader!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder naturally did not believe Blood Robe could defeat Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe's talent, even if transferred to the Six Realms Heaven, would definitely be in the top ten.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, Black Sword shared the same blood as the Black Magic Ancestor, his bloodline extremely noble.</p><p></p><p>This point alone would be enough to shake the Six Realms Heaven, let alone both points combined in one person.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ancestor Purple Origin's expression changed several times, and finally he snorted coldly and left with a swish of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>He could only accept this loss.</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder looked at Ancestor Purple Origin's departing figure and sighed deeply: "I hope Black Sword enters the Great Principle realm soon, otherwise... the Black Magic Abyss's disintegration is not far off."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an unnoticed corner of Sky Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes, a flash of gold in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth layer."</p><p></p><p>Having devoured the Black Magic Ancestor's blood and accelerated his cultivation of the "Ancestral Blood Scripture", he had finally quickly entered the ninth layer.</p><p></p><p>The ninth layer of the "Ancestral Blood Scripture" was extremely powerful, enough to make his Ten Thousand Dao Martial God realm cultivation comparable to the Lesser Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>"I've become stronger... and also metal poisoned."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned himself with a glance.</p><p></p><p>This time, the gold in his blood had increased, and even his pupils had gained a streak of gold, looking quite terrifying and grim.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan dyed his blood red again and his eyes black.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can barely protect myself, I can secretly go see who exactly schemed against me!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful strength of the Principle realm gave Qi Yuan a tiny sense of security.</p><p></p><p>His form flashed, and he once again left Sky Cliff, returning to the Six Realms Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In Sky Hanging City.</p><p></p><p>The woman in golden clothes narrowed her eyes, her expression somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Still haven't found Blood Robe?"</p><p></p><p>She was a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>A mere Blood Robe wasn't worth wasting too much of her time on.</p><p></p><p>She planned to kill Blood Robe, refine his soul into a spirit servant to collect in her Ten Thousand Soul Banner, and then run away directly.</p><p></p><p>Of course she had to run away.</p><p></p><p>With a Demon Prince level genius killed, the Yang Spirit of the Purple Origin Heaven would definitely be enraged and come to hunt her down.</p><p></p><p>She only needed to hide in the Ghost Ruling Heaven's territory.</p><p></p><p>Would a Yang Spirit really risk their life to enter the Ghost Ruling Heaven for that Blood Robe?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, our people have laid out a dragnet, there are formations everywhere, as soon as he appears, we will definitely discover him!" the young man said with his head lowered, not daring to look directly at his senior sister.</p><p></p><p>"So he's been hiding somewhere all along, not daring to show himself?" the woman in golden clothes said lightly.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, suddenly a voice filled with killing intent came from not far away.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a man wearing a crimson robe appear, his form blurry, his features unclear.</p><p></p><p>"Have the mastermind behind this come out, I want to see who schemed against me!"</p><p></p><p>"You are Blood Robe?" The woman in golden clothes looked surprised, then delighted, "To sneak in avoiding the formations, you have some skill!"</p><p></p><p>The woman in golden clothes hadn't expected that the Blood Robe she wanted to find would come to her doorstep on his own.</p><p></p><p>"Mastermind behind this? There isn't one, it's me... who wants to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>After the woman in golden clothes finished speaking, she strode forward, her powerful aura sweeping out.</p><p></p><p>She had gone far on the Mythical path, and the aura on her body was not something an ordinary Mythical could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Her strength was far beyond that of Ox...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sister Jiao was even more powerful. As she moved, a terrifying Banner of Ten Thousand Souls appeared.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it seemed as if ghosts were wailing and wolves were howling in the world, countless wronged souls screaming.</p><p></p><p>Demonic energy surged to the sky, soul shadows flickered, dark and eerie.</p><p></p><p>The woman in golden clothes held the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, like an envoy descending from the netherworld.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, remember, the one who kills you... is Mona!"</p><p></p><p>The soul banner waved, and the yin wind roared angrily.</p><p></p><p>Facing Blood Robe, Mona didn't hold back at all, launching her strongest attack right away.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, watching from not far away, stared intently at Mona with a puzzled look on his face: "Is there really no one behind you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, no one!"</p><p></p><p>The soul banner trembled, and countless ghosts screamed sharply.</p><p></p><p>A powerful spiritual attack fell towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The piercing screams of over ten thousand残魂 reverberated in his eardrums, even transmitting to his soul.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "No one? You, a mere myth, dare to ambush me? Who gave you the courage!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan laughed angrily.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, under Mona's horrified gaze, his arm grabbed hold of the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls.</p><p></p><p>With a crack, the powerful Banner of Ten Thousand Souls shattered directly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mona was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The Banner of Ten Thousand Souls... broken? This was the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, her treasure that took 100,000 years to refine! "You..." Her face was shocked, completely uncomprehending.</p><p></p><p>Before she could make any move, an enormous force struck, and a bloody hole suddenly appeared in her chest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand gripped her heart, his voice calm: "Speak quickly, who is the mastermind behind you?"</p><p></p><p>This speed?</p><p>This divine technique? Mona was completely stunned, the power in her body restrained.</p><p></p><p>The sense of pressure Blood Robe gave her reminded her of Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Her face pale, her mind tense, she couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>"Speak quickly, don't force me, I never hit women!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, he was quite chauvinistic.</p><p></p><p>However, Mona's entire body was restrained, and she simply couldn't answer Qi Yuan. But hearing this sentence from Qi Yuan, a glimmer of hope appeared in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... she might still live?</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, you still won't speak!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had completely confirmed that only Mona was ambushing him, with no one behind her.</p><p></p><p>"You scared me, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan directly shattered Mona's soul with his powerful magic.</p><p></p><p>A look of despair appeared on Mona's face. Just before death, she was finally able to transmit a message: "Didn't you say... you don't hit women?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the shattered Mona, Qi Yuan's expression was serious: "When did I hit you? I killed you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>If the other party had said that killing doesn't count as hitting, Qi Yuan still had an ace up his sleeve - he would directly revoke their female status.</p><p></p><p>There were many experiences from the blue planet's beauties.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that many male tourists don't take photos, they directly steal photos of tourist attractions taken by beauties on a certain red book to post on their Moments.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Mona perished.</p><p></p><p>In the hall, seeing this, the cultivators of Ghost Domination Heaven trembled in fear, their faces terrified.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>"What about me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm as he directly struck out, a powerful fist attacking.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the space in the hall collapsed, and all the cultivators of Ghost Domination Heaven perished instantly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Mona's corpse, his gaze cautious: "I need to run quickly, otherwise the Yang Spirit will catch up!"</p><p></p><p>Mona's body bore the mark of a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>With Mona's death, that Yang Spirit would certainly know immediately, and might come to kill.</p><p></p><p>The best option now was to return to Purple Origin Heaven.</p><p></p><p>After all, who knew how strong the Yang Spirit coming from Ghost Domination Heaven would be? Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan's figure entered the transmission formation, heading towards Purple Origin Heaven.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and a terrifying aura swept over Sky Hanging City.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in heaven and earth surged, and an angry voice echoed throughout Sky Hanging City.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>The figure of Heavenly Venerable Mo Xiang appeared in Sky Hanging City. The entire city seemed to shake on the verge of collapse due to her appearance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, all the cultivators were terrified, extremely reverent, bowing their heads with respectful expressions, not daring to show any resistance! This was a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable! When a Heavenly Venerable is angry, how could it be limited to just ten thousand corpses!</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Venerable Mo Xiang looked at Mona's shattered body, dense anger welling up in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a vast amount of information flooded into her mind, and the anger on her face intensified: "Black Demon Abyss... Blood Robe... killed my granddaughter, my dearest loved one, this matter... is not over!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, killed so cleanly, not even a bit of soul left, can't even collect it into the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, such a waste!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, she directly entered the transmission formation.</p><p></p><p>She was going to confront Black Demon Abyss, demanding an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she knew that in the end there wouldn't be any good outcome, and she wouldn't be able to kill Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>But with her granddaughter dead in battle, if she didn't bite a piece of flesh from the other side, her heart wouldn't be at peace.</p><p></p><p>As for face?</p><p></p><p>Did the Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables of Black Demon Abyss and Ghost Domination Heaven... still have any face?</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators in Sky Hanging City, seeing this, were greatly shocked, knowing that something big was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan left the transmission formation and headed straight for Purple Origin Heaven without stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, having the backing of a great power is good."</p><p></p><p>After entering Purple Origin Heaven, Qi Yuan's mind greatly settled.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the enemies Qi Yuan encountered were all too powerful, and the sect he belonged to could hardly shelter him.</p><p></p><p>Now, in Purple Origin Heaven, he actually had such treatment.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan increasingly feel that having the backing of a great sect made it easier to do things.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Blood Robe, you're back, why so anxious?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he returned to Purple Origin Heaven from the transmission formation, Purple Origin Xiao Lu appeared not far from Qi Yuan, clutching the hem of her clothes, looking curious.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I was entangled by a low-class woman, so I had to kill her.</p><p>Who knew that after killing the young one, the old one came, so I quickly ran back here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Purple Origin Xiao Lu was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, An Xun Lu's figure appeared: "Hmph, why didn't you kill the old one too? If Black Sword big brother were here, he would have killed the old one too."</p><p></p><p>Hearing An Xun Lu's words, a look of joy appeared on Qi Yuan's face: "Black Sword can really kill? The old one... seems to have followed!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, An Xun Lu felt somewhat smug inside. Just as she was about to say something, suddenly, outside the sky curtain, a huge roar of anger transmitted, echoing across the sky.</p><p></p><p>"You dare kill my granddaughter Mona, hand over Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Venerable Mo Xiang roared, her voice carrying for ten thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>She stood outside the sky curtain, coming to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, to demand some compensation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, An Xun Lu's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was seen approaching her, lowering his voice to say: "The old one has come, quickly call Black Sword, see if he can kill her?"</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu's face suddenly turned red, and she gritted her teeth saying: "You're dreaming!"</p><p></p><p>This was a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable! This Blood Robe was really bold, actually killing Mona.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes revealing a wary expression.</p><p></p><p>Mona was a famous prodigy of Ghost Domination Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, she was defeated by Black Sword big brother in three sword strikes.</p><p></p><p>But it should be known that even Ice Sword couldn't withstand Black Sword big brother's three strikes.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe was actually able to kill Mona, this strength... might even be a notch above Ice Sword! Beside them, Purple Origin Xiao Lu blinked her eyes: "Senior Brother Blood Robe is so amazing!"</p><p></p><p>She said proudly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was seen saying to An Xun Lu: "Sigh, since Black Sword can't kill, why are you pretending for him? Doesn't he have his own hands?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

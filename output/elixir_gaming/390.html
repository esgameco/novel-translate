        <h1>Chapter 390</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master was half-lying on the ground, unkempt, with a transcendent look in his eyes typical of immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, all the cultivators held their breath as they watched this scene, expressions shocked. </p><p></p><p>That Wine Master was truly daring!</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that the Blood-Robed Sword Saint was a terrifying expert who, according to legend, loved to exterminate entire clans.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he actually had some backing?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Wine Master with a puzzled expression: "Could it be that you can also sing 'Courage'?"</p><p></p><p>As he finished speaking, Qi Yuan directly extended one finger towards the Wine Master.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present tensed up - was a fight about to break out? Was the Blood-Robed Sword Saint testing him? Many of the cultivators began to back away, some fleeing in a flash, afraid of being caught in the crossfire.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had one arm around his junior sister Jiang Lingsu as he casually extended one finger towards the Wine Master.</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master remained half-lying down, looking at Qi Yuan's finger with a leisurely expression: "Young people still can't change their bad habits. Body and soul are just external things. The Yin Spirit is strongest, residing in the divine realm. Who still fights with fists these days?"</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master smiled disdainfully as his powerful divine realm swept out at that moment. </p><p></p><p>He was prepared to teach this arrogant youngster a lesson.</p><p></p><p>He had encountered too many people like this.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly breaking through, rising rapidly, they think they're the protagonist of this world, not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>Little do they know, there's always someone stronger! His divine realm suddenly expanded, and a wine gourd appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Immortal energy swirled around it, purple-green qi boiling, as a river of wine descended from the sky, disappearing into the dust.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the sound of the great Dao, or a treasure from an immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"With this gourd of wine, I can drown the entire Helan Prefecture!" The Wine Master laughed loudly. "Young man, let me give you your first lesson in entering the ranks of the powerful!"</p><p></p><p>His divine realm rapidly spread and expanded.</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master was still half-lying down, but his body seemed lofty and imposing.</p><p></p><p>"The divine realm is the foundation of one's existence. I'll take that finger of yours!"</p><p></p><p>The divine realm suddenly rushed towards Qi Yuan, enveloping him within it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression didn't change. He looked down at Jiang Lingsu beside him and said calmly: "Junior sister, this is how you crush an ant."</p><p></p><p>His hand reached forward.</p><p></p><p>It pierced straight through the river of wine.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine realm seemed defenseless, allowing his finger to penetrate it.</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master was stunned, his eyes narrowing: "You have some skill. Have you forged your divine realm into your body? But... that's all there is to it!"</p><p></p><p>"Watch as I open my divine realm to 60% power!"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, young man. You have some tricks. But I'm not even at full strength yet!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me go to 70%... 100%!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... something's not right. You're not normal!"</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master kept talking, his expression changing from disdain to terror.</p><p></p><p>Because that finger seemed impervious to all techniques.</p><p></p><p>His powerful divine realm, which could easily trap a great expert, couldn't harm that finger in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>That finger seemed to be the only thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>It was like the finger of a god erasing all living beings!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wine Master suddenly felt like an ant facing a human's descending finger! He had no way to resist, nor any ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>He truly panicked.</p><p></p><p>"It's a misunderstanding! You can't kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"Without me, you'll surely die, unable to survive the next great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he dropped all pretenses.</p><p></p><p>He laid his cards on the table.</p><p></p><p>He had backing, he had confidence, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint wouldn't dare kill him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan didn't seem to hear his voice or his cries at all.</p><p></p><p>One finger descended, as if it were the only thing in heaven and earth, in all the realms.</p><p></p><p>The divine realm shattered instantly, and the Wine Master's body and soul were torn apart in that moment.</p><p></p><p>A disdainful voice sounded in the Wine Master's ear.</p><p></p><p>"The biggest difference between you and an ant is that when I crush an ant, it doesn't cry out. You do."</p><p></p><p>This was the last sound the Wine Master heard in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His body shattered, his soul extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Even in death, he didn't understand why Qi Yuan was so strong, or why... he had killed him directly? Shouldn't he have asked who was behind him, what backing he had?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he could only die with regrets.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present were all breathing rapidly, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they had witnessed a battle between gods! There was none of the expected grand spectacle, not even the street-destroying power of Yuandan cultivators or the house-shattering force of Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>One finger had annihilated a powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>They clearly felt that the finger seemed utterly ordinary.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the Wine Master's divine realm had given them a sense of invincibility, truly seeming capable of drowning Helan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Yet he had died at the hands of the Blood-Robed Sword Saint just like that.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Blood-Robed Sword Saint was truly on another level! Jiang Lingsu blinked, feeling somewhat pleased inside.</p><p></p><p>She had long had some guesses about her senior brother's identity.</p><p></p><p>However, she had never actively tried to expose it.</p><p></p><p>If senior brother didn't say anything, then... she would pretend not to know.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was a bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>If senior brother really was an supreme expert like the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, would he still acknowledge her as his junior sister?</p><p></p><p>Now, senior brother had voluntarily revealed himself in front of her, holding her while slaying a powerful enemy. This was a sign of trust in her.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was beating fast. Even through her... ahem, large chest, she could still hear it clearly.</p><p></p><p>However, she still said softly: "Senior brother, why didn't you let him finish speaking? Maybe there really was some powerful figure behind him?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had heard the Wine Master's final cries.</p><p></p><p>She was a bit worried for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That Wine Master clearly had some background and status.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "If an ant says before dying that more ants will come to avenge it, do you think I would care?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to care about the Wine Master at all.</p><p></p><p>He was just a clown, killing him was no big deal.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu's eyes lit up with a bright smile: "Senior brother is... too strong!"</p><p></p><p>"I am quite strong, but alas... also very poor." Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the pale-faced Wang Yunteng. "Hand over the 1.05 billion spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting trembled, not daring to move at all.</p><p></p><p>She never could have imagined that the person she had looked down upon was actually the legendary Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>The one who had easily destroyed the Palace of Light and killed Yin Spirits like dogs.</p><p></p><p>He had even wiped out the Phoenix Clan, the number one family in Cloud Sky City.</p><p></p><p>"This junior was deceived by that scoundrel. I originally thought he was truly friends with the Sword Saint, which is why..." The previously arrogant Divine Infant True Lord knelt down at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting also hurriedly knelt, seemingly begging Qi Yuan for mercy.</p><p></p><p>She was truly frightened.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you know him or were deceived by him is irrelevant to me. I came here today to borrow money!" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>His words fell on the ears of all the cultivators in the hall, shaking their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng quickly said: "Please give this one some time, senior. The 1.05 billion spirit stones will certainly be handed over!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, only by giving up their family fortune could they preserve their lives.</p><p></p><p>Given the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's personality, they felt fortunate that he hadn't wiped out their entire clan and was only asking for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded, looking at the two of them with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You two are a perfect match. You must lock yourselves together for me and never break up." Everyone present was a bit confused, feeling that Qi Yuan's words were strange.</p><p></p><p>When Wang Yunteng heard this, his expression froze briefly. Then, he took out a magical item from his storage bag - it was a lock.</p><p></p><p>He immediately used the lock to lock himself and Qiong Yunting together.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, senior. The key has been thrown away. We're locked together for good."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was a bit stunned. </p><p></p><p>These cultivators in the immortal world were quite dramatic.</p><p></p><p>They really locked themselves together.</p><p></p><p>"Also, remember to clean your ears, otherwise your hearing will suffer!" Qi Yuan kindly reminded them again.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qiong Yunting was no longer embarrassed and angry, but instead said joyfully: "We'll clean them right away, immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Blood-Robed Sword Saint implying he wouldn't kill her with those words?</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a regretful voice rang out unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't have killed Wine Master."</p><p></p><p>Everyone immediately looked over to see a woman in yellow robes walking gracefully through the main entrance.</p><p></p><p>Her figure was enchanting, with beautiful curves.</p><p></p><p>But what attracted the most attention was her face.</p><p></p><p>Rather than a face, it was more like a piece of paper - a piece of paper with a face drawn on it, but without any facial features.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this woman, the cultivators present felt a chill in their hearts, and expressions of fear and wariness appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Painter, it's you!" Jiang Lingsu was also very surprised.</p><p></p><p>Because this woman before them was the strange painter she had recommended to her senior brother.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed the strange painter actually knew Wine Master.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... an enemy? Wariness immediately appeared in Jiang Lingsu's eyes as she looked at the strange painter.</p><p></p><p>Although she knew the strange painter, she still understood what was important.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, she had a good relationship with her senior brother, so she needed to be on the same side as him and face the enemy together.</p><p></p><p>She wasn't like certain people who couldn't figure out relationships.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter glanced at Jiang Lingsu: "I didn't expect that after so many years without seeing you, you would have such an extraordinary encounter. Truly worthy of being..."</p><p></p><p>She didn't finish the rest of her sentence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the strange painter, his expression calm: "So you're the very skilled painter my junior sister recommended. Do you have time to paint a picture for me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>He had come here to find the strange painter to paint for him.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter looked at Qi Yuan with an odd expression: "You should have understood what I said earlier. I knew Wine Master."</p><p></p><p>"Oh..." Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly, "What, are you here to avenge him?"</p><p></p><p>The strange painter shook her head: "I've long since had no connection to them.</p><p></p><p>I just think that what you should be considering right now is not finding me to paint, but escaping, because you've brought trouble upon yourself by killing Wine Master."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan became interested, "What kind of trouble?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the strange painter waved her plain hand, using it to draw a door here.</p><p></p><p>"It concerns heavenly secrets that cannot be revealed. Why don't you come to my residence to discuss?"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the strange painter's body entered the door she had drawn, and her figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes carrying a hint of worry.</p><p></p><p>If she had known earlier, she wouldn't have brought her senior brother to meet this strange painter.</p><p></p><p>This strange painter seemed quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, junior sister. We'll go take a look together."</p><p></p><p>His right eyebrow didn't twitch. Qi Yuan's hand smoothly encircled Jiang Lingsu's slender waist, pulling her whole body close to him.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's heart suddenly started racing. She didn't resist and felt somewhat happy.</p><p></p><p>Her senior brother was bringing her along to discuss such matters.</p><p></p><p>Then Qi Yuan, holding Jiang Lingsu, also entered that door.</p><p></p><p>The door also disappeared after Qi Yuan entered, leaving behind only a group of shocked and alarmed guests.</p><p></p><p>The events that had occurred today were too shocking.</p><p></p><p>It was more than all the major events that had happened in their lives combined.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan, holding Jiang Lingsu, descended from the air.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu also left Qi Yuan's embrace, her face a bit flushed and her heart racing.</p><p></p><p>She looked around, curiosity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>All around them was a vast expanse of white.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were pieces of paper everywhere.</p><p></p><p>These pieces of paper were either hung on racks or suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>In the middle was an area for drying paintings, while around the edges were rivers of various colors - black, red, green, and other hues, even white, as well as colors invisible to the human eye. The rivers were like paint.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the strange painter was sitting on a small stool in front of a white river, seemingly painting.</p><p></p><p>"You've arrived?" </p><p></p><p>The strange painter's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan brought Jiang Lingsu over: "Can you tell me now? I want to see just how many ants there are."</p><p></p><p>The ants he referred to were naturally Wine Master, as well as Wine Master's associates, and even those behind him.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Qi Yuan's description, the strange painter drew a frown on the featureless face on her paper: "You have always made it your mission to resist the great calamity. You should understand that as long as one's name is recorded on the Mythical Monument, they become nourishment."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Correct."</p><p></p><p>As long as one enters the realm of myth, they will appear on the Mythical Monument, and then be harvested by the great calamity, becoming nourishment.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity only harvests those in the mythical realm, so for us, as long as we don't break through into the mythical realm, we... won't be harvested.</p><p></p><p>However, the great calamity isn't so rigid. It will even pay special attention to some talented pigs.</p><p></p><p>After those pigs enter the Yin Spirit realm, they will encounter many fortuitous events, their strength increasing rapidly. Even if they want to suppress it, they can't. In the end, they even inexplicably enter the mythical realm, becoming nourishment."</p><p></p><p>As the strange painter spoke, she looked at Qi Yuan more.</p><p></p><p>In her view, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint was one of those pigs raised by the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"There have been many, many such pigs throughout history.</p><p></p><p>They all think that they are exceptionally talented, favored by heaven, the destined protagonists, capable of resisting the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Little do they know that they are actually just the king of pigs among all the pigs raised by the great calamity. Once they fatten up, they are sent to the butcher."</p><p></p><p>The strange painter spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu seemed to have understood something as well.</p><p></p><p>She felt some worry for Qi Yuan in her heart.</p><p></p><p>But she knew that her strength was weak, and her knowledge naturally limited. At this time, it was best to keep quiet and not speak carelessly, adding trouble for her senior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. So those who resist are pigs. Then what about you?" Qi Yuan chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>He had actually seen long ago that Wine Master and this painter were different from ordinary great experts.</p><p></p><p>"We... are pigs who escape."</p><p></p><p>There was a look of loss in the strange painter's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Once, we were like you, full of vigor, believing ourselves to be the protagonists of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Until later, we witnessed the terrifying nature of the great calamity, and how deep the waters were. We felt somewhat desperate.</p><p></p><p>Because we couldn't even suppress our own realms. Our realms kept increasing crazily, heading towards the mythical realm!"</p><p></p><p>Speaking to this point, the strange painter drew a mocking expression on her own face.</p><p></p><p>"When we can't even control our own realms, how can we talk about resisting the great calamity? Fortunately, we met a benefactor. Her name was Jade Maiden. She passed down a secret technique that allows us to become an alternative type of mythical being."</p><p></p><p>The strange painter spoke, her voice desolate.</p><p></p><p>As an alternative type of mythical being, one's name would not be recorded on the Mythical Monument, and they would not be harvested by the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

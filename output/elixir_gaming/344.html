        <h1>Chapter 344</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He tossed the rope in his hand, tying up the man and woman separately in the black cloth bags.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan handed the rope to Huo Mushi and instructed: "You lead these two. We're going to... Mount Xianlong now!"</p><p></p><p>Mount Xianlong was over 300 li away from Mount Shuyao.</p><p></p><p>On that mountain, the number of demons was no less than on Mount Shuyao, perhaps even more.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to Mount Shuyao, the demons on Mount Xianlong were not organized and seemed very scattered.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Huo Mushi gripped the rope tightly, looking excited.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the demon and human covered in black cloth with their mouths sealed had a thousand thoughts racing through their minds. Especially the flower demon, who was completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Who had come? </p><p></p><p>What did they want? Why had they tied her up?</p><p></p><p>She desperately wanted to speak, but couldn't utter a word.</p><p></p><p>However, the conversation between the two that followed shocked her even more.</p><p></p><p>"My hand is sore from gripping the staff all night. I really want to call my wife over to massage it."</p><p></p><p>"My lord... you're so mighty!"</p><p></p><p>"After we slaughter the thousands of demons on Mount Xianlong this time, I'll keep two beautiful female demons to give me a massage before killing them."</p><p></p><p>"My lord... you're so formidable!"</p><p></p><p>In any case, Huo Mushi was like a parrot, only able to offer praise.</p><p></p><p>The flower demon, covered by the black bag, heard Qi Yuan's words and felt contempt in her heart.</p><p></p><p>This guy was really boasting too much! Slaughter all the demons on Mount Xianlong?</p><p></p><p>If you're so amazing, why don't you pluck the stars from the sky? But before she could think much more, she heard that detestable person bragging again.</p><p></p><p>"Mushi, do you have any good ways to make money?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... does my lord need money?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, a little short."</p><p></p><p>"If my lord returns to Zhenyang, the county magistrate will surely gather the resources of the whole city to raise funds for you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had slaughtered all the demons on Mount Shuyao, which was a life-saving grace for the people of Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qi Yuan raised a flag in rebellion,</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate and sheriff would likely approve with both hands raised.</p><p></p><p>What's a bit of silver compared to that?</p><p></p><p>"It's not enough money. I want to buy a planet, like Gongxing."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Huo Mushi fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he still couldn't keep up with Qi Yuan's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times of this world, the concept of planets already existed.</p><p></p><p>The common people also knew they lived on the surface of a planet.</p><p></p><p>So when he heard Qi Yuan say he wanted to buy a planet, Huo Mushi was speechless.</p><p></p><p>The flower demon in the black bag wanted to laugh coldly.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity you can't find a buyer in this world of yours. Otherwise if I sold it, I could definitely make a lot of money!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the flower demon felt Qi Yuan was even more arrogant and ignorant.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's power was too strong. He had restrained her and prevented her from speaking.</p><p></p><p>Unable to escape or argue back, she could only become a prisoner.</p><p></p><p>The flower demon's heart was filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>There must be a reason these two had captured her.</p><p></p><p>Were they after money or lust, or had they come for Tong Tianyou?</p><p></p><p>They should at least interrogate her.</p><p></p><p>But these two seemed to have forgotten about her and Tong Tianyou.</p><p></p><p>They just kept traveling.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the childlike follower feeding Tong Tianyou once along the way, she would have thought they had completely forgotten about the two of them.</p><p></p><p>She just wanted to say: "I may be a demon, but I need to eat too!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she couldn't speak, and Huo Mushi had never fed her.</p><p></p><p>Now she only hoped they would reach Mount Xianlong quickly, and these two arrogant and conceited people would die at the hands of other demons.</p><p></p><p>That way, she could be rescued, and also... pee!...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, as Qi Yuan was heading from Mount Shuyao to Mount Xianlong,</p><p></p><p>The people from the Demon Suppression Department in Zhenyang City were gradually making their way to Mount Shuyao.</p><p></p><p>In recent days, they had figured out most of the mission and learned that Tong Tianyou was in the hands of the flower demon Manlo.</p><p></p><p>As long as they went to Wind Flower Cave and found the flower demon Manlo,</p><p></p><p>Everything would come to light.</p><p></p><p>The only two dangers of this mission were possibly encountering other powerful demons on Mount Shuyao, and the threat posed by the flower demon Manlo herself.</p><p></p><p>So these people from the Demon Suppression Department were all carefully making their way through Mount Shuyao, just to find Wind Flower Cave and locate the flower demon Manlo and Tong Tianyou.</p><p></p><p>At this moment on Mount Shuyao, Yang Guang was wearing a wild boar skin, disguised as a pig demon.</p><p></p><p>He sniffed the air and revealed a strange expression: "Strange, why do I smell such a strong scent of blood?"</p><p></p><p>"You're not a dog. Leave this to the professionals." An Qiao shook the rope.</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog reluctantly came over.</p><p></p><p>"Actually I think he's quite dog-like and professional too."</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog spoke venomously as usual.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang glared angrily at the tracking dog and said irritably: "Be careful or I'll catch a male dog demon to mate with you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the tracking dog immediately tucked its tail between its legs and didn't dare talk back.</p><p></p><p>"Also smell for Mr. Qi's scent and see if you can find where he is so we can rescue him!" An Qiao said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Now, Mr. Qi was also trapped somewhere on Mount Shuyao.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, he might be surrounded by demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>If they could find and rescue Mr. Qi, that would be good.</p><p></p><p>"Right, we need to find Brother Qi. I promised to protect him!" Now that Yang Guang's blood energy had recovered, he regained his confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, got it."</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog spoke as it put its nose to the ground and started sniffing hard.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang waited quietly. The strong smell of blood made him uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the tracking dog's tail stood straight up and its eyes showed human-like terror: "Blood... so much blood. I smell mountains of corpses and seas of blood!"</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog spoke as it raised its head to look north with a terrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"What?" An Qiao quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Over there... there's blood everywhere. It's hell for demons!" The tracking dog looked north, its eyes full of horror.</p><p></p><p>"That's the demon camp!" Yang Guang looked in the direction the dog was facing with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that a major incident had occurred on Mount Shuyao?</p><p></p><p>"What about Mr. Qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Not good, Mr. Qi's scent is in there too!" The tracking dog shouted.</p><p></p><p>"What? No, I promised to protect Mr. Qi!" Yang Guang's heart tightened, fearing Qi Yuan had already met with misfortune.</p><p></p><p>After all, connecting what the tracking dog said, it was very possible that Qi Yuan had been surrounded in the demon camp and engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>That would explain the strong smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>"I must go take a look!" Yang Guang was still very true to his word.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>From summer to autumn, and then to winter.</p><p></p><p>For many insects, it was already a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>For travelers on the road, it was a year of busyness, and joy and worry when returning home.</p><p></p><p>This year, too many things had happened in Fengyuan.</p><p></p><p>The Four Seasons Restaurant was located on the banks of the Xi River. The Xi River, which separated north and south, was covered in thick ice.</p><p></p><p>The flags of the Four Seasons Restaurant fluttered in the cold wind, and goose feather-like snowflakes swirled about.</p><p></p><p>Despite the bitter cold outside, it was warm and steamy inside the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Diners held large bowls, drinking wine and eating meat, listening intently to the storyteller's passionate words.</p><p></p><p>"That day, storm clouds gathered and dark clouds pressed down on the mountains.</p><p></p><p>The lizards of Mount Xianlong..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it was a demon king, three hundred zhang tall. When it turned over, the entire Xianlong Mountain would quake! </p><p></p><p>When it flew up to the sky, it would block out the sun, and Xianlong Mountain would turn dark!"</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the details. No matter how strong this Lizard King was, wasn't it still killed by the Red Staff Demon Slayer?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget about Xianlong Mountain, I want to hear about the Red Staff Demon Slayer's battle with Princess Jasmine."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, rumor has it that when Princess Jasmine heard the Red Staff Demon Slayer was coming, she immediately held a wedding ceremony, wanting to marry him!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a demon, how could she be worthy of the Red Staff Demon Slayer!" A young woman in a traditional dress spoke up, her voice full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>"I guess only the most beautiful woman in Fengyuan, that young Empress Zhou, would be worthy of the Red Staff Demon Slayer!"</p><p></p><p>"Watch your words, she's the Empress!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if the Red Staff Demon Slayer wanted to be Emperor, I'd rebel and follow him right now! Back then, when demon soldiers were running rampant, that boy emperor led those noble families to flee south, abandoning the people of the north. They claimed to be preserving the seeds of culture, but what's the point of preserving culture when there are no people left? Bah!"</p><p></p><p>"The Red Staff Demon Slayer is a real man. In just one short year, he fought across 3000 li, slaughtering tens of thousands of demon soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"If I could marry the Red Staff Demon Slayer, I'd be willing to stay young forever!"</p><p></p><p>In the tavern, young men and women gathered, drinking and chatting happily.</p><p></p><p>So many things had happened over the past year.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the most eye-catching was undoubtedly the Red Staff Demon Slayer.</p><p></p><p>His origins were unknown, his name was unknown. Wielding a red wooden staff, he had routed the demon armies of the north.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, corpses would pile up for thousands of li!</p><p></p><p>His strength was so great that he could fight thousands of demon soldiers alone, like an undefeated god of death.</p><p></p><p>He created one legend after another.</p><p></p><p>At first, when news spread that the Red Staff Demon Slayer had single-handedly annihilated 3000 demon soldiers at Shu Demon Mountain, the world was shocked, but most people were skeptical and didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could there be such a powerful expert in this world who could fight 3000 demon soldiers alone? Even the number one martial artist in the Fengyuan Imperial Court couldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>After all, 3000 demon soldiers led by demon kings could even kill Martial Spirits.</p><p></p><p>But... the Red Staff Demon Slayer did it.</p><p></p><p>How was it possible!</p><p></p><p>But later, the demon forces at Xianlong Mountain, Wind Valley Ridge, Crown Prince River and other places were successively wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Eyewitnesses all saw a handsome young man in a blood-red robe wielding a blood-colored staff, like a demon god.</p><p></p><p>The world was shaken, everyone was shocked, and no one dared to doubt anymore.</p><p></p><p>"In just one short year, eleven of the twelve demon lairs in the world have been destroyed. The Red Staff Demon Slayer... is terrifyingly strong!" An old man said in a trembling voice. Judging by his clothes and appearance, he was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was also sitting in the main hall of the tavern.</p><p></p><p>"Only the Xi River Demon remains... I wonder when the Red Staff Demon Slayer will come?"</p><p></p><p>"Once the Xi River Demon is destroyed, there will be peace in the world, and our human race will prosper!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's not necessarily true. Do you think after the Red Staff Demon Slayer kills the Xi River Demon, he won't want to become Emperor?</p><p></p><p>I think he's ambitious and wants to seize power! All this talk of being a demon-slaying war god and doing it for the greater good of the world, he's just an ordinary person like us." A low voice came from the corner.</p><p></p><p>However, he used a special sound transmission technique, so no one present knew who had spoken.</p><p></p><p>In a private room upstairs, a young girl heard this and couldn't help but open the window and angrily shouted: "You're overly critical of good people but tolerant of evil ones. Are you even human? If you're a man, show yourself!"</p><p></p><p>However, the person who had spoken earlier didn't say anything more, hiding in a dark corner.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a great scholar in the tavern couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The other customers grumbled, feeling dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Although the Red Staff Demon Slayer had killed demons and monsters, with achievements that would last for a thousand years, there were many conspiracy theories about him.</p><p></p><p>People in the world like to be overly critical of good people, accusing them of having ulterior motives when they do good deeds, or saying their methods are wrong. But when it comes to evil people, they feel sympathy and are overly tolerant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a calm voice suddenly came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"There are even keyboard warriors here, and I happened to run into them. What good luck."</p><p></p><p>The tavern door opened, and a cold wind blew in, sounding like the wail of a devil.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes like goose feathers blew in, and the people in the main hall of the tavern looked over and immediately saw a handsome young man wearing a blood-red robe and holding a wooden staff.</p><p></p><p>These diners looked at this excessively handsome man with surprised expressions, some with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of this person was quite similar to the Red Staff Demon Slayer! However, the Red Staff Demon Slayer's fame was at its peak now, and many young nobles were wearing red robes to imitate him.</p><p></p><p>This person looked extremely young, with delicate skin, not like the kind of man who often killed demons.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence in the tavern.</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man walked in, followed by a boy who looked very young but seemed to have experienced a lot.</p><p></p><p>The boy was holding a rope in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Following the direction of the rope, there were two figures covered in black bags.</p><p></p><p>When they noticed the black bags and figures, some diners' throats moved.</p><p></p><p>Others widened their eyes, showing disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"The Red... Staff Demon Slayer!"</p><p></p><p>"He's the Red Staff Demon Slayer!"</p><p></p><p>There was a commotion in the tavern.</p><p></p><p>In the private room, the young girl in her early teens couldn't help but lean out to look at this legendary figure, to see if he was as the legends described.</p><p></p><p>When she saw Qi Yuan's profile, she was stunned.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a peerlessly handsome person in this world.</p><p></p><p>As if he wasn't human.</p><p></p><p>"Talking bad about me, and I caught you. Your luck is really bad."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on a fat, wealthy merchant, his eyes calm.</p><p></p><p>The merchant's face suddenly changed: "It wasn't me, I didn't!"</p><p></p><p>He was denying it.</p><p></p><p>The man next to the merchant also quickly said: "Master Wu is a great philanthropist who donates money to build roads. He would never slander the great Red Staff Demon Slayer!"</p><p></p><p>The people in the tavern looked at the merchant with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>This merchant had a very good reputation in the city and was known as a leading philanthropist.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, several others couldn't help but speak up for the merchant.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Red Staff Demon Slayer was a great hero, how could he be so petty, and he would surely listen to reason.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the merchant also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also secretly warned himself to be more careful in the future and never let anyone catch him making a mistake again.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Yuan's lips curled into a smile: "Mushi, play some music."</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi took out a suona oboe skillfully, and immediately, a desolate and sorrowful sound rose in the tavern.</p><p></p><p>A look of terror appeared on the merchant's face as he realized something: "You can't!"</p><p></p><p>But what greeted him was a blood-red wooden staff.</p><p></p><p>The staff struck directly on the top of his head, like smashing a watermelon.</p><p></p><p>The merchant's head shattered like a ripe watermelon.</p><p></p><p>There was silence in the tavern, with only the sound of the suona still playing.</p><p></p><p>Among the diners, there was surprise, fear, and also those who felt it was satisfying.</p><p></p><p>"How to relieve worry? Only by... killing people!" Qi Yuan put down his staff, his voice cheerful.</p><p></p><p>Those who had initially felt satisfied, upon hearing this sentence, also felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Red Staff Demon Slayer's tone didn't sound like he was pretending.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

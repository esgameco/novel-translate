        <h1>Chapter 148</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master quickly went offline after speaking.</p><p></p><p>The group chat immediately became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Rogue Immortal Master who was always online, the Great Sun Emperor and Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady were only online occasionally.</p><p></p><p>He opened the forum and immediately saw the post made by his alt account Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Below it, there were many new comments.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you really came!"</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light has committed many evil deeds, they deserve to be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"It's best to minimize taking action, in case you get surrounded by the Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light. </p><p></p><p>After all, the Palace of Light has strength in numbers, and Cuiyun Province is their stronghold. Senior Blood Robe Sword God should still be cautious."</p><p></p><p>"This old man also has a grudge against the Palace of Light. Blood Robe Sword God, do you want to meet with us to jointly attack the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>Below were all kinds of comments.</p><p></p><p>Some cheered "666", some advised Blood Robe Sword God to be careful.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, Blood Robe Sword God is my alt account. Otherwise I could openly say, with my Heavenly Dao Foundation and Star Golden Core, would I fear the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qi Yuan used his main account to reply to this post.</p><p></p><p>"I, Origin Celestial Venerable, with Heavenly Dao Foundation and Star Golden Core, openly support senior Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>If senior needs it, my Golden Core in the heavens is available for senior to borrow."</p><p></p><p>After replying, Qi Yuan felt very pleased: "When the people of the Palace of Light see my reply, they must be trembling in fear!"</p><p></p><p>After all, even a Star Golden Core cultivator came to support Blood Robe Sword God, how could the Palace of Light resist?</p><p></p><p>However, after a while, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>There were several new replies below the post.</p><p></p><p>"I, with my Immortal Elixir Golden Core, openly support Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"I, with my million Golden Cores, openly support Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"I, with my Nine Transformations Golden Core, openly support Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stared at these in disbelief: "Even large intestines can be cultivated into Golden Cores?"</p><p></p><p>Then his eyes focused: "Those who follow the Dao gain many supporters, those who lose the Dao have few helpers. Blood Robe Sword God will surely succeed in this matter!"</p><p></p><p>With so many terrifying Golden Cores supporting Blood Robe Sword God, maybe even Kidney Stone Golden Cores and Quantum Golden Cores, Blood Robe Sword God was bound to win! Qi Yuan switched to his alt account Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"With everyone's support, I, Blood Robe Sword God, will go kill some more Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light to liven things up."</p><p></p><p>He specifically replied to Nine Transformations Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>A female cultivator widened her eyes, her face showing signs of crying.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, don't reply to me!"</p><p></p><p>She had just imitated the previous comments to reply, but ended up getting a response.</p><p></p><p>Now it looked as if Blood Robe Sword God was instigated by her to go kill the Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light was considered a top power in the entire Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>This female cultivator naturally didn't dare to truly offend them.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light won't come after me, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not in the Eastern Lands now, so it should be fine."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the female cultivator breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wore a blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli followed behind him, his expression numb.</p><p></p><p>Just earlier, he had followed Blood Robe Sword God to another stronghold of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>When the suona horn sounded, Purple Mansion cultivators entered their coffins.</p><p></p><p>That stronghold had five Purple Mansion cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a relatively large stronghold of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it was easily slaughtered by Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The most difficult Purple Mansion cultivator to kill was easier for Blood Robe Sword God to kill than a Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli's body was now trembling.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had gone down a path of no return and could no longer separate himself from Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... do you have any plans to deal with the Palace of Light?" Xu Yeli had to consider his own future now.</p><p></p><p>For a powerful person like Blood Robe Sword God, even if he completely offended the Palace of Light,</p><p></p><p>At worst he could just leave without consequences.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli understood that even if all three Palace Masters of the Palace of Light came out together, they couldn't stop Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>And as Blood Robe Sword God continued to slaughter Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light outside,</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light would start to withdraw and return to headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of Purple Mansion cultivators, plus the three Palace Masters, would defend the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Robe Sword God dared to go there, he would surely die.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yeli understood that this feud between Blood Robe Sword God and the Palace of Light was about to end.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't have Blood Robe Sword God's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Deal with the Palace of Light?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan casually said, "I've already formulated a 100-day plan to destroy the Palace of Light, it will soon be accomplished."</p><p></p><p>Now, he continued to sweep through the Purple Mansion cultivators outside.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light would definitely contract and return to the Palace of Light headquarters.</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's opportunity.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't gathered together, to be honest... it would be quite difficult to kill them.</p><p></p><p>After all, if a Purple Mansion cultivator wanted to hide, it wouldn't be easy for Qi Yuan to find them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Xu Yeli coughed: "I'll await senior's good news then."</p><p></p><p>A plan to destroy the Palace of Light? Xu Yeli naturally didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Without Yin Spirits appearing, who could destroy the Palace of Light? He was worried and felt the future was bleak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan of course didn't know Xu Yeli's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew, it wouldn't matter to him.</p><p></p><p>After killing five old and charming moonlight beauties, Qi Yuan had reaped a full harvest this time.</p><p></p><p>After returning to his cave dwelling, he quickly logged into his alt account and entered the Divine Flower Society forum again to make another post.</p><p></p><p>"Killed Five Purple Mansion Cultivators, Congratulations to All Fellow Daoists!"</p><p></p><p>"I, Blood Robe Sword God, view evil with hatred and have executed Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>I never expected that when I posted a few days ago, I would receive so much support from fellow Daoists.</p><p></p><p>Thank you 'Lingshan Wenfeng', 'Fox Den Little Li', 'Dragon Tiger Daoist', 'Origin Celestial Venerable'... for your support."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listed the IDs of everyone in the forum who had voiced support for him.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that he couldn't tag them.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely the support of these fellow Daoists that makes me believe justice will surely defeat darkness.</p><p></p><p>I lay awake at night, always remembering the encouragement of these fellow Daoists, and went out overnight to execute five more Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>These five Purple Mansion cultivators did not die by my hand, Blood Robe Sword God, but by the hands of all the fellow Daoists supporting me, they died for the great righteousness of the world!"</p><p></p><p>After posting, Qi Yuan felt the last paragraph was very well-written.</p><p></p><p>Not taking credit, but deepening the theme, going from small to big, it was the ending of a perfect score high school exam essay.</p><p></p><p>After posting, Qi Yuan was very pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a comment appeared.</p><p></p><p>Fox Den Little Li: "Senior, it wasn't me, I didn't do it!"</p><p></p><p>In her cave dwelling, the female cultivator was gesticulating wildly, looking at the content of the post with shock and unease.</p><p></p><p>The big shot killed five more Purple Mansion cultivators? Why did the big shot mention my name?</p><p></p><p>Wuwu... the Palace of Light won't come after me, right?</p><p></p><p>"I remember your Nine Transformations Large Intestine Golden Core clearly, I won't mistake you.</p><p></p><p>Destroying the Palace of Light, you all played a part!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>He had to protect his die-hard fans.</p><p></p><p>Fox Den Little Li was completely at a loss, she wanted to play dead.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and more and more people replied.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... is truly strong, your strength is probably in the top 20 of the Eastern Lands."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder senior is so carefree, you don't take the Palace of Light seriously at all."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, as long as you don't directly confront the Palace of Light, they can't do anything to you!"</p><p></p><p>Now, the replies to Qi Yuan's post became even more cheerful.</p><p></p><p>There were even many people offering strategies to Qi Yuan on how to destroy the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I have a plan that can help you destroy the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Senior just needs to leave the Eastern Lands, find a place to seclude yourself for ten thousand years, when you emerge you will definitely be able to destroy the Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>"The Third Palace Master of the Palace of Light is a peerless beauty.</p><p></p><p>If I were senior, I would definitely make peace with the Palace of Light, then persuade the Third Palace Master to become your Dao companion.</p><p></p><p>Treat the Palace of Light as your harem, and to win senior over, the Palace of Light would naturally send more Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>Senior just needs to sow seeds and give birth every day. As long as you have many children and blessings, in a few thousand years, won't the Palace of Light become senior's backyard?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at these comments, Qi Yuan seemed to gain something, sometimes his eyes lit up, feeling he had gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Who says there are no sleeping dragons and young phoenixes in other worlds, these people... are all great talents!"</p><p></p><p>Especially that excellent plan of having children and usurping the nest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt it had high feasibility.</p><p></p><p>And it also sounded very exciting.</p><p></p><p>But then he remembered that Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady and junior sister were still borrowing high-interest loans from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>He had to ignore these brilliant strategies.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light must be destroyed within 100 days!</p><p></p><p>How could he casually change a plan that had already been formulated?</p><p></p><p>He wasn't a boss, nor was he a client.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan switched to his main account to bump the thread.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God, if you encounter any problems in destroying the Palace of Light, come find me, one of the Four Emperors of the Divine Flower Society. I'll lend you my Star Golden Core to use!"</p><p></p><p>He was showing off his Golden Core again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan noticed his contact list flashing.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Girl had sent him a message.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, are you really going to show me?"</p><p></p><p>He thought excitedly and opened the message from his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, I heard that recently, you've been dual cultivating with a man for half an hour every day?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother... being obsessed with games is fine, just don't be obsessed with other things."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, senior brother, what's so good about men?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these messages. </p><p></p><p>He was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"This Jiang Ya looks quiet and elegant, like a lofty immortal, how can she love to gossip so much?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu knew about these things, no doubt told by Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, don't misunderstand. Although I am dual cultivating with Xu Tongchen, it's proper dual cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"He has awakened the True Solar Fire, and I observe it daily, wanting to learn it."</p><p></p><p>"Your senior brother is a married man, how could I possibly be interested in men?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>If it were other misunderstandings, he really wouldn't bother to explain.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of misunderstanding must be explained!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leaving the main hall, Xu Tongchen looked grief-stricken, as if he had lost his parents.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was very happy inside.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, major events had occurred one after another in the Palace of Light, with Purple Mansion cultivators falling one by one.</p><p></p><p>By now, nearly ten had died.</p><p></p><p>Ten Purple Mansion cultivators dead in just a few days?</p><p></p><p>This was more than had died in the past hundred years.</p><p></p><p>And they were all from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine how ugly Huang Tu's face must be.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Saint, who they had casually joked about at the table before, had suddenly become an enormous threat.</p><p></p><p>Even Zheng Fangxing's Purple Mansion master had fallen. Naturally, Xu Tongchen felt very smug.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had to pretend to be very sad.</p><p></p><p>"In just a few days, my True Solar Fire has strengthened by ten percent. </p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan is truly my lucky star!" Thinking of Qi Yuan, Xu Tongchen felt even more joyful.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a double blessing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice transmission entered Xu Tongchen's ear.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen's gaze focused, and after glancing at the seemingly dazed spies behind him, he entered a small alley.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why have you come?" Xu Tongchen's eyes showed surprise and delight.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected to see his master here.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli looked at his disciple and slowly said, "Why have you been going out so often lately?"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple met a... prodigy. He's very strange." Xu Tongchen told Xu Yeli about what had happened between him and Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yeli frowned: "There are actually such people in the world? He must have had some fortuitous encounters."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Xu Yeli wouldn't pay too much attention to a young man participating in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his current situation was urgent.</p><p></p><p>"Tongchen, be prepared to flee with your teacher at any time these days," Xu Yeli said gravely.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen's expression changed slightly: "Master, what happened? Could it be... the Palace of Light is going to move against us?"</p><p></p><p>"The True Solar Fire is too conspicuous. The Palace of Light won't let you keep it for long," Xu Yeli said with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although the Palace of Light was domineering, they at least maintained some face and basic decency.</p><p></p><p>But recently, whether it was launching the Hundred Nations Blood War or other actions, they had become very direct.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli vaguely felt that something big might be happening.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his level was too low to know exactly what big event it was.</p><p></p><p>"Master, now that the Palace of Light has encountered a great enemy in the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, do they still have the leisure to seize my True Solar Fire?" Xu Tongchen said, first indignantly, then excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen continued, "The Blood-Robed Sword Saint is truly a peerless expert. With just one man and one sword, he has slain nine Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Adding in those lackeys of the Palace of Light, he has killed over ten.</p><p></p><p>Such a peerless expert should be the leader of the righteous path in our Cuiyun Continent."</p><p></p><p>"However, I'm puzzled why there's always a black-robed Purple Mansion cultivator playing the suona behind the Blood-Robed Sword Saint in every major battle? Why doesn't he help the Blood-Robed Sword Saint fight? Is his strength insufficient?" At this point, Xu Tongchen also expressed his confusion.</p><p></p><p>That black-robed suona-playing Purple Mansion cultivator seemed like an extra, completely useless.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why would the Blood-Robed Sword Saint keep such a useless old servant?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli's expression grew increasingly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen noticed and quickly asked, "What's wrong, Master? Has the Palace of Light bullied you again?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli glared angrily at Xu Tongchen: "Your master is the useless old servant you're talking about!"</p><p></p><p>"..." Xu Tongchen was stunned and instantly felt guilty. After a long while, he became excited again, "Master, you've met the Blood-Robed Sword Saint? What's his bearing like? Is he as legendary as they say... like a sage?"</p><p></p><p>"A sage?" Xu Yeli snorted coldly, "He's a god of slaughter!"</p><p></p><p>Where could there be such a sage?...</p><p></p><p>When he arrived outside Qi Yuan's cave dwelling again, Xu Tongchen's mind was still in a daze.</p><p></p><p>His master was actually the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's follower.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Saint could offend the Palace of Light and then leave without consequences.</p><p></p><p>But his master couldn't.</p><p></p><p>If discovered, the fate of the Seven Words Sect would be miserable.</p><p></p><p>His mind was somewhat distracted as he entered Qi Yuan's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"You're here, quickly bring out the True Solar Fire for me to observe," Qi Yuan said urgently.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Xu Tongchen brought out the True Solar Fire.</p><p></p><p>Now, for him, thinking about those things was useless. It was best to quickly improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the True Solar Fire again.</p><p></p><p>He squinted his eyes, examining it carefully.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a flame seemed to flicker on the small sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour passed, and Qi Yuan revealed a happy expression: "Not bad, not bad, I've gained some insights."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the thriving True Solar Fire, Xu Tongchen couldn't help but ask, "Has friend Qi gained some enlightenment?"</p><p></p><p>"I've gained a little bit of enlightenment," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was just a little bit, like how a tricycle can only pull a little bit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was stunned.</p><p></p><p>It had taken him decades of comprehension to gain insights.</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan gain insights in just a few days?</p><p></p><p>Was he lying? "In another ten days to half a month, I should be able to fully comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"Good..." Xu Tongchen hesitated, unsure if Qi Yuan was telling the truth, but he still said, "If friend Qi can comprehend the True Solar Fire before the Prodigy Battle begins, you will surely be able to sweep through the competition in this Prodigy Battle and rank in the top twenty."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, to be honest, ranking in the top twenty puts a lot of pressure on me.</p><p></p><p>After all, these prodigies all come from noble backgrounds, unlike my humble origins. I feel very inferior when I see them." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He was criticizing his Golden Core for being small a while ago, and now he feels inferior?</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, heaven rewards diligence. Through my hard work, I finally left the mountains and achieved Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, finally widening the gap with these prodigies."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, everything before was nonsense.</p><p></p><p>How could someone with Heavenly Dao Foundation Building feel inferior? He was now completely certain that this friend Qi Yuan had mental problems and spoke erratically.</p><p></p><p>However, hearing about Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, he couldn't help but sigh: "In this Prodigy Battle, there is indeed one with Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, named Gu Xiaoyao."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao Foundation Building?" Qi Yuan's expression became solemn, "Is his Heavenly Dao Foundation Building perfect or flawed?"</p><p></p><p>According to the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Building could make words become reality and cause gods to fall.</p><p></p><p>But he, lacking talent, only achieved flawed Heavenly Dao Foundation Building.</p><p></p><p>This resulted in his strength being pitifully weak even after reaching Foundation Building.</p><p></p><p>At the Foundation Building stage, he could only kill those at the Divine Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>So every time he encountered a little bitch at the Divine Infant stage, he would shout loudly.</p><p></p><p>"I have Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, what's wrong with killing Divine Infants?" In fact, he wasn't boasting, he was venting the sorrow in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He, with his lofty Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, could only kill Divine Infants like dogs.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Xu Tongchen was confused.</p><p></p><p>How could Heavenly Dao Foundation Building be divided into perfect and flawed?</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Building." Xu Tongchen replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became even more solemn.</p><p></p><p>In this Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle, he had finally encountered a terrifying enemy.</p><p></p><p>The legendary Heavenly Dao Foundation Building.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think my Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, plus a Fixed Star Golden Core, would be a match for that Gu Xiaoyao?" Qi Yuan asked secretly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen shook his head: "Friend Qi, even if you comprehend the True Solar Fire, you wouldn't be a match for that Heavenly Dao Foundation Building cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>This Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle... should he not participate? Otherwise, if he encountered that Heavenly Dao Foundation Building cultivator and couldn't win, it would be very awkward.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of the promise he made to the sect leader, he felt very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>He needed to find a way to avoid encountering that Heavenly Dao Foundation Building cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, in two days, Huang Tu will host the Fish and Dragon Banquet. I need to accompany him, so I won't be able to come cultivate with you. I hope you'll understand," Xu Tongchen said softly before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was startled upon hearing this: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>The Fish and Dragon Banquet was starting?</p><p></p><p>Was the Rogue Immortal Venerable about to arrive too?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 202</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder they thought this way.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were trying to guess Qi Yuan's thoughts based on the mindset of normal people.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pointing out their issues was difficult for them to understand the reasons behind.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, fleeing was definitely the most correct choice. </p><p></p><p>Since they were willing to submit to the evil god, they naturally valued their lives greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell Yan Xi about this matter. He may have already betrayed us, and their information was all leaked by him!"</p><p></p><p>The group communicated telepathically, outwardly appearing as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Old Snake, how about we team up together for entering the ancestral land this time? We can look out for each other," the burly dark-skinned man said, looking towards Old Snake.</p><p></p><p>Old Snake nodded absent-mindedly: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>"I have a treasure here that can unite our offense and defense, allowing us to jointly exert divine power. Would Old Snake like to join?" the burly dark-skinned man asked.</p><p></p><p>Old Snake's face suddenly changed: "No need!"</p><p></p><p>Although this kind of treasure would enhance both of their combat power, it would also confine him to stay by the burly dark-skinned man's side.</p><p></p><p>What a ruthless heart! </p><p></p><p>This was intended to thoroughly kill him here!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all hesitation in Old Snake's heart disappeared, with his only thought being to quickly flee after entering the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the other traitors also had similar thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The burly dark-skinned man was completely bewildered, not knowing what had happened. Why did Old Snake have such a big reaction?</p><p></p><p>However, seeing this scene, the elder twin sister revealed a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and take a look at the ancestral land," Qi Yuan said eagerly from the side.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the gray sky in front turned white, and a transparent membrane appeared in their field of vision.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit like an energy shield, quite interesting," Qi Yuan said with a thoughtful look as he gazed at the membrane rising above the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>In typical cultivation worlds, this kind of formation usually had a cultivation style. </p><p></p><p>But here it had a sci-fi style.</p><p></p><p>The group looked at the energy shield and quickly entered it.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi, Yu Lu, Zhao Zun and others followed Qi Yuan, directly crossing the energy shield and entering the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, several powerful auras erupted.</p><p></p><p>Old Snake's body was enveloped in powerful divine power as he fled directly.</p><p></p><p>The three purple mansion attendants beside Yan Xi Ancient God suddenly burst forth with Step Two Heaven-Treading strength at this moment, burning their divine apertures and fleeing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The remaining few ancient gods named by Qi Yuan exerted all their strength and fled directly.</p><p></p><p>That speed was a thousand times the speed of sound, extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" The burly dark-skinned man was dumbfounded. Seeing those ancient gods fleeing, he ran after them without thinking.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods stood dumbly in place, looking at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked ahead and couldn't help but sigh: "Is there a reward for coming in first in running after arriving at the ancestral land?"</p><p></p><p>The younger twin sister woke from her confusion: "I've never heard of that."</p><p></p><p>"Why did that big dark guy run along?" Qi Yuan could guess the reasons for the others running, but why did that burly dark-skinned man run?</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were puzzled in their hearts. Finally, Yan Xi Ancient God looked at Qi Yuan with reverence in his eyes: "Senior, did the Great Venerable send you in?"</p><p></p><p>With these words, many people's eyes grew even more confused.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked completely bewildered: "What Great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Xi Venerable One was somewhat puzzled: "Isn't it that some Great Venerable discovered Arrogant World Venerable's plot against the ancestral land, turned some ancient gods, and prepared for this event?</p><p></p><p>Except for Lucky Venerable, the other ancient gods, including Old Snake, had already submitted to the evil god."</p><p></p><p>Yan Xi Venerable One's words shocked the other ancient gods present.</p><p></p><p>"What? They submitted to Arrogant World Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant World Venerable is even plotting against the last gate, could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, when this senior pointed them out earlier, I felt something was amiss."</p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed animatedly, and Yan Xi Venerable One also told everyone more facts.</p><p></p><p>Earlier in the year, Yan Xi Venerable One's family was captured by Arrogant World Venerable, and he was also coerced to bring three attendants who were actually Step Two Heaven-Treading powerhouses into the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>The other true gods like Old Snake had also been turned by Arrogant World Venerable long ago.</p><p></p><p>This time, they had two purposes for entering the ancestral land: one was to secretly murder the ancient gods present, and the other was to seize control of the last gate as instructed by Arrogant World Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were all shocked upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately this senior pointed them out." The other ancient gods realized and all looked at Qi Yuan, "Senior, were you really not ordered by some Great Venerable to capture those traitors?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"How did senior discover they were traitors?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't discover it," Qi Yuan blinked his eyes, "I was just fortune-telling for them."</p><p></p><p>He did indeed find that those people had issues, but he didn't know exactly what they were.</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see hidden information, but that didn't mean he was omniscient.</p><p></p><p>"Fortune-telling?" Yan Xi Venerable One felt it was a bit absurd.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's eyes didn't look like he was deceiving them at all.</p><p></p><p>There was also no need to deceive them about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Your fortune-telling... is quite powerful," the elder twin sister stared at Qi Yuan, as if trying to see through to his inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"A coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>"They must have thought, like us, that this gentleman was arranged by some Great Venerable, so they were frightened away. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Old Snake and those true gods had secretly attacked us, we might have been completely wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present felt a chill of fear.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately by coincidence, the other side was scared away.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, sir has saved our lives. I bow in gratitude!" A true god bowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you have saved my life. This kindness is greater than the heavens. If you have any requests, please feel free to ask!"</p><p></p><p>These true gods expressed their thanks one after another, with very sincere attitudes.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Qi Yuan could indeed be said to have saved their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Really feel free to ask?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, friend!" These true gods said politely.</p><p></p><p>This kind of accidental favor, under normal circumstances, would be repaid with some pleasantries, gifts of treasures, or kept as a personal favor.</p><p></p><p>"Your strengths are pretty good. How about becoming citizens of my Qingshui Village?" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>These were all true gods. If recruited, Qingshui Village's strength would also surge.</p><p></p><p>With these words, all the gods present had strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Friend... are you joking?"</p><p></p><p>They were all ancient gods, like Qi Yuan, guardian gods of a city.</p><p></p><p>They could have superiors, but... they couldn't have a "father"! The relationship between guardian gods and citizens was actually analogous to the relationship between fathers and sons.</p><p></p><p>So when Qionghua Great Venerable was willing to be Qi Yuan's citizen before, all the true gods present were shocked and couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan's proposal really surprised them.</p><p></p><p>They only felt that Qi Yuan was joking.</p><p></p><p>"I never joke.</p><p></p><p>After all, a joke is only a joke if it's accepted by the person being joked with, otherwise it's an insult.</p><p></p><p>I'm sincerely telling you." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The usually talkative younger twin sister fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Inviting true gods to become citizens... if this wasn't a joke, it was an insult!</p><p></p><p>It would be better if it was a joke.</p><p></p><p>"Is this person mentally ill?"</p><p></p><p>"Something seems off."</p><p></p><p>"Bringing so many people, and fortune-telling... indeed..."</p><p></p><p>These true gods communicated telepathically.</p><p></p><p>The elder twin sister stepped forward at this time and said: "This condition is probably one we cannot fulfill for you, sir.</p><p></p><p>How about this - you've brought over a dozen citizens in, and it's extremely dangerous in the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Why don't we each protect some of them? To express our gratitude."</p><p></p><p>She wanted to repay the favor through this method.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand: "My citizens are safer with me.</p><p></p><p>Since you won't be my citizens, I won't waste any more time with you."</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about this matter at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the people present didn't try to persuade him further.</p><p></p><p>However, these people were all quite interested in the mysterious Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Some also felt that this person had serious mental problems.</p><p></p><p>And so the matter came to an end.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>The ground underfoot had no soil, but rather various colored metals that seemed to be alloys.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could name some of these metals. For low-level cultivators, they would be considered treasures, but for the true gods present, they were not.</p><p></p><p>The ground was covered in various metal alloys. Looking around, there were also all kinds of metal debris and broken metal artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a huge metal foot rose up to the sky, with eighteen toes particularly eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>The metal toenails seemed to be painted with colorful nail polish.</p><p></p><p>Various strange animal patterns were engraved on the nails.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had never seen these animals before.</p><p></p><p>The younger twin sister looked at the giant foot ahead and said: "Legend has it that the ancestors of our ancient race came from outside this realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire ancestral land is actually a magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>The ancient race arrived in the Mortal Heart Realm through this treasure.</p><p></p><p>After this treasure descended to the Mortal Heart Realm, it shattered and became the ancestral land, with many treasures left behind."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of treasures, all the true gods present became somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>The treasures in the ancestral land were truly numerous and strange, and their effects were very powerful.</p><p></p><p>The last time Old Snake came to the ancestral land, he found a precious celestial liquid. After drinking it, he directly opened two divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>Some treasures allowed more accumulated divine power, enhancing cultivators' foundations and strength.</p><p></p><p>So even though the ancestral land was dangerous, these ancient gods still came one after another.</p><p></p><p>"There are many treasures, but this place also contains terrifying dangers."</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In an instant, one could lose their life to the underworld," the elder twin sister said coldly. "Within the ancestral lands, there are all kinds of puppet gods. </p><p></p><p>They don't have specific appearances - they could be a drop of liquid, a stone, or a wisp of mist.</p><p></p><p>But they are extremely powerful. The weakest are true gods at the first step of heaven-treading, while the strongest are even great venerable ones. </p><p></p><p>If one carelessly enters their territory, there's a high chance of perishing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these puppet gods have no fixed abode. They wander and slumber throughout the ancestral lands, so past experience is useless. They could be sleeping anywhere.</p><p></p><p>For example, that metal foot ahead may very well have a slumbering puppet god inside. Just touching it could awaken the sleeping puppet god."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of puppet gods, the true gods present all had serious and fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the treasures of the ancestral lands?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The younger twin sister replied, "The deeper you go, the more treasures there are, and the more precious they become, but also more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>We divide the ancestral lands into seven layers. Those at the first step of heaven-treading are generally in the first layer, those at the second step are in the first two layers, and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the first layer, those at the first step of heaven-treading have about a 50-50 chance of dealing with the dangers.</p><p></p><p>Entering the second layer, you may not be so lucky.</p><p></p><p>Don't you know all this? Don't you have a map?"</p><p></p><p>The younger twin sister looked at Qi Yuan suspiciously as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No," Qi Yuan indeed did not have a map.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take this." The younger twin sister tossed a sheepskin map into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at it and memorized the map. "This division seems rather crude. So you're saying if I just keep going forward to the deepest part, that's the seventh layer?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt the map wasn't very useful. </p><p></p><p>He had thought it was a special place where one might get lost.</p><p></p><p>Now it was clear - knowing the target was ahead, as long as he didn't lose his way, there wouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>His ultimate goal was the seventh layer, where the Arrogant Great Venerable One had obtained the opportunity for godhood.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he encountered other treasures along the way, he wouldn't pass them up. They could be used to enhance the strength of his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," the younger twin sister nodded in confirmation.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I bid you all farewell. Good luck to you," Qi Yuan said to the ancient gods, then started walking forward.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked towards a tall tower in the distance ahead: "There are good things there. Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the elder twin sister hurriedly called out to stop Qi Yuan: "Friend, be careful! A puppet god has long been sleeping in that tower, and it's extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>One wrong move could awaken the puppet god!</p><p></p><p>Three ancient gods have perished in that tower before."</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also rushed to advise against it.</p><p></p><p>Within the ancestral lands, there were many such towering spires.</p><p></p><p>These towers contained the most treasures, but were also the most dangerous.</p><p></p><p>It was possible that even in a first layer tower, a great venerable level puppet god could be hidden. So no ancient god would enter a tower to seek treasures.</p><p></p><p>That would be suicide!</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, my left eyebrow keeps twitching, which means the treasures inside are calling to me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and all his people followed him, flying directly towards the tower.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods looked at each other in dismay.</p><p></p><p>The elder twin sister spoke up: "This friend has done us a favor, we... we can't just abandon him like this!"</p><p></p><p>The others also hurriedly flew over, landing outside the towering spire.</p><p></p><p>But because they were too cautious, they arrived late.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and his group had already entered the tower.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of those present were grim.</p><p></p><p>"He's already gone in, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"It's over. If the puppet god in the tower awakens, their fate will be terrible!"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods all stopped outside the tower, no one daring to take a step further.</p><p></p><p>Entering the tower, even turning into a gust of wind could potentially awaken the puppet god.</p><p></p><p>"We can only pray they have good luck and don't wake the puppet god!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? There are over ten of them, and even Yuan Dan cultivators. Even if a pig was sleeping in the tower, it would be startled awake!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods' expressions were not good.</p><p></p><p>At this point, they couldn't call out to Qi Yuan either. They could only wait outside.</p><p></p><p>If the puppet god awoke, they would assess the situation and provide aid if possible.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan might be saved, but the others would likely meet a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, inside the tower, Qi Yuan had a look of curiosity on his face.</p><p></p><p>He stood on something resembling a marble alloy, curiously examining the strange objects inside the tower.</p><p></p><p>[Hart titanium dish, a strange wine glass. Pour water in and wine flows out.]</p><p></p><p>[Puppet god, at the second step of heaven-treading, in dormant state. If the tower's alarm is triggered, it will awaken.]</p><p></p><p>[Universal alchemy cauldron, a special pill-refining cauldron.]</p><p></p><p>[Golden gauze, a piece of lingerie discarded on the ground.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze across, and dense information entered his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also discovered the puppet gods sleeping in the tower.</p><p></p><p>They truly had strange forms - one was like dust floating in the air, drifting about.</p><p></p><p>Another was like a metallic six-pointed ladybug.</p><p></p><p>Yet another was a brick.</p><p></p><p>"At a glance, I've spotted fifty-seven puppet gods. No wonder... the tower is so dangerous."</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Yuan, all hidden things were laid bare.</p><p></p><p>All fifty-seven puppet gods were within his sight.</p><p></p><p>"So, as long as the tower's alarm isn't triggered, these puppet gods won't awaken?" Qi Yuan mused.</p><p></p><p>According to the other ancient gods, anything could potentially wake the puppet gods.</p><p></p><p>Even entering the tower as a wisp of wind could awaken them.</p><p></p><p>"This is when my eyebrows should come into play!" Qi Yuan was eager to try.</p><p></p><p>His eyebrows could predict fortune and misfortune.</p><p></p><p>So, he just needed to think about how to move through the tower, then use his eyebrows to judge, slowly finding the correct path that wouldn't trigger the tower's alarm or awaken the puppet gods.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts turned, boldly imagining walking forward in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, his right eyebrow twitched.</p><p></p><p>This path was no good! He turned again, and his right eyebrow still twitched.</p><p></p><p>He kept turning, constantly trying. After about a breath of time, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Zhu Zhuangshi beside him asked in confusion: "Divine Lord, is something wrong with your eyebrows? They've been jumping crazily, I can barely see them clearly!"</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu, Divine Officials Shen Tu and others also looked at Qi Yuan in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyebrows were twitching too fast and too much, it seemed abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I say before that my eyebrows can divine fate?" Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile. "I've already calculated the first safe step."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the villagers present all felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>A god was indeed a god, still as outrageous as before.</p><p></p><p>This was an ancestral land tower, a dangerous inferno, and he was finding the path by twitching eyebrows!</p><p></p><p>As always!</p><p></p><p>However, they still chose to believe in their guardian deity.</p><p></p><p>The guardian deity had already created many miracles.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the guardian deity was willing to take the risk himself, what did they have to fear?</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow my left hand right hand in slow motion."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he walked forward several dozen steps, but his walking posture was strange, as if he were dancing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other villagers didn't hesitate at all, walking in the same odd posture as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to avoid affecting too much, they even used magic to make their bodies and clothes almost identical to Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>Each with their own thoughts, it was as if they were dancing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped, and everyone present stopped at a safe point.</p><p></p><p>This was a spot Qi Yuan had predicted in advance would be safe to stand.</p><p></p><p>He began to try again to determine which direction was safe to go.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes in thought.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding villagers muttered:</p><p></p><p>"Look, the Divine Lord's eyebrows are twitching frantically again!"</p><p></p><p>"Is he really divining fate?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe he's just too tired?"</p><p></p><p>"If I say I find the Divine Lord very funny right now, would you hit me?"</p><p></p><p>"We must revere the gods. We are professional believers, professional subjects. We can't laugh at the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Unless... he's too funny."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussion, Qi Yuan opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, repeat the previous movements."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan led everyone through the tower with ease.</p><p></p><p>In just a few dozen breaths of time, he had led everyone to the highest level of the tower in a very bizarre manner.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a musty fragrance permeated the air, as if it had never dissipated since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The villagers present widened their eyes, looking at the misty liquid ahead that was emitting an immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>"Linmu Immortal Liquid!" At this moment, Village Chief Yu Lu looked at the liquid ahead with a fanatical gleam in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually this! Drinking just a small mouthful can speed up divine aperture condensation fivefold. There's so much here!"</p><p></p><p>"How many tens of thousands of catties are there?!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers all had reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was immortal liquid, coveted even by true gods.</p><p></p><p>"Can this stuff be drunk?" Qi Yuan looked at the Linmu Immortal Liquid with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>[Linmu Immortal Liquid, bathing liquid specially made by the Water Treasure clan, formed by mixing into bathwater.]</p>

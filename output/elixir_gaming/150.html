        <h1>Chapter 150</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Daoist technique was deployed, temporarily isolating the communication here.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you dare to wear a blood-red robe? Aren't you afraid that the host Huang Tu will see it and cause trouble for you? The Palace of Light can't trouble the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, but troubling you... is certainly possible," said a male cultivator named Zhao Buyu at the same table in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He was also the only person at this table who was on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings, and received the most attention from those present.</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were two matters of greatest concern in Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>The first was the Eastern Lands Genius Battle.</p><p></p><p>The second was the grudge between the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal and the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Of course, regarding the second matter, since it happened so quickly, and many geniuses had just arrived in Cuiyun Continent, they were not clear about these things.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit confused. </p><p></p><p>It was precisely because he was afraid his original self attending the banquet would be looked down upon.</p><p></p><p>As a result, changing into the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal's avatar would also cause trouble? Isn't that bullying? </p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Rogue Immortal Lord muttered and asked: "You are all also from the Divine Flower Society, how do you know about the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>His knowledge about the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal was still from before.</p><p></p><p>"We're not from the Divine Flower Society," the five people present shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>That woman then asked puzzledly: "What does this have to do with the Divine Flower Society? During this time, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal came to Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>Killing gods who block his way, killing Buddhas who block his path. It's said he has already killed several dozen Purple Palace cultivators from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, we have never had the chance to see the heroic bearing of the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, nor are there any image stones recording his appearance."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she was very excited, with stars in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>When the suona horn sounded, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal appeared, and Purple Palace cultivators fell.</p><p></p><p>Each time the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal appeared it was too quick, and too few people had seen his true form.</p><p></p><p>However, when asking those people to describe the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal's appearance, they were unable to do so.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, the Rogue Immortal Lord was completely stunned. He transmitted: "Origin Venerable, what are they talking about?"</p><p></p><p>"They're just boasting," Qi Yuan replied sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Rogue Immortal Lord felt relieved, when he heard Qi Yuan say:</p><p></p><p>"How could I have killed several dozen Purple Palace cultivators? I've only killed nine Purple Palace cultivators from the Palace of Light," Qi Yuan transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord: "..."</p><p></p><p>He was very confused now.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal killed nine Purple Palace cultivators? The sect he belonged to in Leixing Continent was not small, but only had five Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was in chaos, unable to think clearly.</p><p></p><p>The woman who spoke earlier looked at Qi Yuan: "Friend, you should still change your attire as Brother Buyu said, to avoid bringing trouble."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord looked at Qi Yuan with a complicated expression: "Why don't we just leave?"</p><p></p><p>At this time his heart was still in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Everything before his eyes seemed illusory to him.</p><p></p><p>It's all fake, it's all fake.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan replied: "We haven't seen the Fish-Dragon Golden Core Dance yet, we're not leaving."</p><p></p><p>He was still waiting to experience the Fish-Dragon Golden Core Dance, and then record it to show to Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>The woman looked at Qi Yuan, seeing she couldn't persuade him, she didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>They were just passing acquaintances after all.</p><p></p><p>At the table, Qi Yuan continued eating spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>At this time, not far away, dozens of geniuses were welcoming the Heavenly Soul Fairy.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu's face was full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Tongchen behind Huang Tu's thoughts had drifted elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, the Solar True Fire in his body had suddenly jumped again.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was as if Qi Yuan was nearby.</p><p></p><p>However, when he casually scanned around, he didn't see Qi Yuan's figure.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze fell on a figure in a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>A strange look appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Although that person's appearance was very different from Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>But the feeling given to his Solar True Fire was exactly the same as what Qi Yuan had given him before.</p><p></p><p>He could almost be certain that it was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Why is he dressed like this?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he quickly withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid Huang Tu would see Qi Yuan dressed like this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Tongchen didn't know that at this moment, Qi Yuan was intentionally or unintentionally using the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't deliberately look at him, no one would see him.</p><p></p><p>They would just subconsciously ignore him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the high tower, two Nascent Soul cultivators secretly glanced at that blood-colored robe, and hurriedly withdrew their gaze: "Is it him?"</p><p></p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators seemed like peeping toms.</p><p></p><p>They were from the Cloud Palace, responsible for maintaining order at this Fish-Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>They would pay attention to all the geniuses at the banquet.</p><p></p><p>As they were paying attention, that blood-colored robe fell into their eyes.</p><p></p><p>At that time, both of them were startled.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, I've never seen the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal before.</p><p></p><p>And him... I can't see through him," said the tall Nascent Soul cultivator with a wary look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the entire Cuiyun Continent, among those high-level cultivators who weren't in seclusion, who didn't know about that killer, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal? Over a dozen Purple Palace cultivators, killed just like that.</p><p></p><p>This kind of strength, even in the entire Eastern Lands, was formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Tixiu will be here soon, he has seen the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal once, perhaps he can recognize him," said the short Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal coming to the Fish-Dragon Banquet, such a thing was too inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>How many forces in Cuiyun Continent now had their eyes on the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal? In secret, how many Purple Palace cultivators wanted to make connections with the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>After all, the Palace of Light was extremely domineering. In Cuiyun Continent, many forces couldn't wait for the Palace of Light to be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also understood that the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal could not destroy the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>But being able to cause more damage to the Palace of Light was also good.</p><p></p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators occasionally stole glances at Qi Yuan, only hoping in their hearts that Tixiu would come quickly.</p><p></p><p>If Tixiu confirmed it wasn't him, that would be good. If it was, it would be better for the Palace Master of the Cloud Palace to handle it.</p><p></p><p>The two small Nascent Soul cultivators didn't dare to face such a killer as the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal at all.</p><p></p><p>If it was really him, and the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal went berserk and slaughtered all the geniuses at the Fish-Dragon Banquet, that would be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, more and more geniuses arrived.</p><p></p><p>Three of the top ten geniuses had already come.</p><p></p><p>The outer hall and inner hall became even more lively.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gao Jien's eyes held a fawning smile: "Friend Zheng is as handsome as jade, I'm afraid your ranking in the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings will improve again this time!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien's ranking on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings was higher than Zheng Fangxing's, but he still flattered Zheng Fangxing.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zheng Fangxing was a genius from Cuiyun Continent, and had a close relationship with Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>By building a good relationship with Zheng Fangxing, Gao Jien could also make connections with Huang Tu, the number one genius of Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>"This Eastern Lands Genius Battle is crucial, and there are more geniuses participating than in previous years. It's difficult," Zheng Fangxing's mood was not very good at this time.</p><p></p><p>His master had perished.</p><p></p><p>His only backer was gone.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the gazes of those people behind Huang Tu looking at him were different from before, with contempt.</p><p></p><p>The world is fickle.</p><p></p><p>He had a belly full of anger with nowhere to vent.</p><p></p><p>"I have a junior brother who, like you Friend Zheng, has a lightning attribute spirit root.</p><p></p><p>Would you like to meet him and give some pointers?" Gao Jien said to Zheng Fangxing.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, almost everyone has the habit of wanting to be a teacher. Gao Jien used the pretext of asking for advice to get closer.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zheng Fangxing raised an eyebrow: "Alright, let's meet."</p><p></p><p>At this time, he was surrounded by geniuses from Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>Those geniuses now seemed to be ostracizing him, and he also wanted to leave this area.</p><p></p><p>Led by Gao Jien, Zheng Fangxing came to the secluded corner where the Rogue Immortal Lord and Origin Venerable were.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zheng, this is my junior brother..." Gao Jien was about to introduce.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he saw dense killing intent emanating from Zheng Fangxing's body.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with a gloomy expression: "Well well, you're all against me Zheng Fangxing, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>An adult's breakdown happens in an instant, silently.</p><p></p><p>When he learned of his master's death, Zheng Fangxing didn't fly into a rage.</p><p></p><p>When he was secretly ostracized by the geniuses of Cuiyun Continent, he also didn't care, gritting his teeth and persevering.</p><p></p><p>As a result, when he saw Qi Yuan dressed in a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hold back anymore.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in this world is bullying him, right?</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Gao Jien had a bewildered look: "Friend Zheng, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>The few people at Qi Yuan's table immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>That woman looked at Qi Yuan with an expression of watching a good show.</p><p></p><p>Told you to change clothes earlier but you didn't, now you're being disliked, right?</p><p></p><p>"My master died at the hands of the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, and he... dresses like the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, this is deliberately going against me." Zheng Fangxing said loudly.</p><p></p><p>If it was a famous genius, Zheng Fangxing might have gritted his teeth and endured it.</p><p></p><p>But on the way here, Gao Jien had already introduced him.</p><p></p><p>That man in the red robe was not listed in the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings, and had no illustrious background.</p><p></p><p>He naturally wouldn't endure anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Take off your clothes!" There was killing intent in Zheng Fangxing's voice.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien still had a bewildered look.</p><p></p><p>He had just arrived in Cuiyun Continent and knew nothing about any Blood-Robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Luo Cha saw this scene with a schadenfreude look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chong glanced at Qi Yuan and said: "Wearing a blood-red robe to attend the Fish-Dragon Banquet, this kid is really bold. Is he here to slap Huang Tu's face?</p><p></p><p>Strange, the blood-red robe is so conspicuous, why hasn't Huang Tu noticed?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Zheng Fangxing with an innocent expression.</p><p></p><p>He had deliberately changed into the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal's attire to avoid being looked down upon. As a result,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Because you're too handsome, you encountered a gay man?" "Freedom of dress, don't you understand?" Qi Yuan raised the banner of freedom of dress high. "I'm wearing this, am I eating rice from your house?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zheng Fangxing's anger grew even stronger. </p><p></p><p>A little nobody dares to speak to him like this? "You're very lucky that it's the Fish and Dragon Banquet now and fighting is not allowed. After the banquet ends, you'll get what's coming to you!" Zheng Fangxing stared deeply at Qi Yuan, killing intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present could sense the thick murderous aura in Zheng Fangxing's words.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the confused Gao Jien was startled, then said: "Fellow Daoist Zheng, I brought him here. If he unintentionally offended you, I'm willing to apologize on his behalf. Your words just now were a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>He had to protect his junior brother's friend whom he brought to the Fish and Dragon Banquet no matter what.</p><p></p><p>That Zhao Buyu also stood up and said: "Fellow Daoist Zheng Fangxing, this Daoist brother may have offended unintentionally."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zheng Fangxing's anger grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>After his master died, he was restricted in everything he did.</p><p></p><p>Now, a little nobody provoked him, and others were even speaking up for the nobody.</p><p></p><p>"You're very lucky," he looked at Qi Yuan and threatened again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gao Jien felt relieved, thinking the incident should be over.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Qi Yuan spoke up at this moment: "Your luck isn't very good though. You don't need to wait until the Fish and Dragon Banquet ends, you'll die here."</p><p></p><p>These words shocked everyone at the table.</p><p></p><p>Especially Zhao Buyu who had just spoken up for Qi Yuan was confused. </p><p></p><p>The incident had just been resolved, why say this now?</p><p></p><p>That woman looked at Qi Yuan, disappointment in her eyes. How could there be such a reckless person?</p><p></p><p>"Very well!" Zheng Fangxing was thoroughly enraged.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan casually waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I'll send you to reunite with your master in the underworld."</p><p></p><p>It was an ordinary wave, without any fancy techniques or profound Dao methods.</p><p></p><p>In everyone's sight, Zheng Fangxing's body stiffened.</p><p></p><p>The expression on his face froze at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Then... with a light "bang", he instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Shattered into seven or eight pieces.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Fangxing... died at the Fish and Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>Killed effortlessly by Qi Yuan with one hand!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of everyone present changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Everything happened too suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Fangxing was a figure on the Genius Ranking, yet he was so casually killed by Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>This was big!</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt that something major was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the Rogue Immortal Master: "After killing a figure on the Genius Ranking, your ranking on the Genius Ranking has moved up one spot."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Brother, you're still thinking about the Genius Ranking at a time like this? He didn't know whether to feel touched or what.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Qi Yuan had killed someone, and it was a genius at that.</p><p></p><p>This scene was instantly noticed by the people in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>After all, the appearance of a bloody smell at such a banquet was very rare.</p><p></p><p>Almost all gazes turned towards Qi Yuan, with a hint of surprise flashing in many eyes.</p><p></p><p>For these geniuses, they would have casually scanned the entire venue after entering the great hall.</p><p></p><p>Why hadn't they noticed this figure in a blood-red robe? Could it be that he came in later?</p><p></p><p>"This person is really bold, actually killing someone at the Fish and Dragon Banquet!"</p><p></p><p>"And wearing the attire of the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, this is slapping Huang Tu's face."</p><p></p><p>"This person's courage is as great as the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal's."</p><p></p><p>"Could he possibly be the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Why would a senior expert like the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal come to our Fish and Dragon Banquet for no reason, to watch Golden Core cultivators dance? If he wanted, those Yuan Dan female cultivators would all go dance in his room."</p><p></p><p>Some geniuses whispered.</p><p></p><p>Many people watched Qi Yuan with an attitude of watching a show.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Huang Tu in a yellow robe had an extremely gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by dozens of geniuses, he walked out of the inner hall and stopped not far from Qi Yuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Zheng Fangxing's corpse on the ground, then at Qi Yuan, and said in a hoarse voice: "Fellow Daoist... you've gone too far."</p><p></p><p>Next to Zheng Fangxing's body, Xu Tongchen was extremely anxious internally.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan... was too fierce!</p><p></p><p>Killing someone at the Fish and Dragon Banquet? He was pondering how to save Qi Yuan's life.</p><p></p><p>"How have I gone too far? He wanted to kill me, so I killed him first," Qi Yuan had always advocated not delaying revenge, as the night is long and full of dreams. "What, have you come to avenge him?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at the many geniuses behind Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>"Have you all come to avenge him?"</p><p></p><p>Those geniuses looked at each other, obviously not expecting that this man in blood-red robes would be so bold.</p><p></p><p>Was he provoking them?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gao Jien had a dejected expression, looking worse than anyone.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, he had heard his junior brother say that his friend was a bit crazy and different from normal people.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't just a bit crazy, this was completely insane and inhuman.</p><p></p><p>One person daring to challenge dozens of geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"If you've come to avenge him, then... you can only be my enemies, and I'll have no choice but to... kill you all." Qi Yuan said casually, then glanced at the Rogue Immortal Master, "If I kill them all, can you enter the Eastern Land Genius Ranking?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Rogue Immortal Master was now speechless.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Buyu at the table also secretly moved away from Qi Yuan a bit.</p><p></p><p>After all, this person had mental issues and must be a cultivator of the Path of Madness.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu's face had become extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Xu Tongchen hurriedly said: "Fellow Daoist, do you know who he is? He's ranked 27th on the Eastern Land Genius Ranking, someone you can't afford to offend!"</p><p></p><p>He frantically made eye signals to Qi Yuan, hoping he wouldn't be too arrogant and provoke everyone's anger.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily: "Now it's not me offending him, but him coming to offend me.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I'm not one to kill innocents indiscriminately. You all can leave, and pretend this never happened.</p><p></p><p>I'll clean up this person's corpse, it won't affect you.</p><p></p><p>Don't worry, I'm very experienced at disposing of corpses."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he took out a bottle of corpse-dissolving water and poured it directly onto Zheng Fangxing's corpse in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>As he poured, Qi Yuan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, strength is a man's greatest beauty treatment and source of confidence.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he used corpse-dissolving water on Yu Linglong, he had to do it secretly.</p><p></p><p>Now, he dared to do this openly in public.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of everyone present became even stranger.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu's expression had become extremely gloomy: "If you, this arrogant fool, can walk out of the Fish and Dragon Banquet today, I, Huang Tu, don't deserve to be on the Genius Ranking."</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly disappeared from the table.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Where did he go?</p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly vanish? Did he run away?</p><p></p><p>These geniuses were shocked, and also amazed at Qi Yuan's speed.</p><p></p><p>To disappear in front of so many people, this level of ability was definitely not that of an unknown figure on the Genius Ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you're in the top 20 of the Genius Ranking, I, Huang Tu, won't let you off!" Huang Tu looked at the empty seat, his gaze sweeping over the Rogue Immortal Master and Gao Jien, killing intent spreading in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a lazy voice came: "I've already walked out of the Fish and Dragon Banquet and walked back in. Does that mean you don't deserve to be on the Genius Ranking? Can you be removed from the Genius Ranking?</p><p></p><p>If so, my brother might be able to enter the main Genius Ranking."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared again, his words shocking, and he glanced at the Rogue Immortal Master beside him.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>Many people looked at Qi Yuan, feeling incredulous.</p><p></p><p>This person... was too much, wasn't he?</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master was moved to tears, truly touched this time.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu's face turned ashen: "Today, you must die"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Tu suddenly attacked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses stood to the side, as if watching a show.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, an urgent voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>A sharp aura spread, and all the geniuses at the entire Fish and Dragon Banquet felt their auras become unstable at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They felt their spiritual energy circulation become sluggish, turning from geniuses into ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"A Purple Mansion expert?"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses were shocked. How could there be a Purple Mansion expert at the Fish and Dragon Banquet?</p><p></p><p>They saw that Purple Mansion expert descend into the great hall, casually waving to stop Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses in the room looked at the newly arrived Purple Mansion expert with confusion and awe.</p><p></p><p>"It's the leader of the Cloud Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"A mid-stage Purple Mansion senior!"</p><p></p><p>The gazes of these geniuses towards that Purple Mansion expert changed.</p><p></p><p>Although they were geniuses, and the top 100 on the Genius Ranking had unobstructed future paths to reach Purple Mansion,</p><p></p><p>But after all, they weren't there yet.</p><p></p><p>For them, Purple Mansion was still a lofty and extremely distant existence.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace leader entered the great hall and looked at Qi Yuan with a hint of respect on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, why bother with these juniors?"</p><p></p><p>These words made everyone present draw in another sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>This man in blood-red robes... was the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>The woman who had been sitting at the same table as Qi Yuan was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien was also stunned, feeling his head was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen felt the same.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal? He was confused.</p><p></p><p>My master is my friend's old servant?</p><p></p><p>The relationships felt a bit chaotic.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at all the reverent and shocked gazes, countless emotions welling up in his heart, feeling proud and elated.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Cloud Palace leader, a smile in his eyes: "Hurry up and say, the Dragon King requests a crooked mouth."</p><p></p><p>Sorry, I still haven't adjusted to the time difference. There's one more chapter to be released at 6 AM. Everyone go to sleep early.</p><p></p><p>I'll try to adjust to the time difference one day, build up a backlog, and then set a fixed time to release every day!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

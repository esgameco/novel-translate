        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who was in the same squad as him, was also at level 95.</p><p></p><p>According to the division of the Wangyue Continent, this was already considered the late divine realm. Going further, one would become a major power.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a huge gust of wind overturned the trees, and hundreds of Yiwu creatures lost their souls, becoming the fuel for the dazzling death light.</p><p></p><p>Under the sword that transcended the world, Qi Yuan's experience points surged crazily, while the figure of the Ugly Clothing Demon King became somewhat disheveled.</p><p></p><p>Several of the black claws on its huge claws were broken, exposing the white flesh.</p><p></p><p>The Ugly Clothing Demon King seemed to have no intelligence, not caring about the pain of the injury at all, and continued to rush towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that today we will not only determine our superiority, but also life and death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded the giant sword, swinging it without any instability.</p><p></p><p>Now he felt that a single sword could topple a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not the mountains within the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>The terrain here was somewhat special.</p><p></p><p>With a sword strike, the wind and clouds moved.</p><p></p><p>And the small skill he activated, Rend Clothing, had a bonus against the Ugly Clothing Demon King and the Yiwu creatures.</p><p></p><p>Rend Clothing had a bonus against clothes and armor.</p><p></p><p>And the Ugly Clothing Demon King, they were originally clothes, so washing them was the same as washing clothes.</p><p></p><p>Rend Clothing did not break their ritual robes, but their very bodies.</p><p></p><p>The mask of the Ugly Clothing Demon King was black and white, without any color.</p><p></p><p>The sharp sword and the terrifying claws collided.</p><p></p><p>The claws were broken, the flesh and blood were exposed, revealing the grim white bones.</p><p></p><p>"You still have bones?" Qi Yuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Ugly Clothing Demon King did not speak, its terrifying mask staring at him.</p><p></p><p>In the silent Yiguan Forbidden Land, this scene was somewhat horrifying.</p><p></p><p>The two clashed again.</p><p></p><p>The Yiwu creatures throughout the Yiguan Forbidden Land were killed by their aftershocks, countless in number.</p><p></p><p>The injuries on the Ugly Clothing Demon King's body became more and more serious, looking extremely miserable.</p><p></p><p>While Qi Yuan, on the other hand, became more and more courageous in battle.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Yiguan Forbidden Land, which had almost become a ruin, and the great sword in his hand shrank.</p><p></p><p>"This place will soon take on my shape, I can't destroy it anymore."</p><p></p><p>He held the sword, ready to end this meaningless battle.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical power! </p><p>Heavenly Sword Technique! The two major skills were simultaneously unleashed, which was his strongest attack in his normal state.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blood-red sword thrust towards the Ugly Clothing Demon King.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Qi Yuan a bit was that the Ugly Clothing Demon King, not knowing whether it was unable to dodge or deliberately did not dodge, allowed Qi Yuan's terrifying sword to pierce its chest.</p><p></p><p>It looked at Qi Yuan, the expressionless clown black and white mask seeming to reveal a hint of relief.</p><p></p><p>This sword had completely extinguished its life.</p><p></p><p>Then its body collapsed.</p><p></p><p>In the air, a layer of human skin was floating.</p><p>A faceless mask also fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the layer of human skin, and for some reason, a sense of inexplicable sorrow arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the faceless mask, and some scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"You are the one with the strongest natural talent in the clan, with the hope of reaching the top of the heavenly realm!"</p><p></p><p>"However, the Heavenly Demon Patrol is inspecting the Wangyue Continent, and you must hide your identity and not reveal your talent!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the faceless mask, from now on, you will wear this mask and leave the clan."</p><p></p><p>"One day, when you step into the realm of the supreme emperor, you will enter the four forbidden lands!"</p><p></p><p>"Remember, remember, do not step into the heavenly realm outside!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw that the ordinary-looking, merely handsome young man put on the faceless mask, abandoned his own name, and forgot his past.</p><p></p><p>But when he came to the Yiguan Forbidden Land and stepped into the heavenly realm, what awaited him was a fishing line descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>His entire qi and blood were instantly drained.</p><p></p><p>Only a layer of human skin was left, attached to a...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Taoist-garbed demon was above.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but raise his head and look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Fish line?"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Demon?" He remembered the invitation to the Demon Slaying Assembly.</p><p></p><p>"The big boss of this world has some powerful methods."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the human skin.</p><p></p><p>"The NPC... is quite humane."</p><p></p><p>"Killing him, I'm level 91 now, and very close to level 92."</p><p></p><p>He picked up the faceless mask and put it on himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a prompt sound entered Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>【The Taoist-garbed Forbidden Realm has been cleared, rewards obtained.】</p><p></p><p>【Reward 1: Polluted Fragments of the Heavenly Dao *10.】</p><p></p><p>【Reward 2: Control over the Taoist-garbed Imperial Guards.】</p><p></p><p>"Polluted Fragments of the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanyuan Forbidden Realm, he had not encountered this problem. </p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Fragments back then were intact.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly thought of the fish line that fell from the sky, which had sucked out the predecessor of the Ugly Garment Demon King.</p><p></p><p>"So, this forbidden realm... has been polluted by the so-called Heavenly Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"I have to kill the Heavenly Demon to obtain the complete Heavenly Dao Fragments."</p><p></p><p>"But according to the invitation, the Heavenly Demon is in the Earthly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>To obtain the complete Heavenly Dao Fragments, I must go to the Earthly Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't really matter, I just can't fully control the Taoist-garbed Forbidden Realm."</p><p></p><p>This means that he cannot establish a rule like "can enter through the back door" for the Taoist-garbed Forbidden Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No, my mental state is a bit drained today, I need to log off soon." After today's battle, Qi Yuan was not injured, but his mental consumption was huge.</p><p></p><p>The mana recovery of the Death Radiance cannot replenish the mental energy consumed in playing the game.</p><p></p><p>Staying in the game for too long will cause considerable damage to his real self.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hugged his wife, this time not digging a hole, but lying on the board together.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the palace, the lights were bright.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Guards were guarding outside, and a solemn and tense atmosphere permeated the entire palace.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Lin Qingli was that today, after she summoned Kong Qi, the Duke of Xing also came to seek an audience, and his words were quite dissatisfied with Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>Among them, he also occasionally revealed a hint that he wanted Lin Qingli to leave if possible.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingli understood these reasons.</p><p></p><p>But she cannot leave.</p><p></p><p>It's already late at night, and she is still tossing and turning.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that can make her feel a little better now is to chat with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan hasn't sent a message today. </p><p></p><p>She doesn't know how he's doing in the Taoist-garbed Forbidden Realm, and whether she can get through this ordeal.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Qi tree is visible but untouchable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint light flashed in the Linglong Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingli loosened her grip on it and looked at the information inside.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you some good news, I've conquered the Taoist-garbed Forbidden Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The Taoist-garbed Forbidden Realm is mine now!"</p><p></p><p>"I need to log off now, I've consumed too much today, I'll go to other forbidden realms tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingli saw this, and a small stone in her heart fell.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist-garbed Forbidden Realm has finally been taken by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful." Lin Qingli sent the message, feeling a little flushed.</p><p></p><p>She recalled that she had once seen the Imperial Guards under her command also whisper to their husbands like this.</p><p></p><p>She thought of her recent predicament, and originally wanted to tell Qi Yuan in person.</p><p></p><p>But seeing that Qi Yuan seemed tired, she thought she would wait until he rested and then talk to him.</p><p></p><p>However, the Linglong Jade Token flashed again.</p><p></p><p>"Little Lin, I have a brilliant plan that can help you stabilize Nanqian, do you want to hear it or not?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 245</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a Flame Fish!"</p><p></p><p>"This fish is worth 10 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"This little girl, whose disciple is she?"</p><p></p><p>The fishermen around the lake were all breathing rapidly. </p><p></p><p>That single fish was worth a full 10 spirit stones, enough to excite the Qi Condensation cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Especially these Qi Condensation cultivators, most of whom were rogue cultivators who couldn't even earn 10 spirit stones in a year.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the little girl's bucket contained not just the Flame Fish, but a pile of other spirit fish as well.</p><p></p><p>Altogether, they were worth several hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Such a large amount of spirit stones would tempt even Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun seemed not to hear the others' conversations, and continued to cast her fishing rod to keep fishing.</p><p></p><p>At this point, an elderly Qi Condensation cultivator nearby couldn't sit still anymore. He advised earnestly: "Little one, as the saying goes, don't flaunt your wealth. It's very dangerous for you here, there are many eyes watching you. Who are your elders? Quickly call them over to take you back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun continued staring at the calm lake surface. She said seemingly aggrieved: "My mother went to heaven, and my father is obsessed with gaming all day, his days and nights reversed. I don't know where he's gone off to die."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old man understood - this little girl's mother had likely passed away, and her father spent his days gaming to drown his sorrows.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, poor child," the old man said, casually asking, "To have given birth to such a clever and adorable child like you, your parents must be from a prestigious family? Which immortal cultivation sect are they from?"</p><p></p><p>"We're from out of town, just arrived in Da Shang recently," Qi Jianjun answered casually.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the fishing rod moved - another fish had taken the bait. A look of joy appeared on Qi Jianjun's face.</p><p></p><p>"I caught another one!"</p><p></p><p>This elicited cheers from the nearby fishermen.</p><p></p><p>A young man watching from not far away had a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"This little one is done for, she's been targeted."</p><p></p><p>He recognized the old man next to Qi Jianjun. </p><p></p><p>That old man looked harmless and even very kind-hearted, but was actually an informant for bandits, trying to get information from Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain some information about Qi Jianjun to assess whether they could make a move, then they would act to rob her.</p><p></p><p>In the world of immortal cultivation, things were never so peaceful and idyllic.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the disciples from major sects were well-protected, but for the lower-class rogue cultivators, and even the dirty deeds of major sect disciples, such things happened all the time.</p><p></p><p>The man wearing the straw rain cape and hat looked at the girl with a regretful expression.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of the bandits behind that old man, he could only sigh. He didn't dare to step in and help.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Foundation Establishment cultivator and two Qi Condensation cultivators were walking this way.</p><p></p><p>They were discussing something as they walked.</p><p></p><p>"From out of town, probably a fat sheep fleeing disaster!" The Foundation Establishment bandit had a greedy look.</p><p></p><p>Spirit fish worth several hundred spirit stones, and seemingly no risk - this deal had to be done.</p><p></p><p>"I've already investigated. There's no girl like her in any of the nearby sects. Her background is ordinary," said a Qi Condensation stage 7 bandit.</p><p></p><p>As long as she wasn't a sect disciple, they had nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>And even ordinary disciples from small sects, they weren't afraid of either.</p><p></p><p>Except for the three major sects that stood like towering mountains, these bandits didn't dare touch them. But other sects, they still dared to.</p><p></p><p>"She can catch so many fish, she must have some good fortune.</p><p></p><p>Why don't we burn her face, make her mute, disfigure her face with burns, and then have her keep fishing here forever," said a Qi Condensation bandit.</p><p></p><p>Bandits often did such things.</p><p></p><p>And in mortal kingdoms, beggar gangs did the same, often crippling people and then having them beg for money.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," the Foundation Establishment elder said greedily.</p><p></p><p>The three bandits appeared, all wearing masks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The fishermen present all trembled in fear, some quietly fleeing with their fish buckets.</p><p></p><p>The regretful man from earlier also sighed softly, not daring to look in this direction.</p><p></p><p>Many others secretly watched the young girl with pained expressions.</p><p></p><p>Such an adorable little girl, about to suffer a cruel fate.</p><p></p><p>Her father was truly irresponsible!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, not far away, two figures stood beneath a tree, watching the conflict unfolding by the lake.</p><p></p><p>A murderous glint appeared in the woman's eyes: "These bandits are truly despicable, even targeting a little girl.</p><p></p><p>Those men are all useless too, not a single one stepping up to help.</p><p></p><p>Young Master, should I go..."</p><p></p><p>The woman looked at the man in coarse clothing beside her, her eyes filled with deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>The woman's name was Shen Zhifeng, the only divine-surnamed Nascent Soul cultivator of the Shen family in the Demonic Desire Sect, and also the guide for the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>Even as a Nascent Soul True Lord, she acted like a servant before the man in coarse clothing beside her.</p><p></p><p>Because this man's name was Shen Wushen!</p><p></p><p>This time, the Shen family's seizure of power in the Demonic Desire Sect, regaining control, was all thanks to Shen Wushen's efforts.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen alone had killed off all the other Nascent Soul cultivators in the Demonic Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>And he did it as easily as slaughtering chickens.</p><p></p><p>Although Shen Zhifeng was at the Nascent Soul stage, if she encountered Shen Wushen, she likely couldn't even last one exchange.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen looked at the young girl by the lakeside, his eyes revealing a profound expression: "She... is no ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Shen Zhifeng was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Was she concealing her cultivation? But no matter how hard she looked, she still couldn't discern that person's strength.</p><p></p><p>If so, it meant the other party was either far superior to her in cultivation, or had cultivated some technique to conceal their aura, or possessed a magical treasure that could hide one's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Don't bother looking, you won't be able to see her cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>I didn't expect to encounter such a senior figure in a remote place like Da Shang," Shen Wushen's eyes held a trace of reverence.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>For even Shen Wushen to call someone a senior, how strong must they be? Could it be... a Purple Palace stage cultivator? Shen Zhifeng's breathing quickened, and her gaze towards those bandits turned pitying.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Waves Realm is more fascinating than I imagined.</p><p></p><p>I hope I can encounter an opponent worthy of me taking action!"</p><p></p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Shen Wushen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was a person from the upper realms, born into a great sect.</p><p></p><p>His master was a legendary level powerhouse, one who illuminated the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was using his sect's supreme treasure to travel through the realms and increase his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Desire Sect of the Azure Waves Realm was a lower realm discovered by his Shen family before, leaving coordinates for descendants to travel to.</p><p></p><p>But the Shen family had declined and could no longer descend to lower realms.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen joined a great sect and was able to descend to experience the lower realms through the sect's supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>Now he had arrived at the Demonic Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>He was a martial arts fanatic, or rather a battle maniac.</p><p></p><p>Traveling through various realms, he had always been honing his techniques, strengthening the foundation of his Nascent Soul. He had remained at the Nascent Soul realm for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>For disciples of great sects from the upper realms like them, below the Yin Spirit stage, the length of cultivation time didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Foundation was most important.</p><p></p><p>After all, they could descend to lower realms, where the flow of time differed from the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>One day in the upper realms might be a thousand years in some lower realms.</p><p></p><p>For disciples of great sects, foundation was the most important.</p><p></p><p>But at the Yin Spirit realm, it was a different story.</p><p></p><p>Yin Spirits needed time to refine, but traveling through myriad realms was not as good as staying in the upper realms. Even with time differences, the laws were more complete in the upper realms, making it easier to condense divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master is unparalleled in the world. Even among disciples of great sects in the upper realms you stand out. How could any Nascent Soul cultivator in the Azure Waves Realm be your match?" Shen Zhifeng said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>She even felt that if all the Nascent Soul cultivators in Da Shang, or even all the Nascent Soul cultivators in the hundred countries joined forces,</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily able to kill the young master."</p><p></p><p>"Even the wilderness can produce qilins," said Shen Wushen, brimming with fighting spirit. "The invitation from Shenguang Sect, and Qi Yuan, the number one divine infant of Da Shang - aren't those quite interesting?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng fell silent upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>If it was before, hearing about a 20-year-old divine infant, she would definitely have been excited, even disbelieving it was true, as it was too shocking. </p><p></p><p>But after following by the young master's side and learning information about the upper realm, she realized how narrow her perspective had been. A 20-year-old divine infant cultivator was nothing special in the eyes of the major sects in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>Even in the major sect Shen Wushen belonged to, if those true disciples wanted, they could use some resources to all reach divine infant stage by age 20.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the Yin Spirit stage, disciples of major sects focused most on building their foundation. </p><p></p><p>If one advanced too quickly in cultivation and entered the Yin Spirit stage at great cost, they would only be a shoddy Yin Spirit, only able to serve as a manager in the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, in front of the young master, he's nothing but a frog in a well," Shen Zhifeng flattered.</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate others in the world," said Shen Wushen. "I know of a true disciple from a major sect who was at the Purple Palace realm. He descended to the Myriad Beasts Realm but ended up being toyed with by a demon woman, his divine soul extinguished."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Zhifeng also took a deep breath. </p><p></p><p>How strong must a Purple Palace cultivator who was a true disciple of an upper realm major sect be? Yet he could still be killed by a demon woman from the lower realm?</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look at tomorrow's Divine Infant Conference. It'll be good to see if there are any opponents in Da Shang worthy of my effort. If not, I'll have to go look elsewhere," Shen Wushen murmured.</p><p></p><p>As for the Cang Lan Realm, he didn't dare get too deeply involved. </p><p></p><p>After all, the waters were deep in the Cang Lan Realm, involving a powerful Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>That Yang Spirit was even more powerful than his own sect.</p><p></p><p>If he died in the Cang Lan Realm, his sect wouldn't offend that Yang Spirit for his sake.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he looked at the cultivator in front of him with regret: "What a pity... being born in this land, the outcome is already determined."</p><p></p><p>In this world, even for Yin Spirits, the outcome was already predetermined, with no possibility of a very good result.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a series of exclamations rang out.</p><p></p><p>By the lakeside, Qi Jianjun lightly waved her small hand, and three robber cultivators instantly lost their lives.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators who saw this were extremely shocked. </p><p></p><p>This little girl... had cultivation?</p><p></p><p>"Killing Foundation Establishment cultivators so easily, could this be... a hidden Foundation Establishment expert!"</p><p></p><p>"These robber cultivators have met their match!"</p><p></p><p>"A Foundation Establishment old monster pretending to be a little girl, it's really..."</p><p></p><p>The fishermen discussed animatedly. The man from earlier was also surprised, and then regretful. </p><p></p><p>If he had known she was at Foundation Establishment, he should have gone up to warn her. He might have been able to befriend this great Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Jianjun looked at the old man beside her, with an indescribable look in her eyes: "You old man, bullying an orphan like me, you're really despicable."</p><p></p><p>As her voice fell, the old man who had just sent a message to the robber cultivators instantly lost his life.</p><p></p><p>The fishermen present looked at each other, some choosing to leave.</p><p></p><p>Many of the robber cultivators present belonged to organizations.</p><p></p><p>Kill the small fry, and the big fish would come.</p><p></p><p>This little girl fishing here, her fate probably wouldn't be very good.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a deep voice rang out: "Shen Wushen of the Demon Desire Sect pays respects to the senior."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen and Shen Zhifeng appeared, both with humble expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these two, the scattered cultivators present were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Desire Sect was one of the three major sects of Da Shang, a true behemoth.</p><p></p><p>Yet people from the Demon Desire Sect were calling this little girl "senior". Could it be... this girl was a Yuan Dan stage cultivator? And moreover, a Yuan Dan from a major sect?</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun glanced at Shen Wushen, surprise in her eyes: "You're from the upper realm?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen's heart shook violently.</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary Yin Spirit couldn't discover his origins.</p><p></p><p>This senior in front of him...</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>The scattered cultivators present looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to senior, this junior is a disciple of Mount Futu."</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of it," Qi Jianjun shook her head. "My mother is also in the upper realm. I haven't seen my mother for a long time. If you return to the upper realm this time, could you pass on a message to my mother?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun's words made Shen Wushen's scalp tingle even more.</p><p></p><p>This senior's mother was in the upper realm?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it said that this realm was just resources, and Yin Spirits absolutely couldn't break through to the upper realm?</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>"May I ask senior to provide more details," Shen Wushen bowed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Jianjun's face lit up with joy: "You're quite a good fellow. My mother is from the Moon Goddess Palace in the upper realm. She is a Moon Lady named Jin Li. Just pass on the message saying 'Daughter Jianjun has long missed Zhiyu, time cuts like a reed... Also, daughter Jianjun has found her father!'"</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun said a bunch of things.</p><p></p><p>"You've done me such a big favor. If you encounter any trouble in the Cang Lan Realm, this young miss will have your back!"</p><p></p><p>The 7-8 year old looking Qi Jianjun spoke with an old-fashioned air.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen quickly said: "Many thanks, senior."</p><p></p><p>The shock in his heart had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess Palace was much more powerful than Mount Futu.</p><p></p><p>A Moon Lady of the Moon Goddess Palace was an existence with the potential to lead the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>Even though his master was a Myth realm expert, while his cultivation might be higher than some Moon Ladies, his status was far inferior.</p><p></p><p>The senior before him was actually the daughter of a Moon Lady. He was shaken.</p><p></p><p>To think a Moon Lady would marry and have such a grown child.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go." Qi Jianjun's hand swept out, grabbing the fish bucket and instantly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Spirit... actually a Yin Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>The trace of aura Qi Jianjun had just leaked was clearly the aura of a Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>In Da Shang, she hadn't even seen a Purple Palace cultivator, let alone a Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The other fishermen, hearing Shen Zhifeng's exclamation, also widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"A true immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Our ancestors must be smiling in heaven, to actually see a legendary true immortal!"</p><p></p><p>These fishermen immediately knelt down, kowtowing repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>That was a Yin Spirit! Because someone present had already recognized Shen Zhifeng as the Divine Infant True Lord, the new leader of the Demon Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>If she said that little girl was a Yin Spirit, how could it be wrong?</p><p></p><p>The fishermen at the scene were extremely excited, never imagining they could witness such a legendary story.</p><p></p><p>The man from earlier had a pained expression, full of regret.</p><p></p><p>If he had known that young girl was a legendary immortal, he would have warned her to leave no matter what, to gain some favor.</p><p></p><p>That was a true immortal! In the land of a hundred countries, even Divine Infants could act tyrannically.</p><p></p><p>If he could latch onto the thigh of a Yin Spirit, he could even defecate on the head of a Divine Infant True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there are no medicines for regret in this world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Zhifeng's face turned cold, and all the scattered cultivators present began breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"What happened today, consider it never occurred. If even half a word is leaked, you will all fall into eternal damnation!"</p><p></p><p>These scattered cultivators turned pale, none daring to object.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen murmured: "These robber cultivators should be cleaned up too."</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng quickly said: "I'll immediately give orders to completely sweep away this group of robber cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>Once again thanks to Zhi Qiu Tao Hua Yuan for the 10,000 reward; thanks to Shou Xie de LiRyi for the reward!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

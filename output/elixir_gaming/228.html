        <h1>Chapter 228</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This plan was clearly inspired by Origin Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Your plan won't work. It's not as meticulous as mine. We should follow my plan," Qi Yuan said again, his gaze fixed on the distant northern lands.</p><p></p><p>Beams of light shot straight into the sky, with countless new gods crowded within them, fleeing the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>This scene moved even the ancient gods present.</p><p></p><p>Lishan Great Sovereign had never imagined he would see such a sight one day.</p><p></p><p>Twilight Great Sovereign's gaze was complex: "It turns out we've become this powerful."</p><p></p><p>So powerful that before the battle had even ended, the remaining enemies were already fleeing in droves.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that we're too strong, it's that the Sovereign is too terrifying!" Pine-Gazing Ancient God spoke up aptly, looking at Qi Yuan with utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also turned to look at Qi Yuan at this point.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Pine-Gazing Ancient God was right.</p><p></p><p>Without Origin Sovereign, they would likely still be muddling along in confusion and fear, worrying about the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Forget about scaring away the evil gods, they wouldn't even be able to counterattack against them.</p><p></p><p>The changes Origin Sovereign had brought to this world were too immense.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, really. I'm just a small Core Formation cultivator. Please don't flatter me, it's embarrassing," Qi Yuan felt he was actually quite shy.</p><p></p><p>These people had all imagined him to be some big shot.</p><p></p><p>He was just a game player, not a big shot. The real big shots were the Three Pure Ones.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods present were speechless at this point.</p><p></p><p>Especially Thunder God Great Sovereign, who wanted to say to Qi Yuan:</p><p></p><p>"Stop being so modest. Bring out that smug attitude you had when you were showing off your Stellar Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>That scene had truly shocked Thunder God Great Sovereign at the time.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan looked at those beams of light, his thoughts complex: "These evil gods fleeing have ruined my plan!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, Qi Yuan's plan had included measures against these evil gods.</p><p></p><p>With the evil gods fleeing, his plan could not be completed.</p><p></p><p>"But it's okay, most of those fleeing are from the evil gods' headquarters and military camps. There are still quite a few evil gods stationed in cities who haven't had time to escape yet," Qi Yuan's eyes held a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"We will take action immediately to sweep through the gods of the northern lands!" Pine-Gazing Ancient God quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Thank you for your hard work. Without even having a feast, you continue to work overtime.</p><p></p><p>I never thought that one day, I would take on the shape of a capitalist."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods quickly accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was brimming with fighting spirit. The previous battle had not been satisfying enough.</p><p></p><p>Having received Qi Yuan's orders, these ancient gods transformed into streaks of light and left to hunt down the evil gods still remaining in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Flower Leaf City.</p><p></p><p>Since the evil god military camp was bombed a few days ago, many evil gods had come to Flower Leaf City to investigate.</p><p></p><p>The once chaotic Flower Leaf City had become tense and uneasy again.</p><p></p><p>In the Red Leaf Tower, Little Xing wore a long yellow dress, her eyes fixed on the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sky now was blue with a tinge of red, looking rather strange.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing's gaze was somewhat dazed, not yet having awakened from the scenes she had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu stood beside Little Xing and patted her shoulder, taking a deep breath: "Was everything we just saw... real?"</p><p></p><p>Little Xing snapped out of it, nodding vigorously. Her expression was both hesitant and excited: "It was real!"</p><p></p><p>Too many things had happened in the span of one day.</p><p></p><p>First the sun fell, then the sea of lightning hung upside down, and the nine stars appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>This level of battle was already beyond the comprehension of Purple Palace cultivators like them.</p><p></p><p>Finally, several terrifying beams of light shot straight into the sky. They were even more confused, not knowing exactly what had happened, but it was definitely something horrifying.</p><p></p><p>After all, the few evil gods investigating in Flower Leaf City, upon seeing the beams of light shooting into the sky, fled in a frenzy, muttering: "Wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf Tower had been rooted in occupied territory for hundreds of years, always passing information to the ancient gods, and vaguely knew what this represented.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods felt somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear voice came from outside the room.</p><p></p><p>"Last time I left too quickly without paying.</p><p></p><p>How about this - I'll treat you all to a feast."</p><p></p><p>Outside the room of the two women, Qi Yuan spoke calmly, his eyes filled with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>The last time he bombed the evil god military camp with Zhu Zhuangshi, they had eaten at Red Leaf Tower without paying, then ran off.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always felt bad about it.</p><p></p><p>Remembering his previous promise to treat everyone in Flower Leaf City to a feast, he simply came.</p><p></p><p>The location of Red Leaf Tower was also once the hometown of No Food Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing and Aunt Liu inside the room heard the familiar voice, their eyes suddenly jumping.</p><p></p><p>"My lord!" The two quickly opened the door and looked at Qi Yuan, their gazes complex.</p><p></p><p>"My lord has slain the evil gods and saved our Flower Leaf City. How could we ask for payment for that bit of tea?" Aunt Liu quickly said.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, feeling somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>After all, in their understanding, Qi Yuan must be a big shot at the level of Great Sovereign or above.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when thunder rumbled densely at the evil god military camp, it was likely related to today's upside-down sea of lightning.</p><p></p><p>How could she not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>"I've come here for another matter as well. This Red Leaf Tower... could you sell it to me?" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>No Food Holy Mother's old home - why not turn it into a memorial hall?</p><p></p><p>After all, she was once the number one person in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu was stunned. She looked at Qi Yuan, not hiding anything: "We are followers of No Food Holy Mother, tasked with collecting information about evil gods here for the ancient gods... If we give Red Leaf Tower to you, my lord, we..."</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu and Red Leaf both hesitated.</p><p></p><p>They still needed to work for the crisis in the Mortal Heart Realm and pass information to the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the information they passed on couldn't change the outcome, but even if it was of the slightest use to the ancient gods, it would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need. From now on, you don't need to do these things anymore. You can go live the life you want to live," Qi Yuan's voice was gentle. "Did you see those beams of light earlier? That was the evil gods racing to flee the Mortal Heart Realm."</p><p></p><p>Little Xing's eyes widened, and Aunt Liu's body also tensed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Is what you say true, my lord?" Little Xing's eyes were brimming with moisture.</p><p></p><p>"Of course," Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile. Suddenly, he flew up into the sky. "Origin Sovereign has arrived. People of Flower Leaf City... there's a feast to eat. Today... let the feast begin!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the southern lands.</p><p></p><p>On Contemplation Mountain, Dong Jianghe's face was full of reverence and awe.</p><p></p><p>"A mythical level contemplation technique... I've finally contemplated it!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I finally don't have to hide my identity as the child of destiny!"</p><p></p><p>"Who says I, Dong Jianghe, am not the young heavenly emperor? A mythical level contemplation technique, just like that!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe was very excited.</p><p></p><p>He felt he could finally redeem himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he had been constantly suppressed by Origin Sovereign, and everyone in the group chat said Origin Sovereign was the true young heavenly emperor, Dong Jianghe was very unwilling to accept this.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had contemplated a mythical level divine contemplation technique, he could finally sweep away the gloom and shit hard on Origin Sovereign's head.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still had a promising future, while Origin Sovereign was already declining with age.</p><p></p><p>He exited Contemplation Mountain and entered the group chat, feeling very smug.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Where is everyone in the group?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, where did you all go?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you going to welcome your Heavenly Emperor Dong?"</p><p></p><p>"Living up to expectations, I, Heavenly Emperor Dong, have contemplated a</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Myth-level God Observation Technique!"</p><p></p><p>He sent these messages in the group chat.</p><p></p><p>However, no one responded to him at all.</p><p></p><p>The group was completely silent, with no one there.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe was a bit confused: "What's going on here? Where is everyone, did they all go to take a dump?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled and also very disappointed. </p><p></p><p>He had just visualized a myth-level God Observation Technique, shouldn't the group be going crazy praising him?</p><p></p><p>Then someone should say, so you're the chosen one! The Divine Cat Elder and Black Dragon Elder who used to look down on him would also face retribution.</p><p></p><p>But now... with no one in the group, he felt that visualizing a myth-level technique also seemed somewhat bland and tasteless.</p><p></p><p>"If they're not here, so be it. If that old guy knew I visualized a myth-level God Observation Technique, he'd definitely be moved to tears, hugging my leg and calling me father!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his master, Dong Jianghe also felt quite excited.</p><p></p><p>That guy had always supported the Myth Project, although he hadn't constantly urged Dong Jianghe to visualize a myth-level technique.</p><p></p><p>But how could he not know his master's thoughts? </p><p></p><p>That old guy had always hoped Dong Jianghe would quickly visualize a myth-level technique, but was afraid of pressuring him, so he never pushed.</p><p></p><p>"No one's here, I might as well go out and show off my myth-level technique, dazzle that old guy's eyes!"</p><p></p><p>But before leaving, he left another message in the group:</p><p></p><p>"The myth-level God Observation Technique is actually super simple."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he left directly.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, Dong Jianghe was dressed in white, a young prodigy with star-like eyebrows and sword-like eyes, exuding an extraordinary aura.</p><p></p><p>But this time when he called for his master, he received no response.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Every time he finished visualizing, his master would wait expectantly for his results.</p><p></p><p>That eager, hopeful gaze had made him feel guilty in the past.</p><p></p><p>This time, he would no longer feel guilty, but proud and elated.</p><p></p><p>But... his master wasn't there! He was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the door and walked out of the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was silent outside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, he frowned, very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to use my trump card!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Master, something terrible has happened, it's extremely urgent!"</p><p></p><p>He called out anxiously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a concerned voice finally came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Jianghe?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Jianghe felt happy: "Master, I have good news for you."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and tell me, I have urgent business to attend to!" His master's voice sounded rushed.</p><p></p><p>The smile in Dong Jianghe's eyes grew even wider.</p><p></p><p>Once he announced his achievement, his master probably wouldn't leave, and wouldn't be in such a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Today on Visualization Mountain, I accidentally visualized a... myth-level God Observation Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe said proudly, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>A myth-level technique was an important part of the Myth Project.</p><p></p><p>His visualization of this level of technique could greatly enhance the combat power of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>This would aid in implementing the Myth Project.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A myth-level technique, not bad, very impressive. </p><p>I have a few bottles of pills in my cave, I'll reward them to you, go get them yourself. I have to go out for something urgent." His master's voice was calm and composed, seemingly without much excitement.</p><p></p><p>This reaction left Dong Jianghe stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand. He had visualized a myth-level technique.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't his master be excited... moved to tears?</p><p></p><p>How could he still go out, still have urgent business?</p><p></p><p>What urgent matter could be more important than him visualizing a myth-level technique?</p><p></p><p>"Master, what urgent business do you have?" Dong Jianghe couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, a great battle broke out in the Northern Lands, it's suspected that three Evil God Marshals have fallen.</p><p>The main army of the Evil God headquarters has completely fled the Mortal Heart Realm!" After his master finished speaking, his form turned into a streak of light, and a voice also transmitted into Dong Jianghe's mind, "I need to go discuss matters with the other Ancient Gods, we'll talk more when I return!"</p><p></p><p>The vast mountains were left with only Dong Jianghe.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit dazed, his mind unable to process it.</p><p></p><p>"I just visualized a god... and the world changed dramatically?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe was truly stunned.</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>The world must be playing a joke on him!</p><p></p><p>And also... what his master said... was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Evil God army was driven away?</p><p></p><p>This was too inconceivable. Even if Dong Jianghe liked to fantasize, even in his dreams he wouldn't dare to dream something so satisfying.</p><p></p><p>His most satisfying dream was visualizing a myth-level technique, being praised by everyone in the group, and then defeating an Evil God Lord.</p><p></p><p>But the result... reality was even more satisfying than his dream.</p><p></p><p>Who was this? Playing a game?</p><p></p><p>If not, then... let him play next?</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, he entered the chat group again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were actually quite a few people online in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe immediately saw the Origin Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"What Dong Jianghe said is correct, visualizing myths is indeed not difficult, it's very simple."</p><p></p><p>The one saying this was none other than the Origin Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Below, those familiar faces were also constantly commenting.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Venerable, the Evil Gods fleeing from the Northern Lands... was that your doing?"</p><p></p><p>"The Thunder Sea Inverted, Nine Stars Soaring in the Sky, were those... all myth-level techniques you visualized?"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Venerable, was it really you..."</p><p></p><p>The group was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>As for the news of Dong Jianghe visualizing a myth-level technique, it was completely buried.</p><p></p><p>No one paid any attention to that message at all.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe felt like spitting blood.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he was also extremely curious inside.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?!"</p><p></p><p>Without seeing it with his own eyes, he felt everything was too unreal, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the messages in the group and also replied.</p><p></p><p>"I always thought the Evil Gods were very powerful, I didn't expect they were nothing special."</p><p></p><p>"The one with the Thunder Sea Inverted was Thunder God Lao Deng. I gave him a slightly powerful visualization technique, and he directly advanced from the fourth step of Sky Treading to the seventh step, single-handedly killing two Evil God Myths."</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Stars Soaring in the Sky, those nine also received nine myth-level techniques, but they were much weaker, with only average power."</p><p></p><p>"The Evil God Marshals are actually not very impressive. I killed two with one sword strike.</p><p>I suspect the Evil Gods are all paper tigers, especially the Marshals.</p><p>Perhaps everyone present could kill an Evil God Marshal with just a sliding tackle."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods present were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Weren't there only eight myth-level techniques in total?</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe even knew that those eight myth-level techniques were all given to eight ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>How did Thunder God Lao Deng also have one?</p><p></p><p>Killing two Evil God Marshals with one sword strike... Origin Celestial Venerable, isn't that too exaggerated! It must all be fake, it must all be fake!</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe couldn't accept such a reality.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Venerable, didn't you only visualize eight myth-level techniques?" Divine Cat Elder asked, trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I... visualized them before." Qi Yuan, sitting in Red Leaf Tower, answered thus.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed visualized them in the past.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 553</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wings were highly technological, yet also dazzlingly colorful and stylish.</p><p></p><p>As the wings opened and closed, Qi Yuan's figure soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Jin Dan Crane's face showed a look of shock: "What kind of divine artifact is this?"</p><p></p><p>He had seen many divine artifacts before. In fact, he was even a master craftsman who had forged numerous divine artifacts. It could be said that in this Cloud Blood City, no one understood divine artifacts better than him.</p><p></p><p>But this strangely shaped wing, it was truly too bizarre!</p><p></p><p>"Divine artifact? This is a flight wing, it's a mecha!" Qi Yuan directly denied.</p><p></p><p>He was in the process of becoming mortal, not slacking off.</p><p></p><p>To deal with this mortal transformation, he had prepared many technological creations along the way.</p><p></p><p>What unmanned drones, what technological wings. The technology provided by Zero One was truly too abundant.</p><p></p><p>Spatial compression technology, nano technology, anti-gravity technology, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in forging these technological creations, he had also used a tiny bit of his abilities as a master craftsman. But it was truly just a tiny bit, and he had even painted them. Just like how officials would buy imported cars, paint them, and then claim they are domestically produced.</p><p></p><p>He painted them, and claimed they were technological creations - was that too much?</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his figure suddenly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>"Watch my supersonic attack!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a loud roar, his speed suddenly increasing to exceed the speed of sound. In the Immortal Realm, this speed would not be considered much, but this was the Divine Wood Universe. This speed was enough to move even Heavenly Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"Ten times the speed of sound!"</p><p></p><p>Powerful fists, a strong physique, and lightning-fast speed. This single punch, relying solely on the force of his body's impact, was enough to kill a Heavenly Realm Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>"The power of Heaven and Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan charging towards him, the Thorn Blood Elder hurriedly unleashed the power of Heaven and Earth. Instantly, the surrounding power of Heaven and Earth converged and condensed into a barrier in front of him, giving him a slight sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The terrifying figure collided, and the Elder's eyes widened in disbelief. The power of Heaven and Earth... actually could not stop him!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his mind was limited, and he could only think of this before his body was shattered into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" </p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Elder is dead?"</p><p></p><p>"You said you weren't a transcendent, yet the power of Heaven and Earth couldn't stop you! You're mocking us, aren't you?" Jin Dan Crane shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that there were Heavenly Realm Armored Soldiers who had mastered the power of Heaven and Earth to the extreme, and could use special techniques to make the power of Heaven and Earth part for them.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the white-haired man in front of them was such a special existence.</p><p></p><p>"Damn you, how dare you falsely accuse me of being a transcendent! I'm not a transcendent at all!" Qi Yuan said while fighting, "I just... have a good relationship with the power of Heaven and Earth, so it doesn't block me."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you crooked and twisted ones, neither human nor beast, neither strange nor ordinary, don't have the troubles that us handsome fellows have. When you've grown more handsome, you'll know... how enthusiastic this world is towards us!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's words fell, his unparalleled speed unleashed another punch.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, another Thorn Blood Elder was slain.</p><p></p><p>"E-everyone... let's unite..." stammered a Thorn Blood Elder.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was getting impatient.</p><p></p><p>"You're still stammering and living in this world, taking up memory space? Let me help the Divine Wood Universe clear some memory!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still had an aggressive attitude, instantly slaying the stammering Thorn Blood Elder.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three Thorn Blood Elders had fallen.</p><p></p><p>Jin Dan Crane, seeing this, was furious: "Who are you? This is the domain of the Enigmatic Deity, offending the Enigmatic Deity will surely lead to your death!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Dan Crane could not understand how someone dared to run amok and indiscriminately kill in Cloud Blood City. This was the territory controlled by the Enigmatic Deity, the domain of the Black Heavens and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were from the Human Awakening Society, coming here, they could only tuck their tails and behave. But this bold and unrestrained behavior was unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although Qi Yuan had white hair, his spirit and vitality seemed very good. The Human Awakening Society would not have placed such a genius in an enemy-occupied area. Wasn't this just sending him to his death? In the Exquisite Gold Realm, there was no way out once you entered!</p><p></p><p>"What Enigmatic Deity? If you don't let me become mortal, you all have to die?" Qi Yuan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Now, his biggest goal was to become mortal. Anything that hindered his mortal transformation was a potential enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Think you can run? Have you asked my wings?" Qi Yuan's speed was extremely fast, killing gods and Buddhas alike.</p><p></p><p>These lofty Heavenly Realm experts were no match for Qi Yuan at all. Annihilation! Completely annihilated! The one-sided battle had no suspense whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>In just a dozen breaths, all the Heavenly Realm experts had been slain. As for Jin Dan Crane, although he fled quickly, he simply couldn't match Qi Yuan's speed without wings.</p><p></p><p>"They're all dead, but... the battle is not over yet." Qi Yuan's gaze turned to the Blood Tiger below, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>That was the true great enemy, the others were just appetizers.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw that person, Qi Yuan's gaze suddenly shrank.</p><p></p><p>How could it be...?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Blood Tiger's appearance was utterly miserable. The aftershock of a battle with a Heavenly Realm expert had struck his body, shattering it and causing his blood to flow. Only a sliver of life remained.</p><p></p><p>That last bit of life was used to send a message through a communication artifact: "Fuck your mother!"</p><p></p><p>After sending this message, the Blood Tiger's pupils had long since dispersed. He was so hateful! Extremely hateful towards that group of scum from the Blood Tiger Gang, actually sending him to deal with such a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he see how those Heavenly Realm Elders were slaughtered like vegetables in his hands? The Blood Tiger's neck twisted in a characteristic manner, his breath exhausted, dying without peace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure descended, his face showing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he sighed, "A true gentleman, he should have realized he was no match for me and taken his own life."</p><p></p><p>As for being hit by the aftershock? That was definitely just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"The enigmatic spirits in this inner city... are quite numerous, it seems I need to help the Exquisite Gold Realm clear some memory!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze turned fierce.</p><p></p><p>All these enigmatic spirits in the inner city were potential criminals hindering his mortal transformation, they all had to be killed.</p><p></p><p>And by slaying these enigmatic spirits, he could also gain a considerable amount of experience points, which was a win-win situation.</p><p></p><p>If he could kill all the enigmatic spirits in this world, the amount of experience points he would gain would probably be massive.</p><p></p><p>With a few more such incidents, he might not even need to undergo the mortal transformation to become an Ancestral God.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Qi Yuan's figure vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter... had only just begun!</p><p></p><p>In an unknown space, the Immortal Elegant Handsome frowned, his expression complex. The elder smiled cheerfully, immortal and celestial: "What's wrong, did this mission fail and greatly disappoint you?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Elegant Handsome shook his head, his mind once again recalling Qi Yuan's words and his various extraordinary performances.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, could it be... that the Divine Wood Universe is hiding... a Realm Lord who has undergone mortal transformation?"</p><p></p><p>The elder before him was the Grand Elder of the Immortal Elegant Clan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Elder, apart from the Ancestor Sun God of the clan, had the strongest power.</p><p></p><p>And his generation was actually older than that of the Ancestor Sun God.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head: "What nonsense are you talking about? How could there be a Domain Lord who has transcended the divine in the Divine Wood Universe?</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Universe... the waters are very deep, and there are even Ancestral Gods that can rival the Second Realm of the Sun God.</p><p></p><p>But the Third Realm of the Sun God, that is absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder said firmly.</p><p></p><p>The Second Realm and Third Realm of the Sun God are a threshold.</p><p></p><p>To become a Third Realm Sun God, one needs to comprehend the Universal Laws and fuse with them.</p><p></p><p>However, the Divine Wood Universe is merely a nascent universe, and a special one at that.</p><p></p><p>The Universal Laws... are somewhat special, seemingly scattered among the Mandate Bearers.</p><p></p><p>This also means that even if one reaches the Second Realm of the Sun God, they cannot step into the Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unless... through special means, all the Mandate Bearers are sacrificed to the Universe.</p><p></p><p>And now, the strongest expert in the Divine Wood Universe is the Mandate Bearer, Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If not for his support, the Divine Wood Universe would have already fallen.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, if Yuan had not gone alone to meet the enemy, carrying a dilapidated semi-finished Bright Treasure, and gone to the Void Sea to confront an enemy dozens of times stronger than the Black Sky and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he made the enemy hesitant, allowing the people to avoid a calamity.</p><p></p><p>Such a pillar, such a backbone, how could the people of the Divine Wood Universe sever it?</p><p></p><p>And even if they did, could they guarantee that someone could reach the Domain Lord realm?</p><p></p><p>Even if there were a few Domain Lord experts, could they withstand the Black Sky and Black Earth?</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shared his thoughts with Xian Ling Yingjun.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun fell silent, then slowly said, "Is it possible that it's from another universe?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Divine Wood Universe does not have the conditions to produce a Domain Lord, but other universes do?</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head: "Even less likely in other universes. Even reaching the Second Realm of the Sun God can venture into other universes, but if one reaches the Third Realm of the Sun God, fusing with the universe, rashly going to other universes, that represents hostility, a collision between universes, and will invite the suppression of the Universal Will!"</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun heard this and fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>It seems his speculation was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"I know you may have seen some amazing geniuses that made you unable to help but fantasize.</p><p></p><p>The universe is so vast, even I have not been able to traverse it all my life, and there are countless peerless talents like fish in a stream, like dreams and bubbles.</p><p></p><p>If they cannot become Sun Gods, cannot become Domain Lords, they are ultimately just passing guests, dust in the universe," the Grand Elder said.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun heard this and nodded, "Thank you, Grand Elder."</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, he asked, "Does the Grand Elder know... the origin of the Black Sky?"</p><p></p><p>The mysterious and terrifying Black Sky, Xian Ling Yingjun had long heard of its great name.</p><p></p><p>However, he never knew the origin of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>In the Void Garden, there was also no information about the true origin of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head, "This old one is weak and of low status, how could I know such secrets?"</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun sighed upon hearing this, "It seems only the Void Domain Lords know the origin of the Black Sky."</p><p></p><p>Becoming the number one on the Void Garden's points ranking can allow one to ask a question to the Void Domain Lords.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun knew that the people of the Divine Wood Universe had once used the power of the entire universe to help a Void Cultivator complete a task and become the number one on the points ranking.</p><p></p><p>That Void Cultivator asked the Void Domain Lord about information regarding the Black Sky on behalf of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>According to the rumors, the Void Domain Lord told that Void Cultivator the origin of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>However, in just a moment, that Void Cultivator forgot the origin of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Quejin Realm, Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Clan's leader's face was pale as he looked at the information in the communication talisman, his heart trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"How could the Blood Tiger Lord, who is usually so gentle, curse me like that?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Clan's leader was in a panic, that one sentence from the Blood Tiger Lord, "I fuck your mother," had really scared him.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." </p><p></p><p>He suddenly had a terrifying thought.</p><p></p><p>"Minister, where is my mother's grave?" the Blood Tiger Clan's leader asked.</p><p></p><p>The minister quickly replied, "In the Purple Dawn Forest!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly go and dig up my mother's remains, bring her bones to me, and I will personally give them to the Blood Tiger Lord!" the Blood Tiger Clan's leader said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The gentle-tempered Blood Tiger Lord would definitely not curse someone like that.</p><p></p><p>So, he must really want to... (have sex with the mother's remains)!</p><p></p><p>"Mother, your son did not let you enjoy life when you were alive, but in death... let you have your fun!" the Blood Tiger Clan's leader thought, comforting himself.</p><p></p><p>This was not unfilial, but a filial act.</p><p></p><p>After all, his mother was also proud to serve the Thorn Blood, a half-human, half-ghost being.</p><p></p><p>Now that the old lady was dead, let her have her moment of glory.</p><p></p><p>But just then, his expression changed slightly: "What deity dares to trespass on my Blood Tiger Clan!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a man shrouded in darkness appeared, emanating a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to take someone... where is Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired cultivator, also known as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving Wu Xiang's message, the dark-clothed man immediately rushed to the Blood Tiger Clan, wanting to rescue Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought there would be a great battle here.</p><p></p><p>He would wait for the right moment to strike and rescue Qi Yuan, then invite Qi Yuan to join the rebel army.</p><p></p><p>But on the way, he suddenly heard a rumbling sound, like an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>The source of the sound was in the inner city, and he was afraid something had happened, so he hesitated for a long time before finally choosing to come here.</p><p></p><p>And so, the current scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Clan's leader looked at the dark-clothed man with a wary expression: "He's not here, he's now in the inner city, probably already captured by the Blood Tiger Lord!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to fight this mysterious man.</p><p></p><p>The dark-clothed man narrowed his eyes, somewhat surprised, but more disappointed: "He went to the inner city?"</p><p></p><p>Since he went to the inner city, he would definitely be unable to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>"What happened in the inner city?" the dark-clothed man tentatively asked the Blood Tiger Clan's leader, not really expecting an answer.</p><p></p><p>"I..." the Blood Tiger Clan's leader had not yet spoken.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his minister's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, boss, a Slaughter Demon has appeared in the inner city!" the minister exclaimed frantically.</p><p></p><p>Just now, his communication talisman had received the news that someone had barged into the inner city, causing a massacre.</p><p></p><p>"Causing a slaughter in the inner city, that's courting death!" the Blood Tiger Clan's leader said loudly, not at all anxious.</p><p></p><p>Although the previous tremor was very alarming,</p><p></p><p>Cloud Blood City had the Thorn Blood guarding it, and the Mysterious Darkness Eye could descend at any time.</p><p></p><p>There was no way a major disaster could occur.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I panicked for no reason, the inner city is as solid as a fortress, how could anything major happen!" the minister said.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still a bit curious why that person had not responded to his message. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was taking a bath?</p><p></p><p>The dark-clothed man's eyes flashed with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Someone is unleashing a massacre in the inner city? What kind of expert is this? He hesitated for a moment, looking towards the direction of the inner city, and finally decided to sneak over and take a look.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if the human warrior dies, there should be an audience to witness it and record this scene, so that he does not die in silence!
